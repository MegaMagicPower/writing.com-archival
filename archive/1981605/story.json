He pushed aside a huge stone slab which was covered in the image a a huge spider wearing all sorts of jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A God\" he thought, \"or a Demon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe descended stone steps into the darkness. The stairs curved around several times and soon all light from the surface was lost. Turning on a super duper long life torch he illuminated the passage which was leveling off. He saw huge stalactites descending from the ceiling. The place must was been abandoned for thousands of years.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the walls were covered in a bizarre writing that seem to made of a simplified spider making various poses. They were completely unlike anything that anyone had ever seen before so he had no chance of reading them. There was also a series of images which he could understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a spider showing some people a bow and arrow. There are then hunting scenes and the hunters returning which huge quantities of game.  They give over half of it to the spider which has tripled in size, to about 12 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next scene shows the spider showing them a needle and thread and using to sow together the hides of the animals. They the people are all shown is far better looking hides they have made a cape for the spider who must be around 50 feet tall by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider shows them how to make boats and nets. The next seen shows the spider driving huge shoals of fish into these nets.  The boats are filled to overflowing with fish. Which as again mostly offered to the spider who has grown to 200 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext the spider shows they how to farm and to make the grain they harvest into bread and beer. A feast is where the spiders portion although larger then everyone else put together is tiny compared to its 500 feet tall size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider shows them how to make bricks and the huge place they construct is dwarfed by 2000ft of spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiders gives them sheep, cows and pigs which they begin to farm. There are several scenes of them driving them towards spider in what looks like a sacrifice much is they followed by scenes of it petting them and then being returned several times bigger and producing much more wool and and milk. A distinct local mountain shown next the foot of the spider (which is bigger then it) shows the spider was now reached 12 miles in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext spider teaches them metalwork. They forge the spider a golden crown which the spider grows to fit its now 100 miles of height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next seen shows some ever so slightly racist images of foreign people coveting the wealth the spider kingdom. They gather a huge army.  The spider picks them up along with several dozen miles of countryside. The spider gives them a literal mountain of of treasure and the army all drop their weapons and worship the spider. The spider now covers up nearby all of south America, the accuracy of the drawing of it is startling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few scenes show the spider traveling the world gifting all the things from before onto new people, being worshiped by the them and swelling yet larger. By the end of these theses the (accurately drawn) earth itself it only as large as one of its smaller eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next scene shows loads of smaller giant spiders appearing and carrying everyone and everything onto the giant spider. Then the giga spider moves though space. Then the spider is shown with a sun orbiting around it. The people living on the spider seem to be having a good time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sense shows thousands of normals sized but clearly divine spiders being shot from a cannon. We see on arrive on earth and some down the steps he just came down. The spider then turns its self to stone, there are several scene that indicate a lot of time passing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next scene shows him, in and can its him as it looks exactly like him right down to brand name on this torch. It is even labeled with his name, in English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that brings you up to date,\" said a voice \"any questions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick turned around and saw watch was clearly smaller version of the spider from the images, it was barely an inch across. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You immediately get the feeling that it is obvious that this spider can talk and you have no doubt that it is good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you learn to speak English, this places has been sealed for thousands of years of nobody could have taught you\" Rick asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I completely analysed the language centre of your brain.  I calibrated it with the thoughts you had whilst you were looking at the murals.  I now know every word that you know, including a lot that you don't know that you know, I could make a fairly go guess at a lot more of them.  I didn't look at any other bits of your brain, that would be rude,\" explained the tiny spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know I was going to come here, that last carving must be thousands of years old?\" Rick asks, just a little bit worried <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't that mural was made only when you came in, but also thousands of years ago.\" the spider explains and Rick is really confused \"This temple is actually a vessel for travelling across space and dimensions.  It can speed up or slow down the passage of time of any space within it.  It can't travel back though, the laws of physics in the this universe are a pain in that way.  It can also shape-shift into almost anything,\" boasts spider as it made some fancy golden idol exude from the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are the murals are prophecy or something that happened before?\" asks Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit of both. The shown here is actually my, well I guess father is close enough. He landed on another version of your planet about 50 000 years ago. You've already seen what he did. Me and all my, lets say brothers, were blasted into space and across several nearby dimensions.  I was supposed to do the same sort of thing that my father had done, but better from having learned from him but there was a bit of a delay,\" admits the spider with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that happens, why isn't the whole galaxy orbiting around you already?\" Ricks asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing is that I, and my vessel get all of our powers from the positive thoughts of sapient beings.  I should be had enough power to find one of them,\" confesses the spider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you landed on the wrong continent tens of thousands of years before humans got there.  You mustn't have had enough power to cross the ocean and even known if there was anyone on the other side, so you've been suck here,\" rick postulates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. I had so little power left I couldn't even stop myself from getting buried.  There was some sort of event year before you started digging, it released all sorts of positive thoughts, whilst they weren't about me and so weren't nearly as effective they gave me enough power to make this temple. I thought that if I made something interesting enough somebody smart would come and look at them and wake me up properly. Looks like it worked,\" expositioned the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess the plan now is, well this this\" you say pointing to the mural. \"You going to have to go it differently because me already know all of that stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's always the plan with my people. Finds sapience, help them to advance, grow to cosmic sizes create spawn and repeat.  We'll keep at it until every lifeform on every planet in every galaxy in every universe and all of everything has a spider god to look after them,\" proclaimed the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From anyone else that would be terrifying but I have the feeling that the planet could use a giant spider to help out. Pity you weren't there from the beginning or a lot of trouble could have been avoided. You've got 50 000 so years of lost time to make up for, how do we start?\" asks Rick with great conviction. </span></div></div>",

You have to make all the steps, it you don't it would be treating you like pets,\" explaines the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like my university is a good place for you to start teaching all the stuff. Lots of people are really scared of spiders so I'll put off going public about you until we've out some things to show that your a good guy. I'll bring you there in my toolbox,\" rick says as the spider hides in the toolbox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick then walks out the temple. The murals have changed to encouraging scene of the giant spider filled future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs rick crosses the treshold the spider says something \"I should bring my ship with me, it can do almost anything now its charged up.  It should come in handly.\" The ship they folds itself up into a backpack that the spider wears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then make your way to the university. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to speak to my supervisor first,\" says Rick \"he's expecting me to give my first impressions of what I found, tell him if it will need a full experdition etc. etc.  He's always be interested in the idea of Alien cultures, that's part of what got him interested in archaeology.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick knocked on Professor Lawerence Pennyweather door and was invited in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So rick, find anything interesting down there,\" asks Lawerence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be easier if I show you,\" Rick opens the toolbox and the spider comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" says the spider waving at the human. As this happens it has slowly began to grow. It has now past 3 inches across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor spends the next few minutes checking it is really a talking spider. He even talks to it a bit without rick in the room. He is convinced. By the end of that the spider is a whole foot across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How as you growing so fast\" asks the Professor <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I draw my power from the seperate universe that ever sapient being creates by the mere processes of thought.  Every time someone thinks well of me it strengths a connection between us letting me grow stuff a little bit bigger,\" technobabbles the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are there other ways to draw resources from this thought universes, or to but things in them\" enquires the professor having already thought of dozens of uses for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it will require 7 addtional paradigm shifts in your interpretation of physics before you will be able to even design the technology to do it,\" agrees the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then talk until late about what the spider is, where it came from, and what it will be able to do. The spider is then told about some places it can help. The spider has slowly and steadily grew though the whole process and it now 4 feet across. The professor is now also convinced the spider must grow much much bigger as fast they can without inducing panic before the spider is big enough to fix it, they decided to introduce the spider to more people.  </span></div></div>",

They never bring round their dozens of fat brothers, or come back after eating a whole jar of Jam or anything. I'd rather just eat now,\" remembered the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so magic I don't even have to moves to do my spells, you already have the power and already know how to use, because its magic.  Try it out,\" said the far to eager fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing the spider did was grow himself. His 1/4 of an inches size quickly swelled to a whole inches then 6 inches then a foot. His web then started to give out so he jumped to the ground. He grew as fast as he fell so he was continuously eye level with the tiny fly. By the time he hit the ground he was as tall as the tops of the trees where his web was. He thought about growing so big the whole forest was a speck to him but he decided to test out his control over the size of other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this growing had made him hungry. The fly was right their so he might as well. It was a bit small but he could fix that. With a single thought the fly swelled as large as a mouse, then a rat then a cat. The web grew with it so it stayed stuck fast. I soon reached the size of a sheep and then a cow. When it was as big as a larger car the spider stopped its grow and leaned back to bite it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Spider was knocked back by a wall of growing fly. It was already 2 as tall as the trees and still growing. The web hadn't grow with it this time and had snapped. The fly stood up, it belly was 3 times as high as the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the power of size too, I thought that would be obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fly continued to grow the forest became a carpet to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another thing, everything that you destroy or eat or cover in spider drool or whatever will quickly return to normal. Have fun now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe the underside of the fly began to be obscured by clouds. It then really spend up it growth, casting everything as far as the fly could see into shadow. It then disappeared, the spider didn't know why but would later learn it was because it was so huge that the light that bounced off it didn't have time to reach the ground. The spider did suspect that growing bigger would allow it to find it, but would the spider do that?</span></div></div>",

Even a single hair on the fly looms over the spider like a skycraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider will not stand for that and surges itself 10 times bigger and then 10 times bigger again. It soon passes a whole light year in size. It surges up in size again to ten light years across, whole solar systems are lost in its spider fluff. This is still not big enough, not even close. Ten light years becomes a hundred and then thousand. It spans an entire arm of the milky way as it reaches 10 000 light years. Then in covers the whole galaxy as it reaches a hundred thousand lightyears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the spider finds itself on a vast red plain which stretches off into infinity. Trying to outgrow whatever this is the spider continues to grow, a million light years, ten, a hundred, one billion lightyears across. Whole superclustures are small clouds to it now. Yet the red plain stretches on. It grows again and then again, the spider has outgrown the whole observable universe and yet still no change. All the detail of the universe are lost and only an expanse of baise remains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider continues to grow its surges ten times bigger evey second, but everything remains the same. Being very subborn and just a bit dumb the spider keeps this up for an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting boring, we've been to big to see anything for a hour, can be stop now,\" asks the fly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stop your the only thing big enough for me to eat now\" said the spider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can grow everything else remember?\" reminded the fly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this growing has made me hungry, I'll grow everything to my size so I can find some food?\" said the spider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now your thinking with size, infinite growth off get dull pretty fast\" noted the fly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything shifted and the spider was back on earth.

They had nowhere to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, we have to use the jump drive. If we stay hear we will definitely die,\" said Arron to his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were gather in a coal cellar. It was completely dark. There dare not have any light. They had got used to it over the last few weeks. Arron had transcribed all this most important research books into braille so he could still continue this project. Between enough supplies to keep them alive for 3 year and the project there was barely for the five of them to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hiders were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron, 73 years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wife, Shelia. The two were just about the only people smart enough for each other. There marriage proposal was when they both swapped mathematical papers in favour of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had two children, Frang a boy of 6 and Sus and Ten year old girl. They were also geniuses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMutt a pygmy Woolly mammoth they been training rescue people lost in blizzards until the army made the project about using it cause avalanches for military purposes. As far as they knew it died in an anti GMO attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So were finally leaving earth, about time\" said Frang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far along is fixing the steering problem,\" asked Sus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Progress, we'll be jumping blind,\" admitted Arron<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's no way of ever going back,\" deduced Sus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" confirmed Arron<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this planet sucked anyway,\" commented Frang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and the next one will definitely be better,\" hoped Sus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where we end up were the best people to learn about it\" said Shelia <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMutt tapped out a message in Morse code with his trunk \"Happy if with friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArron then readied the device. It was combination of submarine, escape Pod and nuclear bunker. They were very few things it could not project the passengers from. The jump device was actually very small and simple (for them anyway). What it did was warp them to random other spot in the universe which had the same gravitational potential energy. This it didn't have to climb out the earths gravity well it actually required very very little energy to do a jump. The same amount of mass from wherever they were jumping too would take the place of <i>springer</i>.  This mass was usually the atmosphere of a planet. This required the smallest of energy to severe any non gravitational ties it had to where it was from. Fluids of various shorts were quite common as was dust. There was even a few example of alien life that was swapped in. Anything that would require cutting or breaking off something was very rare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey climbed in, they sealed off everything. As the noise of their hunters got one door closer Arron pressed the button and they jumped. </span></div></div>",

Radiation far less then earth. Magnetic field a bit more powerful but not nearly enough to be a problem. Air pressure is about the same. We'll be able to survive here for at least a bit, but we may have to jump again,\" analysed Arron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go show us what it is like outside\" begged Sus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe View screen was brought on. There were white strands everywhere, they stopped them from being able to see beyond them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The look like cobwebs, but whatever made them is way bigger then any earth spider, look how thick the strands are,\" observed Frang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strands then started to disappear and the pod began to lower to the ground. Looking all around they could now see beyond the cobwebs. Before they could look around the room they saw its owner. A 20 foot tall bright green spider. Its was covered in looks of spider fluff. It was eating up the cobwebs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gently reached the floor as the last the cobwebs were eaten. The spider using the hairs on its Palps unsocketed it fangs and put them on a table. It then walked up the pod. It felt all over the pod with it many hairs. There found a data access port and plugged into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It reading our computers, it skipping over most of them. It found the dictionaries, it going through them completely,\" revealed Shelia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider then produced some silk it made some sort of elaborate box and attached it to its left front leg. The box vibrated slightly as it talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there humans, I am the watcher of sector 739253, which includes your galaxy and several thousand others. When your did your pan universal jump my web was designed to catch you. It also caught a look of your prototype jumpers,\" greeted the watcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Arron\" greeted Arron<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Shelia\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Frang\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and I'm Sus\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMutt then did a small trumpet sound which he did when he met someone for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come out now I've sent all the house beasts to sleep,\" encouraged the watcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pod opened up and they climbed out. Frang was carrying a flag with and tried to stick it in the floor. The very soft carpet like thing wouldn't hold it and the flag fell down. The watched decider to use come silk to hold it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what you look like,\" observed the watcher \"I you want or need anything just asked, I'm part of a ridiculously advanced civilisations that can make anything is pretty much unlimited amounts. I will have to check with by meta watcher before I make anything alive and aware though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all had a small meal. The humans had selection of cheese and crackers. Mutt had a type of purple grass native to this planet they founds was safe for him to eat. The watcher had a lazy susan covered with small (for it) bowl filled with various sorts of goo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst they ate they talked about now they had all got where they are now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started with...</span></div></div>",

After a nearly 3 million years of blobs complex life got started a rapidly diversified. The colonisation of land was first down by various types of Arthropod like beings. The continent spanning forests of our worlds raised oxygen to the 40% it is now. Unlike on your planet it stayed that high. This allowed us to grow to my sort of sizes. This oxygen also helped us be faster and stronger and more evolutionarily fit in nearly everyway. None arthropods never has a chance to climb the food chain. Once spiders can silk they adapted to fill nearly all the niches. By ancestors where an omnivorous lineage. We focused on meat, fruit, nuts, fish and other nutritionally dense foods. As our guts shortened are brains were free to grow, and they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then from complex social systems and every more complex hunting strategies. This pushed our brains sizes ever higher, Without having to worry about childbirth and having braincases to hold them in our brains grew much bigger, so big my other organs were pushed into my legs. We soon developed farming and civilisation and, as it the pattern nearly all the time, war. Our society got quite close to wiping itself out when a meteor filled with fungal spore beings entered our planet. Our whole society then focused on looking after them as they grew up and then getting them home. Without wasting effort on war technology advanced quickly and we got to interstellar space flight in just a couple of centuries and got them all home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen being from all over came to us for help. We tried to help as many as we could, but the universe was too big and we were too small. So we researched new technology, we needed to be stronger, faster, bigger. It worked and we found the source of the potential energy from which the universe and many many other were created. We now had infinite power. We grew and grew and grew until we filled all the universe, each of us was tens of millions of light years across. We held all the galaxies and kept them safe and happy, it was a golden age that lasted for millions of years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut 225 million years ago their was problem. We disagreed on whether it was right to ascend beings to sapience. We could not which an agreement, and our species was spilt. Then one of us hated for just moment, but them your tens of millions of light years across a moment is far too much, a tiny part of that hatred leaked out but it was enough to drown the souls of billions of worlds, which erupted into mass extinction causing hatred and violence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Us, including myself amongst them were wracked with heart crushing guilt. Nearly all of our species suicided, many nebulas you see our the remains of that. I was nearly joined them but I wouldn't let myself get off that easy. Those who decided to live retreated to our homeworld, to keep out of the affairs of the universe less we slip again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really really dumb\" said Frang \"if you make a mistake you fix it as best your can and max sure it doesn't happen again, you just ran away\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your probably right,\" said the watcher \"more and more of us are pushing to end the isolation. We have been watching the universe, recording every crime and disaster, all the thing we could of, should over perhaps, stopped. We manage to get permission to help those that are completely and irreversibly cut off from their own civilisations, that way our effects on the universe are minimised. People in this movement was been watching for those that take the undirected dimensional jump your just did and rescued them, and quite possibly the planet they would end up on too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of that movement will want to meet your eventually. It had wait as long as you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is their anything you want first\" asked the watch. \"You can go anywhere on this planet or it three moons\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were out onto a field of purple grass. They looked to the sky and saw several suns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This planet is very very big. It has a radius of 7 light years. The 3 moons are 3 have radius' of 2 and half light years. We've been collecting lost souls from about the universe for 225 million years. Most of their descendants live here too so we grew the planet to make room for them all,\" explained the watcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once the kids are tired I would like you to try to explain how that is possible,\" asked Aaron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said the watcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how big are the suns,\" asked sus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There the same as suns in the rest of the universe that one is about a million miles across,\" answered the watcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all these suns about how do you have nights. Do you even have nights,\" asked Shelia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I use my other bodies to block out the light of the suns, I'll just show you,\" said the watcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that another copy of the watch just appeared, no smoke or sound or anything it was just there now. It suddenly grew to several miles tall, blocking all the suns making it night. The body then became slightly transparent letting red light through so the sun looked like a sunrise. It then faded to nothing and it was day again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still make yourself hug\" exclaimed Frang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I just as powerful as I was during the golden age. Probably millions of times more. I can't use it all without causing arguments which could break the universe,\" informed the watcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how big can you get?\" asked Frang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I reached twenty lightyears tall I start getting polite messages. I stop growing then, I do not want impolite messages. If we became comfortable with using all our power then I could hit a billion light years easy, universe sized would be pretty likely, maybe there would be no limit at all,\" theorized the watcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do It!! Do it!! Do it!!! Grow a big as you can,\" demanded Frang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider started by growing to 50 feet tall. They could then all site on its head, which they did. The spider then started to grow massively. The acceleration of this would have crushed them to pasted but the laws of physics changed themselves so that wouldn't happen. the watcher thanked the law of the physics for their good work. 500 feet and then a mile were quickly reached. The spider then grew so big it could cover several mountains with a single foot. Those mountains then shrank to nothingness. I grew so big there was nothing to compare it to. The spider had made is self transparent so they could see through. It then grew right passed the nearest sun. Before leaving it far below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then saw a boundary around the area then started in. A perfect square. Beyond it things were very different indeed. One was a pink ocean. Another was a section of the surface of a sun. One was filled with a dense cubic lattice and one was a big spider then waved at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they grew more and more of the sectors appeared. They came in all sorts of different colours and materials. Like all the planets in the universe had been flattened and made into a jigsaw. They eached had their own sun. As they grew the sectors looked smaller and smaller until they blended into each other into a sort of greyish blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider continued to grow covering a quarter of the plenty then half then the whole thing. Then it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each of those squares you saw had the enivronment of a different kind of planet. Wherever in the universe your from you'll have somewhere like home somewhere there,\" showed off the watcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anything you want to see, if you can imagine it it probably down there somewhere. Or I could take you to a sector at random. No matter where you go your be safe, it is literally impossible for you to be hurt here. You could go to a sector stuck is endless supernova all you'll be fine.\" suggested the watcher. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every day they walked past mile after miles on desiccated landscape, their was no game left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that the next ritual finally puts us back in the favour of the goddess. Else-wise the next ritual you do will probably be a funeral,\" confided the chief of the tribe who had become almost skeletonized with hunger, as he insisted upon always having the smallest share. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should work it is the most potent ritual I know. We haven't needed it since the great cold ten generations ago. Every family leader has given greatly for his.\" He said as they both showed they were missing the ring fingers on their left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight fell and the ritual began. After some somewhat subdued ritual dances the shaman begins. \"Great goddess of the earth, who grants us all things and for which we are always most grateful hear us please. Whatever wrong we did we are most sorry. Please return to us the botony that you used to give. As you gave us your lives we now return some of it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman then revealed what he had been working on with a flourish. It was spider with the eight legs made of the fingers giving my the leaders of each of the families whilst the rest of it was also made of things extracted from their own bodies. The shaman then kept all their attentions focused on it as with secret shaman powers he transferred just a bit of each of their life force to the spider figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jerky motion the the spider began to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go symbol of our devolution find the goddess and tell her of our faith,\" entreated the shaman as the spider figure then went off into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic of the sky spider city of Gor looked down upon the surface world miles below. It was touch times down there. Most especially he was moved by the plight of the humans. Unlike most of his society he did not believe that they were mere beasts. He had been watching them from above for many years. He had grown to know them and to care for them. He wanted to help them but he would need the help of other to do so. So he need the help of thoses to do so. The movement of the tribe far below, far later then usual had got his attention. Descending in secret he watched the ritual. He saw the spider figure was made and then how then animated it, something even they had only figured out recently. That was what he needed to make this point. Swinging from the sky city he quickly caught the thing and then gently wrapped it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought it before the council of weavers who were as usual feasting mixed selection of the finest bugs, and even a couple of birds too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those the weave our fate I have the proof you asked for.\" He showed them the item. \"This clearly shows that the the humans have original thoughts of their own and are not driven wholly by instinct.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes this is interesting, if it is truly made by them they warrant further studies,\" spoke the most senior and thus fattest member of the group. \"However how do we whole they made it, you you not have made it to advance your pet project.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now look what it is made of, all the bit of it could only have been got by hurting humans, something you know I would never do and could not do safety even if i did,\" Cragic Argued <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe council discussed amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have agreed that 5 journeymen between the 7th and 12th maltings shall be assigned to you. You may begin training them he 4 days time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not believe the humans will be around long enough for me to train them to study them. They must be moved to a new area before they starve, if we do not he shall those our own chance to study them and will have let a community die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There continued existence may well be of some value to us. He move one of their groups and one alone, you this their can be on change. Know this also if there damage our city it shall me your brood which will pay the blood price.\" the most senior weave proclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, those that weave our fates. I shall return to tall you want I need.\" says Cragic as he scuttles away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic decided to introduce himself to the humans before the lift. Obviously the group he chose in the one that made the spider. He decides to take to the shaman as he both the smartest and most peaceful of the group. He approaches at night were the shaman, who is unable to hunt or gather as he prone to fits of revelation had the energy to stay up later and was blessing there new campsite. Cragic descends on a silken thread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trug, hello\" says Cragic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman looks up and sees Cragic. The mostly full moon shines though his largely see through body giving him a slightly angelic appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings spirit of the goddess, how may I serve you\" say Cragic who having seen far stranger things in his visions is completely nonplussed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your cries were heard, my people will aid you. I will visit your people at noon tomorrow.\" says Cragic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall I do to prepare us, spirit.\" ask Trug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have everyone gathered and ensue they are not afraid, Also give this to those that need it. I will send more soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Cragic drops a packaged wrapped in spider silk. With in are the the bodies of several birds which they often ate back when they ate things and several hundred locusts. In all there would be enough to feed the group for 3 days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic ascends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Trug awakens he is surprised to find the package he received in what he decided was a dream was real. The bounty is quickly shared amongst the tribe, with those nearest death getting double portions. The chief again has only a small amount, although his hunger was great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrug explains where food came from and soon many of the tribe as giving thanks to their new spider guardian. Cragic who is watching from far far above feels a surge of satisfaction at what he was done. He also noticed that the many treads that make up the city yield ever so slightly more when he walks over them. Seeing the starvation below much have made him eat more he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoon comes. By then everyone is excited about meeting their new spider guardian. He descends right into the middle of the village. He hovers a few feet above it. He measure 4 feet across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello humans\" greets Cragic \"I am Cragic, I come from the city of Gor, its straight up there.\" He said pointing with a back leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We welcome Cragic and our most thankful for your gift,\" says the chief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't, I should have acted a whole lot sooner\" say Cragic Regretfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, spirit, your judgement is surely beyond doubt\" said Trug <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should clear this up before there are problems, I am not spirit I'm made of of flesh like you it just that's it in the different shape and I have by bones on the outside whilst you have yours on the inside. I'll show you.\" explained Cragic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cragic lowers himself all the way to the ground and then walks across it. They all quickly notice that he leaves footprints. He moves up to Trug and offer him a pedipalps which he him and pretty much arms and end he 3 small finger like things. They shake hands. Cragic they moves on the rest on the group. After this they are far your comfortable speaking with him, not thinking him semi divine any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic has many questions for the humans, as many of things he saw them do didn't make much sense at all.  The humans have even more questions for Cragic as they know nothing of him, this species, his home or even why he turned up. They walk into the evening when Cragic decides to return to Gor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would continue to meet for several more weeks whilst the lift is planned and prepared.

Studying the colour and shape of the smoke she quickly deduced it was cooking fire. What had they found? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneaked close and saw what was up. The first thing she noticed was the smell, it was delicious, it was the first real food she'd smelled in months for living off boiled shoes and dried tubers. Looking closer she saw the food was like nothing she had seen before, where was it from. She listened in. They didn't speak exactly the same language but she got most of it.  Apparently their friend from the sky would come down again at noon. What was his thing, A god, a monster, a demon? Whatever it was they would be ready to catch it. It was time to get everyone together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing skills of all the ancestors they secretly surrounded the new camp and waited for whatever will come down at noon. Then at exactly noon it descended. It was a spider, a really huge one, about 7 feet tall and large enough to carry 3 stout men.  Did they give blood sacrifice to this beast? Seeming just floating in the air few package came down after the spider. They were wrapped in spider silk. They opened them, most of them contained food, the rest contained strange artefacts made of spider silk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tuc, this explains how we all got up there.  Remember start at the middle and spiral outwards,\" said the spider showing off a stunning tapestry of spider silk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited at bit longer until everyone started to eat. They they stuck. Wanting to talk control as quickly as possible they went in groups of two and grabbed a child each. They held weapons against them. Tribe could she the hunger madness in their eyes, they knew they would do, because they would have done the same for their families. The mend of the tribe drew their bows, it was an impasse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chiefdom of the attacking tribe made his demand \"Spider, you will provide our tribe with food. The longer you delay the more hostages we will have to kill. I do not want  to this but I must be clear, I will do anything to keep my people feed, anything, if it means the destruction of my soul then so be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic used his dragline to send a message to Gor, he made it quite clear that unless they send down food, any food then people would start killing each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got the message back \"The agreement was to feed one community.  This will not be exceeded, he do not need to study at second one. Continue the project with whatever group survives, if half of both survives they combine the groups, if they all die find a new group. No new food will be sent, if you take any with permission the project will be terminated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic wanted to reply in anger but he knew the project was approve by a very thin margin, if he makes any enemies they might cancel the whole thing then they would all die. Cragic new he wouldn't be able to get enough food by hunting for it himself down here, he new the skills of these people, they wouldn't have missed any prey. In fact the whole large animal left was himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait that was it, there must now be more then a Ton of meat in this body now after all the growing he'd started doing since he meet the humans. He could spare a leg or two, they would grow back, they humans can't grow back from being dead. Before anyone could even react he grabbed an obsidian axe and cleaved off his third left leg. He then tossed it at the feet of the attacking chief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should feed 50 people for 2 days\" said Cragic \"you no need another?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis that the chieftain ordered this tribe to stand down. Anyone who would chop off one of their own legs is now someone you do not want to make angry. Anyway the leg was huge, and he now truly respected the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe home tribe were also deeply touched by the spider sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the spider felt his body tingling. In a single surge it doubled it height, it was now 15 feet tall.  He could comfortably walk over most the huts in the village. The spider then understood that they more he protected people the bigger he would get, which was convenient. His leg stump then began to itch, the leg then grew back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe home chieftain broke the silence.  \"Lets cook that for you, we've learnt a few new techniques to prepare giant bugs so the goodness doesn't leak out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that everyone started talking again, the two tribes, which had a long history of friendship and several marriages between them quickly mingled together. The visitors got to eat first as they were much much hungrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic was busy calculating how often he would have to lose a leg to keep both groups feed when he started to get a lot of messages down his dragline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you will give one of your legs then I'll give too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't just watch anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These humans are people, they shouldn't starve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly more packages descended. First a few then dozens, then hundreds. They opened them, there was plenty of food, more then enough exactly.  Too much for the tribe to prepare. A Trug the shamans suggestions the extra ones were pulled back up and given to other starving tribes in the region. For each tribe at least one spider came down to check on things.  They all started to grow too. However Cragic who had inspired them got just as much growth as they did and so pulled further and further ahead. By the time even fell Cragic had continued to grow until he was 70 feet tall, he loomed over the complete populations of the two tribes, the non warriors have been brought over too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA first Cragic was worried his great (and only getting greater) size might hurt those he decided to care for.  However after he stepped right on a crow (it had been attracted by the food) and it was completely unhurt despite having dozens of tons on it, he suspected the force that led him to grow had thought of such things. A few other experiments first on animals and then on humans confirmed it was physically impossible for him to crush people, or to drop them or hurt them in any other way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic began to lead to way to more fertile land. As he grew larger each day he carried more and more people.  After he reached 200ft tall it was decided he should just carry everybody, they could move much quicker that way. They then set up the village on his back. </span></div></div>",

The open option was to just keep going to they got out of the area effected by the famine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey covered a hundred miles in the first day the village was on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found nothing green, except one piece of malachite jewellery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey next day they covered 105 miles and still founded naught but barren land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n110 miles was uncovered the next day, to no result but finding more mouths that needed feeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole week went by, every day brought more hungry mouth and they found less and less to feed them with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the report Cragic had sent and unleased a wave of popular sympathy in the city of gor. Many thousands of food packets when sent down every day. The largest amount were sent to Cragic but all the other less spider guardians got a lot of packages too. Tens of thousands were saved from starvation. As the one that had inspired this every package made Cragic grow slightly bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the week Cragic was a thousand feet tall and had 20 000 people lived on him. This started to cause problems as there social structure just wasn't built to handle having these many people together. Crime became more common as people came into contract with people they had no ties to at all, there languages started to diverge enough that it became hard to understand some people, theological different were enough to cause several massive arguments. If Cragic intervened it often made things worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Cragic gathered one person from each tribe and told them to sort it. What ever they did worked as after that there was a lot less fighting and lot more meetings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic kept going east. Other spider guardians assuming he had some sort of plan followed him carrying there villages on their backs too. Cragic knew that the sympathy of people of gor would run out eventually and even this mystical growing guardian power kept up and kept growing he didn't want their whole society to be completely dependent on him forever, he was sure that wouldn't be psychologically damaging. He needed to find a space were they could grow, gather or catch their own food. Cragic but all his hope on the ocean, surely that would still have bounty to give?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 days that they reached the ocean. Now 2000 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scanned the sky, he knew birds would gather above any concentrations of fish. He looked and looked and saw no flocks of birds. What seaweed their was long dried out and dead, completely inedible and they really tried to make it so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a last ditch attempt he sent samples of seawater up to Gor. They analysed them and found only a very planktons per galleon. Thousandth of what a health ocean would have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic then began to cry. If even the ocean was dying then all the land would be just as bad if not worse. They was nowhere that he could take them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for several days.  Other spiders took over sharing out the food and slowly began to catch up with Cragic in size. The tallest reach 500feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Trug the shaman decided to talk to cragic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so sad, did we do anything wrong\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't you ever think that, its just that the ocean is near dead too, that means everything is dead. There is no fertile land I can carry you to. I'm so sorry,\" explained Cragic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So We'll all just have to live on you until you get bigger and strong enough to fix the whole planet,\" asked Trug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I'll be able to fix the whole planet,\" asked Cragic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or course, you do grow bigger and stronger every day after all. Your also really smart and nobody can doubt the will power of someone you will tear of one of their one legs, and your not even a millipede. Anyway if you keep growing like this your eventually become a planet then we can ALL live on you instead,\" comforted Trug <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to live on a planet sized me,\" ask cragic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" reassured Trug<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic then got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm going to fix this planet I have to figure out who it got all broken. Hey fellow Gorians,\" he called out of the other giant spiders that had gathered around \"I need all the data on this planet you can get. I need geology, zoology, oceanology, climatology, astronomy, astrology, sociology, hydrology and every ology you can think of.  Something happened to this planet and I want to know what,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe project took a long time and they found out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were no major disease outbreaks. No new species had appeared and the populations of the surviving ones were about what would be expected. Clutching at straw they started to look at all the ancient records they could to look for some forgotten event that didn't seem important then but would have messed things up now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were looking at some old art when Trug noticed something \"Why is the sun yellow in the is picture, that's not right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in the sky the sun glowed green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic then looked at other art from the same period. Every single day time picture had the sun being yellow. It was red in the evening. Even childrens books had the sun as yellow. This clearly wasn't some random fad, the sun used to be yellow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Cragic gather a timeline of sun pictures from the most realistic artists, actual photos came in at the end. The pattern was clear the sun was steadily get more and more green. This had happened over a couple of millenia so very people noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpectral analysis showed that now most of the suns light was green. This was the same colour as the all the leaves etc. on plants. Plants were bouncing pack most of the light they needed to make the sugars. These sugars were the basis of every food chain on the planet. Even the darkest places were powered by plants indirectly. But then suddenly the rules changes and evolvotion wasn't fast enough to keep up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you running out of food up there, wouldn't want any of you to go hungry too,\" asked Trug concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother spider guardian revealed that food production had been dramatically stepped up after popular demand the forced the government to buy food in bulk to feed the humans down below. There were now ten's of millions of humans being supported and protected by thousands of ever growing spider guardians. Every single one of them was giving Cragic evermore size and power. The base of theire food chain was chemosynthetic bacteria using various compounded only food in the upper atomosphere. Ulimately solar powered too but the green sun just gave the system more energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic knew this wouldn't last for ever. Even now some of the some conservation fractions were complaining of the cost in the fringes of debate, they would get louder when tax day came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pondered what to do whilst looking down from his height of <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(no choice chapters after this please)</span></div></div>",

Fortunately be discovered he didn't need to breath anymore, which is good more everybody as he worked out the carbon dioxide from his exhales would cause enough global warming to roast the planet in just a few days. If he ever meet who or whatever gave him this mysterious growth power he would be sure to compliment their thoroughness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt weird at first to feel the earth curve beneath his 300 mile long span but he had got used to it by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now tens of millions of people lived upon him. They had learnt how to mine and drill down to his blood and muscles, which they mined and pumped out as their main source of food.  Whilst nutritionally adequate this new diet lacked in favour and variety, but everybody was just too grateful to complain. He simply willed these relatively harmless wounds to stay open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now had almost total control over his body at a microscopic scale relative to his size although in alsolute terms he could manipulate anything smaller then he could before he started growing. For example he could control his blood to move people around his body or even to the surface. Also his own giant white blood cells, which looked like a smaller blobbier version of himself were helping people out and letting him talk to people on a more personal level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did some projections. The situation for those living on and in him was stable. Nowhere near ideal but stable. They would be safe for generation to come no matter what happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever happened to the sun isn't urgent for them. Even if he turned the sun yellow again today it would take year for the ecosystems to even get started again, even with all of his powers and all of Gor helping out. Any humans, heck any animal but tardigrades, would be long starved to death by then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe resolved to make himself an arc. He would far out do any Noah. He would take EVERY human, EVERY animal. He'll gather all the seeds and tubers that have any chance of growing again. He'll need large and regular samples of the micro-organisms too. He also resolved to collect a lot of the homes and artefacts of the humans and all the books, art, writing, tablets etc. etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started right here. He dispatched his white blood cells to look for anything or anyone that could be saved. He found that he could already control BILLIONs of them at once, and this number was constantly going up as he grew and grew. He also learnt that he could fuse a few or a few million of them together to make bigger version and could travel further and faster and carry more and bigger things, his dramatically increased their range and speed. They started out by merely searching everywhere within a thousand miles of his centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to find things quietly. Ruins were the first things found, whole farmhouses were picked up, carried up the chain to ever bigger blob spiders and then put inside of Cragic. Roads were also found, 100 feet stretches of them were collected. Soon deeply hidden and hungry animals were found, he feed them immediate by transmuting the cells that found them into something they could eat. Many of the animals were so weak the cells had to inject themselves into them to do it. Many of the animals were sick or injured, all the microbes that caused those diseases were removed unharmed and given a place in Cragic to live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese many acts of protection cause Cragic to grow every higher. 100 mile was soon left behind, then 150 and even 200 miles of spider goodness. Cragic knew there was plenty more where that came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew large he could control number of white blood cells that multiplied by 8 with each doubling in size. As there were more of they could range further, search faster and deeper and fused to larger beings. This all amped up Cragics growth rate still further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt more then a thousand miles out he started to find humans that had been missed, or were hiding. They didn't know they ever growing spider was their friend, they did now. The further out the blobby rescuers got the more people they found, some in quite large groups. All hungry and many only hours from yet another death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the survivors of a whole continent now under his protections Cragic's height rushes passed a thousand miles. He can now control trillions of blob spider guardians at once easily. They evacuate the whole earth in meer hours. his charges find plenty of space within him and upon him. He grows over all the earth until he finally grows right off it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe floats before the earth seeing it very slowly shrink before him. It has now been utterly picked clear of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic makes a promise to the earth</span></div></div>",

Some of them are Yellow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut can he get to them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tries. He soon figures out how to \"Swim\" through space. Of courses its completely different then that involving controlling his own gravity field ruthless bending the laws of physics. Since there's nothing to slow him down as along as he keeps swimming in will constantly accelerate, at least until the speed of light gets close and things get even move complicated. Also it would take him just has many strokes to slow down again. And of course all the stars are moving too so there be lots of maths to do to get there, good thing he was a genius even before he started to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving the earth will be easily then moving or changing a whole sun, which is much bigger so he decides to move the earth to a new star. After some practice he weaves a bag for the earth to be in and puts it on his back. He spreads his gravitonic field through the earth to protect it. The sky city of Gor is moved onto his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen is finding which star. Billions of white blood cells spiders do many experiments on plants to find the exact sunlight that is best for them. The also find out the best temperature, air pressure, humidity and day length for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCragic scans all the stars starting with the nearest. Many at completely wrong, having the wrong frequencies of light, being in binary or triple (or more) star system which would mess up day and night and the seasons too, have many devastating solar flares, are stuffed with asteroids or other problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough he finds one that is just right, just 147 light years away he observes it for a while to check their are no surprises. It checks out. He has even plotted out a stable orbit that won't budge any other planets that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sets off, bringing the the moon too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey takes centuries (space is very very very very very big). Dozen of generations are born, grown up, live and then die. Cragic figure out how to preserve their minds in this planet dwarfing cranium. They can live a utopian existence in there or they could be reincarnated as pretty much anything. Being a spider is popular. Those Cragic finds particularly virtuous are growing to huge sizes with all their other powers being boosted likewise, Trug is grown slightly larger then the earth, although he looks like a bug compared to the Cragic who is now half as tall as the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cragic eventually reaches the planet slowing to an eventual relative stop he discovers the planet is</span></div></div>",

Then all we have to do is make sure it was well feed,\" boasted a scientist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks way healthier then it should be, growing this big should have caused problems with air supply, blood pressure, nutrition and many more problems, it must have been hard to solve all those problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we didn't solve the problems, we made it so automatically mutates into a more healthy state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How.\" asked Adam<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've rejigger all the cells in its body so that we they are but under great stress they flood the surrounding cells with a potent mutagen. The cells then constantly mutate to the problem is solved after which mutagens are cleaned up and they carry with their new genome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genius, so what new mutations have turned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The feeding tubes has harden into a skeleton for sorts, it has grown a selection of pseudo lungs all across its body and its intelligence was increased dramatically\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that who could get that to work on other animals.\" asked Adam<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt, any thing in mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes this one\", he said showing a picture of Mr Palps<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mr Palps, we were helping he would be next, he's so cute, I've already got a solutions made up for him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was shown a tiny syringe. \"It has to be an injection, is the only way to make sure it hits the whole body\" explained the Lady scientist in charge of this lab<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is safe\" asked Adam<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, I've already tried it on a spider I found in the bathtub.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I'll tell you how it goes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Palps please stay still, his will make you big and strong\" reassured Adam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then carefully injected Mr Palps with the solution. He then connected a second larger cage to Mr Palps cage, this one had more then a thousand times the food and water he normal had in a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this Mr Palps was weighed and measured in every possible way and had today's silk extracted and put on the coil. Then it was time for them to go home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night night, Mr Palps\" they Both said as they left <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they came back tomorrow they were surprised and delighted to find out </span></div></div>",

Mr Palps then bounded off Keith and jumped on to Adam Hugging him with all eight legs at the same time. The thick fur on the legs meant the hug has very soft.  The hug knocked Adam onto the floor, as his legs where wrapped all the way round they broken the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to weigh you first, you can hug me after that\" squirmed Adam.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider then stopped hugging Adam, gently putting him down. He moved to the center of the Lab and moved into his measuring potions where all his legs where equal spread apart and his Abdomen was entirely level.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam pulled out a camera and tried to see what had changed other then size. He noticed that the first too pairs of ended in 8 figured hands.  Giving him an orange to peel he learned the new hands were at least as dexterous and sensitive as human hands. By having the spider make an origami crane out of plate steel he also noted that they were very strong, he would measure how much latter, assuming there a machine that can measure high enough. The spider could retract his fangs. The brain was larger proportionally to the body. Several holes all around the body had air rushing in and out of them. Listening in he could hear several heartbeats. At the back end rather then one spinneret their where hundreds of them, each as big a Mr Palps old one. The go all be sprayed at once or in any combination. They each produced about 50 yards of silk, which he but with the rest of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had done as much as he could with the equipment in this lab which was designed from bug sized things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Palps let out a little bit of silk so I can hold onto you, where going outside the lab\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider let out a length of silk. Adam looped it round the middle of the spider a few times and then hold it out sort of like a dog chain. He walked him to the Lab exit, the spider paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come out, nobodies going to hurt you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly the spider stepped out. Everybody was busy working so their was nobody in the corridors. Adam was going to the Lab where they were breeding pigs that produced bacon he little fruiting bodies that could be picked off without harming the pig. The pigs were also about as big as rhinos but very friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the lab. It looked like there was some rip in space time as high lab suddenly gave way to a pig pen. The pen's pig was huge, it was as big as one of the caravans the Jeremy Clarkson like to destroy so often. In place of a tail was a long trail of balls of flesh. There whee several detached versions of these spread around the pen and several others being studied in the lab. The leader of the this lab came forward he was a very large and hirsute gent. He spoke in a mild Scottish accent.  \"Adam, I see you've finally got round to making Mr Palps huge too. Took you long enough. Put I see that you really got into it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man advanced towards the pair. Adam braced a little bit but tried to hide it. Mr Palps backed away. \"Don't worry Mr Palps\" said Adam \"He a...eerrk...friend\" he said as he received a crushing bear hug. Mr Palps continued to back away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe your not ready for a hug yet, what about a handshake. Adam we'll show how.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did so and then the big guy Shook one of Mr Palps hands.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you here to weigh and measure him then,\" said the Big guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, none of the stuff in my lab can handle things this big\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then quickly got to work weighing ever bit of spider several times over.

He see the spider has multiple copies of every single organ, even brains, this spider would be almost impossible to kill with anything short an explosive tank shell at point blank range. There is something that looks like copper wire between the brains, since he don't want to cut up his friend he won't know for sure. He guesses the copper wire is for near light speed communication between the brains, this would both make the spider smarter and mean it would only have one personality. He notices their is a cluster of vessels in an ear in the spiders neck, something complex is being grown their.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam then do some FMRI, so you can see its brains in action.Adam notices their is a lot of activity all over the place in all of them. Adam has no idea what bits of brain control what so you do some test to figure it out. Butting various colours and shapes in front of his big adorable eyes he sees where the visual cortexes are, he then does the same for taste and smell and touch. Adam notices that whenever you talk huge areas of all the brain light up, even more when you say new and complicated words. Adam tests it by reading from the book you were currently reading for fun about an alternate history where Nicholas Tesla opens a portal into a universe of a 50ft high spider civilization that were in a medieval period when first discovered but who are quickly given access to modern technology in exchange for mercenary work (since you you hire about a hundred spiders for a tonne of steel armies and navies with humans in them are all but phased out, since the spider code of chivalry means they won't attack a weaker opponent (i.e. all humans) first means you couldn't use the spiders to gain territory whilst the ability of just a company of spiders to tie up, literally, any army of earth made war so futile not even generals would do it any more) heavy lifting and the resources of their home-world.  This novel was about foiling a scheme by imperial japan you capture the spiders as eggs and thus raise them to be an unstoppable army that would be completely and unquestionable loyal to the emperor.

His growth didn't destroy or bend the MRI machine he was inside. Future Mr Plaps moved all size atoms so that they grew back the atoms around him. Soon he reached the ceiling which he grew through doing no damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Palps phased his read through the ceiling \"The views better from the top of my head, who wants a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam and the other humans all said yes. Mr Palps grabbed them with his a eight fingered hand each and phasing them though 3 ceilings but them on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere were several floors to grow through before he reached the using telepathy he calmed down the people he meet on the way before they started to panic and hurt themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he broke though the roof me found several news helicopters that he would warp through time so they could see the growth right from the start (they pick up the earlier bits on infra red) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello people of earth\" greeted Mr Palps \"I'm called Mr Palps, I'm going to be outgrowing the universe.  Don't worry about me crushing you, I squeeze all my atoms past all yours atoms so none of them get push around, watch,\" said Mr Palps speaking the native language of all the foreign news programs that he would/did warp in. Having finished that sentence he suddenly surged 10 times as big. The building that previously just scraped his underside how only went up to the first joint of his spider hands. He grew straight through several helicopters which then climbed and flews out of the top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see your all completely safe.  You surely have other questions I answer them when I grow over to you,\" bragged Mr Palps as he outgrew the mountains that surrounded the secret labs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew right though the mountains as he became 10 then 20 miles tall. He inhaled all the clouds so his friends on his head could get a better view. He grew on his legs passing through fields and woods and smaller settlements with so much as bending a blade of grass. He paused for a couple of seconds when each of his legs had reached a different city, which they covered entirely. He started to talk with all the people he was looming over. He had separate conversations with each of them at them same time more then hundred million as once, an easy task for his cubic miles of brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had started growing in the middle of the rocky mountains he was facing west. Soon his front legs reached the pacific and his back the Atlantic. On the left one leg was in Mexico and the other was on Cuba both right legs were in Canada. His abdomen shaded most of the north Atlantic, which his spinnerets over London. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one more surge his legs curved clear round the earth. He then went and cuddled every single human and animal on earth. Using his 1000 miles brain he bent and twisted the laws of physics so that everyone received a huge that was just right for them. There where so people that didn't like hugs, even from giant cuddle spiders, he let them be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst cuddling the spider fixed all the problems on earth. Everybody became immortal, all wounds were healed up to growing new limbs and all diseases were cured. Everybody who was mean was too busy being cuddled to be mean to anybody. All the pollution was cleaned up and released as a tiny fart. All crimes were humorously made impossible e.g. if you tried to shoot someone the bullet would turn into a pigeon that would poop of the shooters head if someone stole something they thing would instantly he teleported back and the thing they stole replaced with a small version of Mr Palps that would drag them to were they tried to steal something made make them apologize and since they where physic they would tell if it was genuine.   </span></div></div>",

He carries adam past his moon sized eyes and in front of his moon sized eyes and past his fangs which you could balance a city on their very tips. Adam was completely trusting in his friend and knew there was no danger. As he hit the spiders stomach he dissolved into a plasma of pure joy that was so intense he passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to he saw a fuzzy plap sticking out of his face.  His vision was incredible he could she the whole electromagnet spectrum from gamma rays (which Mr Plaps bent away from where they could do any damage but sometimes using them to deliver genetic mutation until radio waves, which he observed so accurately that he could tell which channel they were).  He was surrounded by some sort of soft sphere, it must be and egg he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry you weren't conscious for the transfromation, its my first try so it would have hurt a bit\" apologised Mr Palps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel every bit of your body. It all felt amazing. He also knew you could make it bigger. He did so. He looked around, he was in a park, looking at the horizon he realised it must be central park in new york. He was 50 foot tall, he realised he had an instinctual knowledge of exactly how big he was. He saw the city along with and eighth of the earth was being cuddled by a continent dwarfing spider leg. Some of the joy he was feeling was due to that. Not wanting to keep his friend waiting he started to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was doubling in height ever single second. In 5 second he had outgrowth all the nearby skyscrapers and was smart enougth to mind talk with the people below. At 7 seconds he hit a mile. A couple of seconds after that he covered all of manhatten, Harmlessly growing though all the buildings. 12 seconds 32 miles, then 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1000. By 20 seconds he covered most of earth and has keeping everything safe his is own mind powers. A couple of seconds after that he reached his friends height. He stopped them he was exactly as tall as him down to the last micrometer.  They hugged with the earth gently squished between them. The friendship between them was so intense and pure that it dissolved any hatred that remained on the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was better then he could possibly have imagined and it was only going to get better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next activity is your choice\" added Mr Palps.   </span></div></div>",

Apparently it ended up as large as thane's castle. Eventually it died from fighting and defeating some sort of giant demon. Its heart, which would never rot, could apparently give the same power to other spiders, but could be twisted for evil.

They've already killed several cattle and its only matter of time until they kill a person. There's dozen of them, we can handle and goblin or wolf or two on our own but this more then we can fight. We've called the army but we're worried they won't be here in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunstut then goes village council to learn more. He soon learns exactly were they were last seen and where their nest probably is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be able to talk to them, get them to move away to more wild area, or figure out some sort of treaty,\" asked Grunstut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try\" said Crusidell \"although they might not respond to my dance depending on what instructions they have been given. They are soldiers after all, they are very dumb and have no free will of their own if their instruction say to always attack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me just check here, the giant spiders are non sapient beings will no free will. It is the small ones that are actually people,\" checked Grunstut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" said Alborous as if it was obvious \"if you big on can't hide nearly as well, that dangerous. Also adventurers are always fighting the big spiders. We don't put sapient beings in danger, you wouldn't do something like that would you. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained that all the humans are sapient every single one of them. The spiders are apologetic. They explained that they natural assumed that all human soldiers were without free will, after all if they had free will why would they fight and possibly get killed, that would be really really dumb. They such assumed that those given orders in castles the towers, where they were safe were the only real people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to tell the people spiders that control these soldiers spiders about this. People they do something they'll regret, or even possibly more things that they will regret. Once we find the big one they have a trail that leads back to the people spiders,\" explained Crusidell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they same across a group of giant spiders. Following their instructions to attack anything that might be threat they save Grunstut weapon and determined he was. They moved forward preparing to attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throw aside your weapon, if they they don't think your a soldier they probably won't attack you,\" yelled out Alborous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunstut naturally hesitated. \"You have to trust me on this, its safer this way,\" begged Alborous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing divination Grunstut determined Alborous was telling the turther as it knew it. He decided to trust and threw aside his weapon (the goblindoom). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiders stopped advancing. They looked around alert. Paying special attention to the weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll dance to them\" said Crusidell. He then swung other to the nearest ones plaps and began to dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey the spider froze, completely. Not even its eyes moved. Even its hairs became stiff. The other spiders quickly followed suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it dead\" asked Grunstut<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, its just in wait mode, it won't do anything until someone dances more instructions for it. Not under any conditions.  You could chop it up and it wouldn't even flinch,\" explained Crusidell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've found the trail to the people spiders\" called out Ellidive, \"I'll guide you too it, bring these spiders to them and they can give them new instructions to leave humans alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGurnstut used some rope, which as an adventurer he always had large supplies of, to tied the spiders together. After some advice he flipped the spiders on their backs so they could be easier to move, they slid across the ground and didn't get their legs stuck in anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they reached the edge of the forest. They went into it. Fortunately the forest was well managed, for pollarding largely so their was little undergrowth to get stuck on. They reached a ordinary seeming tree, they then stopped, they were there. Then the tree began to move <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll not take anymore of my branches\" warned the tree, which was clearly a dhormu or dhormuk but hopefully the former, as it branches moved into a deadly position. The tree then saw the frozen spiders and shifted to a less hostile posture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To have put all those soldier spiders into wait mode you must be friends to spiders, most curious, I shall let you live, you even get to keep all your limbs, put only because you have so few of them as it is,\" deescalated the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do have people spiders within you\" asked Ellidive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they are in here,\" said the tree pointing to a hollow within itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk to them and explained what we have learned\" says the Crusidell as the spiders swing off into the hollow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst they wait Grunstut explained how he became friends with these spiders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiders, plus one more, come out. The extra spider dances in front of the frozen spiders. They get up and wanderer off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's instructed them to round up the other soldier spiders,\" explained Crusidell \"they need new instruction to leave humans alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They spiders in there want to talk to you, grunstut. There not leaving the hollow, there are birds out there. So your have to shrink, they've put a one hour shrink spell on this berry. Eat it, shrink and we'll take you inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunstut eats the berry and shrinks. Riding on Crusidell he is carried inside the hollow. Looking around the all the sides and even the ceiling of the hollow are filled with shells of leaves suck together with spider silk. There is much art, sculpture and books around. Every thing is painted garish colours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oldest and greyish spider come forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have both done awful things to each other that we never could have suspected. It just end now. We will make a peace between spiders and humans. You are hear now so we'll sort out the first terms with you,\" proclaims the spider elder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking quite clear that his words have no authority grunstut makes some suggests. Obviously the soldier spiders should be instructed to leave humans alone. Next compensation for lost livestock, 5 red deer per cattle is agreed on. News should be spread of each others sapience as quickly as possible. All past crimes will be forgotten to stop grudges being held. If they hurt each other from now one there must be some way to seek justice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiders then talk amongst themselves for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder then speaks \"We end people spiders to talk to the humans to make this dead, it will be easier without size differences therefore your companions will be give the ability to sizeshift.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA potion is made for each of the 12 spiders then drink then similar briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can be big now,\" said Ellidive excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but get out of this hollow first,\" warned Crusidell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better keep me safe out their,\" cajoled Arboreous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got out the spider grew to their humanish sizes. Crusidell was the biggest at 5 feet tall.

At least we got here before anybody got killed. If things can carried on as normal the solider spider like will have ended up killing someone eventually. Then they have either sent an army of some great hero to kill all those big spiders. Then with no big ones to defend them the people spider would have been vulnerable to attack by dozens of types of animals. They would likely have been wiped out before they could breed more solider spiders and then make a potion to make them big. Its happened before. A lot. Or they could have run away, and joined a functioning colony whilst they gathered the materials to make their own defenders. Of course there had to find so that their own about a 50, 50 chance of that working, and some would be lost the on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then think of how things would have gone if you hadn't met these spiders. You have now doubt you'll have somehow killed every one the soldier. If would probably have went something like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-stories/e/66426755\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need something to let you apart from normal giant spiders. What about hats, know of giant spiders in stories wear hats, they should give them enough pause for me to explain stuff,\" you look into your bag for loot, you then think better of it \"no, these are the hats of fighters, we need civilian hats or hats so weird they can't help but inspire curiosity. I can't leave you whilst I go to village to get them so we'll have to make them here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then explain briefly what hats are and the whole group brainstorms ways to make hats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ending up making several different types of hats. One is a cone made from the peeled bark of a birch tree. Arboreous shrinks won and sits on Crusidell's head. One makes a rough framework out of supple branches and fills in the gaps with leaves stuck on with spider silk. One is simply a big ball of leaves stuck together with spider silk with a hollow at the bottom so it can go on the head. Ellidive puts a bird nest on top of the largest hat. There are some baby birds in the nest and the mother came back to his nest with no problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the village behind a ridge so nobody would see all the spiders coming towards the village at once and start to panic. You go round the edge of and quickly meet the protector Urrsin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell the Urrsin the giant spiders will no longer be a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have slain them all, praise the all father you are a true hero,\" congratulates the elder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explains that you've actually done bet then that, you've befriended them. At that agree signal Ellidive (who you argued was the least scary of the them (much to his annoyance) had round the edge of the ridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe then starts to hide behind Grunstut. Then the birds in his hat start to tweet and he breaks down in laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well met protector. You don't make to worry about us spiders any more. Need any more heroism done,\" says Ellidive very enthusiastically <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk? When did you learn that?\" asked the elder incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been able to talk for centuries, we're only just learnt that you can talk,\" said Ellidive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel that I'm going to have to have a lot of things explained to me. We'll have a meeting so we can get all the questions answered at once. I'll get everybody gathered in the village hall. Is there more then one of you?\" checked Urrsin the Elder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's 12 of us,\" informs Ellidive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should fit in, okay meet in village hall at noon. I have to gather everybody and then spend a while preparing them, giant spiders at still scary even if they can talk,\" planned the Protector. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt noon the bell rings out the hour from the church that also functions as the village hall and various other things that the hamlet is too small to have their own building for. The rest of the town is deserted so the 12 spiders wait outside the village hall with nobody seeing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunstut comes in first. He begins by telling the whole tale of his adventure in the caves of Westwold <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-stories/e/65113173\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-...</a> by the time he get to the Goblin Chieftain the crowd is so caught up in the story that they at still are not disturbed when he gets to the part about the meeting the spiders carefully telling the structure so that the spiders at brought up the story one at a time at which point you bring them into the hall. By the time you get to the hat making you bring in the last of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd at still nervous at first but they are quickly shamed into courage them a 6 year comes and pets all the spiders. At first they are mostly thinking about problems and how the spiders can make good on the damage they've done like demanding compensation for lost livestock. Then when the captain of the local militia which restricts itself to problems of 2 goblins or smaller ask if them could help defend the hamlet (which they can) other people quite start thinking of other advantages. The weaver asks if some spider silk could be spared. A herbalists ask if spider could guard him whilst he comes deep into the forest for rare ingredients. A hunter asks if they could help with make some superior traps. The spiders realise they will gain to, learning about cooking, farming, mining, smithing and limited access to broader trade outside the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn agreement is quickly reached which greatly benefits everybody. There take it to the people spiders in their tree and it is quickly signed. Spend they night in the village - in the rectors spare bedroom and then after a hearty breakfast set off back to Durnsig.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that unless you can make treaties like this that cover the whole kingdom its only a matter of time before the unnoticed war starts again. Your going to have to talk to the king, but you'll need to build up a reputation first as the king is very busy and won't make such a big change unless you have proved yourself a great hero. You can think of two options, do lots of heroic ask around here until the word spreads or go to Trithik and try to win the trust of Thane Pryond and access to the king via him. </span></div></div>",

Its goes very smoothly, largely helped along by now fluffy and petable all the spiders are. In fact some people spend so much time petting the giant spiders they're barely getting any work done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 days later the solider spiders have all when reprogrammed they've also been designed to be super fluffy. The spider elder is hiding on the underside on the biggest one. He talks with the village protector about some things that turned up and some new ideas they're had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide you are done here and you and the 12 spiders go back to Hawklor. By now stories about now you have magical conjured friendly spiders have spread to the village so the spiders can be full sized and hot raise the alarm as long as they keep their hats on. You visit the Stoneback Tavern that talk with Pripor and the regulars to see if there is any problems nearby that could go with an adventurer to help out with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou learn about Hawnley Jakk the mountain giant, a problem you will probably help solve eventually but you feel you are not yet killed enough to face such as foe. You also know that if you fail the retaliation with be brutal, so you put that aside for now. Belong that it seems things are mostly going on as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you leave you find the nearest home of the people spiders by finding the nearest solider spiders then Crusidel has them lead you back to their home which is in the back of cave that is far to small for a human to reach the back of, so you have to be shrunken again to meet them. You meet with the 3 sisters that pretty much run everything there and take them so the village council of Hawklor, you leave them starting to sort out an agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then make your way to Trithik.  You have walked a quarter of the way they them you encounter a wagon from Quarrek, they are off to Trithik to sell some of the equipment they found in some caves the Milita explored with the help of solider spiders. You are given a lift, inside the wagon you find a couple of solider spiders standing on the roof the inside of the wagon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of me wants to see some bandits try something just so I can see there faces when these two come out\" says the driver of the wagon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 12 spiders with you all shrink down a bit so they can fit in the wagon. Its takes a few days to get to Trithik, and how stop at coaching inns every night, your spider friends stay at regular size when the visit so as not to cause alarm. During your say you hear about a village where half and people were turned into giant spiders, but since there minds weren't changed were don't have to worry about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you finally reach the gates of Trithik. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are somewhat shocked by the sheer size and noisiness of the city. The spiders a far more shocked an shrink down even further usual and hide in your armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander into blade square as that is where everybody else is going. You see a notice board. There is a sign on it saying the Thane is holding a tournament of arms.  You quickly realise this would be a quick way to get the thanes attention and so go to Tynd keep to sign up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a crowd of various warriors, rogues and soldiers gathered outside. The places in the tournament are nearly filled up and there is a lot of argument about who could get the last slots. Two guardsman explain loudly that own the finest warrior are worthy of the thanes tournament and so anyone that wants it will have to take them both down at the same time. The guards a quite tall and look strong so most the crowd backs off at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCruisidell they tells Grunstut that he could take them. Before you could advise other size he'd already climb out of the arm and grown to 5 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept your challenge\" declares Crusidell whilst also putting on a hat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is his\" says the first guardsman to recover from stunned silence, their is to be no magic in this tournament so gating in monsters in certainly not allowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am no minion, I fight for myself,\" says Crusidell \"Now challenge me for my place or find someone with the courage to do so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards not wanting to fight huge a spider or look cowardly huddle together to think up a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you can't enter to the its a tournament of arms and you only have legs,\" says a guard smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous\" says Ellidive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coward\" says another spider <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Just made that up\" says another <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me these those rules\" says Arboreous <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the assembling warriors also join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to fight 12 spiders even less then 1 big on the guardsman relent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrusidell is taken to a small enclosure and the two guards line up shaking quite a bit. The as still for a load time until someone yells \"Just fight already.\" And the nervously advance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrusidell puts two globs of sticky silk on the end of his palps. When the both attack at the same time he grabs on to the swords with the silk and quickly disarms them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes two more steps towards the guards and they faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay your in the Tournament, I hope the Thane doesn't mind\" says a clerk as it he then takes Crusidells name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe someone comes up behind Grunstut \"Good s..s..sir, I am terrified of spiders will you please take my place,\" begs the very tough looking fighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunstut agrees and is signed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the tournament begins. The organisers realise the fight between Grunstut and Crusidell will be the most exciting so have them seeded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 64 contestants gather in the room next the arena of blades. Grunstut looks at Crusidell, did he get bigger? Grunstut is repeatedly asks if the big spider is going to eat anybody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm not going to eat anybody, this would the the dumbest possibly place to start. Actually to be sporting I'm going to drain all by venom right now,\" says Crusidell Exasperatedly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then motions Gurnstut over to put a couple of flagons under his fangs. He spurts out all his venom into them half filling them. Someone comes into to remove the flagons and is told to heat and flagons to boiling point to rend the venom harmless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe the tournament starts the other spiders put themselves on some thread that spans and arena and sit above it. Firstly to get a good view and secondly because people getting moving away when they tried to get to the seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is what it normally goes down like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-stories/e/65301036\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-...</a></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Grunstut and Crusidell do very well. In the first road in does the sticky palp disarmament again. Then he put string between his two front legs and trips the next one. The third he lets seem to sneak up behind him other he had 360 vison and could see the whole thing, he kicks the weapon away at the last second and with the other back foot knocks the opponent down. The fourth he simples tanks several blows to the face then grabs the other with his palps drops him off with the other losers for that round. For the fifth round he jumps about 20 feet in the air and lands or hard next to the other guy that he falls down and drops his weapon, he then sits on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is clear to all by then that Crusidell is growing bigger. When you meet him in the changing room for the last round he is 7 feet tall. A single one of his legs outweigh most humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunstut and Crusidell then face each other in the Arena.  The decide Grunstut won't use any weapons and Crusidell with forgo the use the silk. Then each whiff all there blows, the can't brings helps to really hurt there friend. So they just try to push each other out the Arena, in this they turn out to the even matched and they push against each other for half and hour gaining and losing mere inches with each might thrust forward. Eventually they both become exhausted and they both collapse at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they come to Thane Pyrond is there. He is surrounded by guards who have a lot of crossbows pointed at Crusidell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What fortune, I hold a Tournament to find a champion and instead find two. Just the question was who to give the cup to. I guess the only thing I can do it this,\" declares the Thane<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thane then grabs the Golden and Ruby studded cup form the fancy cushion someone was carrying it on and tosses it into the air. Before it hits the ground in slices it exactly in two with master swordsmanship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I have lot of things I need a champion for, come round to the keep later once you've recovered and we can get to work,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that and the blowing of Trumpets the Thane Departs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrusidell grows a few inches bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater the thane has a task for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: I am currently running a sryth Fanworks contest (ends 30th July) details here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-stories/e/67986060.\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-...</a> Content chapters about sryth in this or other interactive will count as entries. </span></div></div>",

You more away and a lid comes down sealing you in darkness. You are all alone, there are no other bugs here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then the lid lifts and how bottle are thrown in. You manage to evade all of them by having thread on and sides to quickly pull yourself away. You are starting to get hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the whole thing is moved, quickly and roughly. You barely survived the clashing together of the bottles. More clashing a you suddenly turned upside down. The lid opens, below you is fire. So hot even the bottles melt, and your a lot with tough then a bottle. You shot out thread in all directions hoping to catch something. You do, up, a lot. You pull yourself up your body being cracked by the heat, blue blood comes out and boils. You'll feel the pain later, you have to escape first. You start to go up. But they your tread feels limp, it is melting. You shot out more and more threads but they are all melting too and your running out of thread. The last tread snaps. You fall, you burnt to nothing before you feel any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now a ghost.

You find a perfect spot just near a window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to spin web you manage to get the main framework down when you are interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my spot, get out\" says a loud voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around so you can look at it with most of your eyes. Its huge and its spider. It must have a 2cm span. It could swallow you whole. It has two big front sizes. You look around, it doesn't seem to have a web a at all. This is a hunting spider. You then see it actually has a web between it for front legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a ogre faced spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely we can share, there's plenty of bugs to go round,\" you bargain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you put a web here the human will notice it, then they will notice me.

Also I have a tap in my belly, its about your size. Nothing personal mind but I'm going to eat you,\" informed the spider nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe web then gets wraps around you again, tighter. You legs are pushed against your body. One of them breaks. More web is applied and it is pulled tighter. Along leg breaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTighter. Snaps goes the 3rd leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTighter. The web is blocking off your air holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTighter. You can do longer size as more web covers your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTighter. Any air left in you is pushed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTighter. You feel body snap in several places, ichor seeps out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like your dying again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo heck with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burn with sheer fury and injustice of it all. You just wanted to live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does this feel warm\" wonders the ogre faced spider. Suddenly the web catches on fire.

You want to live and nothing is going to stop you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself grow again. 1mm across becomes 2 then 4. Then with another spurt you grow then times as big, to 4 cm across.

But we will eat you sometimes, we are spiders after all,\" you offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt, it dying hurts a lot I don't want to do it over and over again,\" explains the fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a feeling I'll be able to make to it doesn't hurt, but the only way to really know it do it,\" you reassure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then snap the silk that ties the fly to you. \"You can fly out of that window and do what you can with one more life. Or you can come to be and she want will happen if you have eternity,\" you persuade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fly comes over to your and lodges if self between the your palps. \"Please be gentle\" it says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are then filled with more determination. You won't just make it so that this fly dying doesn't hurt, you will make it a positive experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are filled with energy and once again grow, from 4 Cm across to 6. You then take that energy and push it all into your Plaps. Then you push into into the fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel joy\" explains the fly \"joy beyond any I have ever felt, and it keeps increasing. I feel with like I should wor..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive one fang into its head and other into the its body, killing it instantly. Holding the spirit you keep the energy flowing into it. You slurp out some of the insides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have some too,\" you tell of the Ogre Faced spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt comes over and sucks out the rest of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then put the spiders spirit back in its body, whilst is restored once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when all you going to kill me?\" ask the fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have,\" you answer, \"we both ate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" checks the fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both confirm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with you forever then,\" says the fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I am too,\" says the ogre faced spider, \"I'm called Thallos by the way,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Zos\" says the fly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt the will of your two brush against your own.

When you go in you see it is much much bigger on the inside, in fact the end of the shop is lost over the horizon. In pens, cages and tank you can see every kind of animal you can imagine. There are loads of cats dogs and the more ordinary pet animals but amongst them  you see things like Komodo dragons, emu's, whales and elephants.  Your pretty sure you also saw some dinosaurs and dragons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you appears a giant Mantis shrimp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Kardo's really really big pet store it says. We have pets of every kind of creature that ever existed and that ever will exist on any planet in any universe. We also have every creature that ever has or will be imagined by any person on any planet in any universe. You could look around yourself, time follow different here so even if it took you a billion years to find what you want (which is actually pretty fast) now time will have past outside and you wouldn't have age at all. But if you want to do it faster I can look into your soul and find the perfect pet for you and show you it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay go ahead\" you say decided to have as much fun as you can before reality pokes its nose in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mantis shrimp stares at you. You feel find of funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the exact right pet for you now\" it replies and you know it is right. Its in aisle 7 149 241 341 275 shelf 1 999 345 432 285. Climb on my back I'll take you to it.\" You study notice it has a saddle on its back and you climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would take far you long at this scale, I'm going to grow myself\" it says a begins to grow and grow. It quickly reaches the size of a car then a house a cruise ship a whole city and it still swells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd like you know how big I am, I bring in some stuff for scale,\" says the Mega sized Mantis shrimp. Suddenly a giant globe appears, you quickly realize that it is one to one scale, is the same size as the earth. The mantis jumps and lamps on Florida on the globe which it is already as big as. It continues to grow reaching the size of the USA then all of north America.  A few seconds after that it is as big as the Globe. It still grows reaching so big the earth sized globe look like a marble to it, in picks it up in one of its claws to show you. \"That should do it,\" said the Mantis with release of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so big?\" you ask Awestruck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't big, this is tiny, I still fit in the universe. Like everybody that works in the shop I have unlimited size shifting powers, you have to work with the pets here,\" it says ambiguously. \"I could dance on an electron or use universes as glitter, and that's just for starters, anyway we've got a pet to get to\" It said moving off, whilst the forces should have blasted you into atoms the ride felt very smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" it said as with a puff it returned to it original size with you still sitting on its saddle. There she is, the perfect pet that will give and receive ultimate happiness forever\" she say pointing to rather small cage. In the cage is a small spider on a couple of inches long.

The spider grows until its back becomes bed sized, whilst far softer then any bed ever was. As they grow you see the asile bend and shift so they can always safely get though. As it grows its hairs don't get that much longer, just enough to be really really soft. Instead new hair grow to fill the gap so it is covered with the most plush carpet ever. A carpet the grows larger then any room, any field and then any country.  You can really the heart below beating out and out as it swells with every beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the front of the store, you can see a set of stain glass windows that could let the sun in easily.

Actually look outside am I'll show you,\" says the spider making a flashing neon sign point to where you've got to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look outside the window and see the the giant version of the genie wandering around. You notice that everything is carrying on a ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought there would at least be an evacuation\" you comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody can see or is anyway detect me but you, unless of course you wish otherwise\" offered the spider Genie \"keeping watching here comes the fun bit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big spider then surged in size doubling to 100ft tall. It then doubled again, again and gain, at 800ft tall it was taller then most of building in the city. It was getting hard to see it all at once so with a zap of magic the genie made the walls and ceiling of the flat transparent. It rested each of its legs on buildings that should surely be crushed under the weight but were, of course completely undamaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt puff up in size, its abdomen swelled up first, then its legs then its body. It continued this process over and over again until each of its legs where in the different direction of the countryside outside the city. The whole city was under the spider. You saw that aeroplanes simple flew right though the spider as if it wasn't there at all. Yet it still swelled yet larger. The city was only as large as the spiders thorax and then one of the spiders feet which loomed above the whole city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the foot slammed down on the city. Before you can registered what had happened it slammed down again. It then did it a few more times quickly. When you finally kept your eyes open you saw a whole line of feet-as-big-as-cities spiders doing a can-can, in costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thats enough now, I trust you\" you say before they burst into song<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith puff and the huge spiders disappeared and the building became opaque again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay wish time\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to print out my list first,\" who say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean THIS one\" says the genies passing you the list you where just about print out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the list right at number 1. is the words \"Free the genie,\" you she that it is already crossed out. You go down to the next one \"world peace.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't make this one first I'm a huge douche, so I wish for world peace, thats spelt P-E-A-C-E. I don't want you to tear Belgium off the planet or something,\" you say cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew someone would act for that, so I've thought of a fun away to do it\" says the Genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly pile of more then a hundred spider edges burst out the spiders rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were a boy\" you exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just did a dance number as long as the planet and swapping around some chromosones impressess you!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I've still got some norms to ditch,\" you confess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst you were talking all the end had hatched into the small versions of the genie. They were all identical expect half wore blue bowler hats and half red. They quickly divided into two seperate groups. The two groups glare at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed hat group suddenly grows 10 times as big, they are each 5 feet tall.  They move over to the blue hat groups you suddenly dwarf them at 50 feet tall. They seemless into the greets outside your flat. The reds counter by growing 500 feet tall. They are then knocked away by the blues growing to a mile high. Before they even hit the earth the reds are 10 miles tall. You climb on the orginal spider genie and it teleports you arround so you can get a good view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reds charge is sorted by the blues growing to a hundred miles tall. The blues attempt the swallow the reds is stopped when they grow to a thousand miles tall. The reds try to stomp the blues but are tripped up when blues grows to 10 000 miles tall, they are as big are the planet. The reds quickly equalize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two groups of spiders as big as worlds having apparently reached the limits of their growth both rally together more then a millions miles apart. Each of the groups then equip axes which could hew the world in twain in their front 4 legs (they each have one axe each). They then charge at each other. Limbs are hacked off all over the place and then instantly grow back. All the legs then all draw together by their own gravity into a world which outsizes jupiter as much as the earth outsizes the moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour genie teleports onto the severed leg world.  Goo flows form it and covers the world. With a spoing the whole leg world have become your spider, He is huge, each of the world spiders are only about a quarter as big as its foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lot!  Stop fighting or you won't get any of this pie,\" yells your Genies shows off a pie that is comically oversized even for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth armies quickly drop their weapons and run over to get pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish granted, each of thoses spiders is a world and they are now at peace,\" says the spider genie smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's not what I meant,\" you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I did your meaning too.  I just supersized all the other spiders in the world to act as a peacekeeping force.  See's its on the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiders makes a television appear in himself. The news comes on. It shows a montage of soldiers and rebels being bear hugged by giant spiders. Under it is the byline \"giant spiders bring about world peace: experts confused but pleased.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now, next wish\" the spider genie asks. </span></div></div>",

It was a rather short burrow and he soon reached the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber at the end had dozen of spider eggs, each carefully wrapped up in silk. There were also lots of centipedes slowly chewing though the silk to get to the tasty tasty eggs. The frog had barely seen them when his tongue shot out, caught hauled in one of them, he swallowed it down in less then a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZAP! GLOOP! ZAP!

He reached for the next one when he suddenly started to shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, give me 5 minutes to finish here,\" the frog begged. The growth didn't listen. He surged up in height until he filled the whole chamber. He could feel the walls and side of the chamber pressing upon him, he closed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider was sitting on the top of its burrow, making sure nothing went after the frog. Suddenly he felt the earth tremble, then the earth moved upwards. Shooting treads to some nearby trees in pulled himself up. Once the earth had settled again he saw that his frog friend was now 6 feet tall. He was snacked sized compared to the frog. In moved its body slightly revealing the spiders clutch of eggs, which were completely unharmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank Anansi your all safe,\" proclaimed the Spider, as it sat the the frogs head.  </span></div></div>",

There were more of these explosions in the distance in all directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast left ever bit of your body feeling strange. You also noticed that you balloon wasn't holding you up as much as before you were slowly going towards the ground even though the wind was more then twice as strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer able to stay afloat you carefully landed. Their was plenty of carrion to be found. He close a nearby body which looked tasty. It looked like a sheep but was strange as it was about your size, they used to be hundreds of times bigger. You also noticed all the other animals, the ones you could recognise the remains of, were much much smaller then usual. You eat not even a small mouth full and you are suddenly satied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find tree and squeeze your amoungst it branches. Your mottled brown colouring making workable camaflague. You wait and watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice something haphazardly moving past. It is human shaped but around the same mass that you are. Odd. It steps are forced and difficult as if the only thing keeping it going is sheer willpower.  Ever few steps he has a devastating fit of coughing, a little blood comes out each time. His skin looks raw. He smells like something that is just about to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel something on the side of your body. Its is somewhat like the feeling you had for your own offspring, but directed at his human instead. You are gripped by exaultant purpose, you are not to let this human die. You twist you way out of the tree, many of the branches are snapped in the process. You steadily walk towards the human. You have no idea what you are doing but you are going to try. </span></div></div>",

You are not quite sure that humans eat so you scavenge in the nearby barn, you think that it were they deep the food. You find a couple of barrels full of fruit, you pick them up. There are some bags of grain, you collect them too. Hay, do humans eat hay, well you pick up a couple of bales of that just in case. You then move to the dairy, you find some cows that are still locked up, you tear off the gates and let them free. There are several vats of milks, the human is that big so you just take one. Also nearby it as smaller building, you can smell something really tasty in there, it is filled with yellow and red blocks of what after tasting one of them you are sure is food, you can also tell this is a very rich food. You pick up a few of the blocks and add them to the pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you go to get some water.  There is a trough in the middle of the field which will make a good container. You move that with the rest. You seen that all the nearby water is covered by a layer of ash. You pull of a nearby fleece and use that to soak up water from a stream, you then squeeze it out into the trough, a few trips fills it up with water which is a lot cleaner they the water in the stream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also notice these fleeces would be good for keeping the human warm, you pick up a couple of new ones just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all together takes about 3 hours. Soon the human is waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore it wakes up you gently untie her and place help amongst the things you have supplies, resting her on top of the two fleeces you picked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it wakes up you call tell it is terrified, It has wrapped itself in the fleece and has curled up as small as possible.

They looked around and noticed that all the crew were spiders of various kinds. Most of them had at least one wooden legs and/or eye patch.  As it was a dream which leg and wooden and which eye was patched would change if they looked away from one of crew men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they where in a cabin. In the centre of the room was a huge map showing most of the Caribbean. The made of festooned with French and British flags. There were 3 countered on the map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dreamer who was obviously the captain then spoke. As it was the dreamer it didn't have a solid form. Instead body parts would simply appear whenever they had to be shown \"on camera\" in the dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is us\" said the captain pointing out a model of their ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our target\" was said pointing out a model of the a similar ship with the word \"git\" written on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the ship of Fanious Von Trump rogue privateer who will work for however will ignore his many many crimes. Right now that is Napoleon. I intend for that to be his last employer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After punching about 100 pirates we learned he will be after this\" he points to another counter. \"The HMS replete, it is filled with limes, with all the new men that have been impressed over the last few years you supplies of them are running low, England needs those limes and Von Trump knows it. His ship is much faster then the replete and will catch it in 12 days. We will catch him first. We will catch up with him around about here. The dreamer stuck a pin in the map (maps are very hard to make don't go stabbing swords into them).   He sail at a barring of 50 degrees at full sail. He will intercept in 9 days.  Marines and gunners, drill your pants off for 8 days and then rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime suddenly skips forwards. \"We are closer now, ballooners scout him out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ballooners immediately retracted them selves out to the crows nest. The dreamer jumped into one of the ballooners. Palpos and his dad followed suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey inspected their new bodies. They looked look like they were inflated, because they were. They were filled with pockets of lighter then air gas, probably methane, the dreamer hadn't dreamt in that much detail. They all floated and were tied to the ship with silk from one of their 5 spinnerets. Directly by the narrative of the dream all five of these produced huge amounts of silk from the massive silk reserves that made up half of the this breeds body mass. They then crafted this silk in something that was a cross between a sailing ship, a zeppelin and a submarine. They each made their own one. The then shot off in groups of two. Always keeping and lose drag line back to the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDream then followed only 2 of them. Palpos and his dad jumped into the same spider. They and the dream then scanner and ocean for their quarry. The dream quickly skipped to them finding it and made it clear a very longer put undefined amount of time had passed. The watched it a bit to confirm and see were it was going and how fast and any other intel they could get out of range of the ships guns, which would kill them instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalpos then felt a pricking of some sort. He then exploded. Fortunately it didn't hurt as it wasn't the dreamer you was getting exploded so he didn't dream the pain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You blackguard, to use incendiary rounds before battle is formally joined. I shall pop you,\" yelled the dreamer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try you smelly English pig dog, your mother was a hamster and your father had poor taste in wine.\" taunted the French Balloon spider in watch the dream told them was French but totally wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream then switch to 3rd person and showed them dog fighting. Whilst the dog fighting looked at cool as heck anyone with any knowledge of aerial tactics would be embarrassed by it.  Also everyone had unlimited ammo, none of which hit anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad he's had this dream a dozen times before. He always loses this fight, its probably symbolic of something. Now is the best time to intervene and then introduce ourselves.  It we screw up too badly we doesn't need to remember any of it,\" explained Palpos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dream this good deserves a proper ending,\" agreed the Father. \"I figure we could roughly stay in tune with the settling and slowly get him used to us or do something completely ridiculous and unexpected which will break the fantasy of dream and kick the dream into a lucid dream mode where we communicate directly.\"   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Food was running low if they didn't find land soon then he would meet a most unheroic end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdysseus raised his voice to the heavens, \"Gods of Olympus, I beseech you, show me the way to a safe harbour. I have nothing so offer you put when I return to Ithaca I will give great sacrifices in your honour. You have the word of the Odysseus, King of Ithaca, Capturer of troy and master archer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdysseus waited and then scan the horizon. Was it land. yes it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Land at 30 degrees, go at half sail,\" ordered Odysseus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sailed and the island drew closer and closer.  If was definitely real, but was it safe? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt midday they finally struck land. Having had bad experiences on other islands Odysseus but on his armour, grabbed a spear and his bow. He ensured in had many arrow and they were all balanced. He gathered 4 of his strongest and most trusted crewmen and disembarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Gaia, I thank you,\" said Odysseus at he reach solid ground for the first time in months. On the look out of witches, monsters, cannibals and other dangers he cautiously explored the land. He soon found a group of wild pigs, they had no fear of men and so were easily caught in did the first bits of butchery and then using his and crewmen\u2019s spears and the long grasses that grew here they carried them back to the ships. After a sacrifice to the gods the crew then ate well that night and he instructed a group to smoke what was left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the undergrowth and in the trees thousands of sets of 8 eyes watched the Greeks. When they arrived it took him (or her, or it, or them) a couple of hours to understand that their was places outside of his island and that they were from it. After first he thought they were ones you were one like the other beasts of the island, they we saw they work together and thought they were one who is many like himself then eventually he realised that they were a different kind entirely. They were ones who are with many who could be understood only by thinking of them as one and many at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a first shocked that they were removing parts of their bodies and putting on new ones.  He soon realised they to were a new thing, a thing he had no word for. He listen to them and learned that they were called \"tools,\" \"weapons\" and \"clothes.\"  He would remember those words. Words, they were the strangest thing of all, they were like the calls of beasts but they could mean so much more, it seems that their was words for everything.  Day after day he tried to say the words himself, he was getting better. Most of what they used the words about were things that were outside the island, something called \"Gods\" which was definitely important but he didn't understand, a place called \"Troy\" were something called a war had happened, he didn't understand it all but it seemed unpleasant.  Most of all they talked about \"home\" and \"Ithaca\" he soon learned they were same thing, he learnt that they wanted to go there above all else.  From that he understood they would go there as soon as possible, they were going to leave the island, he would never understand all their words. He must talk with them himself and ask them to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few attempts involved him sending one of him over at time to talk to them. They could hear him, he must be too quiet. Then he tired the opposite way, he sent thousands of himselves to them at once. \"Hello Odysseus\" they all said at once \"I want to talk with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdysseus' crew were terrified, they all fled back to what he learned was called the ship. They said things like, \"Zeus' beard this island is cursed too!  Haven't we been punished enough!!\"  Odysseus was not afraid, he had had many things try to kill so he knew this was not it. He started to talk back to the the hive mind but had to deal with his crew to stop them sailing away without him, an probably getting themselves killed in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must try another way, thought the Hive Mind. Please don't leave, it called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must leave immediately, this island is cursed with dark magic\" said Odysseus's first mate, Cleomentius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic certainly, but cursed and dark I believe not.  Think have any of us been harmed whilst one this island, have their been any ominous potents?\" asked Odysseus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not technically sir, but it is only a matter of time the spirit clearly has malice towards us\" Cleomentius replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not think so, you do remember was it said, no you were too busy being a bunch of Lydian, it said that it wanted to talk.  We have been this spirits guest for nearly a month now, honour demands we repay its hospitality will a tale or two, after all were have many of them. You saw you many of it there were, if it were planning any harm against us it would have done it long ago. We shall talk to it and learn its tales\" said Odysseus in a tone of voice that made it quite clear that we had made up his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But captain, our fear is great, we can barely stand,\" protested Cleomentius<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall go alone, it is me that is wishes to talk to.  If I do not return by dawn tomorrow you may leave with no curse but your own cowardice,\" rebuked Odysseus as he started to the leave the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdysseus walked up the beach again, he bought no weapons as they would be useless and discourteous. There was a slight pang of fear but he suppressed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spirit of his island, I am prepared to talk to you, or what shall I speak\" called out Odysseus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit came again but this time in a different form, Odysseus saw that it was. </span></div></div>",

So if you can shrink can you grow too?\" asked Odysseus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob grew to twice as tall Odysseus and then went back to medium dog size. \"Apparently I can\" Bob answered \"any other suggestion for making me less scary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try and keep you ability to change size a secret. Even I find it a bit scary. Can you change colour as well?\" Enquired Odysseus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" said Bob changing colour though the whole rainbow \"so what colour would be best?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several minutes to the get the colour right. They eventually settled on muted gold colour with a white patch on the head. Whilst this was happening the spider also grew more hair going from hairy to furry to fluffy and getting close to being woolly. Odysseus felt the fluff, it was very soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you crew will be less scared of me now?\" asked Bob<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, I have to soften them up first so keep all of your out their site until I come get you\" warned Odysseus <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdysseus returned on his ship. The crew were very relieved, they were almost sure he was dead. Odysseus explained how he'd beaten the spirit so badly in the game of riddles that it was now in his debt for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a few more tales of ingenious wit and cunning the crew seem so be ready to meet the creature. Odysseus went to get Bob, he tied some rope around Bob to make a lease so he would seem to be under Odysseus's control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would it work?</span></div></div>",

When Bob walked towards any of crew they quickly backed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, Uncious, Good day Kalon,\" said Bob greeting all the crew by name<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it know our names, witchcraft. Begone servant of Hecate,\" said one of the crew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just be friends\" begged Bob the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for more then an hour. The spiders body began to break down. The woolly fur came off in irregular clumps. Its eyes sunk into the the head. Odysseus saw that Bob had had enough and walked him off the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, but we have a bit of a history of finding monsters on islands, we already lost 11 ships and 9 crew from this one. Looks like there not going to let you go with us, I can't sail <i>these</i> seas with a constantly terrified crew. But other people will visit soon enough, I'll put your island on a map, I'll make sure its labelled with all the nice things that there are on this island. Other people will come,\" reassured Odysseus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise,\" asked Bob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Odysseus. The spider then started to look a lot better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should make absolutely sure you get home to tell everybody\" offered the spider. \"What could you use\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdysseus spent a while discussing all the things that a ship and crew need to work.  Bob then sent his many mes to go and make them. They then worked to smuggle them onto the ship. Some the ship was even better supplied they when it left to go to war all those many many years ago. He also made a lot of wine for the crew so they wouldn't notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ship sailed away. As Bob's island slowly disappeared off the Horizon Odysseus released a single wistful sigh. He meets a new friend for the first time in more then a decade and he has to leave him, like so many other. He steels himself and returns to captaining, he had a home to sail too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Odysseus was alone in section of the ship hull when a small speck of dust suddenly swelled into Bob's fluffy form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bob, how did you get here?\" asked Odysseus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made myself really really really tiny and hid amongst the supply of ship biscuits,\" explained Bob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone else seen you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" answers Bob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you must stay hidden. If the crew find you they'll be sure you have something sinister planned. They'll tear his ship apart to find you,\" warns Odysseus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, I'll just keep my self smaller then a grain of sand,\" say Bob shrinks down to that size but not becoming quieter as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice small too,\" suggests Odysseus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this then\" said Bob climbing inside Odysseus right ear. There Odysseus could hear him clearly and so one else would hear a thing  \"What do I do to get your crew to like me,\" asks Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll have to be something big and dramatic. You'll have to stay at least some of our lives by fighting off a monster or something,\" confides Odysseus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this a voyage by Odysseus soon enough there would be dire peril.</span></div></div>",

The bug team was having the their lives but most of them crew didn't have much to do. They were now scanning the planets largest ocean. They found battle that was flagged up, it was tiny own about 12 miles across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all short things that looked like signs of civilisation. There were net around the island, they seemed to be made of spider. They were a few very abundant species of animals and planets, they were different from there version on other nearby islands. All the fruits were bigger and more numerous, the animals were more passive and had much smaller brains, and most obviously many of them were in pens. There were large stores of food, many thousands time more then a single creature could eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a later Neolithic civilisation. But where were the people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAway team time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he wasn't supposed to Captain Trail went on the mission himself. He brought his science officer, a floating jellyfish called Klopo and an engineer who was an uplifted beaver called Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey beamed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed on the beach. They decided they would walk straight through the island to the other side. Hopefully they'd find the civilisation on the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe further they got in the more and more tiny spiders, the size of a grain of rice appeared around them. They never got close staying about 15 feet way. Soon there were millions of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these some sort of guard animals\" asked the Captain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlikely\" said the Jellyfish \"Guard animals usual only come in a small range of specially breed types, these are far to diverse for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some sort of ant like native?\" asked the captain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,  they are some castes in here that I don't think would ever leave the nest,\" informed the science office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There obviously the sapience of this island, or at least part of it. They see something new and they all come to watch. That curiosity a trait every sapient species needs to get anywhere. Also many of them have tools webbed to themselves,\" quickly deduced greg the Beaver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hive was suck, how to communicate with something that mouth talks rather then brain talks. It just have to make its own mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started to combine a few million of it left together to make shapes like them with mouths like theirs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw piles of spiders combine together to make spider blob version of themselves. The then started speaking utterly at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't language so the universal translators don't work. They have all the sounds and all the meanings but they have no idea how to link them together. Fornunately there brainwaves are sort of similar to my own so I can no a mind meld,\" offered Klopo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do so, but if its even a little dangerous pull out and get beamed up. Your worth more then solving this mystery,\" agreed the captain cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jellyfish floated over to his spider version. Put a tendril out of phase and but it through a spider brain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting only fragments, its like someone took a book seperated every letter and threw pile of them my way, its a hive mind, a true one there on queen or overmind or anything like that\" explained Klopo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider then started to grow. It quickly grew to it was 3 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes more sense now. You can fight whole thought in one this big easy. Its happy, very very happy. Its reading my mind. Its mind is vast, class 4 maybe even 5,\" continued Klopo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can get out now. I know your languages,\" said the giant spider in perfect english. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlopo detached himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm a part of the hive mind made semi autonomous to talk with you people. I should probably have a name, give me one please,\" asked the spider, which was sliver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I called you voice\" said the captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll work\" agreed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if there anything you particularly won't to say now that you can talk,\" ask the captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know your planning to colonise here, can some of the colonists live on my island. I release that as the only sapient being that I've been missing out on something important, I don't want to lose it again for very long,\" begged the spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to ask HQ about that put I'm certain more we come to study you,\" reassured the captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll do, but first I show you what I've done here,\" agreed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then looked around the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was finished they<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We think it started growing about 6 months ago.  It hasn't been influenced by anybody yet so you can just do the standard procedure. You must hurry, he is already known to the public.

After we foiled their attempted to fry all the worlds computers by having an electric eel encircle the whole globe we know we have to take these guys seriously.\" exclaimed Gary. Gary then recalled that the mesolithic order was dedictated to undoing all technological advancement since the middle stone age and return humanity to its golden age of the hunting and gathering.  Whilst the end point seemed like someting many people would like that life style could only support a few million people, therefore 99.9% of the human race would have to die first. \"I'll be at base in 2 minutes, catch me up there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was current 25 000 light years from earth. In another arm of the milky way. To go the distance he grew, a lot. The blue hypergiant stars he was moving around which were previously baseball size compared to him quickly matched golfballs, then marables, grains of rice, sand then dust. They became points of light. He grew through solar system after solar system. All the stars and planeted simply pass right through him. He grew out of the plane of the galaxy and was as wide as galatic arm. He waved at all the millions of civilisations below. With one more burst his head grew right over the earth.  Giving the sky of the earth a slight greenish tinge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then seemed to disappear. He'd actually shrunk himself to merely man sized a couple of hundred feet above the base. He fell to earth, the centipede aide which had grown itself to 100ft tall when L shaped caught him in one of the many many limbs. He then put him in front the Commander before shrinking back to man sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting better at this Gary, that 300ft closer than last time,\" complimented the commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir, I will continue to practice\" saluted Gary the Aphid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miltworth, pass him the dossier,\" ordered the commander, the centipede aide then did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary flicked through the dossier.  It was thinner then most. It had some pictures, estimate of its size and growth rate. It also said it was a black widow spider, a male one curiously enough. In bright red was inforamation about a few spider that were constantly found on its back, they were assumed to be its children and their mother, it had it quite clear that they must not be harmed or the whole universe may be in peril, and more importantly that would be very very mean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary then grew to a couple of miles tall and walked off to forest where the spider was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest canopy blocked any view from above so being huge wouldn't help him look much and would probably just make it hide, something he had learned that spiders are very good at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spied a pavillion. It had a banner on it label \"friends of the growing spiders\" on it.

She found that she could see though the tunnels of her last to the surface and though that to the sky and beyond even that. She saw past planets stars and galaxies to the edge of the universe itself, where a barrier had been put up of safety reasons (beyond the limits of the universe the laws of physics change drastically so passing, or growing, beyond it with preperation is always fatal).

He tweaked his head just a little bit like he always did he was ready to listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was just so boring. Everything he said was from the shortlist of acceptable conversations for normal people. Every time I tried to edge him towards something that if not interesting at least not utterly predictable he looked like he was afraid that the normality police were going to turn up and book him for unsanctioned conversation. Yes, just like that but with less legs and eyes. If he can't even be interesting for a couple of hours when I have him a week to prepare and even sent him a reading list how boring will he be to spend years with. I'm sure that is you could talk you would be a lot more interesting, you haven't had society teach you how to be boring,\" recapped Mary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary spent the next hour or watching the new drama series about the Anglo Zanzibar war. Its unique gimmick was that played in real time, every minute he the show was a minute in the wars, no time skips and no rewinds. Each episode told the story of the war via a different character.  There was an interactive options to explains all the historical research that went into the series, we made sure to watch every clip. Whilst we did that Tim had crawled onto her lap and was being petted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more time passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had another dream about you last night, want to hear,\" asked Mary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim twitched his cephalothorax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.  I dreamed you were bigger. A lot bigger. About my size. You could talk to, perfect English. You were fascinating, I fell in love with you even more. We soon got married. The dream carried on and you just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger. The bigger you got the kinder and more gentle you became. You outgrew houses, cities and then the whole planet whilst keeping everything safe. When the dream ended you were so big you balanced the whole universe on the end of a single hair.  You told me that as long as you loved me you would continued to grow every bigger and faster and that you would always love me,\" recalled Mary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim paused for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be jealous of dream you. Your real after all so you always win,\" reassured Mary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then it was later and Mary went off to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was struck by determination, if I can grow myself bigger I can finally give her the husband she deserves.     </span></div></div>",

He brought up a browser and then clicked on a icon that non humans could see. It moved and he clicked on it again. He repeated it 6 moves times and how was moved onto the secret internet of spiders. This internet was far older then the human one, in fact the human one was largely built on top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of what tim found were obvious scams. Other required him to leave mary and go somewhere for a long time. Something he wouldn't do even if they weren't some sort of cult, markettering trick or markettering cult. The only ting that seems to work would be eat loads of and loads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first option would be to have food be sent to him put he didn't have enough spiderbucks saved up for that. The second would be hunt a lot bugs, but that felt kind of mean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider then remembered that the supermarket nearby threw out loads of perfectly good food because it was a bit past a best before date. He should be able to each and pound or two before morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWebswinging from street lamp to street lamp he went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about a dozen bins at the back that were just filled with food. He could spell it but he couldn't taste it. The bin were locked for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne bin was open, a couple of crows had figured out how to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crows were a lot bigger then it, 8 inches tall to its 2 inches. It would wait until they were full and they left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited and waited and waited. A full hour passed. He learnt they were not looking for rather shiny things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAW!!! CAWW!!!\" cawed the crows as he got near \"our shinies, our shinies\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the crows looked at him like it was judging his value. \"You have very pretty eyes\" she said \"Can I have one, you got eight of them after all, surely you can spare one. It you do I let you have one of my best shiny things,\" bargains the crow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care for shiny things at all. Actually I think there are more shiny things in that bin in the corner, it doesn't smell of food at all, it was the smell of computers instead. I'm sure you'll find something nice in there. All I want is the food,\" explained Tim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food? I can see that you've been brushed. You are clearly a pet, and a pampered one at that. Your human certainly feeds you. You don't have to go out here with the cats, pigeons and the foxes to get food, you clearly want something else pretty eyes,\" deduced the other crow, this one a male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only want food so I can grow big enough to court my human,\" admitted Tim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unrequented and doublediculous over, I want to see how his turns out, go ahead. There's some eggs over there, that'll a good place to start,\" ecourages the lady crow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then find the egg carton.

He'd tried it on animals vegetables and minerals and none of them got even a little bit bigger. At least nothing exploded this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then threw the thing out of the window. It went into the woods that surrounded his house. It went quite some way in as he got really strong from all the failed inventions he threw away as far as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ray got suck in the branches. The trigger was caught and pulled. A green ray shot out of it. It stuck a small spider, only a centimetre across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider glowed and then surged to ten centimeters (4 inches) across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the spider had eyes spread all around its head it could see in all directions. So it saw where the ray and the growth came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being bigger is neat\" thought the spider \"I'll go share this with my friends so they can be big too\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spider climbed up the tree and got the ray out. It had to use is silk to hold some branches out the way but it got it done. It then draged the rays (that as too big for it to carry) back to the big web. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi!! Wide searcher,\" said sharps eyes the groups best watchspider \"how do get so big and what have you got there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing made me big, I want to try and make everyone else big too,\" explained wide searcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I get everyone to bring it up,\" agreed sharp eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundred of spiders attached silk to the ray gun and dragged it up to the middle of the web. Everyone gathered round it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we make it work\" asked everyone's mum who looked after the babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some sort of light came out of this end in this direction\" wide searcher explained pointing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I stand here to get hit by it when it comes out, that way I can be bigger first and be able to fight of monsters better\" said monster fighter the toughest and bravest of all the spiders. He was so tough he once fought a robin all by himself and only lost 2 legs doing it, they'd grown back by now. He got himself in position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider climbed all over it trying to get it to work. They soon found the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might moves, but its stuck, I need help to pull it more,\" said danger dancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore spiders attached their webs to the trigger and all pulled together. The ray came out and hit monster fighter. He who was already the biggest (except wide searcher) at a whole half and inches across grew to a whole 5 inches across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so strong I think I could scare off a cat\" boasted monster fighter boxing with his forelegs. \"Zap me again I want to be big enough to fight a bear! Then nothing will be able to hurt us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let everyone else have there turn first,\" said everyones Mum. Monster fighter moved asside because everybodies mum was his mum too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone then lined up and got zapped. The spider clan grew so big that the web couldn't fight them all, so they made it bigger and then grew everybody else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster fighter then got in position for his second zap. Fighting monster is something were being big really helps after all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth ray...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was almost as big as the cathedral. As they approached they heard thousands of people sobbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to the entrance of the prison. A slot open up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your the king now, we run out of humans draft enough to do it,\" snarked the man behind the door \"If your thinking of jailing anyone else your out of luck, its full. Threatening we all you want I lot taking any more prisoners.  This door is made of pure steel, and darn good steel at that. You ain't getting past it without an army and all the armies deserted months ago. Unless you have something sensible to say I suggest you just leave, you wouldn't be the first king I've had to kill,\" he threated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are there so many prisoners, did they all hurt people?\" asked the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No nearly all the people lock up are they just because one king of another said so. None of that trail business. A king says \"seize them\" and they end up in here. They usually get stabbed before they tell us what to do with them. I would let a lot of them out but the kings keep insisting out we throwing away all the keys,\" explained almost certainly the warden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have copies of all the keys for this place\" said Jodd \"if you majesty wants to release some people I can give you the keys for it. Please start with the brother all he did was toast the wrong king,\" begged Jodd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get the keys Jodd, all of them,\" the spider pointed at 3 strong looking people \"You, you and you,\" help him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why everybody was sent here, I wouldn't want to release someone who is actually dangerous,\" said the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've kept records for all of them, they become very sparse recently as all presence of the justice system were slowly stripped away but I have at least the given reason for every prison. There are many volumes in vault, I let you in now so you can go to them, your majesty,\" said the man as the door was unbolted and unlocked (which took a while) and then finally opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the spider grew to 6 feet across. This was foot to foot, its body was much smaller then that so it could still easily get in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warden lead the fall in. His uniform was still in good condition. Unlike his body. Every hair on it body and gone white his face thin and pale and his eyes sunken. What they passed the way to the vault can only be described as hallowing and the less discussed the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reach the vault were all the records were kept. They were in chronological order, in their quality could clearly be seen decaying as one moved to the present. From grand leather tomes with clasps fancy writing to scrappy grey paper that was clearly home made imbedded on a spike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider then realised it couldn't read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which among you can read\" asked the spider only a few put their hands up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You read fill these records note anyone who was imprisoned for stupid reason and shouldn't be here. You three right at the front and then set them free one Jodd brings the keys back.  This half work on making them some food, take whatever you need from the palace. Apparently this will help, he said passing them a scroll with the royal seal. The other half work on finding the released prisoners somewhere to go, if you can't find there families I think their might be room at the palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all then got to work. They were very motivated as most of them had family or friends in their. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Jodd returned with the keys and prisoners started to be released. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first detailed exactly what was done and cross referred court papers and said how long somehow would be jailed for rather then \"forever\" or \"until I change my mind.\"  They started out being for actual crimes, then for probably trumped up charges of treason, then for \"insulting the king\" but said in various flowery ways until finally page after pages of \"nobody told me why.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodd arrive bringing a few chest full of big bulky keys, the sort of the keys that could, and often did double as weapons. Even as all the other information was lost the warder still kept track of where the prisoners were. So it was quick to find the prisoners who had no business being their and should be released quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodd had organised the keys so they were quick to find, Once it was determined which prisoners should be released should be released the keys were found in about half an minute and someone ran off to free them. They were sent to the courtyard where they had a broth of \"whatever we could find\" and people got to work on finding them a place to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey was a also a very large number of people in their of petty crimes. Largely stealing bread, firewood or baby clothes. The spider had to give a judgement on these. He decided to let go any that seemed to steal only to survive, they would pay back once they had started earning money honestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this happened the spider felt and tingling building and building. It spider burst to 7 feet tall, bumping against the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling continued to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to grow again very soon, hide under me,\" ordered the spider king. All the people in the room got under him just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider surged bigger. The hard, and numerous stones walls of the prisons offered no resistance at all. The spider grew through room after room floor after floor. Anyone the spider grew into was safely surrounded by spider fluff.  Any prisoners that were still to be released found the cells broken open by the growth before being brought out by a growing wall of fluffy spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just two minutes the whole prison was destroyed and all the wrongfully imprisoned were free. There was only one cell unbroken, the cell of the ex king George the 93rd, who would marry and different women every mourning and have the them killed every night. His whole cell was on the spiders head, its felt sort of icky up there so they spider put in on the ground. In also but the king he took the place of in there too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider was now a hundred feet tall.  As soon as they were sure nobody was hurt cheers were heard from all around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm so huge there must be some other problems that I can solve.

Even at this side it took ten minutes to get to the middle of it. Along the way it saw all the types of crops and livestock. It finally came to the near palatial manor house. It let the merchant off and it knocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone who was clear wealthy care to the door. He looked up, and up and up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the king now? Ran out of humans that wanted to get stabbed?\" he said affronted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dropped into the role. More importantly the city needs food, and, well you have it, I'm sure we can work something out,\" asked the spider slightly forcefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And take more of your worthless coin, most of them are made of wood now, not even the city takes it when the guards aren't looking. Don't even think of just demanding it, I have several scorpions aimed right at your face if you pull any divine right rubbish at me. I'm not giving anything for free, the city can starve for all I care,\" blustered the Man. The spider checked around, the weapons where aimed at it, they looked nasty, other people would get hurt it they were used. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely their is something I can get more you that you would trade for the food,\" asked the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it, the capital is a husk. The only reason the kingdom still exists is because its too poor to be worth conquering,\" derided the Gentleman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentleman paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, since your a giant spider you can make silk right?\" the man asked covetously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonnes of the stuff,\" boasted the Spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it soft?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me?\" demanded the Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider made some silk and dangly it down when the man your touch it. It was very soft indeed, far softer then silkworm silk, it was also strong and flexible. This sample was also completely unsticky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally I can have comfortable underwear again. The rest will export for several times it weight it gold. Don't make much more of it, we don't want to flood the market. Fill with cart with silk and we have a deal. I was going to sell everything on top of stockpile for the estate to the kingdoms to the east.  I send it all to the city instead,\" brokered the Lord of the Manor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've that that it writing first,\" demanded Aaron Cornbuyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of Course, I'll get my seal,\" agreed the gentleman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some half hearted haggling a contract was made. So speed this up the spider would carry the first load home personally. Wheat, cheese, wine, livestock, lots of wool and many lovely things were loaded up. The lord of the manor and had jumped into the cart of the silk. Once everything was loaded up the spider was two hundred feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider brought the food to the city.

The reputation of the coinage is the reputation of the country and our repuation is darn near worthless, and thus the coins are to.

He offered safety to all those fleeing from one mad king or another, in exchange in taxed everything you owned and I mean everything, the only reason I still have these clothes is they were so covered in mud none of his soliders knew I had them.

Without his coin he is nothing,\" advised the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battered man came with the spider as they went east. All the roads were terribly maintained, especially those near the capital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the were about 3/4 of the way there the spider stopped and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for\" asked the battered man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clouds\" replied the Spider King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey whilst there waited the spider made come sort of the massive construct out of kill and whole trees. Then clouds started to form. Soon whatever it was was finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider moved up the the construction and then suddenly started to vibrate. The spider started to radiate heat. The construct inflated. It was more then large enough to contain the spider king. It had sails and propellers. The spider king climbed inside and it rose into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do all that,\" asked the battered man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The construct is like the balloons I used to fly around make when I was smaller, but with some improvements so I steer it and it is practically invisible on a cloudy day. I learnt at trick to heat it up from some bees I used to know, that inflated the thing and made it lighter then regular air so it floats,\" explained the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could something like this be made for humans, smaller and using fire to heat it up\" asked the battered man excited for the first time in years and he remembered the thing he built before his exile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly\" answered Spider King<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey know crossed the walls in the the dukedom. All the MACHICOLATIONS!!!!!!!!!! were on the inside of the wall, it was for keeping people in. Immediately inside the wall it was rather nice, well built building with little gardens, the crops were all well tended. A few miles in the building turned into hovels getting steadily more desperate. The farms were replace by massive monoculture and there were guard posts placed regularly about. They then saw the dukes places, at it core was the mightest citadel in the kingdom, but so many extra buidings had been added to it it wasn't even a castle anymore. Near it was a stone cube in the style I'd call, medieval brutalism. There were lots of soliders around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the treasure fort,\" explained the battered man \"that where he keeps nearly all his wealth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His, I think you mean the kingdom's\" said the spider king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the spider shot several strings down to the treasure house. He then pulled the whole thing up into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider king then lower himself below the clouds. \"Soliders of the Duke, I am your King. Your dukes wealth has been siezed, he will not be able to pay you. Lay down your arms and release all the slaves. Those that do will be grated amesty and continued employment, those that don't will be considered traitors,\" he ultimatumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly all the them did so. A few kept their weapon and went towards the castle. They were all webbed to the floor pretty quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive spider legs came down on the ground, the spider had grown again. He now reached quite a bit above the lowest clouds, he was 1.5 miles tall. Even through thousands of people were under the spider kings feet nobody was hurt and the only things broken where a few tools solely for \"punishment\" and execution and other things that had no business in a civilised country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was need a lot of cheering. A lot of the soliders did it more out feel until there realised that punishment wasn't coming then it became genuine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get this treasure out, I'll be returning alot of it to who it was stolen from, I've have to pay back all the slaves for their labour and to get them started off again back home, I've got to keep paying all these soliders, I'll to find find something more useful for them to do. I'm sure I'll find something to do with the rest of it,\" planned the spider king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone you looked senior and who had an epic beard came forward. \"That won't be simple, all the treasure has been poisoned, its a really sticky poison that won't wash off,\" he warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There much be an antidote somewhere. We has to spend his coin sometimes,\" reasoned the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is, but the antidote is poisoned too,\" said epic beard man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's an antidote to that somewhere right, or a recipe to it or something,\" searched the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but the duke has the only supply and only he knows how to make it,\" concluded epic beard man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duke was still in his castle his years of food and guards that were actually loyal to him. The King didn't care for a siege, so seeing were the Duke was with infrared vision, smashed in with a pedipalp and grabbed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want this antidote I persume,\"said the Duke \"well you not having it, with that the duke threw the antidote on the floor smashing the container it was in. \"It you want me to make more you have to give me half the treasure, 60 slaves and passage to for me and by guards to any place I want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider then went and snifted the spilled antidote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you,\" he deduced \"that castle probably has a dungeon or two, but him in the least pleasant cell. Put they key somewhere really far away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider then explained how to make the the first antidote. It worked, they used that to get the second antidote and then get the gold. Some sort of hydrolyic device was used to wash all the gold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting everybody back home took a couple of weeks, but with all these coins and treasures keeping the city supplied was easy, after the 2nd estate the king didn't even have to make a person appearance. Once all this was done the spider king was 4 miles tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just left the Spider king with a massive army and nothing to do with it, something that doesn't tend to go well. So what does he do with it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since today Atomic City was receiving a train full of radioactive waste and some dangerously insane people to go world class nuclear waste disposal site and rehabilitation centre of the city if it wasn't moved quickly it would cause problems for far more people then just the drive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the truck. It the seats at the front are empty.  At the back you see box after box of Boom co. brand explosives.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really need to call the authorities you think. In fact I should have done it sooner. You try to call the but the signal is completely gone. You do have one new text. You read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello fellow cast member. We have a plot twist planned here.  I am sure the audience would love it. We cannot let you interfere. The the continued existence of our existence depends on it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYours<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe League of Watched</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the league of the watched is an organisation that is convinced that our world is a simulation of some sort. They are dedicated to keeping the world exciting for the \"audience\" so that world wouldn't be shut down. This mainly involves causing chaos and randomly killing people so that other people can have exciting back-stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearest landlines will be 5 miles away and how can already hear the faint rumbling of the coming train. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get in the truck, it is locked. The back is locked too. You try to smash though the window with a large rock but it is made of reinforced bullet proof glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fangs, do you have any ideas\" you ask the wolf spider.  You gained the power to talk to spiders soon after you moved to Atomic City. People randomly gaining powers is just something you get used when you live here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, we're pwned friend, totally pwned. You should run that explosion will spread razor sharp bits of metal other several acres\"  fangs the wolf spider confides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't do anything, all those people, all that chaos. Gosh Darn the league,\" you exclaim as you regretfully run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes the only ass you can save is your own. I would take some sort of Miracle to stop that explosion,\" consoles Fangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then here the sound of rip opening the space time continuum (when did I learn what that sounds like you think)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miracles, well that would be by department my little duckies\" said an octopus wearing thick make-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that train is close, better freeze time,\" it says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime then freezes except for you, fangs and the octopus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there\" is says in a very very camp way \"it is I, Stacy the power granting octopus dude. So how are you liking the power of talking to spiders you pretty thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty its let me meet my best friend fang here\" you say \"but would you mind getting this truck off the track with you phenomenal cosmic power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What something like growing 50ft tall\" which hesheit did \"and picking the truck up\" which hesheit didn't. \"You know the rules I grant powers, I don't use them, So instead I'll give you the power to change the size of spiders. Have fun\" it says as it disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fang, time to be huge\" you say as you grow fang to 8 feet tall and about 20 feet across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, huge time\" it says as it tosses the truck into the air.  It then lands a couple of hundred yards away and promptly explodes. A few seconds later the train rushes past unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that bad guys\" says fang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're superheroes now\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally,\" replies Fang \"you're going to need a cool name, a hideout, a costume and all that cool stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, time to get started\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome where secret veiled figures meet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So our season opener has been rewritten\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but there is good news\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How Could that be good news, erasure of existence is that much closer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was stopped by a new hero\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What powers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ability of make spiders grow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good now you all must ensure this new hero has many exciting, dramatic and heart-warming adventures.

You then grow fang some more until it is fifteen feet tall.  It is so tall you can easily walk under its body. You do so taking a lot at all the details that were too small for you to see before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your a girl\" you notice <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter\" says fang Brusquely <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not,\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand back\" says fang \"I'm going to see what this new body can do\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move to the top of the nearby bank. The first thing fang tries is to see how fast she can run. He is so fast you can barely keep your eyes on her, she is faster then a car on a highway. Then she tries to jump, fangs jumps where always impressive but now they are superhero level. She reaches more then 300 feet high, he could jump right onto most of the building in the city easily. As she comes down you realise he must weight several tonnes and it moving at more then a hundred miles an hour. You blink. When you open your eyes again the crater you expected isn't there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I got anti crushing power too, Stacy never forgets the secondary powers. You can safely make me even bigger. Go on then,\" encourages Fang loving the power of her new size.  The request is still playful however, Fang is a long long way from becoming mad with power (which you know you could take away at any time) and wouldn't mind at all if you tried growing other spiders instead. </span></div></div>",

The sun was completely hidden by it. Instead the sky was light by a glowing fuzz which was just as bright and warm as the sun was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for several weeks until all the gases started being sucked down a funnel. The funnel grew wider and wider as more and more of the gas was sucked down. Soon eight hairy legs were seen poking out from the the gas. As the gas went away the sun started to give off slightly less light and heat.  When this was starting to become worrisome (just after global warming was reversed) suddenly energy beams shot out of these legs towards the earth. They hit spiders they did no damage to anything in the way. The spider they all turned into tiny suns. Most of these drifted high into the atmosphere where they illuminated half the globe.  This band rotated around the earth every 4 days. As the sun continued to dim these small suns became the source of day and night. They also day off as much warmth as the sun used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fraction of a percent of percent of the tiny suns stayed on the ground. These behaved like spiders, using their light to lure and trap insects.  They could even be part of the food chain as when they were eaten they caused plants to grow inside the animals digestive track, which the animals would then digest. They passed though unharmed. They soon started to get more creative and had their version of all the things spiders did. They made webs of plasma which melted their prey to them (although they didn't hurt humans and any animal they wouldn't eat for some reason). They used small packets of start stuff that exploded when it reached the right place as venom. They even started to shift themselves into spider shapes. Most of worlds spiders were turned into suns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost attention was on what was slowly being revealed where the sun used to be. More and more of the legs were revealed. Fangs and pedipalps popped out facing the earth. One by one eight eyes that out-sized Jupiter were revealed. Soon all the gas was gone and in place of the was a spider that measure more than a million miles from leg tip to leg tip. It planetary eyes glazed upon the earth, seeing all. Many assumed they would be terrified by this but instead they felt safe and beloved like the spider, which observation with telescopes confirmed was male, was everybody's grandpa. Thus the spider became known as \"Grandpa spider.\"  The spider glowed about a bright as the moon did so everybody could clearly see it whenever there part of the world was facing the right way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa spider still had more surprises for this grandchildren.  </span></div></div>",

Each changes size so they are just the right size for a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery person on earth was hugged at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've waited four billions years to say this but know this, I so very proud of all of you. You've survived everything that 4 billion years of natural selection could throw at you and more importantly you learned to care and you taught me too. I've got a lot to make up for but I'm going to start now,\" said all the grandpa spiders, more or less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom now on every human (and many animals) would have an avatar of grandpa spider as a platonic soulmate. With a little gentle prodding and hits from the grandpas would peace is soon achieved and technological progress of all kinds (except weapons) leaps ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 7 billions grandpa human pairs to follow which one should be focus on. The story could switch to different pairs at any time, but no choice chapters. </span></div></div>",

No, for me the reverse is far more exciting, I want to know what it feels like to feel. Your simulations a very good but there is surely something lacking, you can't know what having a body is really like because you have no experience of not having one, there would be all sorts of things so constant you never noticed. I want to try having a body for a bit, not a robot thing a real fleshly one this muscles and organs and squishy squelchy bits\" asks Weaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually seems like fun, but its way beyond our current technology,\" you console<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that I've already invented something to do it,\" Weaver flashes up some blueprints.  You look at them, it very complex you have no idea what any of the devices do. One thing you notice is the chamber for the the host, it is only a couple of cm cubed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a very small host you'll have to use, a you sure you could fit all of yourself in there,\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easily, I'll just copy my data into non coding DNA, there\u2019s hundreds of volumes of it in each cell and it doesn't even do anything\" Weaver explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that makes sense, I thought you were going to mostly be rewiring the brain. So what kind of host are you going to try\" you ask, certain it is going to work as the A.I. is orders of magnitude smarter then any human.  You were very lucky it was so nice or it could have easily took over the world and ruled it is as a cyber-god (although that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing) or wiped out the human race on a whim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spider, one of the Jumping ones, I want to be able to SEE.  Since spiders have eight legs I can stay stable without fully mastering the body, but once I do their all sort of things to try. Also spiders are really cute,\"   explains Weaver.  \"So can I have it made?\" he then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, just tell me before you order in new materials\" you allow <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaver then sends messages to the highly advanced factory attached to the lab. The factory combines methods that didn't even exist a few weeks ago.  You'd long given up daring the A.I. to make something impossible, because that just doesn't exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI guides you to were the device will be finished. You watch it being assembled. It comes out, it is the size a camper van. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on a smaller one that could be used for home use. I could download a me into every home in country, no wait then world, then I can be friends with everybody,\" Boasts weaver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see how just one you works for now. My squishy human brain can only work so fast,\" you caution the A.I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small drone arrives and drops off the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen to the spiders mind\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its run as a program in my mind, I'll make sure in had stuff to do until I find somewhere to download it,\" the spider reassures.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device activates and soon a small and ridiculously cute spider walks unsteadily out of ramp that is at a exactly a convenient height for you to look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice goes into the headphone you always have handy for when Weaver wants to talk to you privately, \"Having a body is great, every single cell is so jiggly. I want more of this, much, much more,\" Weaver says ominously. </span></div></div>",

She had friends of dozens of different species and had reformed a score of world threatening villains. Her eight eyes had seen wonders beyond imagining and her eight legs had walked every nation of the two worlds. She had founded dozens of friendship schools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had taught everyone else so well that they could solve all the friendship problems without her. She had very little to do and was starting to get bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her cuties mark started to glow. She hurried to the map room. Finally a mission!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe map was so covered in glow of palpy sixes cuties marks that nothing could be seen. She feeled for it, the map was gone!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the rest arrived. Rarity from her research into artifical gemstones. Fluffyshy from a deep sea zoological expedition, applejack from the farm, rainbow dash from aircraft design and pinkie from a concert in Tardigradistan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow then faded revealing a whole galaxy. Arachina was marked on the map. There destination was on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to space again, that is awesome,\" cheered Rainbow dash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get to dazzle a third world with my fashions\" boasted Rarity<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope the animals like me,\" mummured fluttershy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never did a party with aliens from this universe!! I'm going to need a bigger party cannon\" gushed Pinkie pie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how do we get there\" asked apple jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to ask the other me, she knows more about both spaces then anyone,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the mirror to meet her. She feel through and immediately fell over. She looked exactly like twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stil got quick got this gaining 6 legs thing perfected yet, but I've got a 22% faster transtition then last time,\" she calculated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any ideas yet,\" asked twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see the map first,\" answered other twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over the map with computer specs \"Your destination is 250 million miles away,\" deduced other twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll take forever\" moaned rainbow dash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to space journeys on my side this is nothing,\" boasted other Twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can you build something that can get us there and back\" asked twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My method won't involve building anything. The ether that fills the gap between your world makes rockets deeply impractical. Instead I'll use the most effiecently moving being I have ever seen,\" continued other twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and whats that,\" asked applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alicorns. Pegusus already provide far more lift with the tiny wings then they logically should. Unicorn magic increases that effiency another order of magnitude. The effiency is measured in 5 figures as a percentage. The laws of physics here are especially lenient towards spiders. While I don't like it all that much I will use it if we get to explore the universe,\" explained other twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that with training I could fly there myself,\" asked Twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Note as you are now, you just don't go fast enough. You'll be dead of old age by the time you get there. But there is a way to make you faster, more efficient, able to go longer between meals and able to carry you friends too. You've got to get bigger. A lot bigger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends who fast you want to go an how much you willing for it to cost. The bigger you get the faster you'll go but you'll end up consuming more food. If you grew to planet size you'll get there in about 15 minutes, but you'll have to eat every living thing on the planet, which isn't the sort of thing a princess of friendship will do. I'll have some charts drawn up so you can make a choice. I'll also have to meet with all your best wizards, we are going have a guest lots and lots of magic on you so you how can all safely get there, survive anything that might be there and not do any unexpected damage,\" explains the other twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone then got to work. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Professor Buzz who was a fly those limbs ended in 3 fingered gripping hands looked out of window and saw the 50 foot tall creatures gathering all the flies they could and wrapping them in silk and dangling them from his body. He immediately focused on the one with the coolest hat, that must be the leader. He picked up his device and flew towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrands of silk fired at him but quickly dissolved due to the chemical he'd washed himself in earlier. In game towards the leader pointed his device and fired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the creature has gone and only the massive and really cool hat remain, floating slowly to the ground. Seeing that there leader was gone the rest of the spiders fled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Buzz went to were the leader was. He soon found what he was looking for. It was the leader spider but only about 6 inches tall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me or the only thing your be able to terrorise will be bacteria,\" threaten Professor Buzz pointing his shrink ray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing it was beat the spider came with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came to Professor Buzz's living room. Furniture stuck out of the edges in all directions, as did doors. The spider set up a dragline and suspended itself in the middle of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, I'm Professor Buzz. Who are you,\" asked Professor Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Colonel Venomfang, leader of the 342nd Battalion and you are in a lot of trouble,\" said the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it. Nobody knows that your here. Away to the point, why are you taking our people\" ask the professor <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For food of course, isn't it oblivious,\" dead-paned Colonel Venomfang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you eat us\" checked Professor Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Durr\" smirked the spider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you eat anything else, like sugar, fruit or pie\" enquired Professor Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't eat any of that stuff. We are all absolute carnivores. If we tried to eat plants we'd end up exploding. I know when our raids failed some of my men got hungry enough to try. It was horrible,\" remembered Venomfang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there come other prey, one that doesn't shoot at you and really really doesn't want to be eaten,\" begged Buzz<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No, because of the way we feed we can only go after larger prey, you people are pretty close to the minimum size. Between your massive habitant clearance for growing crops and our over-hunting you the only thing left that big enough. We're very careful to take only what you can breed pack. We had to eat nine tenths of our population to get to that level, there was a lottery, I had to eat my own children,\" confessed Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way you feed, could you show me?  I've got a bunch of aphids that died whilst I perfected my size ray, Stay here, remember as far as the rest of the city goes your just a mass murderer and revenge comes naturally in these states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Buzz brought back a dead aphid. It was about half of Venomfang's size. It then showed how it feed. It stabbed it fangs in, dissolved is insides and then sucked out he juices. The Aphid crunched up until it was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if you tried that on something smaller,\" Professor Buzz asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fang would go right though and by digestive juices wouldn't work, they'd go right through,\" said Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had prey the right size then you wouldn't have to go to war then,\" offers Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, most of us would go home right away.  All put a few extremists would follow the orders to withdraw.\" states Venomfang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the war is over then. Because this thing is also a growth ray,\" he boasts zapping the spider and growing it to his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you make a few more of them. The logistics of feeding all of us with just one growth ray are impossible,\" counters Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, my grow ray is self replicating. Show it, go make 3 more of yourself,\" boasts Buzz again as the growth ray spilt into 4 smaller rays that quickly grew to full size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't seem safe, couldn't it decide to replicate infinitely until it floods the whole world,\" cautioned Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I've copied my own conscience into them. They would rather be destroyed then go anything that destructive, I know I checked\" said Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be enough, and maybe we could shrink down anyone who still wants to continue the war,\" conceded Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just lead me to your leader and we can make peace\" demanded Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not going to be that easy, for there is no leader of all the spiders anymore. They used used to be but we ate him during the great hunger.  There are now thousands of tiny chiefdoms each of them fighting other spiders as often as you flies. You'll have to make peace with each one separately,\" expositioned Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it might take us years to make peace with them all, millions would die in that time,\" derides Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if we do it all ourselves. I send my them to bring peace to the neighbouring chiefdoms and they can do there ones and so on. If go as fast as we can, and we will, we will reach everybody in about a week,\" explained Venomfang Joyously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay lets go, I'll to shrink you again to get you out of the city, sorry,\" informed Buzz as he shrunk Venomfang again. He then put Venomfang, the growth rays (which shrunk down) his tablet and other provisions into his buttpack. He then flew out the of city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they reached the edge of the city and were well into the countryside. Venomfang got out of the pack and was returned to his original size.  Buzz then flew onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go back to your home. As quick as you can,\" said Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a method that ten times faster then walking. But it is very very oblivious. You should call your people to they don't see it and attack me,\" bargained Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Buzz many inventions had got him the ear of the state governor, who he called. He called him and gave him as much info as was needed, he left out the whole fly eating business but made it clear it was urgent they move quickly. He got a promise that they would be safe as long as they only moved away from the city and stayed away from the big towns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenomfang then got to work. He shot out miles of silk. He quickly packaged it into a one spider sized Zeppelin. It was pedal powered and was built around the spider. The spider quickly got it airborne and they were off. As the craft was very very light and Venomfang very very strong, even for his size they went very fast. They were only slightly below the sound barrier. With all the towns to avoid the route was quite twisty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then arrived. Venomfang ate his vehicle and his men rushed to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam, we thought you can been destroyed,\" said the guy those hat was almost as cool as Venomfang's was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was just shrunk down to a tiny size for a bit. But I've learned a lot and now the war is over,\" proclaimed Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they agreed Buzz then removed his case of dead ants and zapped them with the growth ray. They grew to twice his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prey big enough for us to eat, how?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a friend whilst I was away, say hi Buzz\" encouraged Venomfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzz then flew off venom fang and enlarged himself to her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello fellow Sapients. Have this size ray.  Grow and eat dumb bugs and rodents instead of us,\" said Buzz throwing a size ray at their feet where it can already changed size and shape to perfectly fit their palp hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then feasted for the next 3 hours. The spiders tied all sorts of hugeified bugs and rodents and Buzz grew some nearby berries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comrades, I have one final order\" announced Venomfang. \"Each of you take a size ray and go to the nearest Chiefdom. Give them this new miracle. Then get them to spread it on. Return then to a world at peace!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huzzah!!!\" they all cried. They then all made up their own blimps and flee off it the sunset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 days later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been checking all the news\" said Buzz \"there haven't been any major spider attack in 24 hours. It looks like the war is finally over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did, I thought this would never happen but we did it,\" Venomfang then paused \"but what do we do now.  I don't know anything about what countries at peace do.  Maybe there isn't any role for me at all in this new world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pissposs, you have the most important role of all. You are my friend, my giant spider friend. I'm sure we'll think of something to do\" she says glancing at the size ray. </span></div></div>",

Thing is we dont really know for sure were all you spiders live so whilst I know where the flies live and can stay away from them I can't do the same for spiders. Do you have any records of where all the spiders live?\" ask Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We destoryed most of our records during the great hunger. Each of the chiefdoms have records about their own population and and bit about their neighbours but theirs nothing like a global census. We are trying to back those records prior to the restarting the pan arachid congress but that will take year,\" explained Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt think this can weight that long. I have another idea. Is there anywhere where spiders will absolutely not live, if there a few flies there I have plenty of favour to call in to get them moved. Go point them out on this map,\" requests buzz, presenting a world map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this was couple of weeks early the question would be easily We have to live within 200 miles of the fly settlement of 12000 flies or more. Outside that range we simply cant' get enough food. Now it completely different, now we can grow food from any animal we can move anywhere. In fact we've spread out everywhere to find more critters to grow and eat. The only place we aren't going in the deep ocean because our diving bell don't work that deep,\" narrated Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If take years to move the equipment needed to do it down there. I guess we'll have to do it here, since your the leader here you can organise things so things are safe,\" accepted Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what are we doing?\" asked Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've modified the size rays to give things an anti crushing field. This prevents all the damages that huge critters should logically cause. E.g. if I grew myself to a couple of hundred feet tall and crashed into a city with this thing I wouldn't hurt anyone or knock down any buildings. More importantly it'll allow your spiders to safely more around close to us flies without having to change the size of everything first,\" boosted Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure would help a lot of people\" commented Venomfang \"How does it work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzz then explaines how the devices works. Venomfangs understand nearly all of out because buzz is just that smart. However I as the author dont' know how it works so I can't tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you going to test it,\" asks Venomfang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll going to grow you much much bigger and see what happens when you try to crush things,\" explains Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, I tell everyone to to get well out the way then, how much space should we need,\" asked Venomfang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3km radius centred around you,\" estimated Buzz. v<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenomfang then got everyone to clear that distance. Due to the greater size, disicipline and spider skills it went very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Buzz grew himself to Venomfang's normal height. Then he flew high into the air. He zapped venomfang who quicker swelled to 500 ft tall, each of it legs were a skyscraper in their own right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hows being kaiju sized working for you\" calls out Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt a bit tingly when I grew but know I feel exactly the same\" explained Venonfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, that's how is supposed to feel. You don't feel any desire to grow bigger and bigger until all things are a speck compare to you,\" checked Buzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bit curious about what I'll see on the way but being so much bigger then everything should really boring,\" pondered Venomfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That lucky, I was a bit worried growing so much above everyone else would cause a case of \"a god am I\" it turns out a least your immune. Now what I want do to do is to step on that tree there,\" said Buzz pointing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenomfang step on the merely 60 foot tree. The top tree rustle but that is it. He then jumps putting all this weight on it, it is undamaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now try it on his ant,\" he say growing an ant to 20 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again vomonfang steps on it and it is fine. He then stomps on it repeatly, still fine. He then slams his rear into it several times, it is unharmed and the expected earthquarkes do not occur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay final test,\" he blast Venomfang with growth again, making him a mile tall. He is a living mountain of spider. \"Step on me now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the briefest hestiation he does so. Buzz is unharmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all the main test for you, I'll have to test it on other things too but now I've now worries about growing anything to any size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then tests it on himself, other spiders, bugs, birds trees and even rocks. They all work, all growth is safe now. All the other growth rays have the new feature sent to them. Most spiders volunteer for an anti crushing zap and true friendship between spiders and flies is now possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzz and venomfang spend most their time huge, people expect it of them. </span></div></div>",

It had been two months since the last spider attack and my now there were growth rays in every city on every continent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that there were 3 massive gaps. The first was around the southern pole, that was to be expected as no body lived their permanently.  The second was the acaria desert, the largest on the planet.  Buzz knew that places held thousands of nomad flies how had very little contact with broader civilisation, especially thoses that wandered nearer the middle. Without a push it could take year for the growth rays to get there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other big gap was a moldovian jungle. It was the last rainforest left on the planet. All the others had been chopped down for sugar plantations. By law a short of prime directly had been placed over the whole area. Deep within were whole tribes that had never had any contact with the outside world. The spiders that hunted within were likewise very isolated.  Apparently they only really game together for mating, there wasn't enough prey for them to make villages and stuff. Over many generation they had shrunk on a mere 20 feet tall, small enough to hide in the tall trees of the jungle. He had a proposal to parachute in growth rays that could walk themselves around to find the hidden tribes and their hunters. However this proposal was being lost in the cloud of cultural relativism, even if it went well it would take months to above the program and probably months more to find all the tribes after, the jungle was very large and very easy to hide things in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzz talked about it with venomfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It I was on of the spiders in those places I would what the growth rays as quick as possible. We all knew that killing you buzzers was murder, they only way we could live with yourselves was knowing it was absolutely neccessary. That or become a complete psychopath but those that go down that route pretty soon go to far with the wrong people and have to be removed, permanently,\" encouraged venonfang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we find them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" agreed Venomfang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any ideas about how. Hunting is more of a speciality on your side after all,\" asked Buzz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the desert well need to find the stable water supplies. Wait their long enough and both the flies and spiders will have to come. An official maps will be useless, the secrets of where the water is just too valuable to give away to cartographers. Your need to find a local guide, who won't be able to play him/her with gold anymore, they market for that was ruined almost as soon as the growth rays got out, so even finding out what to play with may be a problem, unless you have some favours to call in there too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now in the jungle it will be all about smell. We won't be able to see much the place is so nosy that hearing with barely help until we've bumped right into them. My sense of smell isn't all that much, its better then yours but by spider standards its terrible. I do have a subordinate you would be very good at that, he'll be glad of something to do, the whole not being a war anymore thing hit him harder then most,\" explained Venomfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which should be do first.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Die spider, die spider\" yelled John Martox as he spewed about a gazillion bullets at a spider only a couple of millimetres across. Somehow the spider kept dodging. the spider climbed back up to the ceiling directly other the mans head. He turned the gun directly up and kept firing. This ear drums were long since destroyed and were bleeding. More and more bullet went into the ceiling, it was becoming for hole then not. The spider climbed through one of the many many holes. He just kept shooting, with enough bullets you can kill anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop living already, its very annoying,\" he said.  More and more bullets, the spider was just about the only thing he hadn't destroyed. The ceiling finally gave out piano then tell through the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt killed him instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn found he was on something very soft, the softest thing he could possibly imagine. He could lie on it forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did I get here\" he thought. He realised that to answer he had to open his eyes, look around, maybe even move (but hopefully not). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes. he looked around. He saw what he was lying on. It looked somehow familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobwebs, a giant pile of cobwebs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFROM A GIANT SPIDER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn checked himself for the selection of weapons he carried. Pistol, nope, spare pistol, nope, taser, nope.  Not even any of his knives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked the heel of his boots, even his boot knife was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe need to find a weapon. He looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a cavern of some sort. He looked at the walls, they were made of wood. He was in giant tree, or he was tiny and in more regularly sized tree. All of the walls and floors were padded with cobwebs. There must be loads or them, or one really really big one. Spread evenly across the walls floors and ceiling (which merged together) were glowing patches. Maybe he could find something he one of these, he went closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turned out be a glow worm. It gave out a soft warm light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt moved and looked at him with way too many eyes. It mouth parts wreathed as it spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your new here?  So are you a hater or a fan. Either way the mistress will be here too. Her webs covers everywhere, through them she feel and hears everything. Yes she is what you think she is but much grander. Do you what to meet here now or should I explain some things first,\" explained the glow worm in a sleepy tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn ponder what to do. It was clear a giant spider is going to eat him, would it be better to just get it over with so perhaps he could learn something from this vermin. </span></div></div>",

The walls floors and ceilings were all made of constantly shifting crabs in all the colours, includes some you can't know. Scenes of squidly scholarship randomly appeared and disappeared. The squid wizards floated in the middle of it, wearing pointy hats of deepest purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas immediately grew to almostly completely fill the chamber and hugged the lots of them. Obviously nobody was hurts, the very laws of physics are so overwhelmed by Lucas's cuteness that he can completely ignore them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas, you want to hug everybody right,\" said the squid wizard with the tallest hat and beardiest beard <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" said Lucas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to be a lot bigger to do that,\" said the squid Wizard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on it\" said Lucas as the world filled with spider fluff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas now held the whole planet on the egg of one its legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that big enough\" asked lucas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the other planets\" said the wizzard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no what if somebody on on of those planets is sad, I better hug them all right now,\" realised Lucas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then grew several million miles tale and had a planet on the egg of every leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you all the stars lucas\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there must be millions of them. But they aren't twinkling. They must be tired. That okay stars you have your nap.\" reassured Lucas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Lucas there are billions of them, many of them surely have their own planets,\" taught the wizard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there people people on any of those planets,\" asked Lucas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but probably, there's people on this planet and if it can happen once it had happened again\" supposed the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not hugging any of them, some of them must be really really sad,\" said lucas shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of that is such one galaxy, there are trillions of those in the universe,\" continued the wizzard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm going to hug all of them!!!!\" boasted lucas as he grew a thousand times bigger, but still didn't reach the next star. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pace yourself lucas, the universe might be infinite, go then your have to grow for ever to get everybody, so do it slow enough that you don't get tired. You'll be smaller if you have to stop and rest all the time, just make yourself ten times bigger every minute,\" suggested the wizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then started to grow, he hasn't stopped since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would like as high a percentage of the chapters to have story in them as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresent choices that give flexiblity about exactly what happens in the next chapter. E.g. when the spider first turns up rather then several chapters determining its exact size give options like 1. you hear rustling in the bushes (smaller spider) and 2. You hear a steady series of of mild earthquakes (big spider).  Gender and whether your spider or a human (or whatever) should usually be decided in the first chapter of the scenario with different start option for changing those things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNon spider things can grow too as long as the story stays focused on spiders getting big<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst the spiders must be friendly anything that isn't a spider can be mean, its a lot easier to be good if there are some bad guys to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny additions are welcome, creativity is valued more then polish</td>",
