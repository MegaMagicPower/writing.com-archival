Singularity or just a servant messing with you, you've seen it all. Or so you thought. Waking up you notice that your surroundings have changed. No, perhaps it is more accurate that you've changed. \"Why am I so small!\" You yell out in bewilderment. You try to telepathically talk to your demi-servant Mashu, but there is no response. Matter of fact it's as if there's no connection at all. You take a look at your hand and instantly feel even more annoyed than before. Your command seals are missing. This means you can't summon a servant to aid you. Releasing a sigh you say \"Getting scared isn't gonna do anything, I've got to find a way to get help.\" Pausing for a second you add on \"and not get hurt or worse by anyone.\" What should be your first plan of action?</span></div></div>",

Besides, My room gets a lot of traffic and it's only a matter of time before someone comes in here.\" You sit down in your bed and wait patiently. That is until a thought enters your mind \"Man, I hope they see me when they come in. I ought to head over to my desk where I'm easier to see. Getting up, you head to the edge of your bed. There is gap between the desk and your bed, Looking at it for a moment and  doing a couple of test jumps you, decide that you can make it.

Oh well at least I made it.\" <br>\r\n        <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust then you hear your door opening and see a servant entering your room. \"Yes, Over here!\" you yell, jumping up and waving your arms around to get the attention of_________<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"></font></span></div></div>",

She quickly made her way over to the desk where he was and picked him up. \"Master, how did you end up like this?\" You respond to her \"I don't know. I just woke up and found myself like this. Atalanta do you still feel the connection to me? I don't have any seals and can't communicate telepathically to anyone.\" Atalanta processed this and replied \"That's weird, but I still feel the Master Servant connection.\" Things are quiet for moment before Atalanta gains a teasing look in her eye and a light smirk. \"You know, I always used to say don't get close to me. You remember what I said I'd do?\" Atalanta says with that same smirk. \"Uh, you said you'd bite me, but you wouldn't do that now would you, right.?\" you say with a very nervous giggle \"Oh, I wasn't <i>going</i> to, but now that you mention it.\" Atalanta brings your small form upward and toward her mouth. She tilts her head back and opens her mouth, Her breath washes over you and you peer into her wide maw. Her menacing, pearly white fangs drift closer as she lowers you closer to her mouth and her wet tongue extends as if inviting you. You're too petrified to do anything as your feet just barely reach past her lips. Then she yanks you back and she releases a giggle. \"Heh, just kidding Master.I'm not going to do anything bad to you\" Your fear quickly vanishes and is replaced with relief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you had me for a moment Nyanta, good one\" You nervously laugh. \"What did you just call me\" Atalanta Alter says with a cold look and serious tone. \"Oh shoot, I'm sorry Nyant- AH, I'm sorry I mean Atalanta. I know you hate that name, but can you let me off the hook. You say pleadingly. \"Not this time, <i>Master</i>\" Atalanta looks at you with a terrifyingly cold stare before she says \"I take back what I said. I AM going to do something bad to you, More precisely I'm going to ________.\"</span></div></div>",
