All-purpose weapons, auto rifles are magazine-fed weapons that, as their name suggests, automatically removes the spent cartridge case, cocks the rifle, loads a new cartridge, and fires again repeatedly as long as the trigger is held down, or until the magazine is exhausted. Auto rifles are distinguished from scout and pulse rifles in their ability to fire constantly once the trigger is pulled without the need for special perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hand cannons:</b><br>\r\nHand cannons are a type of pistol used in Destiny. They reward calm technique and sharp shooting. In addition, their abnormally high impact provides them unparalleled stopping power, making them capable of staggering or killing most low-level enemies in one shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Scout rifle:</b><br>\r\nA scout rifle is a class of primary weapon featured in Destiny and Destiny 2. Scout rifles are semi-automatic precision weapons that fire one round every time the trigger is pulled, considering the magazine is not spent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Shotguns:</b><br>\r\nThey are time-honored holdout weapons that are quite common and known for their reliability. Their sturdy frame can accommodate a variety of attachments and accessories.<br>\r\nShotguns are only effective at close range with the exception of both The Chaperone and Universal Remote. At maximum range their damage output is 20% lower than at closer ranges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sniper rifles:</b><br>\r\n are a type of weapon in Destiny and Destiny 2. They are long-range marksman weapons meant for picking off important enemies at a far distance with powerful headshots. However, there are only a select few snipers that can kill a Guardian's super with full health in one shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are the most common weapons in this universe, but we got Fusion rifles, sidearms, rocket launchers, trace rifles, swords and bows. and granades are generated by the light of the traveler. Your ghost helps you with minor things as well, also wields the light.</span></div></div>",

Skills and cunning is as much powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessus. You, unknown human, lightbearer? no. Scavanger, yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up next to a pool of white and glowing liquid. The plants around you are a vibrant red. You jolt in shock as you take in the environment, your hand dips into the pool and you begin to feel a sharp stinging pain. You jolt again and crawl your away from the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and think about how you got here, but the only thing you seem to remember is your name. You strain yourself trying to think of your past, but end up with nothing. The only memory you seem to have is a deep and gravely voice followed by a mechanical beeping. You hear words, yet you can't make out a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and find that you are wearing a raggy hood and what some firm pads. Wrapped around your waist is a purple and white cloth with a gold stripe running through it. You find a holster on the belt this cloth is attached to. In the holster is a bulky revolver. It has a golden hammer, trigger, and iron sight, the rest is decorated with scratchy white paint revealing black underneath. The grip feels nice in your hand. As you hold the gun memories flood into you. You suddenly feel like you could take the gun apart and rebuild it with ease. You are also entirely sure that you are quite the marksman. Though, even thinking back to these memories you can only seem to grasp the knowledge and skills they contain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander the planet aimlessly, your muscles ache and your stomach growls. As you come over a hill you see what appears to be a battlefield. It is covered with spider-like beings and brown robots. A massive golden ship hovers nearby. You are once again overwhelmed with knowledge. You learn that what you see is a battle between a race of networked intelligences known as the vex and another race called the fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide it would be best to wait this out and come back to scavenge around for something that might come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually as you look down over the battle, you see three beams of white light appear. From the light three humanoid figures materialize. They are clad in armor and their faces are entirely covered. The one of them that stands in the front has bulky armor and a cloth that drapes over his right leg with a lion on it. There is one of them that begins running along to the outskirts of the battlefield. They wear lighter and clearly more flexible, but softer armor. Resembling your own pads, they have a cape coming from their hood. The last one travels closely behind the bulky one. They have a mix between bulky armor and robes, a glowing band is wrapped around one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them work together to easily wipe the battlefield of both the Vex and the Fallen, it was incredible. The one with the cape looks up at you for a moment, then back to his teammates. He outstretches a hand and with a similar light a small machine materializes and floats over his hand. Then just as quickly as they had arrived, they vanished with the same white light.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had also stolen some tech off of the vex that you would spend much of your time studying while you were tired or bored. You often found yourself thinking back to the three super soldier like beings that you watched plow that battlefield and how they appeared and vanished so suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to wander the planet each day feeling more and more dreadful as you've only been eating scraps from left behind fallen campsites. You started to think that this would become your life until you either starve, get shot, or explore every inch of the planet. You walk your way through a tunnel to find a massive field of scrap metal and parts. The fallen were having quite a time stealing what they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your best to sneak past these fallen, but eventually had to resort to using your revolver, which you now lovingly call The Deal Breaker. You look over the horizon past all of this scorched metal and see a what looks like a massive, but broken shuttle. You run your way inside and wander around. More fallen are scavenging parts from inside, you blast the ones you can see. You take note of the location relative to various landmarks, one day you would have to come back and take some of this stuff for yourself, but as of right now, you were too exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to wander around the dark inside of the ship, blasting fallen who try and fight you. Suddenly the part of the ship your in seems to come to life. Radio static begins to fill your ears before the voice you swear you hear when you think back on your past informs you of the communication device in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello~?\" An almost robotic female voice breaks the static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" You mutter in a questioning tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" The voice says in an enthusiastic and excited manner. \"It has been a long time since anyone has actually come aboard the Exodus Black!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is-\" You start, but are interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Exodus Black-\" Her voice changes to more somber, sarcastic tone. \"Where all your dreams come true...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who-\" You are interrupted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for tending to the fallen! Her voice is enthusiastic again. \"They have been scavenging through parts and circuits inside the walls, and honestly-\" Her voice changes once more. \"It really hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I can try to help with that.\" You say, spinning The Deal Breaker on your finger. \"Who are you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Failsafe! A.I of the Exodus Black!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Failsafe. How should I go about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a few simple things you can do. Here come to my core, I'll send your gh- Oh! You are not a guardian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A guardian?\" You mumble to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will lead you to my core so that you can get rid of these fallen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the instructions provided by Failsafe, and fight hard to clear the ship of the fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand, leaning against a wall near the entrance to the room containing her core, your arms are hanging limp as you pant to get your breathe back when a person enters. They wear bulky red and white armor covered in depictions if a dual headed phoenix, a long and tattered cloth with a matching mark is draped around her waist. Their hips and bust are certainly bulkier than the other person in similar armor you saw clear the battlefield. Their figure seems vaguely female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA floating machine rotates and stares at the armored person, who looks back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello guardian!\" Failsafe says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Failsafe, where are the fallen?\" A calm slightly accented male voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see ghost, and guardian. This man took care of the problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian and their ghost look at you then to each other. \"Who exactly is he?\" The male voice says. You figure it comes from the ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure! Who are you, my hero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John.\" You wheeze. \"Doe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian puts their hands on their hips and leans in, even though you can't see through the dome helmet they wear, you are sure they are looking you up and down. The ghost flies up close and seems to examines you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Aren't a guardian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian nods. Then leaves.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, you have not left the Exodus Black since you found it. You believe you started to grow a good relationship with schizophrenic A.I Failsafe. The more time you spend on the Exodus Black, the more you wonder why these guardians have yet to try and fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow after a long day you lie down on your mat and begin trying to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? There is a guardian who wishes to see you.\" Failsafe informs you. \"I believe it is the same female titan you encountered before.\" Her voice fills with disdain. \"Great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as you stand. You make your way to the guardian who waves at you as you approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan's ghost materializes. \"Ath- My guardian would like to know if you need anything done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a second. \"Well it would be nice if I could get some security while I sleep... All I have now is Failsafe screaming at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost looks at the titan. \"We could do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really isn't anything you guys should worry about... I'm sure you guardians have better things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ath- My guardian insists. She claims it is the least she could do as you completed her mission before she even arrived... She expects nothing in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have fun.\" You make your way back to your mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to drift to sleep the voice of the ghost pries you from your rest. \"Athena, you can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a female's voice, but it was too quiet for you to hear, muffled too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a guardian, Athena.\" The ghost firmly states. \"Besides, all he did was fend off some fallen! It couldn't have been that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys talking about?\" Failsafe playfully chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan drops her weapon in her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-it was nothing!\" The ghost cracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checking probabilities... You are not telling the truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I have determined based off of the content, context, and manner of their conversation that that titan is somewhat attracted to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and ignore Failsafe, but you couldn't help a cocky grin from appearing on your face. Somehow, you have managed to win over the attraction of a guardian. You don't even really know what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to drift to sleep again. You dreamt of the titan removing her helmet. It looped in your mind. Each time a different face with different hair would appear. This lasted quite a while before you woke up to the sound of gunshots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wrong! It certainly is that bad!\" You hear the ghost shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up and see you are inside of a large purple bubble. The titan laying waste to fallen outside of the bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and reach for The Deal Breaker. You step outside of the bubble and walk up beside the titan. They look at you, then back to the swarm of fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you sleep through so much of this?\" The ghost asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you handle all of this? You aren't even a guardian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gesture to The Deal Breaker. \"This gets the job done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all you're equipped with?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan drops a magazine out of her rifle and places a barrier of energy in front of the two of you. You step around the barrier and begin to drop fallen, each shot you land is one to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the titan's speed has dropped significantly. You look back to see she was staring at you, she quickly returns her focus and reloads the weapon. She then steps through the barrier and begins to once again lay waste to the fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the fallen stop their push and exit the Exodus Black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like they are only after the core.\" The ghost says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is almost as if all of the important stuff outside has been stolen!\" Failsafe interjects. \"Or moves here by John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again drawing a grumble from the ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so good with a hand cannon?\" The titan asks with amazement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of practice I suppose.\" You shrug, honestly unsure of where the skill came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that anyway?\" The titan asks pointing to your The Deal Breaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spin in on your finger, thinking of a proper response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know. I found it some time ago. I've found myself calling it The Deal Breaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan looks towards her ghost. Suddenly a clump of materials materialize in her hands. Knowledge fills you as to these items origin and usage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches them out to you. \"I was thinking we could trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't have anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe materials disappear. \"That's too bad.\" The titan folds her arms. \"There anything else you need done around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We expect a reward this time.\" The ghost lets out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan lifts her arms, offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't. It just seems like you need help around here.\" She tilts her head in a way that allows you to know she has a smile under that helmet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I heard it while I was drifting in and out of my sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need us to do?\" The ghost asks in an agitated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" You chuckle for a moment considering your audience. \"If you would be so kind as to bring me a dead ghost-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" The ghost declares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena looks at him. \"Let him finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to study the technology of a ghost. I believe that I can fix Failsafe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You believe what?\" Failsafe chimes. \"You aren't very funny.\" Her tone somber, then changing back to normal. \"The vanguard has tried several times to fix me. How could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for me to find out.\" You fold your arms. \"That's why I want a dead ghost.\" You chuckle again. \"Not like you're going to use them for anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've already told you.

If I can figure it out, based off of the parts of the Exodus Black that I've already researched, I should be able to put you into the ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You plan to turn me into a ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, not even when focusing all of my processing power to scan a ghost can I understand the technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope, for you, that I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color of the light from her core turns a pinkish color, then to a blue. When she speaks her voice is somber. \"If you do not succeed to put me into the ghost, will you leave the Exodus Black?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"Nah. I have no intention of leaving without taking you with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe core light turns pink. Her voice cheery. \"You will not leave me?

I am unable to understand the technology of a ghost, even when using all of my processing power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to dismantle a few of the parts you have been unable to identify. Now with an unprotected view of their inner workings you begin absorb their functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating...\" Athena's ghost cracks. \"In such little time you claim to be able to understand the processes within this shell...\" It flies closer to your hands. \"You do appear to know what you're handling as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back from the table. \"Ghost, you said this was a scavenger shell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ever extract what it was holding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not aware.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One way to find out.\" You press hard against a small coil like piece of the shell... Nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened.\" The ghost flies over to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it.\" You hunch over the shell and rotate it, focusing only on the coil. \"That should have released the load.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it is because you do not hold the light that the ghosts and guardians hold.\" Failsafe suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be it.\" The ghost admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena press on this piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps into your position. \"This one?\" She points, you nod. She presses it in and in that instant a large pile of a glowing blue substance materializes from the broken lense of the shell. Along with it several plant like materials that you have never seen on this planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at all that glimmer.\" The ghost floats around. \"That's a whole lot more than I can even think to hold.\" It looks to you. \"You really can understand the technology within a ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean you are ready to transfer me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet Failsafe, I still haven't found the ghosts brain.\" You continue to take apart parts that only get smaller and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena, we should take him back to the tower.\" The ghost returns to Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even Master Rahool was able to comprehend even the simplest processes of a ghost. In less than twenty-four hours John has managed to release the locked load of a scavenger ghost's shell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even Rahool-\" Athena pauses, and stutters. \"That's amazing!\" She bounces excitedly. \"We need to take you back to the tower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John is not leaving until I am put inside of the ghost. He said so himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena looks to her ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really might do it.\" The ghost looks to Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally come across a small node on a small panel in the shell. You pick up the shell and run to Failsafe's core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready Failsafe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to opening a panel on Failsafe's core and reach inside. You pull out a long wire and attach it to the node. Any of the lights in the Exodus Black that were on turn off. The color of Failsafe's core light turns to a simple white. Another panel opens to reveal a keyboard and a small monitor. A simple window is open which reads. \"Proceed with transfer of Exodus Black artificial intelligence Failsafe.\" You readily hit enter to proceed. A progress bar appears on the monitor and Failsafe's core light turns off. The bar very slowly fills. When the bar fills completely the monitor reads \"Success\" before turning off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou promptly put all of the parts to took apart back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we turn her back on?\" The ghost asks, now hovering close to your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove the lense of the ghost and look at the burned power cells within. You mend the cells with parts from the Exodus Black and replace the lense with part of the monitor's screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new lense you created quickly flashes a stream of scrolling red text that was too quick for you to read before a part in the circuitry of the ghost sparks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel that Athena?\" The ghost asks. \"That's a strong wave of light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to it?\" Athena asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems the light that was still in the ghost when its shell died just flooded out into the open space and dissipated... It's gone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part that sparked was the one and only part you were unable to identify and dismantle. You now know it is the function that turns the ghost on and turns the light into the energy that feeds the power cells. You were afraid of breaking it before, but now you know you won't need it. You force the part open and begin to build a compatible battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but you finally finished and attached the battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again scrolling red text flashes on the lense before the lense turns white and black letters that read \"Exodus Black: Failsafe.\" appear. The lense then turns to the same blue color that Athena's ghost has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?\" Failsafe's voice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, that's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is strange to see in more than energy signatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it worked!\" Athena's ghost cracks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible!\" Athena bursts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, you have just done something that no one in the vanguard or their ghosts could do!\" Athena's ghost explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you are absolutely coming with me to the tower now!\" Athena grabs your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, it seems I am unable to perform any of the special capabilities of a ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is because you do not wield any light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift Failsafe as Athena begins to pull on your arm.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is a massive red and white ship, it has six thrusters and is of a square shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ramp extends as a door opens. Athena walks inside and gestures for you to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the spacious ship and after the door closes liftoff begins. The ghost is in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat and Athena sits next to you. She reaches up with both arms and grabs her helmet, a few clicking sounds are made as she twists her helmet off of her head. You take in the face of the beautiful brown-haired guardian sitting next to you for the first time. Her eyes a piercing blue and her shoulder length hair flowing and straight, she pushes a few strands away from her eyes. \"You know, I never thought much about it until now.\" She puts her helmet down. \"How exactly do you breathe so well on a Nessus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to tell her that you didn't know when Failsafe started. \"My first scan of John revealed a few oddities. He is a human, yet he could breathe so easily on Nessus all without being a guardian, this is why I scanned him. I have found that he has a communication device implanted in his head and some device I can not identify implanted inside of his lungs. Even more puzzling is that these all seem to be Cabal technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena looks you up and down, a light blush on her face. \"Just what exactly have you gotten yourself into where Cabal have put there technology inside of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I surprised that you are alive John.\" Athena's ghost starts. \"You have been in the situation where Cabal are implanting their technology into you, but have also gotten away, then you made it to Nessus and survived there alone fighting off wave after wave of fallen to protect Failsafe, then you met us and managed to -in less than two days- fully grasp the inner workings of a ghost, and transfer Failsafe. All of this without the help of the Traveller's light.\" The ghost flies from the cockpit to Athena. \"You are quite the spectacle John.\" He dematerializes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we're here.\" Athena stands and opens the door and the ramp extends. She jumps from the ramp to the ground. You walk out and see Athena standing next to a robot who moves to help another ship dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, just jump.\" Athena sticks her arms out. \"Would it help if I offered to catch you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump to the ground of the tower. You look around and see a fantastic courtyard, several people and guardians are around and talking with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Athena as she walks through the courtyard. You look around and take in the fantastic environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Zavala.\" Athena starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bump into her back, and she doesn't even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Athena.\" A deep and silky male voice says. You move to stand beside Athena and see a man with blue skin in impressive, though bulky armor. He looks at you. \"Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is John.\" She gestures to you, then to him. \"John, this is Zavala, the titan vanguard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure to make your acquaintance.\" He extends his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou copy the gesture and firmly shake his hand. \"Likewise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why exactly did you bring him to me Athena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Zavala.\" Athena's ghost starts. \"It's a little... Complicated.\" The ghost turns to you. \"Show him John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You present Failsafe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, vanguard Zavala!\" Failsafe says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavala's eyes widen and he takes a step forward. \"This is the ghost shell you requested the other day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is... Failsafe?\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.\" Athena's ghost informs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavala looks you in the eyes, then to Athena. \"You mean to tell me that he has put Failsafe into that ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also correct.\" Athena nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means that he could understand and manipulate both a ghost and the Exodus Black.\" Zavala folds his arms. \"That is... Impressive indeed.\" He clears his throat, suppressing his excitement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is he a lightbearer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He isn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That only makes your feats more impressive John.\" Zavala nods before turning away, overseeing a large city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena grabs your wrist and drags you across a nearby bridge to the next station. Similar symbols to the one on Athena's armor is painted across screens. Standing in the center of this area is a very large man in bulky armor painted with a minimalistic orange stripe, a revolver attached to his waist along with a cloth. His chestplate has a brown-fur collar. His helmet is decorated with the same orange stripe, on one side a horn, the other a fragment of what used to be a horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a proud, hearty and masculine voice with a slightly british accent he speaks as he raises he arms off of his hips. \"Ah! The legendary Goddess of The Crucible Athena returns!\" He puts his hands back on his hips and stares at you for a second. \"Who's your friend?\" He makes a square with his fingers with you as the focus. \"He doesn't look like much.\" He lowers his hands then laughs before speaking again, this time louder. \"Well if he is anything like you I can expect another star on the battlefield! Oh! Perhaps the start of a star fireteam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I still don't have a fireteam, Lord Shaxx.\" She gestures to you. \"This is John, and as unfortunate as it is, he is not a lightbearer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how unfortunate.\" He takes a step towards you. \"I'm sure one day the light will find its way into your heart, it always does.\" He nudges you. \"If Athena sees enough in you to bring you around the tower, I'm sure it is only a matter of time before the Traveller sees what's there too!\" He says pointing to the massive machine floating above the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes on your side and walks along a narrow walkway to a small corner of the tower under an awning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Master Rahool, I've done it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done what guardian?\" A blue-skinned man responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've finally found someone smarter than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How interesting, who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestures to you. \"This is John, and he was able to transfer a golden age A.I into a dead ghost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" He takes a step back, a shocked expression on his face. \"That is indeed an insurmountable feat.\" He looks at you and bows his head. \"Hopefully we can work together someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena now begins to lead you through a nearby corridor and down some stairs into a large hangar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks up to a work space where you can see the lower half of what you can tell to be an attractive female figure, her plump ass is being hugged tightly by the jeans she wears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amanda!\" Athena says, prompting the girl working on the ship part to come out and greet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has now been revealed to be a girl with a cute and slightly freckled face and blonde hair. Her figure is a fine figure eight, with a plump ass and average tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it goin' Athena?\" She speaks with a southern drawl. \"This your boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena blushes lightly. \"Afraid not, just some super smart guy I figured you might be interested in knowing.\" She tursn to you. \"His name is John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena's ghost appears. \"He dismantled a ghost and then put a golden age spacecraft's A.I inside of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\" Amanda puts her hands on her hips and cocks her stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" Failsafe says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" Amanda now says in shock. \"You promise to come over here and help me out if I need it!\" She practically demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will have to wait.\" Athena says grabbing onto your wrist again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drags you to the other side of the tower and down more stairs. She brings you into a room with a large glowing tank. A sketchy man wearing strange armor is leaning against a handrail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey sister!\" He says. \"Who's the guy? You went out there and got a boyfriend? The vanguard won't like that.\" He goes on jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the second person to say something like that.\" Athena sighs. \"Drifter, this is John.\" She points to the tank. \"I think he can really help you out with this whole gambit thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah sister.\" He puts his hands up. \"You aren't supposed to be talking about gambit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh calm down, he isn't even a lightbearer. He's just some stupid smart scavenger I found on Nessus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid smart? What he do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He manipulated both a ghost and golden age A.I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is super smart.\" He rubs his chin for a second. \"Alright brother, come visit your buddy The Drifter here sometime. If Athena's tellin' the truth your skills could really amp up gambit.\" He flips a coin, he then gestures it to you and it appears vanish into thin air. \"Of course something will be in it for you also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, see you later Drifter.\" Athena says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later you two, don't go dyin' out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena leans against the wall by the staircase up. \"Let's go find Zavala and see if he's got a place for you. I think you've met everyone important.\" She shrugs. \"You'll get acquainted with everyone here eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you stay the night?</span></div></div>",

These discomforts were broken instantly when Athena slugs your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you're going to get yourself an office.\" She blushes for a second before continuing to speak. \"It won't be ready for a while, so you still need somewhere to stay.\" She brings a hand up to her chin and folds an arm across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm going back to the Exodus Black for while.\" You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will vote strongly against that idea!\" Failsafe chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on John.\" Athena puts her hands on her hips. \"You seriously can't be considering going back to the Exodus Black.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would the Drifter be willing to house John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he would.\" Athena mumbles before clapping once. \"Alright it's settled then, you'll stay with the drifter for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only shrug in response. You then walk beside Athena to The Drifter's spot in the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, back so soon?\" The Drifter remarks as he sees you enter. \"And you brought you're boyfriend.\" He flips a coin as he teases Athena. \"Watcha need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John needs a place to stay for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry brother.\" He gestures to the tank in the center of the room. \"There isn't necessarily room for someone else in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena points to an empty section of the room. \"There's all kinds of empty space though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want to sleep uncovered on the ground next to that thing?\" He shrugs. \"Go for it man, my well being not yours.\" He flips the coin again. \"You got a ship don't you sister? Why don't he just stay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena blushes. \"You're right. How could I have overlooked that?\" She turns around and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man did you see that?\" The Drifter points to where Athena was standing. \"She's feeling something for you man, I just did you a favor.\" He flips the coin again, then leans against the hand rail again. \"Don't leave her hangin' brother.\" He gestures you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the room and walk up the stairs where you meetup with Athena. She walks to the hangar with you in tow. The door opens and the ramp falls, the two of you enter the ship. She lifts on a small handle in the floor and pulls which reveals a bed underneath the floor. She does the same on the other side of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena yawns as she outstretches her hand. Her ghost materializes then drops, the light of its eye turning off. She puts the ghost down and then enters a small room. A minute or so later she exits the room without her armor. She wears a purple tanktop that tightly hugs her body, you are able to identify that she has around d-cup breasts and very well defined abs. She had a tattoo of the Titan insignia on her left shoulder. She wears a pair of black volleyball shorts on her toned and muscular legs. She yawns and raises her arms above her head to stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to change?\" She gestures to the room she was just in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself. \"I don't really have any other clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross man. I've got some stuff for guys in there I've been trying to barter off for some glimmer.\" She sighs. \"Don't buy engrams from eververse those things are scams.\" She lays on the bed and pulls up her sheets. \"Slip on something comfortable, you can keep all of those male clothes as well.\" She rolls over so she is no longer facing you. \"Goodnight.\" She says during a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room and see a box poorly marked with the words \"Barter Items.\" You open the box and see a load of clothes, all fitted for men. You flip through the messy pile of clothes in the box until you find a pair of purple long and baggy silk pants. You slip them on and remove your shirt. You enter the room and lie on the pad. As you pull up the sheets you catch Athena looking towards you, her eyes appear to be closed, but she has a deep blush on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall asleep quickly, as this is easily the most comfortable thing you can remember sleeping on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing guardian Athena?\" Failsafe's voice rips you from your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your eyes closed and listen to the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Athena asks in a defensive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am an A.I. I would have initiated sleep mode, but this function appears to be locked. My calculations determine it is a light lock. I figure since you're clearly willing to do work with your fingers, I was hoping you could try and help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.\" Athena says in a hush and embarrassed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How unfortunate!\" Failsafe chimes. \"It seems that did not work, perhaps my calculations were off.

You enter the room that you changed in to find your clothes just as you left them, in neatly folded pile. On the other side of the room you have Athena's clothes which were tosses aside as she changed before putting her armor on. As you lift your shirt from the pile you catch your eyes drifting to Athena's sloppy pile of clothes. You put your shirt down and take a knee by the pile. You didn't want to do what you were about to do, but your morning erection, and the ease of access made it really hard not to. You sigh as you lift her tanktop from the ground and take in its aroma. It smelled mostly of lavender, but it was tainted by something musky, yet somehow still feminine. You drop the tanktop and move on to her plain, navy blue panties. Before they could get to your nose, you notice a small wet spot. You smell a pleasantly sweet, yet immensely musky smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shamefully drop the panties and dress yourself, feeling like a total pervert.

She then inserted her right hand into her pants. I witnessed the movement! Not to mention how flustered she got when I said something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't tell people's secrets like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were involved! I believe you had a right to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cock twitches, but settles before getting erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the ship and see Zavala waiting patiently outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, John.\" He approaches you. \"Your office space is ready.\" He says, gesturing for you to follow him. He leads you to a narrow office with a storage area that appears to be for storing weapons. \"This space used to be utilized by our gunsmith, Banshee-44. Unfortunately, it seems he doesn't remember it is his.\" Zavala shakes his head. \"It's terrible what is happening to that exo.\" Zavala hands you a key. \"You can use this to lock and unlock the door to this space only. This office is yours as a living space. Your duties here have yet to be decided, for now I'd say help those who request it.\" He leaves you to your office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admire the space and furnishing for a second before a knocking at the door strikes your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door to see the monument of a man Lord Shaxx standing with his hands on his hips. He laughs briefly before wrapping his arm around to your shoulder to pull you out of your office and then lead you behind him. \"Today is a very special day!\" He booms as he walks you to the courtyard. \"Athena will be competing in a rumble match with some of the highest ranking guardians! Thinking about this match makes my sould shiver! This will decide who the single strongest guardian of the crucible is!\" He rambles before stopping at his post. \"Athena has specially requested that you watch, she asked me to be subtle, but that isn't really me.\" He laughs. \"I also had a feeling you would decline had I been subtle.\" He lowers his head to match your height, and his voice lowers with intensity. \"You will watch her match.\" He smacks your back as he rises to his regular height. The screens in front of him switch from crucible statistics to a birds eye view of some location you recognize to be on Nessus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen again changes to viewing several different angles through cameras, and on another monitor the point of view of the guardians through their helmets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guardians standing in this arena.\" Shaxx begins. \"You are the best of the best the crucible has to offer. This match will be special, a rumble were you all only get one chance in the fight. There will be several different factors determining your score, placements, eliminations, precision, awareness. The one with the highest score will be the absolute best guardian standing in the crucible. Fight well, guardians!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardians displayed on the screen seem to bounce to life as they begin moving. Several firefights have already begun. You watch as guardians of all varieties begin to fight each other, very much to the death. You keep your eyes on the one titan you recognize to be Athena. She has one each of her engagements. She fights a very mobile style that involves getting around an opponent and shredding them with her auto rifle while outmaneuvering them. Occasionally though, she will hunker down with a towering shield of light taking opponents with pinpoint sniper shots. If the fight starts where she and her opponent see each other she will start by throwing a purple grenade that shrouds her opponent in a purple fog after connection. Sometimes in close combat she will lay an enemy down with her fist, after each strike a purple energy shrouds her body like a shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed by the skill displayed by everyone, especially Athena. Lord Shaxx was clearly excited, he cheered and reacted with immense enthusiasm for each engagement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the match had only four guardians left. Athena ran towards the most open area of the arena. Suddenly, she was pelted from all directions with gunfire, her overshield could not take the heat and broke, but right as they did she arrived at the centermost area of the arena. This is where she deployed a large purple bubble around herself. The bubble, you recognized from your time on Nessus. You watch as her opponents continue to fire upon her bubble from locations unknown to her. She stays calmly in the center of her bubble looking around to pinpoint the origin of the shots. Very suddenly she stepped out of the bubble and threw a grenade, it bounced off the head of another titan before exploding and eliminating him. A hooded man runs towards the bubble and enters striking Athena with a blade, which seems to bounce from the purple light surrounding her, before she could strike back he jumps backwards and throws several glowing blades from the air. Somehow, Athena reacted to the attack and place a barricade. She fires only a few shots from her auto rifle, but promptly ends her opponent. The bubble by now seems very damaged. She looks around for her last opponent, but couldn't find them before a grenade lands on the part of the bubble that is behind her. She turns and sees her opponent running towards the bubble with a shotgun in his hand. The bubble dissipates as a result of the explosion, and the man with the shotgun slides towards Athena. Athena jumps backwards, but takes a heavy beating from the blast of the shotgun. The man practically throws the gun away to switch to his hand cannon, but by the time he is ready to shoot Athena is behind the barricade she placed a little while earlier. She tosses a grenade that bounces off the ground by the right side of the barricade towards the man, she strafes to the left of the barricade and blocks the man's original retreat. He distances himself from the grenade, but stays clear of the left side of the barricade. Athena's strafe however, was a feint. She slide through the center of her barricade and fires a few shots of her rifle before smashing in the mask of her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaxx laughs loudly as the match comes to a close. \"You've reduced your enemies to dust! Are you satisfied? I certainly am. Watching you makes my soul shiver!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screens return to crucible statistics and Shaxx's laughter dies down. \"How did you enjoy the match scavenger?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only exhale before he cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't tell me!\" He pushes you lightly with one hand. \"I could see it as you watched, you were amazed by the battle unfolding! Just as I was!\" He shakes his head. \"You know, I'd love to reward the top three combatants. Banshee-44 and I had arrangements for making a special weapon for the person who placed first, but it seems he forgot to even show up to watch... I was hoping that you could cook something up for them.\" Shaxx hands you a small bag of red tokens with the crucible insignia on them. \"That is all I shall give you for now, do please get me some rewards for them. I figured you'd be great for this scavenger.\" He puts his hands on his hips. \"I would love it if you could provide them within a week, though take as much time as you need.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You get up and then sit beside her. You wanted to say something, but feared that you had no good response, so you instead wrapped your arm around her. \"Are you tired?\" You ask. \"You sure did a lot today, and I certainly could use some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" She rests her head on your shoulder. \"I could too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sit like that for a while until Athena lets out a yawn and stands up.

You counted the number of bullets of your trusty hand cannon but decided it wasent worth the effort so you spoted a bow shaped symbol in the massive stone wall next to the ship. As you walked to it you shot dead 4 fallen around the enterance with one headshot each and you walked in to see a dimmly lited corridor. On the way you saw machines, but for some kind of reason images and info flickered into your skull and you knew these machines calls Vex. As you walked you shot every vex in your sight as you took cover while taking aim to some floating Vex units. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 min when you cleared the bunker, or what you thought it was at least you saw a chache with glowing glimmer and some kind of Rifle. It was similar to a M16 and a AR15 but it had a black cartridge and had the apperance of an auto Rifle. You scoped it up and carried your loot out of the bunker and saw 3 men in Armor with heavy weapons and they tilted their heads in confussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey, did you cleaned out that lost sector by yourself?\" Asked the blue black Titan in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Lost sector? ahh, you mean the bunker, yes I did.\" You said casually and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 Titans looked at you with amazement and looked at you up and down again and probably did not belived what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" By the Light! A lone hunter equiped with nothing less than a hand cannon and an auto rifle with leather armor and a simple flack vest.\" Said the red white titan to the left, who appered to have a larger chestplate outwards and maybe was female, but the voice came out synthetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Actually I grabbed the Auto Rifle when I was done in there, belive me it was pretty easy really. If you target the weak point they fall with one shot.\" You said and gesture to your hand cannon`` The deal Breaker`` and you continued. \" But not the last one, it was pretty big but I grabed a vex distruptor and killed it off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 Titans fell silent in awe. Was it because you did a feat so easily that would have been hard for 3 guardians or that you manipulated vex technology?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Who are you?\" said the female Titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ehh, Im John. John Doe.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You.. are.. not a Guardian?\" They said all three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ahh, no. Im John.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You are not a Lightbearer?!!! Said the Front Titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No, far as I know I woke up here on this world a couple days ago, scavange to survive, killed off a couple fallen there and there and for some reason I know what and who they are. and how to manipulate tech I havent seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" By the traveler, that\u00b4s not possible for a non guardian. My, well. My fireteam came to clear out the sector for some glimmer and you did the job for us and can we at least help you with something?\" The male Titan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, I was thinking you could help me clear out that big ship overthere.\" You pointed at a massive ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Titan fireteam looked were you pointed and spoke up, or the Titan on the left. \" aye, that is the Exodus Black mate, wre the Golden age AI is located eh.<br>\r\nBy the way lass, with that legendary auto rifle of yours, it would be more than enough to get the job done eh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then the front Titan adressed the Titan with that scottish accent. \" Simon, John here has done something a non guardian has never done and he has proven to be very formidable warrior, We owe it!\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan named simon replied. \" oye, yo right Lars, will do mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Destiny is now self-published by Bungie after separating from Activision in 2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right reserved to Bungie. This is fan content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfo about destiny, or those who are not familiar with it. ( Main source Destinypedia ) and this is not made up by me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<b>Cayde-6</b>. Cayde-6 was an <u>Exo</u> Guardian and the Vanguard for the Hunter class. In Destiny Cayde-6 sold Hunter armor and emblems. At the beginning of Forsaken, he was murdered in the Prison of Elders by Uldren Sov. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Banshee-44</b>. is an <u>Exo</u> Gunsmith, located within the Tower. He sells weapons for field testing, telemetries that increase upgrade weapons for a certain type of weapon, and ammo synthesis items for Guardians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Commander Zavala</b>,  is an <u>Awoken</u> Guardian who serves as the Vanguard of the Titan class, and overall Vanguard Commander of The Last City. Stern and uncompromising, Zavala's only goal is to safeguard humanity within the Last City against all threats. He oversees all Guardian military operations, and led the Guardians to victory in both the Taken War and Red War. In the aftermath of both conflicts, Zavala has become increasingly isolated and reluctant to commit Guardians to conflicts outside of the Last City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ikora Rey</b>, is a <u>human</u> and the Vanguard for the Warlock class. Rey's extensive knowledge of her field has earned her respect \"among all Orders.\" Ikora Rey sells Warlock armor and emblems, but will also sometimes assist in some exotic weapon bounties such as A Dubious Task. Following the Red War, Ikora began allowing Guardians to use her meditation device to relive past missions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amanda Holliday</b>, is a <u>human</u> shipwright and pilot found in the Tower's hangar. She repairs Guardians' personal spaceships, as well as sells new ships and Sparrows. Amanda is also involved in organizing the Sparrow Racing League and works closely with the SRL pilots to upgrade their Sparrows and experiment with new designs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dr. Anastasia Bray</b> is a Hunter Gunslinger and an adopted member of House Bray. Prior to her first death, she was a psycholinguist who helped develop the Warmind Rasputin by teaching it independent thought. After the Collapse, Ana was revived by a Ghost named Jinju. Unlike most Guardians, Ana had knowledge about her past life due to a Clovis Bray ID she was wearing upon her revival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Master Rahool</b> is an <u>Awoken</u> Cryptarch found at the Tower's main plaza.[1] Rahool will decode any Engrams that the player has for free. In Destiny, he will also offer to exchange a number of legendary engrams for Legendary Marks.<br>\r\nBesides being a Cryptarch, Master Rahool is also a historian and linguist. He makes mention of various artifacts from the Golden Age and beyond, particularly various religious texts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lord Shax,</b> he\u00b4s the headmaster of the crucible, an arena were guardians can battle each other for rewards and bounties. He\u00b4s unknown what race he is, but he\u00b4s demenor seems<u> Human.</u> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaces:<br>\r\nHuman. <b>Humanity</b> is a sapient species native to the planet Earth. The remaining humans are all that survive of a race whose reach once spanned the Solar System, having descended from those who endured the apocalyptic Collapse. Since then, they have fought to restore our toppled civilization to its Golden Age splendor first by the legendary Iron Lords, and more recently by the Guardians. During the 21st Century, humanity made first contact with the mysterious entity that would later come to be known as the Traveler, the arrival of which ushered in a centuries-long Golden Age that saw humans colonize the newly remade worlds of Sol including Mercury, Venus, Mars, and even the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.<br>\r\nBut this Golden Age would not last. Unbeknownst to humanity, the Traveler had an ancient enemy; a powerful <b>Darkness</b> that precipitated the Collapse and nearly wiped out mankind, if not for the intervention of the Traveler who sacrificed itself to push back the assailing Darkness.  And with its dying breath, the Traveler created Ghosts to seek out those worthy to carry on its task.<br>\r\nIn the dark decades after the Collapse, Humans, Exos, and Awoken found the Traveler where it made its final stand and built the City. the last bastion of mankind\u2014beneath its shadow.  And from an age of chaos and death began the City Age.<br>\r\nThough its tenuous peace lasted for the better part of a hundred years, the City Age would ultimately come to a shattering end in the wake of the devastating Cabal invasion; with the heroic deeds of The Guardian bringing an end to the Red Legion's siege and marking the dawn of a new Golden Age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Awoken</b> are a race of humanoids living in the City and also the Reef. Ruled by a Queen and her brother, they were generally isolated from Earth, long avoiding contact with the City until the Wolf rebellion and later the Taken War. Awoken are standoffish and resemble baseline humans, with the notable exception of having pale blue, purple, green, or gray skin. They also have luminescent eyes with glowing irises.<br>\r\nBeyond physical appearances, the <u>Awoken</u> seem to possess powers and abilities beyond their human ancestors. The Techeuns are a particularly notable example, though ordinary Awoken can also experience visions in the form of dreams. This is a side effect of them being within Earth's universe-within the Distributary, the Awoken do not have paracausal abilities, but are so intertwined with the fabric of its existence that they do not age past a certain point. <b>The Distributary</b> is the home planet and universe of the Awoken race. It was formed when the Exodus Green was enveloped by The Darkness at the exact moment the Traveler released its Light. This resulted in a singularity containing a pocket universe. In the Distributary's universe, time flows differently, and Awoken society has had thousands upon thousands of years to flourish and build. The centuries in which Humanity suffered the Dark Age saw the exponential growth and abundance of the Awoken in their pocket universe. Only near the end of the Dark Ages were the Awoken able to detect and confirm that they were inside a singularity - identifying this information from bits and pieces of radio transmissions that the singularity ensnared from the solar system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExominds (or simply <b>Exos</b> as they are more commonly known) are self-aware war machines built by humanity in the Golden Age. The Exos were the brainchildren of Clovis Bray,  though the motive for their creation remains a mystery. During the Collapse, the Exos' memories were shattered and nigh-all knowledge of their origins lost as well. In the Dark Age that followed, the Exos helped build the Last City alongside their organic brethren, with many going on to become Guardians.The Exos were built during humanity's Golden Age for a long forgotten struggle, possibly against the Vex, with the purpose of protecting their creators. Rasputin was once involved in their command, a fact that some Exos dimly remember. The conflict itself has long been forgotten and the Exo remain ciphers, even to themselves, for their purpose has been forgotten as well. But there is one clue to their origins; many Exos experience a dream they call Deep Stone Crypt, or the \"place where they were born.\" It is described as \"the infamous subroutine which seeded the first Exo consciousness.\" Cayde-6's memories stretch further, where he recalls being a human before traveling an icy moon, possibly Enceladus, to become an Exo, as he \"came there in flesh and bone. Gave everything to the ice. Started over. Rebooted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuardian classes:<br>\r\nTitan. The Titan is a class of Guardian. They tend to have the highest armor of any of the three classes in Destiny and the lowest agility. They are equipped with suits of powered armor that boost their strength and endurance. Titans utilize their strength and skill with firearms to kill their enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Titans</b> have long honed the Light of the Traveler, passing these skills to each new generation of warrior. Their strength gave birth to the City, and they have taken a blood oath to ensure it will always stand strong. The Wall surrounding the City was built by the first Titans, who also perished defending it. Steadfast and suresighted, Titans face any challenge head-on, serving as living, blunt force instruments of the Traveler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter:<br>\r\nThe <b>Hunter</b> is a type of Guardian who uses stealth and long ranged weapons to kill their enemies. Hunters tend to be taciturn, mostly keeping to themselves and using lightweight throwing knives and smoke to disorient their enemies. Hunter Cloaks provide a sense of mystery and excellent camouflage when they are in the wild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarlock:<br>\r\n<b>Warlocks</b> are \"warrior-scholars,\" and a class of Guardian. Warlocks utilize powers granted by the Traveler for both attack and defense. Warlocks were the first to tap the power of the Traveler, wielding its light as they ventured beyond the safety of the Wall. They know each discovery offers new possibilities, and they have devoted themselves to understanding the Traveler, its power, and how to better channel that power. A <u>Warlock</u> mind is an arsenal of deadly secrets, balanced between godhood and madness. On the battlefield, those secrets can shatter reality itself. They search the frontier to find a means to defeat the Darkness once and for all. Warlocks specialize in ranged melee attacks and casting elemental spells to take out enemies. </td>",
