It's one of the most delicious things you've ever tasted! The treat is sumptuous, just the right mix of chewy and melt-in-your-mouth. There's some caramel in the middle, just to make things even better. As you swallow, you feel strange for the slightest second, but the feeling is as jarring when it leaves a millisecond later.

I know,\" he says, \"we can dip into my business for a second, and I'll give you a discount to make up for almost squishing you.

Turns out he was a culinary school graduate who couldn't decide what he wanted to specialize in, so he didn't. Instead, he tried to develop recipes for every single cuisine he liked and stuck them all in one place. The bathrooms are spotless, the tables and chairs beautiful, and the food smells heavenly. By the time he finishes walking you around, you're already a fan, and you haven't even tried the food yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tour winds down, Jake asks you what you plan to do about your job. To be honest, you reply, you have no idea. You hate your old job, so you won't be fighting to get it back, but your skills aren't exactly up to par in the market. It might take a while for you to land your next opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever tried sumo?\", the kangaroo replies. You laugh at what seems like a jokey statement, but he's serious. \"No, really, I have a bunch of friends who are into it. This city has a decent sumo scene. Good pay for anyone who can win the occasional round, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him in disbelief. \"No offense, sir,\" you reply, \"but I'm not exactly the sumo figure,\" pointing at your slim physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's certainly true,\" Jake says. \"Still, it's an option if you're struggling in the future. You'd have to put on some pounds, but it seems like a fun pastime. Some of them are even making it a career.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank him for the advice, and though you agree it might be fun, it's not exactly high on your list right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! By the way, I still need to apologize, yet again, for what happened earlier,\" Jake adds. You try to tell him he's been kind enough, but he replies that he's only more convinced by your respect. He goes behind the hostess station and comes back with a card in hand. \"Friends of mine eat free here, no matter what,\" he tells you, handing you a lifetime card good for free meals whenever you want. You thank him profusely - if nothing else, you won't need to worry about paying for food for a while. Jake wishes you well as you leave, waving goodbye before you set your mind on sending out applications.</span></div></div>",

You can't tell if your old boss has a vendetta against you, as many of the places you apply don't seem to give you the time of day. In the few cases when you do land interviews, fate intervenes - on one day, a sudden pouring rain sends you into the interview soaking wet, to which the hiring manager weasel immediately dismisses you and calls the janitor to bring a mop, while on another, your briefcase pops open just as a gust of wind kicks up, blowing copies of your resume all around the city and leaving you wholly unprepared once you get into the interviewing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you've got a decent-sized fallback fund to lean on - it'll help you pay rent for a while, as long as you don't make any extravagant purchases. To help save money, you start making healthy use of Jake's all-you-can-eat gift card as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first few days, you're eating normal, healthy meals as you come in, trying one dish each meal. They're all superb, to boot. But as the days turn into weeks, you find yourself becoming a bit depressed by the job search grind. After your first blown interview, you find yourself drowning your sorrows in a big three-course meal, washing down a steak and fried chicken with a heaping pile of pasta. The next day, after sending out a few resumes, you wander down and daydream while you eat, only stopping when your aching stomach cries mercy. Only then do you realize how much you ate - four empty plates of Chinese food and a big bowl of ice cream all went down before you even realized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the first month of eating at Jake's, you don't really notice any changes - maybe some of your smaller shirts don't reach down as far as they should, or your khakis are feeling a little tight. It's the second month of no callbacks that really hurts you, though. Some days you send out a dozen resumes and hear nothing, ending the day with a half-dozen tacos and a plate of cookies. Others, you struggle to even face the rejection, content to simply meander down to Jake's after sleeping late and spending the whole day there, intermittently stuffing your face and reading a magazine. This is when you really start looking different. Your belly, once nonexistent, is slowly swelling outward both in width and length. That same effect is repeating itself all over your body, with your arms growing thicker, your legs and butt expanding outward and a second chin slowly forming on your neck.</span></div></div>",

Your pants still come on, but they're almost skin-tight - you've often been relying on oversized t-shirts, large sweatshirts and stretchy sweatpants when you leave the house.

You've still got a few months of rent and living expenses saved up. It would be really, really nice if you could start bringing in at least a little bit of cash, though.

Once you're done, you find the nearest seat and absolutely tear into it. Bite after bite, gulp after gulp, you manage to choke it down in just a few minutes, at which point you repeat the process. Once you get to your fourth plate, you can start to feel your stomach getting full, but you push on until you finish the whole thing. Nursing your swollen, distended belly, you slowly walk over to the ice cream machine and make yourself a big bowl as well. Bringing it back to your seat, you let it melt over the course of a half-hour, rubbing your stomach to make it feel better.

The scale tells you you're about halfway there, and it shows. The fluffy fur of your white belly has grown in a small but noticeable way, and your entire body seems to have thickened. Likewise, your sweats fit just a bit tighter than they did last week, though you've got plenty of room left for growth. Seeing the scale feels different - your chin pressed down on its double, and you have to poke your head out a little to see the number - but you're not as big as you hope. 207 means you've got plenty of eating left to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you get to it as soon as you leave your apartment. Your first stop is at the ice cream dispenser, filling up a few bowls of ice cream. Then you fill plenty of glasses full of the sugariest sodas on Jake's tap. By the time you manage to grab four plates of food, the ice cream's half-melted, and between plates you drink it down like its milk. Your stomach's a bit bigger than it was last week, which lets you get an extra few minutes of stuffing your face before you're full, which gives you time to finish a bunch of plates of everything you can think of, plus the ice cream and soda. By the time your stomach finally begs for you to stop, it's largely round and distended, and you barely make it home before the food coma hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to eat as much as you can in the next week, not bothering to stop when you hit 225. Every morning you wake up and feel yourself be a little bit heavier. By the fifth day, you need to get a new set of sweats one size up, as your belly's starting to hang out of the waistband, and your legs and arms have swollen to make it feel a little tight. You even get a second set two sizes up in case you eventually need it. By this time your body is used to its daily marathon of calories, and whenever you're not eating, it wants you to eat. That's why you start eating four meals a day at Jake's instead of three. By the end of the week, you can comfortably eat nonstop for the better part of an hour, enjoying every bite. You finally bring yourself to weigh yourself by the end of the week to find you weight...</span></div></div>",

Your job-search funk had made you disregard your appearance and then some. Your belly strains at your too-small sweatshirt, pushing out in every direction. Your reaction is to head directly to the plus-size section, as you're not exactly able to wear mediums and larges anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plus-size section is surprisingly extensive, which you didn't quite expect. The typical XLs and 2XLs are there, but that's not all. Everything from jeans to dress shirts are well above your current size, as big as you already are, rising as large as 12XLs, which look closer to tents than clothing for the average fur. You grab an XL and a 2XL so you can better compare what you need right now, and for kicks, you grab a 12XL to see just how foolishly large it looks on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking out your clothing, you wander over to the store's changing rooms. There's a clerk there waiting to check you in, just to make sure you're not going to walk out wearing the merchandise. You hand over the clothes in your hand, but the chubby rabbit girl stops you before you enter. \"Hey, you've got a 12XL! My boss told me that if someone were to grab anything over a 3XL piece of clothing that I should give them his business card. Here you go. He wants you to call him after you're done shopping, if that's OK with you. No pressure, you don't have to if you don't feel like it.\" With that, she leaves you to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou test out the clothes. The XL fits, though it's a bit snug, while the 2XL is baggy. As a joke, you put on the 12XL, and as you expect, it's ridiculously big. After you try everything on, you think about the business card. What's that all about?</span></div></div>",

Of course, you're not so confident about the weight gain, either.

As much as you hate to admit it, you've gotta work hard and get to that first big payday as soon as possible. The ones after that will be gravy, of course - you were barely making $30,000 annually before, so this is going to be a nice windfall for you. It's a shame you need to sacrifice your waistline (more) to do so, but things could be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of heading straight home, you instead change course and head over to Jake's, where you eat with a vigor that you're not entirely sure you remember ever having before. Instead of piling one plate high, you bring three back to your table before you even dig in, and they're twice as large as they've been in the past. After you've absolutely torn into them, you don't even hesitate before grabbing four more. Rinse and repeat for twenty minutes, until your formerly growling belly is swollen a few inches further off your frame and is almost crying out for you to stop. You stumble home and immediately pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis becomes your routine as often as your poor stomach can stand it, and as the first few days go by, you're not seeing any immediate change. Until, of course, you do. Five or six days after you've started your stuffing routine, you wake up and find yourself noticeably softer than before.

You spent more and more of your days in Jake's restaurant. That day in particular, the roo offered you room and board as a joke, but a smidgen of your mind pondered the idea. It saved the morning walk, where which valuable calories burned. Besides, room and board might pay off the sheer amount of profits you metaphorically devoured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Time not spent gorging, you spent letting your stomach settle and getting to know your culinary-enthused neighbor. You spent some time in the kitchen with him, just watched him work his magic. He moved fast for such a heavy guy. He juggled three or four dishes at any given time and somehow never once mixed up his steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a sixth sense these days.\" He said, sipping at a stew with one hand while stirring red sauce with his other. \"What about you, what do you do for fun? Besides eating.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing I guess, I live a pretty boring life.\" It sounded much more sad now that you said it out loud. \"Before now I just got up, scrambled over work, went home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Smart guy like you's gotta have friends, maybe a girlfriend or something?\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were some guys I used to go to lunch with at work, maybe go to the bar on Friday nights.\" You said. \"Relationships though? I guess I never had much time for any of that. These days I imagine my waist-line might be a bit of a deterrent anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised, my friend. Some ladies are really into it.\" Jake chuckled. \"This one girl I met was real picky, said she only dated guys in the 'seven-hundred' club if you know what I mean.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are guys like that out there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better hope so, for the sake of that modeling contract of yours. Hell, I'll give her a call when you start showing off those 12X shirts you told me about, let her have something to gawk at.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look on the bright side, the pasta's done.\" Jake scooped a plateful and slid it your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace a little at the pile of heavy looking noodles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I just ate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty pounds aren't going to gain themselves, my friend.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You roll your eyes, but decide he's got the right mindset. Never mind imminent explosion, you need this month's rent now. One forkful after the other, you clear some room on that plate. Half way through you note some serious discomfort, you belch a little to ease some pressure, but it does very little to soothe you. Bothered by this development, you shift around in your seat in an attempt to get comfortable again. It proves a lurch too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A light <i>pip</i> sound catches your ears off guard. You grunt in confusion as the pressure suddenly gives way. A muffled noise, you realize too late as your zipper being forced apart, follows. You look downwards, an inch of furry belly fat juts out from your shirt and over your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, you don't happen to have scale handy do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/paw.png\" alt=\"*Paw*\" title=\"Paw\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic, simply fantastic.\" The tiger looks you up and down. \"I ask for fifty pounds, and the next time I see you I get fifty and three whole pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The image of the scale's reading long since etched into your mind. Two-Seven-eight, less than thirty pounds shy of three-hundred. The thought that you have nearly doubled your weight in only four months leaves you with a sense of whiplash. A thought only compounded by the bright lights shone on in you in all directions.  You feel your face grow hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I understand you have some experience in the marketing field.\" Said the tiger. \"So I won't need to inundate you with the specifics then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" You whisper. You worked behind the scenes most times, never the subject in front of the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good.\" The Tiger nods and put his arm around your shoulder. You can't help but notice you've approached his size, and are well on your way to surpassing his weight. You take a deep breath and walk along with him. \"These guys are professionals, real classy crew, they've put just about every good name brand you can think of on the map.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He leads you off set, talking your ear off about their industry achievements. From swimsuit models, to bodybuilders, to high-end fashionistas, they've done it all. You, as it turns out, are their greatest challenge yet. Selling the fat guy image. With that, he lets go of you and looks at his watch. He announces he has other plans for the day, and that he's leaving you in oh-so-capable hands. You stand off stage, awkwardly looking at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, nice to finally meet you. Name's Tanya.\" A slender cougar woman approaches you, her voice sleek and posh as the neat robin-egg blue blouse and khakis she wore. You introduce yourself, trying your best not to stammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be the one prepping you for your shoots. Make-up, clothing, that sort of thing.\" She says. \"Speaking of which we need to get you ready for today's shoot. We need you ready to start your first set of shots before Damien gets here. Come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You follow her a little ways to a changing area. The room is fairly well-lit, with a booth for make-up and several tall mirrors. She clears her throat and steps towards a large pile of clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this seems like a lot, don't worry, we won't do a formal shoot like this until you reach specific size brackets. You've obviously cleared the 2X bracket, but not to worry, 3X through 4X still qualify this shoot. 5X through 8X are next, then finally 9 and beyond.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought they only went up to 12.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the sumo business burgeoning in town, it seems they've got an eye to push the limits. Who knows, someday they might start calling 3X 'Sumo Size 1' or something.\" Tanya winks at you. You gulp and watch her grab a single piece of clothing. One you recognize as a very large pair of briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God.\" You shake your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best to get the underwear modeling out of the way first I say, we've only three styles you need to show off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thongs right?\" You roll your yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some briefs a few sizes smaller ought to do the trick.\" She snarks right back. \"Just relax, no one is here to judge you. We're here to make you look attractive no matter what your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She tosses you to briefs and you waddle behind a changing curtain with much reluctance. You cannot take your eyes off of your bloated form while you strip. The way your chest quakes, the way your belly wobbles. It just puts your nerves on edge. This photo-shoot could easily be the worst thing you've ever done. You cram yourself into the all too revealing briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, you carry your weight quite well.\" Tanya nods at you while she escorts you to the stage once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Furs scramble all around you to get into place. To your surprise a rather plump otter is standing with his arms crossed onstage. You try your very hardest not to freak out, despite this resembling some bizarre adolescent nightmare. You stood on a stage, many pounds overweight, in front of many much more in shape furs. A few scramble about on stage, setting up wooden background and some props: a couch, a scale, and a dining room table. It all looks like a bare apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah so this is the model then?\" The plump otter smiles and walks up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you're Damien.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At your service. I must admit, this is exciting new ground we are breaking.\" The otter gestured for you to follow him to the prop scale. \"Yes, new artistic ground.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Photographing fat people?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just plain fat people? That's what we have the news for good sir.\" He huffs. \"No, no, no, I have worked with gods of the industry. Yes Mister World champion of the decade, a veritable Hercules if I do say so myself. Ah and Miss Annalise Cocteu, a beautiful Aphrodite, and just as unattainable for mortal men. And you, a fine Dionysus perhaps? Jolly and full of excess? Or perhaps one more primeval, a god whose name is lost to ancient furs, one of fertility and harvest. Oh the possibilities good sir, are grander than you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him and blink a few times. What insanity have you brought on yourself? You bite your lip and nod at him, in hopes the answer will sate him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you see things my way. Now please stand atop our modest facsimile of a scale.\" You do as instructed. \"Good, now look down. Realize you are not standing upon a scale, but a symbol. Yes, a symbol so guttural to overweight furs everywhere. The number that so determines your mass, your size, your sense of beauty. And look at you, you are massive. Truly a man of size if I've ever seen one. But what does this number speak of your beauty? Ponder this, and let the emotions happen on their own, only then will we take the picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs crazy as this sounds, you humor him. You reflect on the moment when you stood upon Jake's scale. When you read your body weight out-loud. The moment your hefty body destroyed your XXL clothing.  How did it make you feel?      </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/paw.png\" alt=\"*Paw*\" title=\"Paw\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<i><u>Large and In Charge</u>: You wear a confident smirk for the picture, compounded by an authoritative hands-on your-hips gesture.

On the other hand..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you rub your stomach, you feel all this belly on you. When you look at yourself in the mirror, you aren't looking at a weak lazy individual, you see a big strong guy whos willing to sacrifice his waistline for what he wants! You smile and place your hands on your hips. Yeah, this is making you stronger! Nobody in the world would dare pick on someone who could squash them. You are fat. You are heavy, you are the representation of blubber in the world, and you are proud! You stand tall and triumphant. You smirk as you slap a hand against your gut feeling it ripple underneath you. With enough weight, you could even make the earth tremble under your mass! You wiggle your gut some more, feeling the power of a wrecking ball inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the shoot is over, and everyone thought you did great. \"You are gonna go far working for us kid\" the otter grinned. You smile\"thanks, I can't wait for my next one!\" \"Its in a few minutes kid, and your gonna be with a partner on this one.\" You nod and start to head back to change for the next shoot.

You're told to sit in the waiting room for a minute, which you do - literally 60 seconds later, a yellow lab comes in and calls your name. He beckons you to follow him through some doors and down a hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, and thanks for joining us here today!\", he says. \"I'm Dr. Jones, a research scientist here at NutritionTech. We're trying to make sure everyone out there gets the healthiest food and treatments on the market. On the physical side, we're going to have you test out a product here in the labs. You're on a day-by-day auto-renew contract, but you're allowed to leave whenever you want. We pay $15 per hour and consider all testers employees, so you get breaks, snacks and any benefits you wish to claim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the testing lab, a large white room with a few chairs and some vaguely sciency-looking materials. \"So, what we're testing here today is what we hope will be the next evolution of a digital health watch. You wear it on your wrist and it actually syncs with your body. What our researchers have been trying to make it do, recently, is for it to separate out nutrients of the food you eat and dedicate your digestive resources to those first, effectively making your meals as healthy as possible. We've had a few kinks, but the team is finally ready to start testing it. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For $15 an hour, sure,\" you say, and the dog-tor removes a white band with a small screen from a cabinet. \"Great! I'll put it on right now.\" You hold out your arm, and he straps it across your wrist. You feel a quick pinch, but other than that, it's harmless, and the screen pops to life with a smiley face. \"Looks like everything's in order!\", Dr. Jones says. \"Did you eat already this morning, or are you interested in lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did have something at a diner about an hour or two ago,\" you say, but then you get a small twinge of hunger. Guess that breakfast wasn't as filling as you thought. \"But I could go for a bite, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll show you to the cafeteria. We offer all employees free lunch, and it's buffet-style - you can serve yourself.\" Dr. Jones guides you there, and it's just as he says - there's a small buffet with five entrees or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to run, there's a meeting in a few minutes, but I can come get you when it's done,\" he says. \"Shouldn't be more than an hour at most. You OK hanging out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you tell him. \"I'll get a bite and then just play with my phone for a bit.\" Satisfied, he rushes off, leaving you in the mostly-empty cafeteria. There's only a few people - a lioness scientist eating a salad while reading the paper and a German shepherd sipping a coffee and frantically typing on a laptop - so you feel fine helping yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander around the buffet, checking out what's on offer. There's chicken Parmesan, buffalo wings, Caesar salad, fried rice and a soup of the day, as well as a dessert table with some cookies and ice cream. Your hunger has picked up a little bit, so you feel free to help yourself to a little bit of everything, filling a plate and sitting near the back of the cafeteria's seating section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, you finish your food, which was all excellent. You laze around afterward, fooling around on your phone and letting your food settle, when about five minutes after that, you get a strange feeling - despite finishing a pretty big plate, you're still hungry. You wait another minute or two, but yep, your stomach's still growling. Shrugging, you walk back up to the buffet and get another plate, slightly smaller portions but mostly the same thing. You eat it slower this time, but when you finish you're hungry. Again. This is getting weird, you think, but you still have another half-hour before the doctor comes back to check on you, so you shrug and get a third plate. It is free food, after all. You finish it faster this time - strangely, your hunger is picking up steam as time goes on - and get a fourth plate, which you also finish faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Dr. Jones returns, you've just finished a few cookies and started in on some ice cream, your hunger finally subsiding. You're about halfway done when he comes in, and you call out to him as he looks around for you. Unexpectedly to you, as he looks you up and down, his face falls and he looks hugely concerned. Wondering why he's responding like this, you look down at yourself as well. And, yeah, that's new. Your clothing, a button down shirt and pair of khakis, isn't exactly properly fitting like it was this morning. You're...</span></div></div>",

What are those?\" you begin to ask, but your question is answered. You can't believe your eyes- the four catgirls pull a zipper at the top of their suits, and the whole thing falls off. But as it falls to their feet, the surprising thing occurs- the formerly skinny girls expand outward in every way like crazy! Before your eyes, the lithe girls get very thick! Within seconds, you are face to face with four 300-pound cats, wearing bikini tops and mawashis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, much better,\" says Tracey. \"So, guy, time to start your training.

You attempt to get up and run, but they grab you before you can take a single step.

They quickly return and lash your legs and paws to the sofa's legs. \"At this point, people who aren't sure usually try and bolt, and if they get outside, it's a wash, as we'd have taken off the suits and couldn't chase without making a scene,\" says Tracey. \"You called and you're not going to waste our time anymore. You said you're hungry? Well, let''s feed the growing boy, girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four get into action while you are left in your chair. Two of the girls go through your cabinets, grabbing any and all snack foods, while Tracey, the white catgirl, heats up frozen dinners from your fridge. Stacey puts her suit back on, which covers up her body again and makes her look 1/3 her size, and runs to the van, grabbing a box full of what appear to be spices and powders. Once she gets back inside, murring at the pleasure of taking her suit off, she begins sprinkling the stuff all over the food the others are getting ready for you. Eventually, the four come back to your sofa with piles and piles of food and sodas. \"I'm not really that hungry anymore,\" you lie. \"Oh, that's too bad. Looks like we have to feed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey straddles your chest, lying on your lap and stroking your chest. You feel yourself getting aroused, and you begin gasping in wonder. As you open your mouth, she shoves a fistful of food into your mouth and forces you to swallow. As the food enters your stomach, you suddenly feel hungrier. The girls take turns force-feeding you for a while until you feel so hungry, you grab a bag of chips off the piles and begin shoving handfuls down your throat, which gets looks of approval from the girls. The more you eat, the hungrier you continue to become, to the point where you're literally pouring food into your mouth. The girls continue to watch with growing smiles on their faces for another ten minutes, until you stop long enough to ask what's so funny. Stacey points at your body and tells you to look down.

The instructions were a guide to getting big and strong. \"Hmm.. I hope I made the right choice\" You say as you decide to make a chili and sprinkle some of the powder on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start heating up the chili, but its gonna take a half hour before it'll be ready.

His skin tight shirt clearly defines his sagging chest, but also the well-muscled arms. You can't see the tail, but you bet it's pretty big too. His face is bloated, but he had a strong, square jaw. He looks slightly worried, and says in a thick Australian Accent, \"Crikey, mate, sorry, didn' see ya there!\" He offers a blubbery hand, and you take it, he lifts you up, and dear God, his grip feels like a  pair of steel pinchers. \"I was on my way to this great new ba' down the street, supposed to have great Shrimp on th' Barbie! I'll buy ya a round, my treat!\" \"Uhhh...\" The Roo has  a friendly, almost pleading look on his flabby face, you'd feel really bad about refusing his offer, but you're already late for work, really late, oh, what to do, what to do...</span></div></div>",

Then again, \"flexible\" and \"understanding\" aren't the best words to describe your boss. He'd probably fire you. Not to mention your new \"friend\" might make you eat yourself sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then again, it does <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">feel</span> taste good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nod. \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The roo grins and slaps you on the back. Kinda hard. \"Atta boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So he orders the two of you another round. While he digs into his serving, you eye yours warily. Twenty of the shrimp this time, and just as big as the rest. You try to eat more slowly this time. Try to. After one bite, you're back to devouring them with reckless abandon. Your stomach protests, but you ignore it. Very rarely were you able to indulge your appetite like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Come to think of it, you've never indulged to this extent before. Maybe it's because you never tasted food this good. Regardless, you're enjoying yourself too much to care about anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The roo says something to you. It sounds like a question, but you couldn't catch it over your glutting, so you grunt in the affirmative and keep going. Then he slaps you in the back again and knocks the half-eaten shrimp out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ha! Thought so!\" he says. \"Lemme guess, your boss is as mean as cat's piss, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, it's about your job. You assume he was asking if you didn't really want to go to work and nod. \"He's just... Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The roo gives you a lopsided grin. \"I getcha. Prob'ly wish ya had a better job, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or at least the same job with a different boss.\" You sigh and slouch a little. Your stomach protests at the movement. \"He's gonna fire me for being so late. I just know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The roo hums thoughtfully and looks away for a moment. Then he turns back to you with a sympathetic smile. \"Tell ya what: if that happens, I'll help ya look for a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your ears perk up. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He nods. \"'S my fault you're late in the first place. Though if I <i>do</i> getcha fired, I might be helpin' ya, in a way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You don't have an answer for that, so you just shrug and get back to your shrimp. Stomach pains be damned, you're going to enjoy this while you can! It's better than putting up with the boss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The remaining thirteen shrimp go down in short order. You almost choke yourself by trying to shovel in more than one at a time. It feels like your now distended stomach is swelling with each bite. Hell, considering how big each shrimp is, you wouldn't be surprised if that is the case. It doesn't bother you one way or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>It's kinda nice, actually...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The thought makes you slow down for a second. Then you pick your pace back up. You <i>do</i> kind of enjoy it, in all honesty. No sense in trying to deny it. Maybe you'll come back and do this again some other day. As you finish you last shrimp, you decide to come back here sometime next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A low whistle from the roo snaps you out of your thoughts. \"Not bad!\" he says. \"Think I ate about the same when I was that small!\" You must be staring at him funny, because he laughs and adds, \"What? Thought I was born this big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You blush and stare down at your gut. A split-second glance reminds you that, yes, his is still much bigger. An image of you at the roo's size flashed through your mind. Your blush deepens. Then you try to get up, but a sharp pain shoots through your stomach. Biting back a yelp, you ease back and tenderly rub the distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-oh.\" The roo places enough money to cover the both of you on the counter. Then, in a move surprisingly fast for his size, he lifts you up from your stool and onto your feet. After promising the bartender he'll come back another day, he leads you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\" you manage between grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No problem, mate,\" he replies. \"Say, how 'bout I take you to my place an' getcha somethin' ta help with all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You don't even stop to think before answering. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His couch is comfy. Very comfy. You could probably get lost in how soft it is if you weren't preoccupied with your stomachache. Thankfully, the roo's already given you a pair of digestive supplements, which you've already chased down with the glass of water he also gave you. With nothing better to do, you examine what you can of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He seems reasonably well off. There's plenty of space for someone of his size, and there's plenty of pictures and posters decorating the walls. There's a running sumo theme to them; makes sense, given his body. He's got a pretty big TV, surrounded by cabinets and drawers that you assume to hold his DVD collection. It must be big. The walls are a fine white, and his hardwood floor looks pretty well maintained. Does he take care of it all by himself, or does he have any help? Does he hire people to do the work for him? If he does, he may be better off than you first thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn back to the roo. He's standing on the other side of the glass coffee table, holding the bottle of those pills he gave you and smiling at you sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" you ask. His face tenses a bit.</span></div></div>",

Damn, that's a killer grip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ow,\" you hiss under your breath. You look back to the roo, his face still all smiles. Nursing your hand, to say to him, \"Y-Yeah, well... Um...\" What's the best way to put this? \"The thing is, I'm still gonna need to find work in the meantime, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The roo nods. \"'Course you do! Sumo wrestlers don't get paid till they're pretty high up in the ranks anyway. Oh, and if you need references, I'll put my name in for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Well, that's something. \"Thanks,\" you say. Then a thought occurs. \"By the way, how many people does a sumo stable need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The roo hums thoughtfully. \"Don't think there's a set number. In fact, there's one with only two wrestlers. Kasugayama...? No, Kagamiyama! Always mixin' up those two's names. Anyway, we could start a stable with just the two of us if we need to, but bigger's always better.\" He pats his belly and looks down at yours. \"In more ways than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You snort. \"Funny.\" Then you briefly reflect on his last comment, and a question comes to mind. \"So how do I train for sumo anyway? Some sort of mix of bodybuilding and getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The roo chuckled. \"That's about the gist of it. Your weight training, at least. We'll start by focusing on that while I teach ya some of the basics on the side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright then.\" You move to get up, but stop when your gut pushes back. Ugh. Still too much discomfort to move around. Sighing, you ease back into the couch, though it feels more like your overstuffed stomach is pushing you back. You sigh again. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The roo shrugged. \"Dunno. Gonna be a bit before you got any room for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right...\" You attempt to readjust yourself, only to stop when you feel the cell in your back pocket pushing up against the back of the couch. Come to think of it, you haven't checked it since you ran into the roo. And there's that call you missed. If you know your boss like you think you do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You know you don't want to, but you also know you can't avoid your boss's unbridled wrath forever. And so with yet another sigh, you pull out your cell and open your voicemail. Two new messages. You hold the cell a few inches away from your ear just as it's about to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><b>\"WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You recoil and drop it. A quick glance to the roo and, yup, he hears it too. Everyone makes that kind of face when your boss is on one of his tirades. Goddamn, can he yell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><i>\"I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU ALL MORNING! YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP ON TIME--AGAIN, I MIGHT ADD--AND I WAS COUNTING ON YOU TO MEET WITH A LOCAL BUSINESS ABOUT A PARTNERSHIP TO HELP WITH ADVERTISING THE NEW DRINK! CLEARLY, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO COUNT ON YOU FOR ANYTHING! CONSIDER YOURSELF FIRED!\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You savor what you can of the brief second between messages. Eyes wide, you look to the roo, who's giving you the same look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then came the second message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><b>ONE MORE THING: DON'T EVEN BOTHER COMING BACK TO CLEAR OUT YOUR DESK!

One the one hand, you're free. On the other, you're out of a job. The prospect of being a professional sumo suddenly seems a bit more appealing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An uncomfortable cough draws your attention back to the roo.

The news channel was interviewing a celebrity professional sumo wrestler, asking him questions about what was expected for the popular sport of Japan. As the T.V. turned on, a female voice is heard as she says: \"I am with celebrity professional sumo wrestler, Hamujii Ash\u014dro, who is in fact helping with the arrangements for the acclaimed Sumo2013 event. Hamujii, what is in store for this upcoming event that has captured the attention of the Japanese public and the world population?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mrs. Halls,\" Hamujii Ash\u014dro said in a Japanese-American accent, \"I've been helping the Association get ready for the event. the Association and I have been planning this event since late 2011. It has been long time with agreeing, disagreeing, and compromises to prepare event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everyone here must be excited, people have been lining up for this event. How much longer until the event opens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too much longer, estimated at 4 weeks prime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4 weeks?  And you allow these people to wait here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting in line separates hardcore fans from regular fans. We tell them that they have time to go back to lives and comeback when we ready, but they enjoy sumo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anything else? What are some of the things people will witness at this event?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not to give much, but I have been chosen to host.

It represents highest rank a wrestler can achieve by continuously making kachikoshi, or majority of wins, in tournaments. I am undefeated and reigning victor. I am imposing a challenge that if you defeat me in ring, winner will be given 250,000 yen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"250,000 yen. Wow how exciting.

Heh</i>, you think to yourself as you scrach your sides and head for the bathroom. Hopefully, your waterbill hasn't come yet. A few minutes later, you are in the bathroom and you test out the shower by turning the cold water knob. EUREKA you still have water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile made the corners of your muzzle curl up slightly as you scratch your belly. {i]Wait...when did that get there, you think as you arch an eyebrow and look down. Your eyes slightly widen at what you see. Where your flat stomach was, was a small buldge. You could have sworn that you lost all of that fat when you went into hibernation. You sigh as you shrug it off and pull off your pajama bottoms.

A little more frightened at this, you walk over to the scale and step onto it. \"Let's see, before I gained all that weight for hibernation, I weighed about 250,\" you mutter to yourself. When you looked down at the scale, your muzzle hung open as you read the number, \"285?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back off of the scale and head into the kitchen. You were strangely still hungry after that big breakfast before. <i>How did I gain thirty five pounds in the shower,</i> you thought to yourself as you reached the kitchen. Your body already used to the extra weight as the weight you got to for hibernation was around 320. You sigh to yourself as you walk into the kitchen and looked around.

You look at the fruit bowl in your kitchen, which you normally just occasionally eat from and refill with a grocery trip.

After five cookies on a roll, you stop to breathe and start feeling that feeling again: a warmth inside your stomach at first, then spreading lower to your abdomen and hips, slowly fading away. It's a funny, but very good feeling, and you end up with your eyes closed enjoying the moment. You get back on the cookies, this time going slower, to better feel the chocolate and enjoy the warm growth on your tummy and hips.

When you start heading for the door, you notice that your belly is jiggling! Not very much, but it feels awesome, you think. You hop a little just to feel the fat in your stomach bounce a little more and the door bell rings again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jezz, the pizza! I almost forgot!\" You run for the door and open it to find a little mountain of pizza boxes, the delivery man hidden by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Aww man, that's not a life! - complains the delivery boy, with a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take some of the top boxes and you see a cute bunny girl in front of you. Startled, she excuses herself, blushing a lot, the white fur not helping a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh, so you take orders and make deliveries too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Yeah, we're a small restaurant, so it's basically me and my boss. - she says still blushing - So, here's your order, Mr. Blackpaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can call me Phill - you say taking the rest of the pizza. - You are?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Jennifer, but I guess you can call me Jenny. - and she gives a small smile with the side of her mouth. - As a retribution for the inconvenience, you can have this extra pizza, on the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the pizzas and place them on the dinner table, heading back to pay her. You can't help but to notice that she's staring at you when you giver her the cash, and then it hits you: you are in pijamas, with a belly exposed for everybody. It's your time to blush, and both get caught in an awkward moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally breaks the ice and quickly thanks and leaves, not without failing in giving some supposedly discrete looks at you. You just stand on the door, without much reaction until the little car disapears on a curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to the kitchen, you can't help but think about Jenny, the little conversation going back and forth in your head, while you grab a coke and open the first pizza box. The smell brings your attention back to the present time, and what a time it is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza smells so good that you almost start salivating out of mere antecipation. The pizza is rich with topping, the oily toppings almost sweating fat. You take one piece and closing your eyes, you slowly lowers is into you mouth, taking a bite. You feel like in an acid trip, as your taste buds go frenzy and gives you tastes that you've never really noticed. You then eats the rest of the slice with one bite. You start feeling the warmth again, and remember to take it slowly to fully enjoy this moment. Time seems to dissapear as the first pizza end up into your belly, and you wash it out with a full can of coke, giving a loud belch at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProudly smiling of your belch and loving this pigging out, you head for the second box. As the pizza vanish, you start to grow, specially on the gut and hips. You even feel your butt growing, as your pijamas start to get tighter. The belly is getting rounder, but still soft, and you start caressing yourself in the belly, giving yourself shivers of pleasure, sometimes. Not only your gut grows, your chest start to get soft too, and you move your hand to explore it, giving it some nice rubs and squeezes as your man breasts slowly develop. Your pijama pants start to get tight, and you love the felling of having yourself surrounded by the clothing in every inch of your hips and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you get to the last pizza, you open your eyes and notice that your gut swelles quite a bit: it's sticking out almost two inches from your pants. By the way, your pants are being strained from the pressure from your newly fattened legs. You head to the mirror in your bedroom to notice that you officially have man boobs, and your arms have put in some mass themselves. The only thing that doesn't seem to have changed much is your face, mosly because of your muzzle, because your neck is thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the pizza is gone, and you spent almost two hours eating it. You never thought that you could eat a pizza  yourself, let alone six! It's almost lunch time and you don't feel full at all. The effects of the pill must be ending in some moments. What to do?</span></div></div>",

Since the effects of the pill are wearing out, you decide that now is a good time to stop and get some food, cause you know you'll be needing it. You could eventually rent some movies to make a marathon/binge duet later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first barrier to it was that your pants were pretty tight around your legs, so instead of fighting with them you just put some sweat pants over them and wore a big green sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car waited with a new discovery: you had to move your seat a little to the back, because your belly was starting to touch the steering wheel. When you finally adjusted the seat, you headed out for the nearest grocery store, five blocks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store never seemed so marvelous to you. Every product screamed for attention and, most important, a place in your shopping cart, which of course, you were more than happy to oblige. Cookies, chips, lasagna, chocolate, icecream, ham, cheese, brownies, you name it, everything was there. You ended up filling two cars of shopping, and had to get some help to get them to your car, not without the cashier asking you what army you're going to feed with that much food. You, of course, just gave a ironical smirk and moved on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back you passed by a store for big guys, and you thougth why not, so you ended up inside. The place was really big, and even the attendents were a little chubby. You wandered a little before finding something that pleased you, which of course were more of the same clothes that you've used so far: jeans, plain or button shirts and some shorts. You ended up buying XXL items, which got you a surprised and questioning look from the attendant, that quickly disguised it behind a smile and a pleasant attitude. She even ended up showing you a costume section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- It's a new section, so our prices are promotional. Feel free to brwose around and if you need anything, just call me, ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left, you started looking. Clowns, roman soldiers, firefightes, all of the usual costumes were there. Then you saw it: a sumo belt. You quickly remembered the mail you got this morning and you instantly got fond of the costume. It said \"sumo mawashi (sumo belt)\" on the label, and you got an XXL version of it too. You paid for everything and got back to your place. Everything was feeling great, and you even sang along with the music that was on the radio, something you didn't remember doing in a long time. Just to create a habit, you stopped at the nearest fast -food restaurant and ordered some burgers and fries, and donnuts with some soft drink (actually, a liter of it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to your place and unloaded all the stuff of your car. Man, when you finished putting everything in the house you were famished, and you were just about to resume your gorging when you remebered the pill. Should you take one now or would you like to try out your stomach to see how much it can handle?</span></div></div>",

You then see the sumo school brochure, and you take another look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dragomike Sumo Accademy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt our accademy, you'll discover the arts of this milenar fighting style! You'll improve physically and mentally, and find very helpful instructors and friendly colleagues, friends for a lifetime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop by and have a free lesson!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe I'll stop by when I can fit my mawashi, hehe.\" you smile. It's time to keep on eating, and you go for the bags of food you bought on the fast-food restaurant first. You actually take some time looking for them, as your kitchen is filled with bags, and they all look the same. \"Good, it's still hot.\", you think as you manage to find the bags and take them to the dinning table. You then see the camera where you left it, and have an idea. You set it to shoot a picture every 30 seconds, and you dig into your meal. Needless to say, it's vibrating with taste and spice, and you almost choke trying to eat a whole burger at once, the camera catching that 'kodak' moment. Burgers are meaty and with a lot of cheese, and they almost melt in your mouth when you take a bit out. The fries are crispy and extra tasty. Just to give that extra touch, you put in some ketchup on them and continue shoving food on your maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're done with all the 5 burgers and the 4 french-fries, you notice how snug your sweater is on you. Your belly is very noticable even with this discrete sweater (dark green helps to hide the pounds), and you start posing for the camera to make some pictures of you massaging and grabing your gut, the love handles that are also noticable and even a pat in your but (you feel naughty doing so, but since it's just you, it's ok). You then remember that you still have your pajamas trousers on, and they are complaining about the strain your legs are putting on them. You take of your clothes, just to remain in your PJs, and you resume eating, going for the donnuts (all 3 dozens of them) and the rest of the soft drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel really warm when you finish it, and the feeling of the fat pilling up is undescribable! You enjoy your growing body so much you end up hugging yourself to feel every inch. Love handles, man boobs, and a special attention to your navel, that is much deeper than before, now that you belly sticks 7 inches from your waistband, that is distended itself. Your butt floats in the air because of the tightness of your trousers, and your tail sways happily as you caress yourself. This time, even your face puffs out, a little, that's true, but it's better than nothing. Your neck is really thick, and the beggining of a second chin is noticable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, your stomach complains again, and you resume eating the things from the grocery store, putting the frozen food on the oven and eating all the junk food you got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou literaly ballon out in the next few hours, because you end up eating like a mad man, giving yourself time only to breathe, and your pants show it. They are impossibly tight, and starting to rip. \"It's like a skin coming apart\", you think, and grab even more food to help it rip faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are eating a bag of brownies, you feel like farting, and when you do, the sound you hear is different: rrrrrriiippp!!! And the back of your trousers are open, from the tail hole of it to the undersides of your pants. Your fat flesh spill out to relieve itself from the strain, and you fell a cool breeze touch your butt and other regions, as you smile a big and satisfied smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ripping is so much fun! I wonder if I can go all the fatten untill I rip it all the way.\" You get the now hot food from the onven and resume your pigging out, the seams on your legs slowly giving away to your big thighs and legs. They are already touching themselves down to your kees, and the last of the fabric falls to the ground, you realize that you've eaten almost half of the stuff you brought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou amaze yourself, you're HUGE! You don't know how much you weight, but it must be more than 300 pounds! You feel yourself, starting with your face, and you definately have a second chin now, and a respectable one at that! You head to your bedroom, to check yourself on the mirror. The fur you meet is almost a stranger to you: you wouldn't recognize yourself if it weren't for your fur pattern, a light brown color that goes from your chest to the insides of your thighs, underside of your tail,hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body jiggles with your every moment, but you don't seem to have a jelly body, you find it almost firm in a strange way you can't quite explain. The most noticable thing about you is your gut: round like and sagging to the point of covering your crotch, it's big and beautifull, and when you pat it, waves form and travel through your whole body, waves of pleasure following them. Your tits (yeah, they are certainly tits now) follow the design of your belly: round and big. You certainly would need a special bra if you were a girl, and they are wonderful to touch and squeeze, and you spend a good time just pressing a boob against the other, and hopping around just to see how your body jiggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour love handles are big as car tires, and you almost can't grab them with your hands. They continue on your back, on top of your big, round butt. \"Guess it wasn't the pajamas that were holding my butt, but the other way around\" as you look at your big ass floating in the air. Your round furry end is a spectacle by itself, with it's near perfect roundness, starting to engulf your tail, the poor thing pressed between the love handles and the butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs are round large tree trunks, and your knees are pratically invisible, as your thighs spill on them. Even your feet are puffed, and when you giggle at the sight of them, your whole body shakes along!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you are, a whole new person, fat spilling out everywhere. You get curious about your weight, but you also feel like trying that sumo suit now, \"just to see if it fits\", you think. What to do?</span></div></div>",

You stop to think for a while, and you go for the scale to see it in your mirror. As you bend down towards it, your big gut starts to pull you down, and you  loose your balance, heading face, or better, gut-first into the floor. Your face never got to touch the ground, because of your belly stopping you right before that happended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well, who would have though of that, a personal air-bag, hahahha!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally manage to get the scale to your room, and you check the marker out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Woow!! 403 pounds?!? Man I'm HUUUGE! Those little pills are crazy, man! I'm pretty much like those sumo fighters, allright, no difference at all - and you laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start positioning yourself like the sumo guys, only to almost do another dive in the ground. You then head back to the dinning room, and you realize it's night already. \"Well, I better lay of the pills for today, or I'll end up imobile before midnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you got nothing else to do, you just grab a bag of chips and turn the TV on. Watching TV naked was a long waited, but repressed dream of yours. You'd always feel dirty for having your bits on the show, even if all the blinds were shut and you were alone in the house. You felt dirty, but now it was all history. This felt right, your gut sticking a good foot and a half on your lap (you know how bellies seem to grow when you sit), your wide butt covering two of the three seats of the couch and fat spilling everywhere, your boobs resting on your gut and your second chin on them. \"Kinky\", you think as you chew your chips, but this time you don't feel bad at all, and you chuckle alone watching an old samurai movie.</span></div></div>",

This will be your shining achievement: standing here in front of Roberto\u2019s Buffet, with your apple-green pills in one hand, the $4.78 cost for the all-you-can-eat mega-buffet, and a 4X outfit you bought for just for the occasion. Your stomach gave an anticipatory growl. You pat your rumbling gut, smiling at the ripples of pleasure it produced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatience. Soon, my well-formed friend, very soon\u2026\u201d you tell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in through the automatic double-doors, and immediately your sensitive wolf nose picks up delectable mouth-watering treats, one right after the other. Steaming-hot pizza with warm crust and melted cheese, honey-butter spread rolls (which you hoped would put some rolls on you), and STEAK. Lots of steak. And lots of different foods everywhere, as much as you wanted. And you wanted it ALL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the mother of all grins on your face, you shill out to the waiter (or waitress, you were going too fast to tell), and make your way to the buffet. Quickly gulping one of the green pills with a glass of coke (Yay for self-served refills!), you grabbed one of the larger plates and piled it as high as you possibly could and still carry it. Corn, mashed potatoes, rolls, chicken, pizza, lasagna and plenty of others. You pick up your fork and load it up with mashed potatoes doused in brown gravy. Half a second later, the hot potato was making its way down your throat and making your lower jaw quiver. Sure, this place had pretty good food, but it seemed like the pills made everything taste better. After that first forkful, you didn\u2019t stop: you practically inhaled the mountain-like plate of food, the same ecstatic grin on your muzzle. Even the slight obstacle of an empty plate couldn\u2019t stop you: According to eyewitness reports, you had the fastest time from table to food and back, with an equally stacked plate. And demolished it just as quickly. And got another just as quickly. And so on and so on and so on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good two solid hours of gorging later, you relax and let out a sigh, placing your paw on your distended gut. Your sigh then transformed into a murr of sheer pleasure. Your stomach was a full, gorged ball, the skin stretched across it\u2019s massive surface. Beneath the soft, grey fur of your paunch was an immense, vast reservoir of fat. Apparently, the pills had done their job, and even stole a few pounds from surrounding plates and added them to your gut. Your stomach was around two feet of wonderful, beautiful fat. Your rump was no less impressive. It was squished into the chair, spreading across all four sides. You had developed a third chin, with the beginnings of a fourth on their way. Your arms and legs were like tree trunks, thick and heavy. All in all, a good 550 pounds of blubbery wolf. You chuckled, jiggling your stomach slightly. You\u2019d definitely fit into that mawasahi now. In fact, that\u2019s where you were headed, once you levered yourself up out of this chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get to the hall (there were directions in the brochure)\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You, of course, start pigging in the pizzas. The pills start taking into effect and you start getting bigger by each minute. After your done, you start putting on your sumo belt again, but now it seems to squeeze a little. Still you make due, you start doing sumo poses and actually pretend to fight one. Then, your belly growls again, you pat it and say<br>\r\n-Well, you just want a lot tonight, don't ya?<br>\r\nYou head to the fridge and you see the cake you never ate yet. It was a pound cake, but the pill was still in effect. You wonder if you eat it, or you just stay like this?</span></div></div>",

As you stand, a couple of pieces of what was previously your mawashi fall to the ground; stretching your arms as far as you can around the enormous pile of goop that is your stomach, you find a few more pieces buried under the various folds of your flesh and pull them out as well. You guess you'll have to get some new clothes as well. But first, you want see how much bigger your little stunt has made you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling into the room (you decided a while ago it was best to leave your scale in there where you have room to see it) you quickly realize that there is absolutely no way you're going to be able to see anything on that screen, mirror or no mirror. Your best bet is to try out a phone app you've been meaning to test, that connects wirelessly with your scale. Suddenly wondering where your cellphone has been for the last few days, you act on a hunch, and find it lurking in a fold under your right shoulder. A few quick taps with your sausagey fingers, and you step awkwardly onto the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe app takes a minute to read, and when it comes to a stop, you can't believe the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..780 lbs!?\" Your heart skips a beat.<br>\r\n\"Just a few days ago, I weighed 150,\" you do a little math in your head. \"I weigh more than five times as much as I used to!\"<br>\r\nYour extremely happy, but also a little scared. You like walking, and moving around, and leaving your apartment, you want to be a sumo wrestler, and you can't do that if your immobile. You're starting to have trouble just at 780 lbs, if you keep going at this rate, you'll weigh more that twice that in a few days. You look back at the bottle of pills. <br>\r\n\"Maybe I should try doing this without cheating for a while.\"<br>\r\nSqueezing back into your bathroom, you flush the rest of the pills down the toilet, you can always order more if you really can't stand gaining weight the right (i.e. slow) way. 780 lbs is sounding pretty okay for right now though. <br>\r\nYour stomach is growling, and you know that even without the pills, your body's going to need more than 6000 calories a day just to keep running, but maybe you want it to do more than run? Without any clothes that fit, your going to need to order in, or should you see about getting some clothes first?</span></div></div>",

After calling and ordering your food, you look down at your growling gut \"Don't worry\" you say patting your tummy \"your gonna be NIIIIICE and full. And this time were not gonna cheat to get big.\" You smile, but then frown as you think. \"Hmm... i'm gonna need to get some excersize in order to have enough muscle to lift this thing if I get much bigger. And i'm gonna need some clothes.\" You then realise you need to wear something for when the food arrives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you hear the doorbell. You look up and grin \"oh goody! Food!\" You say getting up. You take several towels and wrap them around your lower body. Then you take a deep breath and open the door. \"Hi did you order 3 pizzas, a burrito supreme, some Chinese noodles and chicken, some\" a delivery hawk said \"Yes\" you interrupt \"Sorry for my wardrobe, I didn't expect you so early and was about to step in the shower.\" \"That's ok\" the delivery hawk said handing over the food. You pull out some money and pay him, adding a nice tip. \"Thanks, enjoy your food!\" the  hawk said as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run back into the kitchen happily and plop all your food on the table. You start drooling at the sight of it all. You then start stuffing your face happily munching away on your meal. \"Mmmm this is good!\" you say stuffing another pizza slice in your mouth. Without the pills you start to feel full, and soon you have to stop. \"eh, it wont matter. I can always get more\" you remind yourself. You then your laptop and start searching websites for new clothes and a good gym. Soon you reach for your phone and call</span></div></div>",
