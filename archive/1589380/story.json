As time passed, the simplified modern magic took root and the old magics faded away. One of these magics was referred to as \"Soul.\" Soul magic saw use in manipulating the souls of its users and its targets, freeing or shackling them from their own bodies. One such spell, \"Soul Swap\" did just this: extract the souls from two bodies and return them to the opposite bodies. This could work at close range or long distance. As with most Ancient Magic, only one known practitioner of the art still exists today, and he spends his time alone, practicing his craft in solitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, one of his charms, a single silver coin enchanted with a charge of \"Soul Swap\" has escaped from him and landed on the bartop of the worst place imaginable: the Fairy Tail guild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't idle long, before the coin was picked up by someone. Who picked it up?</span></div></div>",

What he thought was a few seconds could have been hours, as he was no longer standing in the bar. Something must have happened, and one of his friends brought him back to Lucy's apartment. Natsu pulled back, pushing the chair he was planted in away from the threshold of the desk, and he jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy! This is lame! You really suck at pranks!\" he hollered out. Natsu and Happy played pranks on their good buddy Lucy all the time, but Lucy was never any good at getting them back. Natsu sat back down at yanked at one of the pleats of the skirt dangling from his hips. Dressing him up like a girl? How amateurish. Although, he admired her dedication to go as far as to shave his legs, and paint his toenails. Natsu reached down are ran his hand over his smooth legs- until he noticed the Fairy Tail guild mark tatooed... to the back of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu jolted up, and sprinted for the bathroom, knocking over a lamp and a bookshelf in his haste. When he got there, he flashed a dulled expression as he gazed into the mirror. It wasn't just Lucy's skirt, or her shoes. It wasn't just the nailpolish costuming his toe and fingertips. Heck, it wasn't even the breasts. No matter how he looked at it, Natsu was inhabiting Lucy's body entirely. This wasn't just a weak transformation spell. It's the genuine article. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, Natsu stood and gazed at Lucy's body in the reflection, occasionally looking down and feeling parts of the body to make sure it really wasn't a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he erupted with a response of \"Cool!\" and proceeded to:</span></div></div>",

He almost, almost lost himself. Is he getting used to Lucy and her bodies memories or something? A scary thought considering he almost felt himself slip away.

He had to fix this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! He we go then!\" He yelled in lucys voice, emmabressed for a second before ploping down and concentrating.

I've got to show Happy! I bet Gray would get a kick out of this too,\" Natsu said aloud as he marched towards the door. But he stopped, and took one last look in the mirror before he left. For a brief moment, he considered all the serious questions involved in this unexpected switch: <i>Would I ever get my body back? How did this happen? Will I be Lucy forever? Where's my body? Am I going to pass up this opportunity to explore a girl?</i> A brief moment passed. Brief.

Instead, the living room was as empty as he had left it just 10 minutes ealier : clean and very tidy, with a sweet perfume filling the space around him . Yet empty. Natsu figured out that Lucy hadn't acted has he had predicted : maybe she was still at Fairy Tail's, asleep as she was in her own body. Or maybe she had run away in fear towards Natsu's house. Either way, he hoped she hadn't revealed their little swap to everyone: he still wanted to paly a good prank to everyone, Happy included. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu closed the door behind is back and fell on the sofa, wondering what he could have done now.

He didn't regard them as something tragic or dangerous , but instead average : since he now possessed Lucy's whole body, mind included, it wasn't too weird that some of her memories had started tapping his mind. There was nothing to do with it , at least until Lucy hadn't showed up . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis raised a new topic to his attention . He still didn't know how they had swapped bodies all of a sudden : there was just this now foggy memory of him , still inside Natsu's ...his own body, holding a silver coin glimmering with a misterious blue light nobody else had noticed . The he had woken up inside Lucy's body, which he was still inhabiting. He just hoped that Natsu ...Lucy had been clever enough to keep the coin .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, despite of thinking that there was nothing to fear in inhabiting each other's body for a while, she ... he had noticed that his own behaviour, mind, attitude, memories... everything had been influenced and slightly modified to match the body he now possessed.

The mirror sent him back the reflection of a beautiful girl in her late teens, long golden hair surrounding an angel-like smooth face with two bright, blue eyes. His body was really well-formed : big round firm tits, held by a tight white blouse, surmounted a thin waist ; broad ankles gave birth to two long, shaped legs, only partially covered by a revealing sky-blue mini-skirt.  A reflection that now trouble him nomore. Instead , he felt something else, something he didn't expect to feel at all . Was it ...satisfaction ?!</span></div></div>",

Lucy's magic, and maybe to learn some way to fight back other Stellar Spirit Mages' one. However, he now felt like she.. he knew the book by heart , as she .. HE had read it through many times. Contracts, summonning, Stellar Spirits dimension and way to relate with other kinds ... : everything was long since clear to her... him . <i>No wait ! How can it be so clear to me if I just landed in Lucy's body a couple of hours ago ? Are her memories taking control over me ? </i><br>\r\nNatsu focused on remembering Natsu's ... his Dragon Slayer tecniques , but althouhg he could still recall them , they seemed more and more like somebody else's fighting styles. It was lke she... he had just seen someone else performing them . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing he was loosing himself to Lucy, Natsu tossed the book to the ground and began doing physical exercises, something he felt like his own , Natsu's own.<br>\r\nHe tried push-ups and abdominals, but they were now far more difficult , partly because her.. his body wasn't used to a big load of them, but mostly because his new equipment kept getting in the way : his.. Lucy's long hair kept falling on his eyes, while his .. LUCY's tits just bounced and made it very hard for him to concentrate on the exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after 30 good minutes of exercising, he was sweaty and sore. He has tied his hair into ponytail, so as to stop them from falling, and had removed the tight blouse, which was about to break off. Natsu now felt far more relieved, as his memories had regained strenght and control over Lucy's ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnluckily there was non trace of Lucy yet, and Natsu began wondering if she had been able to resist his body's memory of if she had fell for them instead. He could now go out looking for her, or he could take a shower and rest a bit before doing so. </span></div></div>",

And that was the kind of urge he couldn't resist in his current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it in, Natsu headed once again to the bathroom . When she .. he got in, she .. he istinctively picked up the cosmetics the banging door had made falling from the cabinet. Then, she ... he quickly undressed himself, tossing the dirty clothes into the laundry basket, and opened the water tap , allowing the warm water to flow inside the pure white bathtub. While the rumbling water was rising and rising to the top of the tub, Natsu couldn't resist the temptation to give herself.. himself a look at the full-lenght mirror.

The hot water hit her...him as a brickwall; yet, after taking some long, deep breath, Natsu regained her... his self-control. But this time she.. he didn't think. He could not. Soft, sweet, new sensations wer siezing him from everywhere: every inch of her.. his body was feeling the intense heat of the water. It had been a long time since Natsu had felt the feeling of heat on her.. his skin . But this time it was different. The heat   wasn't hurting him.. her, nor it was causing pain as the first time Igneel had made him hold it in her..his bare hands. Now the heat was a source of pleasure: it was easying the tension inside her... his limbs, smoothening the fear and complexively calmng him.. her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThought of running away didn't occupy his .. her mind anymore. Instead, all he.. she care for at the moment was to be snug in the warm , pleasing water. As the relax softened his senses, Natsu began loosing himself once again to Lucy, but this time it was far stronger than before. It's not like he was taken by surprise. Lucy's brain just poured itself inside Natsu weakened conscioussness , all at once. Memories of joy, fear, sorrow, friendship. Memories of Lucy relating with her first spirits, growing closer to them. Memories of her hately arguing with her father, and fleeing from hom with just some money, clothes and the stellar spirits key. Memories of her ambition of becoming a member of the terrific Fairy Tail. He joy when she was finally accpted, after that Salamander had saved her from the pirates. Memories of fighting alongside Fullbuster and Dragonigneel at Garuda Island to free its inhabitants. And finally, memories of being kidnapped by Phantom Lord under her own father decision, and of definitively cutting the bridges with her own father. This, and much more, all this poured inside Natsu at once, leaving little space to fight it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this life changing experience, Natsu finally began one with the body she now occupied and which she would have left no more. She explored the deepest parts of its, got acquantained with every single inch of it .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she raised form the bathtub, a naked goddess just reborn, she felt like she was and she had always been Lucy Heartphilia, and she really was indeed. She wrapped a towel around her chest and dried her long, golden hair. Lucy then dried her voluptous body from head to toe, and kept admiring it for some time in the full-lenght mirror, turning it to every possibile angle, as if she could only now see it with proper eyes. She  put on one of her pajamas and, after having put the magazines she had picked up before back to their proper shelf, she went to her desk and checked something just beside one of the wooden legs . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good</i> She thought <i>It is still there. Maybe one day I will let Natsu and the other read it</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then climbed up to her bed , but she only managed to open her new book before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside her, the former Natsu was still struggling against the new Lucy.</span></div></div>",

While the two comrades got back to the street mumbling about how weird Lucy was and so on, Lucy herself got ready quickly. She dressed in her usual outfit , but kowing that their mission would have taken them to the beach, she wore a two pieces bikini under her clothes. She packed some changings inside her bag, grabbed her Spirit Keys, switched off the lights and reached her teammates. She was greeted by Gray, Elsa, Mirajane, Elfman and Juvia, who formed with herself, Natsu and Happy the today-killing-demons team .<br>\r\nElsa immediately scolded Natsu for having burst int Lucy flat without being allowed to , and when he answered her back , she began chasing a running Natsu , followed by the laughter of eveyone. </span></div></div>",

That woman's the Fairy Queen!\" The members of a local Dark Guild went scattering in all directions, hollering for mercy as the strongest woman in Fairy Tail, \"Titania\" Erza Scarlet, opened her eyes. During her thrashing of the punks, she was suddenly knocked out for a few seconds by an unexplained magical blast. Their punishment prior to that moment was more than enough to cause the Dark Guildsmen to flee at their first opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu hocked a wad of spit on the ground. \"What... happened...\" His entire body felt like it was carrying a heavy load and he had been transported from the familiar bar of his home guild to a town unfamiliar to him. \"If I get some answers, I think I'm going to start wrecking stuff until I do!\" Natsu asserted; but clearly the voice that spoke was Erza Scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced Erza was speaking to him, Natsu fell to his knees almost instantly, clasping his hands and begging for dear life much like the men who had just fled from Erza themselves. \"No! I'm sorry! Please, No! I didn't mean to do anything...\" Natsu stopped and stared at his hands, clad in armored steel gloves. Taking one of the knightly hands, he banged against a matching plate of steel protecting his chest cavity. Strands of long, scarlet toppled from his head and covered his face in the scent of the latest <i>Hart Cruz</i> brand of shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-Wha-What the hell is this?!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu struggled forward, stumbling over the weight of Erza's armor. Yet somehow, his confusion brought him to the edge of a fountain in the middle of the street. The water shined Erza's reflection back at Natsu, but without her usual scowl that would emerge in such situations. Instead, Erza looked puzzled, confused, and <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a little bit scared</span> absolutely mortified. Natsu's heart beat like a hammer, and he was almost certain he could feel a frightening evil eye coming from the real Erza, where ever she might have been... But it wasn't here, because right then and there, Natsu was Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Calming down, Natsu decides to do something he rarely ever gives himself the luxury of doing; he started thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I... I'm Erza? Oh God, she's going to rip me to shreds for doing whatever it is I did. It's obviously my fault, since she would never do this to herself, and she's too good a mage to let anyone else do it to her, so it has to be something I did.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought, Natsu did not notice his armor revert to Erza's base armor, and he did not even give a second thought to the reason why it's so much easier to think now. It was like a thick veil of smoke had been lifted from his mind, giving him more room to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right before I lost consciousness, I was playing with that coin before it had some kind of magical reaction. Obviously, this coin was the catalyst for the events leading to my consciousness taking a new resting place in Erza's body. So that takes care of the 'how' part of the mystery, leaving 'why' and 'HOW THE HELL DO I FIX THIS BEFORE ERZA FINDS ME??'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to panic again, before Erza's calm face flashed in his mind, instantly relaxing his stress level. If he was in Erza, then where did that put her? If he was in Erza's body, then natural deduction would suggest that she was in his. <br>\r\nNatsu decided he was right about this, and he would need to find Erza, and together they would be able to find their way back to their own bodies. Now if only Erza wasn't already on a job thousands of miles away from the Fairy Tail guild where Natsu lost his consciousness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't let anyone know about this. I'm the one person in the guild who knows Erza better than anyone, and I will have to put it to the test and actually BE her until I can find her and fix things. Until that happens, my name is Erza Scarlet, also known as Titania of Fairy Tail and the strongest female active member.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up proudly and looked herself over. Noticing that her armor had changed back to the Heart Kreuz Armor, she smiled softly to herself. Erza had used the Heavens Wheel Armor to fight off several members of a Dark Guild known as Black Serpent who had been terrorizing this town. The town had sent a request for aid from Fairy Tail, expecting several strong looking mages, but when the gorgeous scarlet haired young woman arrived, they had felt let down and ready for their own doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't fret for long, as Erza had done what an army of mages from a lesser guild could not. She had defeated Black Serpent and chased them out of the town, leaving the villagers safe yet again. Now she had to accept her payment and the hospitality of the grateful villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around as she heard someone running towards her, brandishing her sword in case it was another hostile. Natsu raised an elegant eyebrow in question as an old frail looking man shuffled up to her, wearing a face of hero worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Scarlet, let me first offer my most sincere apologies for ever doubting a beautiful woman like yourself could ever be anything less than what your legend describes you as. We are very grateful for what you have done for us, and would like to offer you a room at one of our taverns and a village-spread party in your honor later this evening. Will you please accept our offer, and let us show our gratitude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu thought about it for a second, before deciding Erza's body did feel a bit tired. She smiled back at the man and gracefully accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, she was holed up in a rather nice looking room. The villagers were all busy putting up tables in the streets, cooking and making the town ready for a party for their heroine, the great Titania of Fairy Tail. Natsu felt a bit bad for taking this away from Erza, as he had not done anything to earn this. But since he would have to be her, she was the one who would get the honor and glory, and she would accept it gracefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her armor, Natsu thought about what she would wear for the party and decided Erza was always more formally dressed than the occasion required of her, so she would have to Exquip a formal gown and heels, and do something with her hair. Focusing her mind on an image of Erza wearing a green dress with a brown corset, Natsu summoned Erza's magic and easily exquipped the same outfit Erza wore the last time Fairy Tail had a banquet. He remembered how beautiful he thought she was back then, and he knew she looked just as gorgeous herself at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza was respected for both her looks and her abilities, and this was Natsu's chance to learn more about the woman he admired the most in the entire world. The one he would give his life for in a heart beat, if that was what she wanted. He knew he loved her and wanted to be with her, but he also knew she would never go for an idiot like himself. This was Natsu's chance to know more about Erza, and maybe she would learn to love him with time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, the current Erza Scarlet stood up and smoothed out her dress, before leaving her room intent on having a good time before she returned to Fairy Tail.</span></div></div>",

Natsu/Wendy had volunteered to keep the package safe, and now was starting to regret it. The train ride to the Magic Council's new headquarters would take until dawn, and Carla was fast asleep. Ordinarily, this would be no problem, but it was a problem since Natsu/Wendy's bladder had filled up to capacity since their encounter with the courier. Despite Natsu/Wendy's attempts to wake up Carla, she never came close to waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n' \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Man, who knew that Carla's a heavier sleeper than me?</i>' Natsu/Wendy thought, half jokingly half desperately. He/She was fidgeting more rapidly in his/her seat, desperately trying to take his/her bladder of his/her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>It's fine. Besides, how long can Carla possibly stay asleep?</i>\" Natsu/Wendy thought innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>8:00 PM (5 Hours Later)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla had been asleep for five hours, and Natsu/Wendy was desperately trying to wake her up. Despite slapping her, splashing water into her face, and even giving Carla a wedgie, she still refused to wake up. The only toilet on the train was only big enough for one person, without anything else. This meant that Natsu/Wendy couldn't take the package with him/her and he/she couldn't leave it with a slumbering Carla. However, he/she couldn't necessarily wet him/herself either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b><i>I can't take it anymore! I'm going to pee my pants!</i></b>' Natsu/Wendy cried inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, Natsu/Wendy hastily left the package next to a sleeping Carla and rushed off, in speeds that Jet would be envious of,to find the bathroom. Fortunately, the toilet was empty, but it was very far away from where Natsu/Wendy left Carla. In overwhelming desperation, Natsu/Wendy abandoned that thought and rushed into the toilet, making sure to lock the door, unaware of a mysterious figure watching him/her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla had shortly woken up after Natsu/Wendy's departure to the restroom to find herself alone and the package next to her.  Before she could question this, a white man in his late 40's took Natsu/Wendy's seat to talk to her. He had spiky,blue hair with an 'X' shaped scar on his right cheek. His pure amethyst eyes practically gazed into Carla's soul, much to her displeasure. He was strangely garbed in a tuxedo with black dress pants and dress shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a long way from home kitty cat, ain't you?\" the man said sinister tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it to you stranger? Have you seen a 13-year-old girl with blue hair?\" Carla asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have, but I'm more interested in that package you have. It belongs to us.\" the man said in a tone that made Carla almost wet herself in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you're talking about.\" Carla said sternly while visibly shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me rephrase it then. I'm taking this package or you're going to that big litter box in the sky.\"the man said impatiently. He quickly took out a magic gun from his tuxedo and pointed it straight at Carla's head, the butt mere inches away from her skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to be a good kitty, or do I blow you away?\" the man said threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll face the wrath of Fairy Tail if you harm us.\"Carla said fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're guild's days are numbered once we use that package to send those wizards on a one-way trip to Hell.\"the man said stoically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy will stop you. She'll take down every single one like you until all of you fall.\" Carla said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm afraid that she'll be getting fit for a halo very soon. In fact, my friend is planting a magic bomb on the restroom door that'll send her pretty face to Hell.\" the man said menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very idea that someone was about to kill Wendy made Carla's blood run cold. She was utterly terrified on what she would do next, but that fear soon took the form of determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will never get your hands on this parcel you brute!\"Carla said determinedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that, the man fired and Carla's world had become dark as she heard the terrified screams of the other train riders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a desperate Natsu/Wendy was busy peeing the longest pee of his/her life, he/she was unaware of a man, no older than 19, discretely planting a magic bomb on the restroom door. The man had long,blue hair that reached down to his back, with an 'X' shaped scar on his left cheek. He had amethyst eyes and was dressed in a tuxedo as well, but his was blue with matching pants and dress shoes. As soon as Natsu/Wendy's pit stop ended, he/she tried to open the door to get Carla, but it was still locked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, open the door!\" Natsu/Wendy cried out n rage. He/She had banged on the door to no avail and yelled for help. At first, he/she thought it was blocked by something, but he/she had heard a small, ticking sound coming from the door. Before he/she could scream, the bomb exploded in the same instance that Carla's assailant had fired his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1 Hour Later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla's eyes had fluttered open to reveal that she was still in her seat, very much alive. Her relief soon turned to worry as she noticed that the package was gone and that all of the train passengers had disappeared. She quickly flew away to find Wendy and was shocked to see a badly injured Wendy, sitting on the toilet. She was covered in numerous bruises and cuts, but much to Carla's relief, she opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank Mavis you're alright Wendy! I thought those brutes had killed you, but I'm so glad you're alive! Don't ever scare me like that again!\" Carla said as she cried uncontrollably into Wendy's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastu/Wendy was very relieved to see that Carla was still alive, but there was the obvious issue of who tried to kill them. In a rage, Natsu/Wendy proudly declared \"We''re going to make those jerks pay for this!\" In that instant, Natsu/Wendy's dress had disintegrated, leaving Natsu/Wendy in his/her green panties. This brought a hearty blush to Carla's and Natsu/Wendy's cheeks as they frantically tried to cover it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first, you need a new dress!\"Carla said embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"I agree!\"Natsu/Wendy said while trying not to pass out from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

However, the much more pressing issue was what happened to the passengers. The train was completely stopped in the middle of the forest and with the obvious exception of Natsu/Wendy and Carla, the train was empty. Natsu/Wendy even tried to smell the air to find them,,but to no avail. It was if there never were any passengers on the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they made a startling discovery when they made their way to the engine room. There, they found a strange crystal, similar in structure to a lacrima, shattered in pieces. Even more so, the engine room was completely empty. However, when Carla took a closer look at the crystal fragments, she was frozen in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Carla?\" Natsu/Wendy asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an Illusion Crystal. Those brutes must have planted it here from the very start after we received our package from the courier.\" Carla said fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so all the passengers and workers were all fake?\"Nastu/Wendy asked confusedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but the illusions were completely sentient. They believed that they were real to the point that one of the passengers actually bought that dress you're wearing and that the conductor drove the train to this point.\" Carla explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you acting so scared Carla?\" Natsu/Wendy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Illusion Crystals are extraordinarily rare to the point that very few have at least one in their possession.\" Carla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still doesn't explain why you're looking so scared Carla.\" Natsu/Wendy said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This means that they were stalking us the whole time and planned everything from the beginning while we were none the wiser. All they needed was to separate us.\"Carla said utterly horrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, they could have waited the entire trip right? So their plan was flawed if we were still awake.\"Natsu/Wendy said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They probably drugged my food with sleeping magic and drugged yours with a powerful diuretic; that way it was only a matter of time before we would be separated.\" Carla said appalled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news that they's been drugged, tricked, and lied to on this scale, caused Natsu/Wendy's anger to rise exponentially. Without any warning, Natsu/Wendy suddenly unleashed an incredibly powerful Sky Dragon Roar that belw the engine room to smithereens, much to Carla's shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU CHILD?!</b> You're acting like Natsu!\" Carla yelled incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Natsu/Wendy do now?</span></div></div>",

That conversation drove a wedge between the normally close fire mages, as Romeo wanted Natsu's advice on asking Wendy out, and Natsu played the role of an overprotective big brother. Needless to say, these two haven't spoken in a week. That was also part of the reason that Natsu/Wendy agreed to let Romeo come with them, as he/she wanted to find out the best way to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the (current) sky-dragon slayer, Wendy/Natsu was unaware of that plan, but aware of the argument (not what started it). Playing the role of a super protective big brother, Wendy/Natsu said, \"I just want to make sure nothing happens to Wendy. You don't mind, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part was growled out, making Romeo, Natsu/Wendy, and Carla shake their heads with great vigor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the train hits a bump at this exact moment, making Wendy/Natsu fall to the floor due to her/his motion sickness. The other three members of Fairy Tail sweat drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo thinks, '<i>I won't be able to so much as glance at Wendy if Natsu-nii is here. Damn it! Why did I have to ask him for advice? If I didn't, we'd still be cool, and I could have already asked Wendy out.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla was trying to hide her disgust at the sight of Natsu's body on the floor, '<i>I pray Wendy never acts like that.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy/Natsu was inwardly crying, '<i>I'll never laugh at Natsu-san's motion sickness ever again!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu/Wendy just stared at his/her former body, '<i>Is that what I look like when I'm motion sick?

You almost walked into the boy's bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu just nodded quickly before running into the girl's bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a one-person bathroom, with one toilet, one sink with a mirror hanging right above it, and some paper towels to dry one's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu said to herself, \"Huh, so this is the girl's bathroom. I thought it would be more different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Natsu let the backpack slide to the floor, before bending over to take out the one-piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu shuddered, the way the Natsu on the bathing suit looked at her, it had some effect on Wendy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I know Wendy's 12, but just imagine her as 14-15. It just makes it easier for me to write this.Even if the age difference between Natsu and Wendy isn't that big to begin with. Wendy's appearance remains the same.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, Natsu quickly undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds pf just standing there naked, Natsu peeked open one eye, quickly grabbed the one-piece, and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing the mirror, Natsu scowled as she realized that the only thing she could see of the image Natsu was the tip of the hair, and even that was being obstructed by the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu put one foot onto the side of the sink, and put her weight into it before putting the other foot on the other side of the sink. Bending over, Natsu got a close view of Wendy wearing the bathing suit, and if she was completely honest, she didn't dislike it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the train lurched, and Natsu fell forward, banging her head against the mirror. </span></div></div>",

He'd never hear the end of it if he wet himself in Juvia's body, so Natsu did the only thing he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move it you icy pervert. I gotta take a leak.\" Natsu replied in Juvia's body.

Natsu locked the door and tried to undo his pants, only to be greeted by tight pantyhose that he was trying to get off Juvia's voluptuous butt. He finally succeeded after a few minutes and let Juvia's pantyhose drop to the floor and frantically tried to find the hole in his underwear to pee, but was greeted by Juvia's crotch that was covered with blue panties that had \"G+J' stamped on the butt in purple letters.<br>\r\n'Right. Juvia's body, women underwear.'Natsu thought to himself. Natsu quickly pulled down Juvia's panties and rested her shapely behind on the porcelain throne. He then released a tremendous stream of almost clear urine into the toilet, much to his relief. The feeling of relief was enormous as Natsu pushed Juvia's pee out of her bladder. This feeling of relief was soon met with worry as he'd been peeing for a good 5 minutes and not even close to emptying her bladder. This went on for sometime until someone came in and took the stall next to Natsu's and was shocked to hear the voice of....</span></div></div>",

Natsu and many other were still out on their tasks, and they would have never stopped until they were chosen, but Gray was sure he wouldn't have been turned down flat, not after all he had done in the previous year : Lullaby, Garuda Island, Oracion Seis and Edolas were just some of the guild successes, and he had played a decisive role in all of them, no doubt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira came in seconds with a cold drink, and gave it to him smiling as always.

Instead, he was awkwardly looking at a brickwall, holding some flasks of alcohol in his smooth, slender arms. He felt different, completely different indeed. It was like his body had received a new asset: he was definitively shorter thatn before, his hips where wider and his legs longer than before. He could feel two heavy weights attached to his chest, and his sight was partially obscured by some locks of long white hair, which he instinctively moved away with his hand. The hand itself was cuter and smoother at touch, with long nails varnished in pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still confused by what had happended, Gray could feel a calm, iron-cold voice talknig inside his head: \" It seems that you  have found my missing coin. Very well. I'm obliged to tell you that the coin was enchanted with just one charge of Soul Swap Magic. If the two of you wish to have your own bodies back, you need to track me down. I'm Targaryen . I sincerely hope you will be able to find me, and reverse your condition. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice ceased, and Gray was finally able to move himself. Putting the flasks on the ground, he further examinated hte body he had landed into, although he already had a quite clearly idea of who he had become. He was wearing a shoulder-less, purple dress, which enhanched his new slender , curveous figure. A figure who was sbuject to envy from many girls and women in the whole magical world. He had landed inside Mirajane's body, and she was due to have landed in his one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray cursed himself not only for having picked up the cursed coin, but for having involved in this trouble the lovely Mirajane. He needed to find that Targaryen as soon as possible, or he would have hated himself forever. He hoped Mira wasn't to angry to him , 'cause the task seemed far to hard for himself to accomlish it on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice came from the bar : \" Mira, can I have some of that liquor from the Capital ? \"</span></div></div>",

Hakobe. He would swap out souls of any volunteers and return them at the end of his shows. The people of Fiore loved him, but he wanted more. It wasn't long before at the age of 20, he decided to join Fairy Tail. I had been the master for quite some time and I happily accepted him into our family, completely unaware of what would transpire immediately after.\" Makarov said.<br>\r\n\"So what happened next master?\"Mira asked. \"My greatest failure.\" Makarov solemnly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, Targaryen had been an excellent addition to our guild, even making S-Class at the age of 27, and earning enough Jewel to be on Gildarts's level. It was then that he became corrupted by the power he received for becoming S-Class; he attempted to kill me and my son Ivan to take over the guild. He used his Soul Magic, not to swap our souls, but to destroy them. Fortunately, Gildarts managed to defeat Targaryen and Prolyusica managed to retrieve them, but out of spite, Targaryen wiped out Ivan's memory of the event. After that, I excommunicated Targaryen from Fairy Tail for his selfish actions, but not before he swore vengeance on me and Fairy Tail. If I had seen Targaryen's darkness, I could have prevented that from ever happening.\"Makarov said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't your fault master. But why doesn't anyone else know about him?\" Mira asked.<br>\r\n\"In order to keep the guild's impeccable record intact, I ordered all members of Fairy Tail to destroy every shred of evidence regarding Targaryen and for all members to let Porlyusica remove any memory of Targaryen from their minds. After that, Fairy Tail returned to normal until Ivan's eventual actions forced me to excommunicate him as well.\" Makarov replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why is he back now?\" Mira asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. His missing coin does use Soul Magic, but its imperfect which is why you and Gray are inhabiting the same body. It was most likely made during his early years.\" Makarov said.<br>\r\n\"So how do we find him?\"Mira asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but Porlyusica is your best chance at finding him. She's been keeping tabs on him ever since his excommunication. Find her Mira and Gray; she's your only hope.\" Makarov said.<br>\r\nWith that a determined Mira and Gray set off on their mission to find Targaryen and reverse the coin's effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Along the way, they inadvertently ran into a forest Vulcan. It was a huge, green, gorilla-like beast with white eyes that seemed to be angry by Mira's presence.<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of this Gray. <b>SATAN SOUL!</b>\"Mira cried out.<br>\r\nIt was then they had noticed that Mira's magic seal had not appeared, leaving Mira, the Vulcan, and Gray sweat dropping at the event.<br>\r\n'Gray, why isn't anything happening?'Mira thought. nervously.<br>\r\n\"It must be because of the Soul Magic. You can't use Satan Soul while another soul is inhabiting your body. Which means we're screwed\" Gray deduced.<br>\r\nJust as Mira was about to cry out in despair, the Vulcan lunged out to attack, only to be exploded instantly before he attacked Mira. Mira and Gray were dumbfounded by what just happened until Mira looked behind her and saw Porlyusica with an open red spell book in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filthy perverts. I should have used a less messy way of dealing with him.\"Porlyusica said as she returned her spell book to her cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira and Gray had shocked expressions on their faces, but they quickly shook it off as Mira began to walk towards Porlyusica. Before she got within five feet of her, Porlyusica took out her broom and pointed it at Mira.  Mira was afraid that Porlyusica would attack her, but she was pleasantly surprised when Porlyusica said \"You need to find Targaryen don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5 Minutes Later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter killing the Vulcan, Prolyusica led Mira and Gray to her tree-house and gave Mira some tea, much to her's and Gray's relief. As Mira continued drinking the tea, Porlyusica led them to her pprivate study, which had been similarly enchanted like the closet in Fairy Tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen, the information I have regarding Targaryen is one of the utmost secrecy. Not even the members of the Magic Council are aware of this location. I understand you found Targaryen's old coin, yes?\"Porlyusica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Gray is inside of my body, while his is passed out by the bar area in Fairy Tail holding the coin that did this.\" Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very mention of this situation, Porlyusica instantly began to go into an uncontrollable rage. It wasn't as bad as Makarov, but without any warning, Porlyusica put Mira over her knee, hiked up her dress; revealing Mira's naked buttocks, and began spanking her without mercy for 10 minutes; to her's and Gray's obvious displeasure. As soon as her onslaught had ceased, Mira tried not to cry as she rubbed her now very red butt to stop the pain, to Gray's embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY DID YOU DO THAT!?\" Mira yelled while trying not to cry.<br>\r\n\"BECAUSE YOU LEFT GRAY AND HIS BODY UNATTENDED!\" Porlyusica angrily yelled back.<br>\r\n\"Why does it matter?\"Mira asked calmly, but still pissed off at the spanking session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It matters because Targaryen's charms can affect more than one pair of people at one time. If anyone else touches the coin, they will be swapped with someone as well. Also, for the one who did touch the coin, their body will become a mindless zombie attacking anything that gets in its way, unless it's suppressed by one of my spells. You need to get Gray and the coin back before his body goes off on its own. Without it, you will never be able to get Gray out of your body.\" Porlyusica explained grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that new information, Mira and Gray began to run towards the guild as fast as Mira's body could take them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Mira had entered cautiously, only to be rewarded with the door slamming instantly as she fully entered, submerging her in darkness. It was then that a candle had been lit and Mira and Gray were horrified by the man who lit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was old and hunchbacked with a cane in one hand and the lit candle in the other. He was completely bald with missing teeth and wearing a strange blue robe. All in all, this man had clearly seen better days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you, Mirajane Strauss and Gray Fullbuster.

You have it right?\" Targaryen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira had pulled out the coin from her left dress pocket and handed it to Targaryen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know its funny. I created countless fool-proof Soul Magic charms, but this one was unique. It gave the user a full experience in another person's body, without the vessel even noticing. The only way someone would notice if the person inside the vessel had enough history together. I take it you've known each other for a long time.\" Targaryen said as he began the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the power of your creator, I command you, <b>RELEASE</b>! Targaryen said in a loud booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he finished the incantation, Mira's body began to glow a bright blue and Gray's soul had shot out of her and safely returned to his waiting body at Porlyusica's tree house.  As soon as Mira's body returned to normal, she asked Targaryen \"Why did you do that so easily? I thought you wanted revenge on Fairy Tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was a young fool, yes. However, living the remainder of my life in exile, I realized how pointless it was to hold a grudge against someone who only wanted to help me. In the end I'm grateful, because I finally did my last good deed.\" Targaryen explained solemnly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'last good deed?'\" Mira asked him worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The drawback of Soul Magic is that it actually uses a wizard's own soul to power it. As a result, the wizard will eventually die an early death. I didn't want to die knowing that my final act was an act of hatred, so I sent my first Soul Coin to Fairy Tail in the hopes that someone would find it. As luck would have it, Gray found it and because of that, I can die in peace. I can't thank you enough. Goodbye.\" Targaryen said as his body began to shine blue. His body had slowly dissolved bit by bit, until there was nothing left. Targaryen's final sensation was his Soul Coin that had disappeared along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything he'd done, Mira couldn't help but shed a tear for the fallen wizard. Before she left, Mira found a heavy stone in Targaryen's backyard and slowly engraved in it with an old chisel. It took until sunset, but Mira had finished the inscription and made her way back to Porlyusica's home to get Gray, happily smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the stone was engraved '<i>Here lies Targaryen. A great wizard</i>.'</span></div></div>",

It definitely wasn't anyone he knew since he had never seen this bedroom before. Elfman removed his bed sheets and went into the adjoining room, which was hopefully a bathroom.<br>\r\nElfman was glad that his hunch was right since he had an incredible urge to take a morning pee. As he made his way to the toilet, he stopped and looked at his reflection in the mirror. He was in Ultear Milkovich's body! Even worse, she was a woman! Elfman/Ultear was dressed in a pink bathrobe,completely naked underneath. His/Her new hair was long and dark and his/her face was quite lovely, even with red irises. The only reason Elfman knew who she was, was because of his knowledge of the Magic Council.<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable! How can I call myself Fairy Tail's manliest man if I'm a woman?!\"Elfman/Ultear wailed loudly.<br>\r\nIt was then that Elfman/Ultear sensed a dark presence in the room and recoiled in sight of a man in a cloak behind him. He/She turned to face him and was met with a light chuckle.<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the new body Mr. Srauss?\" the man said.<br>\r\n\"You did this?<b> A REAL MAN DOESN'T CHANGE OTHER MEN INTO GIRLS!</b>\"Elfman/Ultear exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"Like your'e one to talk. You should be grateful my coin put you in the body of the lovely Ultear.\"the man replied.<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap. <b>WHO ARE YOU?!</b>\" Elfman/Ultear demanded.<br>\r\n\"All in good time, but you may call me  Rus Bushdan\" the man replied.<br>\r\n\"<b>Why are you doing this</b>?!\"Elfman/Ultear angrily asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm bored.\"Rus said before disappearing in a cloud of black smoke.<br>\r\n\"Come back here! Come face me coward!\"Elfman/Ultear yelled to no avail.<br>\r\nBeing at a dead end Elfman/Ultear was forced to face the full gravity of his/her situation. He/She was in Ulter's body with Ultear most likely in Elfman's body. Even worse is that Ultear's body needed to pee and there was no way he/she could ignore it long enough to find a way back to normal. As unmanly as it was to Elfman/Ultear, letting a lady wet herself was even more unmanly, learning that lesson with Lisanna's numerous bladder issues she had when they were growing up. Elfman/Ultear did't have a choice and simply rested his/her naked buttocks on the toilet seat and released Ultear's morning pee before deciding his/her's next plan of action<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was he going to get back to normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seems kind of dead in the water, and the status quo of Fairy Tail has shifted a lot since this story was created. I'm considering deleting this story to make space in my portfolio. I might do an updated version of this, or maybe not. I'll probably do something rather soon, so if you're still interested in this, let me know before I ruin it for everyone. <b>Posted 1/10/13</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne variety of Ancient Magic \"Soul\" has the ability to tamper with or misplace the souls of its users or victims. A single Soul Mage exists in the world, and one of his artifacts has found its way to the bar of the infamous Fairy Tail guild. Once triggered, the contained Soul magic switches the bodies of two targets and Fairy Tail has yet another problem on their shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive is based on the Japanese manga series by Hiro Mashima, \"Fairy Tail.\" Let's keep this literate and the chapters roughly 1-2 paragraphs a piece. When dealing with canon characters, for the love of God, keep them in character. Natsu wouldn't suddenly become sly and want to keep the swap a secret. Otherwise, feel free to be creative with additions. You can create new characters, magic types, or locations. Have fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>UPDATE</b></u><br>\r\nEpisode 19 of the anime has aired, and features a job request that causes the group to swap bodies. If you're a fan of this Interactive, you might want to track this episode down and give it a watch, even if you normally only read the manga.</td>",
