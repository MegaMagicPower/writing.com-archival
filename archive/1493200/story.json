You removed your helmet, because clearly this planet had oxygen, it was lush with dense forests, large oceans and plains. Rubbing the dust off of your head, you got up to your feet and began to walk around. The gravity on the planet was close to earths, and you could see this planet was less advanced in evolution, because it looked like a prehistoric earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperature was high, almost 90 degrees, you took off your space suit and ordered the rest of the surviving crew to do the same. It was time to look for shelter. You called your crew to come with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first destination?</span></div></div>",

Finding a small patch of berries, Sinthia immediately runs up to them, you and the rest of the crew including Sinthia haven't eaten in days. She grabbed a handful of berries, shoving them into her mouth, and swallowed the whole bunch whole without trying to test them first. She waited a few moments, and looked at you, with your face of surprise, \"You are lucky those aren't poison Sinthia, I wouldn't be able to help you.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I've got a cast iron stomach\" she said, and gave her belly a small pat. Her belly began to rumble, getting louder and louder every second, you where scared that the berries might make her explode! After a loud gurgle her stomach calmed down, \"Cast Iron\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But no, they had a bottom, rumbling to the surface was a massive head, next came a neck, body, with two plump breasts that as they arose they cracked the earth even further as they squeezed out of the ground, and then its body. The creature stopped coming from the ground, already at a massive 35 feet. Suddenly the creature swept the green colored hair from its eyes, it had the face of a beautiful 25 year old woman, with deep green eyes, the same color as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature began to look around and spotted the two of you stunned on the ground. She smiled, \"Hello why are you two so small? You must not be from this world.\" <br>\r\n\"Y-You can speak english?\" you said. <br>\r\n\"Of course, we all can!\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean we?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"This whole planet is filled with creatures like me, now lets cut to the chase, why are you in my domain of the forest?\"<br>\r\nTrembling you did not know what to say, terrified you where on a planet of giants.</span></div></div>",

Moving quickly you swiftly avoided her grabs and ran through a clearing in the trees.<br>\r\nAs you ran through the dense forest you realized Sinthia's grip was lost, you looked back and she was not there. You could not trace your steps but you did smell the strong scent of her cologne that she put on if ever so the need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the strong scent you came to a small circular clearing in the woods, looking around the circle you saw a large plant in the middle. You then realized that you had crossed this clearing before, and that Sinthia was not wandering off but she got trapped somehow. Suddenly to your amazement, the plant moved something popped out from the bud on the top, the plant was expanding in size, until it was about 15 feet tall. Then a face emerged from the top of the plant, the bud split and out emerged the upper body of a beautiful girl. She looked much like the tree girl you saw before but much smaller. She did have green hair and green eyes just like the tree girl, but her hair was much shorter, cut just about to shoulder length. She looked over to you licking her lips, purple sylive began to drool down them. Suddenly she pulled another bud our from under her rooted down body, the bud opened up and there was Sinthia.</span></div></div>",

I'm not going to hurt you, yet\"<br>\r\n\"W-What d-do you mean yet?\" you said<br>\r\n\"Not until I finish digesting your partner, I can't have two ccupants in my belly, you will just have to wait an hour before I can eat you.\"<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be eaten!\" you yelled<br>\r\n\"Well to bad, anything that stumbles into my part of the forest, I will eat them, those are the rules.\" <br>\r\nBefore you could say anything you where trapped in a vine from the ground and brought close to your captor. <br>\r\n\"Now watch closely as I devour your friend so you may see how you are going to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant girl expanded her mouth, like a rubber band and inserted Sinthia's head, slowly working along she sucked in her upper torso. <br>\r\nAlya was pleasured by this greatly as she moaned and groaned. You could hear the slurping very loudly. Sinthia's whole upper body was inside Alya's throat and she was now working on swallowing her legs. A bulge began to appear in Alya's belly, as she swallowed down Sinthia's legs. With one final gulp Sinthia was gone, A large bulge streched out Alya's belly, she patted it as it began digestion on its meal. Sinthia went lower into the ground, so that her plant half was burrowed down into the ground, her belly tightly stuck unable to fit into the whole. \"I guess I'll have to wait out here instead of inside my hole. But this is better so that I can let you listen to your partner digest.\" You began to sob as she brought the vines that where carrying you to her arms. She took you out of the vines, into her grasp. With a strong push she put you onto her belly, holding onto you with the assistance of the vines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled hard, but it was no use it was impossible to break out of Alya's grasp.</span></div></div>",

She began to stroke you, \"Don't worry it will all be over soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that you fell asleep, due to suffocation of the hard grip and the odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Alya's belly began to shrink, which woke you up.

You heard loud slurps coming from her throat, which you where looking straight down, as Alya pulled your upper body in all together. Your head was now in her throat, which was a very tight squeeze, it was coated with acid that burned at your skin every inch you squeezed down. Your legs where the only things free and kicking, but Alya held them tight with her arms as she slurped in the rest of you down her gullet. Your head now entered the inside of Alya's stomach, which smelled like the calming odor she used on you before. At last Alya slurped in your feet, which where in her mouth while your body was heading down her throat, clothes and all. As you where further pushed in, your face was dunked, into the acidic liquids in her belly, you could do nothing about it because your arms where still in her throat. She gulped down your legs, and now you started slip down further into the stomach. The last two things to enter where your legs which plopped straight down. The acid was torture to your skin, boiling and stinging, but the pain was aided by the odor of her stomach.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry honey, but I'm bigger than you, and those are the rules of the forest, that I must eat to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside Alya laid back, with one hand behind her head and another stroking her stomach. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry it will all be over soon\" she said, while rubbing her stomach harder and moaning. <br>\r\nYour kicking was no use, her stomach was too stretchy and she was to relaxed and sleepy to let you out of her stomach. This continued for another 20 minutes until your skin began to flake, becoming hard leathery pieces. It began to break off and drip into the acid, where it was disintigrated immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou where numb, the pain was gone, but your body could take no more, it gave in. Her stomach had won and you had lost. You where her prey, your only use was nourishment to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about an hour Alya woke up from her slumber, regurgitating what was left of you next to the waste that used to be Sinthia. She then stroked her belly lightly and returned inside her hole, where she could sleep in peace, that is until the next victim comes.</span></div></div>",

You watched in horrified fascination as the alien woman opened her maw and stuffed your screaming crewmate in headfirst, but she didn't bite or chew, she just kept pushing Sinthia further into her mouth and swallowing. You watched the squirming bulge that was Synthia as it progressed down the tree alien's throat and into her massive stomach. As the giant plant woman sighed in contentment you were transfixed, staring at the bulges you could see in her stomach from Sinthia's struggling.

After you all get things sorted you've salvaged enough food and water to last at least three days plus some sleeping rolls and flares for lighting so you could hopefully wait until the ship cools down, salvage the wreckage, and then get some kind of distress signal rigged up.

The three of you ventured into the caves, with the harsh red lighting of the flare as your only light source, you were nervous about getting lost in the cave as you saw more and more branching paths into a whole underground network but Nathan was confident he'd be able to find the way back out. Most of the time the tunnels were about 40 feet across but sometimes they'd be so big that you couldn't see the other side. After what felt like an eternity of walking through the dark you realized you hadn't been watching the tracks, looking around... there were no tracks. \"Hey, Nathan, where are you leading?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nathan responded as he turned around. \"Oh, I, well, when I lost track of the tracks I just figured we'd keep going deeper.\" It took all your willpower to not just facepalm upon hearing his excuse, you looked over to talk to Sinthia and then realized she wasn't there. Whipping your head around you saw movement on the edge of the light from the flare, the face of a young woman emerged from the dark, after a second you realized that from her size she must be something like 50 feet tall.

You travel for many years until your rocket runs out of fuels, your ship crash lands on a distant planet. The planets surface, much like a prehistoric earth. As you look over a cliff you see hundreds of giant creatures, half woman half animal, on the bottom half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome to my new story, please read, review and add as much as you want here are some rules though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No male halvies<br>\r\n-No giant males<br>\r\n-Scat is ok, but please don't go too far in detail that people with a weak stomach will puke<br>\r\n-The animal parts, or plant parts can only be on the bottom halves, unless you want to make a cat girl with animal ears.<br>\r\n-Plain giantesses are alright too, but I mainly want to focus on halvies.<br>\r\n-There are parts of the planet were the creatures live, like dont talk about a mermaid living in the desert.<br>\r\n-Nathan CAN! die but please make it descriptive of the way he dies<br>\r\n-Please, like most of my stories feel free to add anything you wish, but keep in mind i will be reading all of your chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnvironments<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForest:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenus Fly trap girl- Larger than human about 15 feet tall, can enlarge mouth wide and swallow things as large as itself whole. Its digestive tract is strong and acids are deadly, it will completely digest everything in its belly in one hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlob girls: 20 feet tall about, blob-like transparent lower body, but cute girl upper body until the waste, doesn't have to use its mouth to swallow but normally does, she can absorb you into her bottom half or swallow you through her mouth into her regular stomach. Blob-part is mainly digestive juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagas: Girl upper body until waste and snake lower body, it has a tendency to hunt climbing on trees but nobody really lived to long to study their hunting habits. Nagas are one of the largest species in the forest, at about 65-70 feet tall, they normally swallow prey whole and alive and like to feel them squirming around in their bellies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTree girls: Half girl half tree on the bottom, they slurp on any tree dwelling animals or anything that is dumb enough to walk straight into her mouth, immoble like the venus fly trap girl, it is usually lazy so it has a slow digestive tract. The only mobile part of this creature is its upper body down to the waste. Tree girls can also burrow under the ground and disguise as bushes.<br>\r\n________________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark caves:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpider girls: Half spider, half woman, has and 8 legged thorax and woman's upper body. They usually hide underground, in funnel tubes waiting for unsuspecting prey to slip in. They are usually 40 to 50 feet tall, and will either swallow prey whole or turn them into a liquid with acid from their mouths and drink them. They also make giant webs in the back of caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCave Nagas: A smaller naga, the same size as spider girls that usually wait under rocks and live in wholes, they usually sleep so have a strong but slow digestive tract.<br>\r\n________________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beach:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMermaids: Usually sizing between 50 and 100 feet tall mermaids prefer to suck water into their massive mouths, while the prey is still in the water, mermaids can breath air and water so you will usually see them basking on the beaches after a long meal. The ones with blue tails tend to be less active, they are the large 100  feet tall mermaids, and green tail mermaids range in size of 75-50 feet tall. They are more active prefering to hunt for prey instead of waiting for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOcto girls: Half woman half octopus, these creatures are smart, cunning and quick. They camoflauge from their prey by changing colors and either trap them in their tentacles and eat them through a small whole under their bodies(anally) or through their mouths whole. They usually range in size of 30-40 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShark girls: Lower body of a shark and upper body of a woman, these fierce hunters cannot breath air so you will not usually see them basking in the sun enjoying thier meals like mermaids. They usually gorge themselves with whatever they can find.<br>\r\n________________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plains:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat girls: Full woman body, but with cat ears and a tail, their fur color between brown to blonde, cat girls usually hide in tall grass to hunt for prey usually swallowing whole but they sometimes may lightly chew. If they are not hungry they will play with their prey for a little while until their bellies empty themselves and they are hungry again. They are usually between 50-70 feet tall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiantess: A full woman, just much, Much bigger, they love to eat and swallow smaller creatures whole and are always in the mood for pre-swallow games. They usually are in groups of 3 or 4 other giantesses. They usually also fight between each other for who gets the food first. Usually ranging at the same size as cat girls<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountains:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawk Girls: The bodies of humans with two large grey or yellow feathered wings on their backs, depending on the age. They usually live on small perches on the mountains where they feed their young whatever they find. They tend to find hunting for prey amusing and sometimes pleasureful. They usually capture prey in their hands if they see them, or if they are really hungry they will fly straight down to prey and grab them in their mouths, and swallow whole immediately. If humans where caught dead near a nest with babies the mother bird girl will not hesitate to eat them or feed them to her young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</td>",
