Nothing special came to mind whenever you were asked to describe yourself, only that you worked in IT at a local insurance office. That being said, the other night your life was spiced up a little bit when you met a camgirl at your local bar. After explaining to you what she did in her line of work, she was able to read the visible interest you took in the subject. After mentioning that she was looking for a man to join her on stream sometime, you exchanged contacts and went your separate ways. You hadn't spoken since that night, but that was about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just received a text message from that same girl, and having nothing to do for the rest of your friday night, you took her up on the offer to head over to her apartment. Hopefully you'd get to actually chat with her for a minute before she started her stream, but you had no info outside of the address that she sent you. Hopping in your Volkswagen Jetta, you drove into town, and pulled up to the parking lot outside her generic apartment building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nervously, you made your way up the stairs towards the third story of the complex, and reached the room number she had sent you alongside the address. Taking a deep breath, you stared at your feet in anxiety, and started to knock on the door. The sound of rustling inside was immediately heard, leading up to the wooden door swinging open, revealing the grinning of face of the woman. This camgirl was a</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door clicked and slowly parted inward from the frame, held together by a chain lock at about your chin height. The dim lights in the apartment complex's hall barely illuminated a silhouette in the crack of the door. The apartment's occupant leaned forward, her tidy shoulder length bob cut fell forward and concealed her face partially. She amended this by raising a pale hand to pull back her chocolate locks, revealing her pretty white face to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi hi! I'll be one moment, please,\" she chirped in a stirring accent, reminding you of the pleasant day dreams you'd enjoyed from her exotic voice alone before she shut the door and the sound of the chain lock being undone was heard. The door opened properly, revealing her darkened apartment with her figure blocking the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Mia,\" you grinned, leaning forward to hug her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled in turn, reaching just her right hand forward and halting your approach, \"I'm glad you've come.\" Your brow rose, but you shrugged off your disappointment at not getting a hug by accepting the shake heartily. Her response was innocently charming, unaware or naive of your impressions, \"Enter, please! I will be starting soon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia gestured you in, showing her surprisingly conservative outfit comprised of a dark sweater and baggy sweat pants as you entered the dim main room. There was a coffee table set up with two huge LCD display monitors on it. Most of the light in the room came from these screens, the rest having been turned off or just dimmed to nearly not being on at all. Your eyes marked how tidy this one area was in contrast to the rest of the place, which was altogether a mess. Yet, the huge, plush looking couch and it's surrounding area was immaculate. Clearly, this was the only part of her living space she intended for anyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone except you. A flutter of self congratulatory pride swelled in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want water? I was going to fill my canteen. I can get you glass?\" she patted your shoulder after shutting the door, walking past you towards the shadowy kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waters good, yeah,\" her broken english was adorable. You didn't know where she was from, but ventured a guess that she was some russo-asian mix. Pristine and proper, yet exotic and unique at the same time. Not that you paid attention to such things, but this certain case was of note amongst you and your friends who have all tried pegging exactly what made this girl so ethereally gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not that she was overly sexy, or cute, or particularly smart even. She was just unbelievable. Some mix of a delicate flower mixed with a stone cold fox wrapped into one mysteriously charismatic girl. Everyone wanted to learn more about her, though her aloofness was as constant as her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only at your bud Marcus' birthday that you had the chance to actually <i>meet</i> this girl. Of all people, she offered you a drink of her choice. A vodka tonic, pretty clean from the stinging taste of it. She chuckled, telling you that you were part of a game. You remembered being set aside by that comment, yet any question as to what the game was was only met with giggles and affectionate strokes on your arms. As time went on, she told you you'd won, and got to name your prize. Though confused, it wasn't like you'd pass up that chance. Instead of picking the obviously direct/scummy route, you just asked to learn more about her. Mia seemed to like this choice, answering any question your liquor-addled mind could conjure. Somehow, your queries let you to this invite to come over for something you never thought would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stream will be on soon. If you could start offing with clothes, we can get ready faster,\" she filled her water bottle, sealing it with her long, pale hands walking back towards the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, can you really see in all this shit?\" you asked, squinting your eyes while the present light in the room denied you the chance to develop your night vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm! Easy when I live here,\" she responded cutely, the subtle twists in her enunciation of her second language accentuating her adorable alto voice, \"Okay but quick, offy offy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... shit, alright,\" You shrugged, not one to say no to a girl when she asked you to disrobe. Your shirt was already unbuttoned by the time she wormed around you to reach her setup. Behind the coffee table was a pair of standing lights on either end of the wooden surface. Flicking them on illuminated the void of her apartment immensely. Both were focused on her, a sort of green screen stretched along the wall behind the couch you hadn't noticed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so we're gonna be using backgrounds? Like the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" she wasn't really paying attention, focusing on something to do with the stream on her desktop, kneeling on the floor between the table and couch to meet her computer at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The green screen. I was saying it'd be funny to do whatever we- uh... what we're doing at like the beach or something. Maybe the mountains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at you, her achingly sweet almond eyes beaming at you giddily, like you'd just answered a test question correctly, \"Yes! We can do mountains! Ooo~ That'll be exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, right?\" you were starting to loosen up a bit. She was eccentric, sure, but there was a vulnerable earnestness in her energy that swept away your reservations, and incidentally your jeans which now fell to your ankles. You stood to the side, only in your blue plaid briefs, as if you were waiting to go up to bat, \"Soooo, how do we do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been back on her screens, giving you a cursory glance when you poke up. Mia smirked at the site of you, \"Mmm, fantastika~\" she spoke in her heavy accent, hitting a final key on her keyboard then reaching for what looked like her smart phone, or a remote of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie dokie John!\" she chimed, sweeping upward from the floor and washing you in a wave of her odd loveliness when her wanting eyes locked onto yours, \"You'll need the rest off, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze for a second, you didn't think you'd be completely bare so early, let alone in your underwear already. You'd expected the stream to start with you two hanging out, playing games like she said, then get to business as the donations came in. You never did this kind of thing before, and she knew it. Both from you having told her, and the nerves that painted your face. Seeing your hesitation, she smirked, stepping forward to cover the last bit of space between you two. Her hands rose to rest on your bare chest, and her achingly playful gaze mad her comfortable ensemble all the more unbearably appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I help you instead, pretty boy?~\" she purred through a mischievous smile, biting her lip and running her hands down your front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh! I didn't think we'd, uh...\" how could you complain? How could you protest this beautiful creature trace the contours of your torso with her fingertips before finding your waistband? Hooking her fingers under on each side, she bent her knees while dragging your undergarments down, revealing your manhood to the cool room air until she was in a full crouch, her eyes just below the curve of your semi-hard chub while she released your underwear to fall to your ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step out please...\" her polite request was now an irrefutable command, one you rightfully answered. She stood back to her full height, her sweater covered chest pressing forward against your groin as she returned to standing, her figure now pressed lightly into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was palpable, her staring had you locked in place, like just through your eyes she could dissect and savor every emotion you could possibly experience in this moment, a coy hint of a smile sprouting on her pouting lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-d-do you get, uh... are you gonna join me?\" you stammered out, overwhelmed by this sexually enlightened entity that had somehow deemed you worthy to bless with her otherworldly presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile finally unleashed itself, enough to make your member quiver against her waist, \"Mmmmm no. Not yet~\" she cooed, a playful pout deflating the hypocrisy of her arrangement even as her hand rose up to run through your hair and making you forget to question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need you ready when the stream start, yes?\" she pulled her smart phone thing between you, holding the end to your chest, \"Are you ready? Big surprise for you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly hell, yes. There was no way you'd say no, not with this impossible opportunity, \"Fuck yeah, Mia. Let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feline eyes beamed, her thumb closing around the device, \"Excellent! Thank you friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second, your world was rocked by a pulsing wave of vertigo, the sensation of a sharp drop overcoming you as darkness consumed your environment. You flailed through the air, arms flapping wildly at nothing except the rare rugged wall of a collapsing cavern. You fell and fell and fell, until finally, your body smacked into a springy surface with muted puff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, delirious, frightened, all of the lusty anticipation you'd known moments ago had vanished in all by the slight erection you still wore, already deflating.. There was the hint of a light nearby, which you crawled over toward hoping to find some clarity in all of this delusional madness. When you broke out into the haze of artificial light, you quickly realized to your horror what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(How much?)</span></div></div>",

Wearing a little black, pleated miniskirt and black spaghetti-string top, she was showing quite a lot of pale skin.

Your heart wrings out an alien emotion as you realize it\u2019s because of how hard you\u2019re screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bright pink mouth framed by her weirdly dark lipstick was a dizzying combination as it grew larger at a rate too quick for you to comprehend. Time, in your mind, was slowed down to a crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hands up to brace yourself, but a painful shiver darts through your spine as her fingers split apart, depositing you on her warm lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing your teeth together, you\u2019re overloaded by a sense of horror and disgust as her upper lip descends upon your waist. Now trapped between the two fleshy surfaces as if you\u2019re in the center of an inflatable pool donut, you inhale another breath, smelling her humid mouth chamber, the aroma hovering between bubble gum and wet garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat was both unexpectedly harsh as well as disgustingly familiar. Hot saliva bubbles fluttered around the top half of your body, soaking slime into your shirt, as your legs kicked in midair. Your heart now pounding, the blood coursed through your veins so quickly that it quickly turned painful. Spitting out her almost-sweet saliva, you could hear a \u201cwhooshing\u201d sound shortly before a thunderous \u201csq\u2019UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUIICK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAigh!\u201d You shout in reflex as you feel your hair and arms thrust forward, the fluid around you rushing towards her throat, but your body remaining motionless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201csq\u2019UICK sq\u2019UICK sq\u2019UICK\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s sucking on you.
