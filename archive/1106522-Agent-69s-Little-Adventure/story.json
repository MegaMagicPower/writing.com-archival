Suddenly her pager went off, summoning her immediately to HQ. She sighed, found a phoine booth and warped there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agent 69, it has come to our attention that HECISB has built a new base and plans to use it to transform all the hot guys in the world into ugly ones, keeping a small percentage of hot guys for themselves,\" Agent 1 explained.<br>\r\nAgent 69 gasped in horror.<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I know. So, you'll have to infiltrate their new base. One small problem.....\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a small problem. Literally. The base is just six inches high. They have used a shrink ray to shrink it and all their personnel down so it would be unnoticed. Fortunately, we did notice it, and we are sending you in to infiltrate it. Now. Our chem girls have cooked up a shrink serum, which will shrink you down to precisely four inches high. Trouble is, it works only on living matter, so your clothing won't shrink with you.\"<br>\r\nAgent 69 stamped her foot. \"Why must I always be starkers on these missions?\"<br>\r\n\"It's only a minor inconvenience. Anyway, the good news is that your wrist communication panel implant will shrink too, so as soon as you have destroyed their device you can report back to us and we will warp you back to administer the antidote. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n\"Will my, erm, other implants shrink as well?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. Now let's get you injected with the serum. Um, we couldn't develop a shot that could go in your arm, so....\"<br>\r\nOne painful shot in the ass later, the head chem girl was explaining the serum.<br>\r\n\"It's delayed action, so you should feel the effects in about two minutes. Ok, we are now warping you two inches to the left of the base.\"<br>\r\nThe warp machine hummed, and Agent 69 was on her way.</span></div></div>",

There was no sign of life anywhere.<br>\r\n\"If they have sent me to the wrong place, I am so screwed,\" she muttered.<br>\r\nSuddenly her body tingled, she became dizzy and she got a new and odd sensation- her clothes sliding around. The serum was taking effect.<br>\r\nThe shrinking was an odd sensation- like she was falling and falling but never hitting the ground. Her clothing began to bunch up. She clapped an arm over her chest and grabbed the back of her pants with the other in order to keep them up as long as possible. Her clothes slipped and slid around her body as she got smaller. Suddenly, it sped up. She got too tiny to hold her pants up anymore, and they and her knickers dropped to the ground. She valiantly endeavoured to keep her top on as the wind blew around her exposed nether regions, but it was a lost cause. She took a step, tripped and fell over. She dwindled into her top, then eventually came to a rest four inches high, nude and in the left cup of her bra.<br>\r\nShe immediately climbed out, stood on her clothes and looked around.<br>\r\nWhat had seemed to be lifeless desert was revealed to be a hive of minuscule activity. The base seemed impregnable, and Sandra wondered if she was quite up to the challenge just yet, as she was still giddy from the shrinking process.</span></div></div>",

Sitting in her G-cup bra, she waited until her body stopped feeling giddy, and once it did, our little brave bare-bottomed agent made her way out of the bra, and on her way to the compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding behind a small pile of sand, she noticed that each of the various minions patrolling the base seemed to be on a very tight patrol schedule, and that they were in large, beetle-like vehicles.  Unfortunately her shrinking didn't allow her to have any fancy spy stuff on this mission, so she'd have to do everything by hand.  Sprinting forward, ensuring that she was still in the blind spot of the patrol, she slid under it, grabbing its undercarriage, allowing it to take her with it as she looked for a way in..</span></div></div>",

All of the minions were wearing bikinis, and none of them were her cup size, meaning that she could kiss a stolen uniform disguise goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a maintenance door, she quickly ran over, opened the door, and locked it behind her, turning around, she saw a lone minion typing away at a computer screen.  Creeping up behind her, Agent 69 brought her GG breasts down on the minions head, before turning around the stunned henchwoman and introducing her to marshmallow hell.  Thankfully her more than ample enough breasts made the smothering much faster than normal, and she quickly tied up and gagged the minion with her own bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the computer screen, she saw it was a layout of the base, and looking over it she saw three different places that could be hiding the nefarious device that she was sent to stop.  But she'd either have to go through the halls connected to the garage, or through the vents, to get to any of them.</span></div></div>",

Getting down on all fours, her massive mammaries became extremely pendulous, crawling became a chore, the momentum in her swinging knockers shifting her side to side.  As she began to see the end of the tunnel, she hear do the base alarm go off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alert!  Alert!  All personnel prepare for scheduled relocation!\"  A mechanical voice called out through the intercom.  She then found the vent she was in vibrating, and feeling warm to the touch, before everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up slowly, Sandra Shagington found herself laying not in the vent, nor in a holding room in the miniature base, but outside.  Sitting up, she noticed that she was no longer in the desert, but in what appeared to be a garden of some kind.  Making her way slowly under the roses, she saw what appeared to be a common suburbia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great!  Now we'll have to locate them all over again!\"  Bringing up her communicator, she pinged HQ, \"Boss, I've lost the base, they appear to have some sort of teleporting device.  I'm in a neighborhood somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative Agent 69,  we noticed as well.  The base is still in your vicinity, about three houses down the street.  Under what appears to be a broken down truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that HQ,\"  Sandra said, orienting herself accordingly, \"en route now.\"  Closing the channel, she began to make her way down the street, taking care not to get spotted by anyone or anything as she went.
