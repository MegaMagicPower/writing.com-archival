For miles all that could be seen was the rolling sand dunes and jagged pinicales of sand and rock. All except in one direction. Rising up out of the land. Like a plate in a sandpit. Was a huge satellite dish, constantly scanning the planets surface for signs of life. As Charlotte and her squad patrolled closer. They acessed how to gain entry. As far as she could see. There were three possible ways in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Front door, barred with sand after too many dust storms without being cleared, was probably still accessible once the sand was dug through. But it may take hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was also a ladder to the top of the dish, where there would probably be an access hatch, however, once inside, the way down from the hatch would be small. Too small to take their rifles. They would have to use only pistols. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Last way in was to have the transport blow in the roof of the structure, however, this method, if calculated wrongly, could destroy the computers full of data inside and vaporise any survivors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle brought her radio to her lips, prepared to give the command to her squad. What should she order though?</span></div></div>",

Private Martinez and Private Daniels grabbed the access hatch and pulled it open, revealing a very narrow, very dark environment within the base. Cold air escaped from the hatch, briefly cooling down the women gathered under the hot sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate Rachel Meyers stared down into the darkness, still confused about the nature of their mission here. She wasn't one to ask questions, and, in fact, the marines were frequently discouraged from doing so, but something about this base made her feel uneasy. At least it would be cool indoors, the hot sun was making her irritable - when her parents had forced her to sign up for the marine core, she had hoped to travel to more exotic locations than this barren desert. Her uniform chafed and she could feel herself starting to sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get inside,\" Sgt Contreras ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women climbed inside, carefully descending the ladder into the pitch black of the base. Rachel was the last to descend, and while it felt good to get inside, the darkness made her nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the power is out,\" Private Zhu said. \"Torches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone had safely reached the floor, they activated their torches, shining some light on their surroundings. They were inside a metallic room, with large steel doors - only one of which was open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zhu, Martinez; try and get the power back online,\" Felicia ordered. \"They must have a backup generator here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" Zhu said as she and Martinez passed through the open door and disappeared into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meyers, me and you will split up - you search the south of the base, I'll search the north. Keep your radio on, I don't want any surprises,\" the Corporal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Rachel replied, heading down the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel took the safety off her pistol and kept her weapon close by as she walked down the southern tunnel. Martinez and Zhu were long gone, probably working their magic with the computers in the control room. Technology had never been Rachel's strong suit, she wasn't as smart as the other women in the group, but she was okay with that - her determination had been all she needed to see her through military academy. Well...that and her good looks. Even in this environment, her long blonde hair was shampooed, conditioned and styled to perfection, while her uniform had been specially chosen to accentuate her slim, toned figure and perky, full breasts. To say Rachel was proud of her body would have been an understatement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned a corner - her torch eliminating the path ahead - she heard something move in the darkness. She froze, pointing her weapon ahead and scanning the area for signs of life...</span></div></div>",

Keeping her pistol ready, she moved ahead, scanning the room for signs of the moaning woman. \"Who's there? What's wrong?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Over here...\"</i> The woman's voice called again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was more than a little creeped out, but she kept her hands steady. The voice was coming from behind a stacked pile of metal crates, used for transporting cargo and the like, and they seemed to have been arranged into a sort of makeshift fort, not unlike one a child might make while they were playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Rachel asked again as she shone her light behind the crates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her answer almost immediately. This woman was clearly <i>not </i>okay. She couldn't have been more than a few years older than Rachel, but she looked tired, dirty and absolutely terrified. She was completely naked, and some tattered scraps of clothing were littered on the floor beside her. Most worrying of all was the state of her body - while her arms and legs were long and slender, her stomach was absolutely enormous. The woman was clearly pregnant, but she was carrying more babies than Rachel would have ever thought humanly possible! Her massive ball shaped belly seemed to have pinned her to the floor, and it rested between her open legs, pinning her to the ground. Her breasts were equally gigantic, twice the size of the poor woman's head, and leaking milk all over her distended belly. The floor was covered in the stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...what happened...are you...pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm pregnant!\" The woman snapped before letting out a loud moan as she rubbed her massive stomach. \"You have to help me...get me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" Rachel said in amazement, shining her torch on the enormous ball shaped belly before her. It was strangely smooth and free of stretch marks. \"How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This base isn't safe,\" the woman said, clasping her hands over her nipples as they began to leak milk at a faster rate. \"Urghhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Rachel asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This hasn't stopped all day...\" the woman replied, milk leaking through her fingers as she struggled to contain her swollen breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did this to you?\" Rachel asked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an infestation...these creatures. We thought we had them contained but they broke free...all they want to do is <i>breed</i>...\" she gestured to her monstrous belly. \"I don't know if the others made it. But I managed to seal the doors and hide away here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus...\" Rachel shook her head. \"What are these things?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're stronger and faster than anything you've seen before,\" the woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they're...inside you?\" Rachel was horrified. Whatever was growing inside this woman, it looked ready to tear her fragile body apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hung her head, staring down at her fecundity. \"Lots of them...and I was one of the lucky ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Rachel asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim,\" the woman replied, managing a slight smile as droplets of milk ran down her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better warn the others...\" Rachel said, grabbing her radio. \"Don't worry, we'll get out of here.\"</span></div></div>",

Their all around us! Help us!\" Suddenly the radio chatter was filled was the sounds of screaming and gunshots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martinez? Zhu!? Olivia! Lei! \" Teary-eyed Rachel turned to Kim, their wide eyes met under the dull lights of the station. \"Kim, i'm sorry..... I've got to go.....they need me.\"<br>\r\nA Lazy Smile crawled onto Kim's lips. \"Go\" she said drowsily, \"It's too late for me, but you might still save them if you hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Rachel got up slowly, her legs weak from shock, she started to back away from Kim, trying to memorize the features of the woman's face. In case it was the last face she saw.  Switching on the tracker she had at her wrist she turned and started to run, her vision blurred by tears, hazes of large objects rushed past her, seeming like memories more than things. She stopped and glanced at the tracker. Each team member was highlighted on an outline of the base, most were outside, only the four chosen were inside, she could see Zhu and Martinez in the Control room for the dish, they were both in a corner, obviously fighting for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set a marker on the Control room and started to sprint once again through the small, dark metal corridors. Her breath coming in small, shallow huffs, a tear rolling down her cheek.Then as she turned a corner, she ran slap-bang into a heavy blast door, welded into the door, in dark block letters, were the words \"Control Room\".To the left was a panel in the shape of a human hand. She quickly slapped it with one had while aiming her sidearm with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heavy Steel door grinded open with the shreek of metal, not waiting till it was fully open, she dropped to a crouch and rolled under, already scanning for targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe First thing she saw was Pvt Zhu, Unconscious, being dragged into a ceiling vent. It was too high for her to jump to but if she hurried she could grab Zhu's legs before they were dragged up completely. She was about to sprint for Lei when she heard a sudden groan to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlouched in the corner was Pvt Martinez, she was deeply moaning in pain. Her hands clutched her flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Should I Do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wasting no more time, she rushed over to where Olivia was leaning against the cold, metallic wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhhh!\" Martinez let out a loud, pained grunt as she clutched her abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Rachel asked as she rushed over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things...they took the others...\" Martinez panted. \"They came out of nowhere. I tried to hold them off but one of them grabbed me and some sort of...appendage...came out of it's mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gulped nervously, remembering what had become of Kim. \"And...then what?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It forced something into my mouth,\" Martinez said, disgust filling her voice. \"I don't know what it was, but I feel like I'm about to throw up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was rarely the smartest person in the room, but she immediately knew what was going on here. The creatures that had impregnated Kim and the rest of the staff were the same creatures who had attacked her team. From the sounds of it, the strange 'appendage' that Olivia had mentioned had impregnated her as well. Rachel was horrified, and wondered if the fate would befall the rest of the squad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They took Felicia and Lei,\" Martinez said, supporting her back against the wall while she clutched at her stomach. \"Did you find anything that might help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel wasn't sure she wanted to tell Martinez about Kim and her monstrously pregnant stomach and milk filled breasts, it would only cause her to panic, and right now, they needed to stay calm. Discovering that she had been inseminated by a group of alien monsters wasn't going to help Martinez stay focused. Hopefully they would find a way out of this situation before Martinez starting swelling up...although Rachel had no idea how. \"Nothing of interest...\" she replied at last. \"Should we go after the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartinez steadied herself, looking dizzy as she pushed away from the wall and struggled to regain her balance. \"They can't have gotten far, and this time, I'll be ready for those...things. Can you get a trace on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel activated her tracker again, and saw that the two pulsing lights that represented Felicia and Lei were still present. They were alive...but around them were a dozen other lights, flickering wildly. \"They're being dragged somewhere beneath us,\" Rachel said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by the looks of it, those monsters have got them well guarded,\" Martinez replied, glaring down at the tracker. \"Come on, we're going after them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women hurried out of the room, Martinez moving a little awkwardly due to her growing nausea...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel held the tracker in one hand and her weapon in the other as she lead the way down the cold, dark corridor. The lights were still bleeping on the scanner, which meant that Felicia and Lei were still alive, for the moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meyers, slow down, you're moving too fast!\" Martinez snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel turned to face her comrade, who looked a little worse for wear. She looked terrible; her face was a ghostly white colour, in contrast to her usually healthy looking tan. \"Woah, Olivia, you look awful. Maybe you should rest for a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Martinez replied, wiping sweat from her forehead. \"Let's just keep moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel moved ahead at a deliberately slower pace, her eyes fixed on the tracker while Olivia watched her back. Olivia didn't look good at all, and her usually graceful, athletic movements had become sluggish. Once again, she considered telling Martinez about Kim and the fate that might await them - but she couldn't even be sure that the Latino marine had been impregnated, so she decided to stay quiet until the signs became more apparent. Martinez was still standing, and that was good enough for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls finally reached a dead end; a huge metal door that was covered in burn marks. It looked to have been sealed shut some time ago, which meant this was a dead end. There was no way they were getting past that. \"Crap, we're stuck!\" Rachel exclaimed, banging her fist angrily on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so...\" Martinez said, propping herself up against the wall as she gestured to a vent overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up <i>there</i>?\" Rachel asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They travel through the vents, why shouldn't we?\" Martinez replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can fit,\" Rachel said, looking at the narrow vent above her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Felicia and Lei could fit, we could too...or have you been putting on a little weight recently?\" Olivia smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, who was incredibly proud of her trim figure, shot a glare at Olivia. \"<i>What </i>did you say?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>nothing</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gave an annoyed grunt and punched at the vent covering with the end of her pistol. It wasn't hard to get it loose, and it soon clattered down onto the floor. Rachel put her hands in the vent and hoisted herself up, quickly moving into a crouching position on her hands and knees. It was a tight fit, but she had more breathing room than she expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rach, gimme a hand!\" Martinez called from down below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel peered down at the Private, who seemed to be having some difficulty jumping up. She extended her hand, which Martinez quickly grabbed, groaning audibly as Rachel pulled her in. Martinez was panting heavily, and looked like she was about to throw up, but she seemed determined to go on. \"Come on, they can't be much further,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling along the vent, the cold metal rumbling underneath them, the two marines continued to follow the tracker's signal. Rachel could see the dots that represented Felicia and Lei getting larger, which indicated they were getting very close now. She hadn't really been afraid before, but she realized that she would soon come face to face with the monsters who had overrun this entire base...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much longer?\" Martinez asked, her voice strained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're her...\" Rachel said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Rachel was another vent, which she peered through. What she saw in the room below her was like a nightmare; the walls of the room were covered in some sort of strange gooey substance, and suspended within that substance was a dozen heavily pregnant women. Their stomachs were so heavily bloated and distended that they were almost touching the floor. Tattered remains of clothing and underwear lay on the floor in pools of what appeared to be milk, and every woman had such massively engorged breasts that they were still leaking even as they slept. As she scanned the bulbous, naked women, she finally caught sight of Felicia and Lei!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the other women, the two marines were still fully clothed and appeared to be conscious. Their arms and legs were trapped within the thick, disgusting goo that bound the other women, but they were struggling against it desperately. There was no sign of the aliens that had taken them though...so perhaps this would be a perfect time for a rescue?</span></div></div>",

Rachel then looked around and saw the vents that Lei Zhu had gotten dragged into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Zhu, I'm not gonna let them get you too! I swear it!\" Rachel said determined not to let another of her comrades get impregnated by these monsters. She then climbed up into the vent that Lei Zhu had disappeared into. She then crawled around for a couple minutes before hearing a scream. \"Lei Zhu!\" Rachel whispered anxiously as she tried to find the source of her comrade's voice. Then, she came to an open part of the vent where it sounded like the voice was coming from, as she cocked her pistol, she peered down and saw Lei Zhu cornered by one of the aliens. Now that it was out in the open she could see it clearly. \"Reminds of the Alien movies with those chestbursters and crap.\" She whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dropped down silently she managed to get at an angle behind a large pipe, and she could see a tentacle coming out of the aliens mouth. \"No way! I'm not letting you freaks take another one of us!\" She yelled inside her mind as she aimed her pistol at the tentacle. Now Rachel may not have been the smartest of the group, but what she lacked in brains she made up for having near perfect accuracy with almost anything she could throw or shoot. So aiming at the tentacle was easily doable for her, and she fired, blowing the tentacle off just as it reached Lei Zhu. \"Yeah go to hell freak!\" She yelled out as Lei Zhu sighed in relief at the sight of her savior. The alien on the other hand was enraged, and turned to face Rachel. However, as it charged at Rachel she simply put it down with a couple rounds to it's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rachel thank God you're here, everyone is gone! They took them!\" Lei Zhu sobbed as she recalled the events that had transpired earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Zhu, but Martinez seems to be alright for the moment, but unfortunately seems to have been impregnated by those things...\" Rachel said sadly, \"but don't you worry we'll get out of this!\" She said reassuringly to her companion.

For a couple seconds, nobody moved, and it was so silent that one could hear a pin drop. However, Rachel then brought up her pistol as fast as she could in an attempt to fire at the aliens. However, the creatures knew just what her weapon was capable of, and swatted the gun out of her hands and also knocking her over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel no!\" Lei Zhu screamed as she fired her revolver at the aliens in a desperate attempt to fight back. However, her aim was not as good as Rachel's and only ended up grazing the Alien that had charged at her. The creature swiftly knocked and pinned her down. \"Rachel help!\" Lei Zhu yelled out, fearing for her life. However, Rachel had also been pinned down by the other alien and was struggling to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! Let go of me you son of a bi-\" Rachel tried to yell, but was still in the iron grip of her captor. As Rachel looked over to Lei Zhu she saw the Asian private had been knocked out, and the alien who was over her had begun extending the same tentacle towards her that the alien she killed had had out before. \"No, Lei Zhu!\" She whispered in defeat. As she shifted her eyes back towards her captor, the last thing she saw before blacking out, was another tentacle headed right for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(30 minutes later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel groaned as she came to. She felt fine for the most part, if not a bit nauseous. As she looked around she noticed that she was in the same room as before, but the aliens had disappeared. She was about to ponder about the matter when her eyes widened. \"Lei Zhu!\" She thought frantically looking around, before sighing in relief when she spotted her comrade lying on the ground a few feet away. \"Hm...for the most part we both seem ok...I mean...neither of us look pregnant.\" She thought, trying to reassure herself. She then lightly slapped Lei Zhu's face in an attempt to wake up. \"C'mon Zhu get up!\" She said anxiously. Finally Lei Zhu opened her eyes slowly, but had a scared look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel what happened to those things? Are they gone?\" She asked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they left.\" Rachel replied quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Are we...you know...\" Lei Zhu asked with a mixture of sadness and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but we can't say for sure, but for now let's find a way out of here.\" Rachel said, trying to take their minds off of what just happened.

A female scientist was voluntarily impregnated with one of them, and everything seemed fine for a while. The pregnancy was the hot discussion around the facility, and she was loving all the attention she was getting. She always had her belly on full display, open for any colleague to rub it.\u201d Karen rubs her own belly defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how do you know I was impregnated with a queen?\u201d Rachel asks as she breaks into a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was impregnated in the same fashion. However, when the rest of us were impregnated, while it was the exact same method for all of us, it was different than when she was impregnated with the current queen\u2026 judging by how fast they reproduce, their lifespans must be awfully short\u2026 if they\u2019re already breeding a new queen\u2026 this could be fantastic news, if it wasn\u2019t costing lives\u2026\u201d Karen continues to rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I still have time, right?! How did the pregnancy go?\u201d Rachel frantically pats her currently flat stomach down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 it lasted for a week\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, we\u2019re not gonna be able to reach a medical station in time with our transport!\u201d Rachel punches the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can radio out, you should be able to bring surgeons here in a faster transport to surgically remove the queen\u2026 but, there\u2019s one problem\u2026\u201d Karen raises her finger to symbolize her raising her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe aliens\u2026\u201d Rachel speaks through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you can flush these aliens out, you\u2019re going to have to rely on whatever medical supplies your squad has to keep you alive after the birth\u2026 we don\u2019t have anyone that will be able to perform the surgery, so you guys have no choice but to overpower the aliens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 but\u2026 I need details on the pregnancy, I doubt I\u2019ll have much time to fight before I\u2019m too big to do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2026 did all her growing in hours\u2026\u201d Karen says meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...What?\u201d Rachel can feel anger building inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t get too big, maybe she looked like she was due with twins?

She took a deep breath, cleared her head, and pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consult Dr. Daringer.\"  The radio crackled with an affirmation from the young private running the radio back on the transport before it fell into silence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed out into the red desert, observing an enormous dirt devil twirling and dancing in the distant wind, while she waited for the scientist to give her the proper coordinates to place explosives.  In most other situations, Isabelle would have found the dirt devil beautiful, but now it was just an obnoxious creation that made her entrance into the satellite compound that much more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked away into eternity and she was beginning to think clearing the front door might have been as fast when her radio crackled back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sgt Contreras, this is Dr. Daringer.  I have the coordinates but listen closely, if you're even slightly off. . . I cannot stress to you how important it is that your team places the explosives exactly where I tell you.\"  She rolled her eyes, as if she needed reminding, but listened intently to his instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, she called over Cpl. Dawson.  The young woman was somewhat of an enigma among her peers.  While most of the bomb crew were male and had extensive training under their belts, she proved to be superior despite her gender and lack of training.  Somehow, instinctively, she knew what to do every time.   The jokes around the barracks was that her luck would eventually get the pretty blonde blown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter receiving her orders, she hoisted her pack on her shoulders and ran over to the big dish with two of her fellow Marines hot on her trails.  Their boots left prints in the sand for only a few minutes before the wind kicked up and swept them clear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a desolate hell, what could be here that would draw the attention of the government?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a half hour, Dawson came running back, her big, blue eyes twinkling with delight.  The two lance corporals with her followed close behind, looking like little boys who just got a new toy.  Isabelle felt her own excitement and fear swell up.  Explosions were always fun, just so long as they didn't do any harm with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the area was cleared of any of their people, Contreras nodded her head and the perky bomber pushed the button.  A small fountain of red flew up and the noise roared louder than the constant wind, but Dawson did her job well.  It was tiny and controlled, and hopefully placed perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle took the lead, ordering her Marines to fall behind her and they ran over to the top of the compound.  Using proper procedure, she secured a repelling rope to the satellite and let the end dangle into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shined her flashlight into the darkness and gave a sigh of relief.  Asides from the pile of rubble on the floor, there were no other apparent signs of the explosion.  Dr. Daringer theorized they would be dropping into the entry hall and as far as she could tell, the man was dead on with his calculations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to back down from a challenge, she insisted on being the first lowered down into the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt ground level, the entry hall took on a whole new appearance to her.  Her flashlight made dust motes dance in the air, thick as snow from the explosion, but still lit up the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long hallway directly in front of her that lead off into inky blackness and two closed doorways on either side of the hallway.  Right next to the hallway, blood splattered on the floor and smeared against the wall, trailing into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of squad landed on the rubble strewn floor, Isabelle knew she had a decision to make.  Which way would she choose to explore?</span></div></div>",
