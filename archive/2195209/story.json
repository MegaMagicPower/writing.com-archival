One second you were driving down the road, then the next second a speeding car comes out of nowhere &amp; ends up killing you. However, when you opened your eyes you didn\u2019t see anything, just darkness floating in a void. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you floated in the void you could make out an old quiet voice saying something like your time wasn\u2019t up yet. Then as suddenly as you found yourself in the void you were sucked out. As your eyes adjusted to the light you realized that your surroundings were different. Everything looked and sounded different. However, as you continued to look around you found your eyes staring up at a sight you knew: the red keep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What the fuck\u2019 you think. You look around more frantically to confirm your suspicions. But as you looked around you became more convinced that you were in fact in the world of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that was freaking you out was the fact that you didn\u2019t have a body. Yep, after several minutes of trying to get someone to notice you, you realized that you were now a ghost. \u201cWell\u201d you sigh \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why that should stop me from having fun.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you floated throw the city to gather intelligence on when you arrived. As you found out it, you had arrived right after the battle of the black water, but before the start of season 3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with this information where do you go?</span></div></div>",

The show really did not do it justice, when it was right in front of you. As you phased through one of the castle walls you were still amazed no one noticed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you continue searching a though pop into your head. \u2018Now that I\u2019m a ghost, can I possess people?\u2019 You decided that you would test your theory by scouting out some candidates. Since you are a male you weren\u2019t that interested in possessing a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you searched throughout the castle until you managed to run into two perfect candidates walking down one of the halls together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei Lannister: You could possess the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister &amp; try to prevent some of the terrible actions she commits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaegaery Tyrell: You could possess Maegaery &amp; use her beauty &amp; charm to win the throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow which do you possess? </span></div></div>",
