Why they got drunk? They're prone to it, or they're depressed.<br>\r\n4)Fights can be avoided or stopped, this is more about story than fighting, but fighting is going to be common, considering it's soul calibur<br>\r\n5)Everyone has a weak point<br>\r\n6) No one is invincible.<br>\r\n7) have fun</td>",
