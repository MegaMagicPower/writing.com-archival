He had created many new inventions over the last few days. It seemed his brain was coming up with ideas faster then ever. But he had made so many inventions that he didn't have time to test them. He had just finished the machine he was working on. He looked at his inventions and sighed. \"How am I ever going to test all of these?\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his alarm system went off. \"Intruder detected in vault.\" Said his security system. Tails ran to his vault where he kept his valuables such as rings, and chaos emeralds. When he got there he opened the door to find none other then Rouge. \"Rouge? what are you doing here?\" He said. \"What also would a master thief be doing in a vault?\" Said Rouge. \"But I can see This was a waste of time. There's nothing in here.\" Yes the vault was empty. But it was a security feature Tails had made. The vault was designed to teleport what ever was inside it to a empty dimension where no thief could get to it. and it could only be activated by Tails voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tails had a Idea. \"You came here for the chaos emerald didn't you?\" He asked, knowing the answer. \"No duh, Sherlock.\" Said Rouge. \"Well, How about we make a deal? I have some inventions I haven't tested yet. If you help me test them, I'll give you the chaos emerald.\" Rouge thought about it. She decided it was the only way to get the emerald. \"All right, I'll do it.\" She said. She followed Tails to the main part of the lab where he kept his most recent inventions. \"What should I test first?\" He thought.      </span></div></div>",

Rouge laid on the wood chip covered floor. There was even a water bottle and running wheel. Tails closed the door on the top and put a lock on it. Rouge sat here saying \"Do it for the emerald.\" Then she decided she might as well get some exercise. She got on the wheel and started running.

She got held on to his fur and started climbing. She had gone climbing before, but not without equipment. when she got to his knee, she was getting tired. To her it was like climbing Mt. Everest. But she wouldn't give up. But when she started climbing on his belly, it tickled him. He started laughing and she almost fell off. When she got to his shoulder she sat on it. \"Hey, I said to the top of my head.\" Said Tails.

Also debris came flying down and some landed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was in heaven, not only did her body grow, her breasts grew at least 3 more sizes, her clothes grew to match them as well a bit and she saw the Chaos Emerald grow close to her form of being handheld, but it seemed to gain its own power now because of the growth ray. So she picked it up and could already feel a sort of flow of energy just from holding it, but she didn't tap into it. That'd be for later. \"So this is what it's like... being big and powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had finally recovered enough to try and fix the ray gun, and tried to shrink Rouge but when he hit her with the ray it just.. bounced off and out the window. \"No... no no no no no!\" Tails was freaking out, the only way he can shrink her is now confirmed to not work. What goes on next with a giantess bat and a shocked twin tailed fox? Well it depends.

When her body had both stopped shrinking and crystallizing she was standing there a miniature crystal statue with her normal organic head, just as she realized that she couldn't move she started changing again her arms suddenly snapped to her sides and her legs collapsed her into a sitting position with her knees up to her chest, then slowly at first but gradually getting faster her body condensed into the form of a chaos emerald still with her normal head on top but before she could tell Tails to change her back her head was pulled into her new self slowly spreading her consciousness throughout her new form allowing her to do anything since she was a chaos emerald but only able to do anything at the command of another.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't much though. A puff of smoke filled the room and Amy changed into the tight black panties that Rouge once was. As soon as Tails put Amy away for a sec( who still has consciousness), Rouge returned with Sonic. \"Hey Sonic,\" Tails said, \"are you ready?\" \"Yep, let's do this!\" Sonic said. \"Remember,\" Rouge chimed in, \" if you get tired of it, just come back and we'll fix it.\" Sonic replied, \"Okay! Thanks you guys,\" and he entered. Tails pulled the lever as smoke filled the room. When it cleared, there stood a taller light blue hedgehog with curled-tip quills, large thighs, DD ample breasts, and a thin figure. \"S-Sonic,\" Tails asked. The hedgehog walked out of the machine, approached Tails and gave him a small kiss on the cheek with her now large lips. \"Thank you Tails,\" Sonic said, \"you too Rouge.\" \"D-D-Don't mention I-it,\" Rouge replied a little nervous. \"You have anything for me to wear Tails?\" Sonic asked. Tails fetched him the Amy panties and handed her to her. Sonic slid it up her thick thighs and settled it nicely around her crotch. Rouge then brought in a white bra, pink tank top, and tight/skinny blue jeans. \"Thanks again fellas,\" Sonic replied as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now? Do we follow the new Sonic and Amy panties? Or do we follow Rouge and Tails again?</span></div></div>",

She soon started to stretch and become looser. Sonic didn't notice at first until Amy fell on the floor. However Sonic didn't see her and still didn't notice because he was used to being naked. (of course before he turned into a girl) Amy was relieved to be free from Sonic (Sonny) as she walked away but she couldn't ignore what was happening to herself.<br>\r\n Amy felt her elasticity increase even further and the tingling sensation grew even stronger. Then she started to roll up into a ball and then became hard. She was relieved that the tingling ceased but couldn't help but ponder her new form. She was now a bouncy ball.<br>\r\n However the transformation wasn't complete. Amy's eyes sprouted back up from her new form and she began growing. She thought,\"How is this happening...what is happening?\" She grew to about four feet tall and four and a half feet wide. She then felt tingly again as she bounced around and grew softer. Soon she began to sprout arms.<br>\r\n Almost as quickly as she sprouted arms, legs followed and she was now a sphere. Her mouth came in shortly and she could speak again. The tingly sensation left and the transformation ended. She observed her new form.<br>\r\n She kind of liked it because she was rather elastic (almost like a balloon) and soft. She poked herself and rubbed herself for a moment. She liked feeling like a pillow but didn't like the fact the she had limited movement. <br>\r\n The limitation wasn't from weight but from her arms and legs being sunk into her body. She could only wobble and bounce around. However after all of this she had heard some footsteps coming her way. <br>\r\n She tried to hide but couldn't because of her shape. The footsteps got closer and soon revealed Sonic and Tails. They both spotted Amy rather quickly and said, \"Amy is that you?\"<br>\r\nShe replied, \"Um, yes.\"<br>\r\nSonic said, \" So you transformed again.\"<br>\r\nTails thought, \"This wasn't expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then her legs merge just like her feet, but instead they formed a thin, black metal bar that went up right below her chest. The area around her chest stayed about the same except they were rounded out a little more and felt like metal. Then Rouge's ears suddenly pointed down. They soon began to stretch around the sides of her head, forming a lamp shade. Inside there, the final physical change took place. Rouge felt her facial features disappear and suddenly her head \"bulbed\" up into a lightbulb. A little pull switch made of a gold thread appeared on the side. And that was it.

They could also be referred to as \"Nurse Bots\", which was fitting since three were wearing nurse outfits, while the other three wore maid outfits. There were six in total, one for each baby, and all of them had big gentle light eyes and smiles and were designed in a way to not frighten small children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the newborns were carefully lifted out of the play pen where they were lying and taken over to another part of the nursery, which looked more like a maternity ward. The babies were stripped naked and put through a series of tests. They were weighed, measured, had their foot prints taken, many of the procedures that a baby goes through when it's first born. After that was done, the Nanny Bots proceeded to bathe the regressed girls, and then diapered them, dressed them, placed tiny beanies on their heads, and swaddled them up, so they really did look like newly born infants. The bots then bottle-fed the babies, gave them pacifiers, and then rocked them off to sleep while playing gentle music through the voice boxes where their smiles were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the sleeping babies were placed into little nursery beds so they were all lined up nicely in a row. Cream and Vanilla got to share an extra large bed so they could be together. Once their work was finished, the Nanny Bots went to the other side of the room and went into sleep mode, awaiting any emergency that should come up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the newborn girls slept, Tails wondered if there was another test he could run on them. He had assumed that the regression had some sort of effect on them mentally, and was wondering if they could dream at this state. He could test one of his inventions on them to see what was going on in their heads, if they did have anything going on in there. But he also got the urge to try some more... unusual tests on them as well...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tails decided to test out an aging device on Rouge first. He plans to eventually use it on himself to get older with the sole purpose to awaken any potential he has when it comes to his speed or natural flight abilities. He escorted Rouge to a lit up tube, and Rouge was lazily getting into the tube as she really wanted to get the jewel she desires most of all and get out. Tails heads to a nearby control panel to start the machine, and as he did, the lights in his lab started to flicker on and off, rapid and wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, come on you!\" Tails tried to get a handle on the control panel and alter his commands in a way so when the machine \"worked\" it wouldn't mess up his lab in some was as it has done before with other experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, kid, what's going on?\" Rouge said, trying to keep the cool in her vocal tone, but all around worried for her safety, and maybe the kid's safety too. Tails turned his head to look at Rouge and gave a smile, a panicked, fake, forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, this has happened before, but I can fix it and readjust some controls and-\" a noise from the machine interrupted him, and it started to work, sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights in the tube grew dimmer and brighter in succession repeatedly, and quickly. Rouge started to feel weird, she was frightened, and she cried out in panic, but it was too late as the device already began the process. The tube was quickly filled with a liquid that was actually breathable, a fact Rouge didn't know, so she held her breathe for some time. Tails ran to the tube to see Rouge in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that there's not much he can do now, all he says to her is \"Listen Rouge, you can breathe in that liquid, trust me!\" Rouge had a scared look on her face, something she rarely makes, and she does as the fox boy says and breathes in the liquid, to which he was proven correct and she felt safe. She looked the fox boy again, and he had a face of regret, and all he said to her before the process was over was \"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Rouge to be even more scared, she thought she was going to die, instead something else happened, something one can consider to be the opposite. Rouge felt like she was shrinking, but in reality, she was aging backwards. She aged less and less, younger and younger, it got to the point that in the blink of an eye, Rouge was 13 to 10, and then from 10 to 4!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end, she regressed so much, that the only way she was able to be sustained was by either the tube, or if a volunteer decides to \"carry\" her, but it must have been done in the next few minutes. Tails reluctantly goes to the control panel to make some decisions. Once the machine was prepared, an operating table came out of the floor. Tails quickly lied down on it, the table automatically strapped him in, and he waited for the \"carrier\" process to begin. A beam of light was flashed on to his belly, and his belly started to glow orange. In the tube, Rouge was a fetus in a protective shell, but she then started to disappear from the tube, and through Tails machinery, Rouge was now slowly forming inside Tails through teleportation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails himself wasn't having such a happy time, as the operation being done had to alter his body from the inside. He was able to find a quick work-around from having to do a crazy operation that would have required an artificial womb to be implanted, thus his beam of light was actually a device firing micro-machines so small, that they are altering his genetic code. As his genetic code was being reworked, Tails kept agitating on the table, the genetic rework being very unpleasant to feel. As this was happening, Rouge was then forming inside him, and his belly started to grow slowly, very slowly, and painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails belly started out looking rather flat as Rouge began to enter, but that quickly changed as his flat midsection began to expand. Now a little bigger, looking a few months in, and his belly was also firm. More time goes by, and Tails looks like he was five months in, his belly being very noticeably larger and rounder. As this all went on, Tails cried out in pain, though he breathed rapidly as a means to get himself through the process easier. The last growth spurt occurred, as Tails' belly grew to look and technically be eight months into a pregnancy. His belly was at its most round, very firm, very large. Rouge was now being carried inside the young fox she tried to steal from, and the young two-tailed fox must wait until he can birth Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not a good day so far.</span></div></div>",

He placed his gloved hand on his expanded belly, patted it, and shook his head. He thought to himself, \"Rouge, I am so sorry, I'm not sure how I can make this up to you, but I'll find a way to fix this.\" Tails slowly sat up to accommodate himself to get off the table, his two legs now hanging off the table. His lower back started to hurt a bit, but he knows the pain will dim soon, and he will get used to it again. Tails carefully got off from the table and stood up, but as he did, his legs felt like gelatin, Tails was loosing some balance, but he caught himself from falling down by holding on to the side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time getting re-used to his situation, Tails wobbled towards the tube Rouge was in. The machine itself was going through a cooling down that will take at least few days to finish. Once Tails was in front of the tube, he opened the door to get it as it is now unlocked, and what he saw inside were Rouge's very <i>provocative</i> jumpsuit, her boots, and her gloves. Tails collected the articles of clothing, having to slowly bend down to grab all of them and slowly get back up, and he then waddled to the his experimental washing machine that can clean any type of clothes by detecting it, no matter what. This experimental machine also only failed once, and that was when he used it for the first time. Tails thought to himself once more, \"Oh boy, I can only guess what the others will think this time. After promising that I wouldn't mess with the machine again, after they nagged me on and on about it, geez I'm gonna get it for sure this time! Three strikes, three strikes, three strikes already!\" Tails bang his hand on the washer angrily, but he regretted it as it actually hurt him than actually helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young two-tailed fox was leaning his back on the washer, turning his head to look at a nearby mirror. While looking from the side, he really noticed how large his pregnant belly was, especially since it looked like he was trying to bush out his belly as well due to the pose he was in. He blushed in slight embarrassment and looked away... for just a second. He turned his head back, and he rolled his eyes, finding the situation somewhat laughable in its absurdity. He stood up as straight as he could, side looking to the mirror from its side, and he placed his hands on his belly. He began to rub his pregnant gut, as it did make him feel better. The sensual feeling he gets as his belly is rubbed is something Tails has grown accustomed to over the past few months. He started to think that he actually enjoyed being pregnant, but there was something missing that made him fully appreciate the pregnancy he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as that thought happened, the little Rouge inside Tails began kicking him, and that's when Tails remembered the happy little moments that makes being pregnant worth it in the end. He rubbed his belly even more, finding enjoyment and happiness in a dark place at a dark time. He smiled and closed his eyes, he was in bliss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BEEP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BEEP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BEEP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until a call was coming through from Tails computer. He was freaking out, he had no idea who could be calling him, he had a few guesses, and those guesses scared him. The fox dashed as quickly as he could to the computer, reluctantly answering the call. Worst possible scenario, it was Amy. Tails tried to get as close to the camera as he could, trying to hide his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tails, how you doing?\" Amy sounded sinister, as if she already knew something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Amy, how you doing?\" Tails was getting very nervous already, his voice quivered and he began to sweat, \"I-I-I'm doing okay,\" he was stuttering too. Any more obvious he was trying to hide something, he'd just admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing well. I was just in Vanilla's home, taking care of the babies while you were out in your lab for some reason, and out of nowhere the ground shook!\" Some anger was getting out of Amy's system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Is everyone in the house okay?\" Tails sounded legitimately nervous for many reasons. One because he was truly worried for the safety of the others, the other reason because now he knows for sure why Amy would guess that he screwed up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, we're all fine. Though I'm a bit worried for you, because the lights around your lab were going crazy! You're not doing anything you should be doing, are you?!\" Amy questioned him hard, and the pressure was getting to Tails pretty hard. He started breathing anxiously, he was sweating profusely, and he unwittingly rubbed his pregnant belly and made it noticeable to the camera without knowing he did, pretty much outing himself already without knowing he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I'm fine, don't worry, no need to come here!\" Tails voice was just cracking, he knew he was in deep trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy began to growl, \"NO! YOU ARE NOT FINE! I CAN SEE WHAT YOU DID TO YOURSELF AGAIN!\" Amy screamed angrily to the fox and pointed to his belly, which Tails was still rubbing, though he did stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I messed up again, I'm sorry! I thought it wouldn't happen again this time, I thought I had all the kinks worked out, and I didn't mean to!\" Tails teared up a bit. Amy noticed his tears and she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know you didn't mean to do this to yourself...\" Amy looked away from the camera and crossed her arms, \"A boy your age should not be the parent to so many kids. A few flickys, a lot of ricky's, a single picky, and two of your friends...\" Amy scolded him subtly, but she truly did mean well. She turned her head to look at the camera again, \"Okay Tails, meet me in Vanilla's house. She isn't here yet, but the babies are, so you better come here as quickly as possible... I'm worried,\" with those last two words, Amy turned her head away again and teared up herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails got up and sighed, cleaning up his own tears, and went off to meet his children, aka, two of his friends.</span></div></div>",

What surprised him, however, was how, even though Rouge was helpless at this moment, she somehow managed to avoid being stepped on or run over or hit by any obstacles in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Tails followed Rouge all the way to the shore of the lake. The uterus sphere rolled across the top of a smooth rock at the edge of the lake and started to fall toward the water. Tails noticed this and dived downwards as fast as he could, and just before Rouge hit the water, Tails managed to grab her in time, hovering over the surface of the lake with a firm grip around the fetus. Not firm enough to hurt the fetal bat, but firm enough to keep it from falling in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the fetus close to him, Tails flew over to the shore and sat down, observing Rouge. She started to squirm around and suck her thumb again. Tails couldn't help but be mesmerized by tiny she was in this state, so helpless, so cute. Tails gently touched the transparent pink covering, and Rouge kicked, not hard enough to push against the uterus wall, but hard enough to be felt. After that sudden reaction, Rouge settled down again and curled up into a fetal position once again. Tails slipped the uterus sphere into a bag, so that it wouldn't somehow slip out of his grasp, and flew back to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned, he was trying to figure out what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Hmm, I guess it shouldn't be much different than when she was four. All that's changed is she hasn't learned her ABC's yet, heh heh. Wait what am I saying?

I've never lived with bats, I have no idea at what age they learn to read, or hit puberty, or learn algebra, or get potty trained, or... oh no, potty training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails ran up to the bed and gently pulled out the covers to see if Rouge had any accident. Thankfully, she didn't. So he put the blanket back onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went to his database computer and searched for information.<br>\r\n\"Alright, so according to this, bats typically start toilet training at age 3, and finish at 4. So Rouge is definitely going to need some protection...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails got up and crawled under his bed, pulling out a large bag of pull-ups.<br>\r\n\"Good thing I wet the bed.\" Tails said with a smirk. \"Hmm, I think these are too big for her though.\"<br>\r\nHe looked under the bed again.<br>\r\n\"Oh hey! I forgot I have these pull-ups too for when Cream is over.\" Tails said, pulling out a different package.<br>\r\n\"These should fit Rouge perfectly.\" Tails slowly slid the pull-up on the three-year-old bat, and sure enough, it fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails sat on his chair and looked at Rouge some more.<br>\r\n\"You know... Cream is considerably taller than her. I wonder why the pull-ups still fit so well? Oh right, because Rouge was born in the early 90's, where everyone was more plump and wide, more Mickey Mouse style. So now that Rouge is so young, she looks more like she did then. But wait a minute, I first appeared in the early 90's right next to Sonic, but after all that time I've gotten taller and slimmer but haven't grown any older. Or wait, I think I was four years old in that one TV show... how old was I in that other show where I didn't do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails rolled his eyes, figuring it's pointless to try to understand the continuity of the franchise, and go to bed instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and slid one of his larger pull-ups on, then brushed his teeth, then crawled into bed--trying to give Rouge as much space as he could.<br>\r\n\"*yawn* I hope I'll be able to get everything fixed by... *yawn* ...tomorrow.\" And with that, Tails closed his eyes and he went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

KEEP OUT OF SIGHT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, this is just what I wanted! And it looks like silly Tails forgot to hide it!\" Rouge said vilely. She carefully lifted it over her head.

Rouge's spirit became pure evil With that, her eyes' irises changed to a red color. . She wouldn't have mercy. She wouldn't have sorrow. She would enjoy destruction.

Rouge, feeling she had<br>\r\nto do do something fast, kissed him with a great amount of passion. Once she<br>\r\nkissed, Tails was highly surprised, then accepted it and didn't fight it at all.<br>\r\nAfter they finished, Rouge pulled away and saw Tails with a with a heartfelt<br>\r\nsmile. Being kissed by a girl that he has had a crush on and always wanted<br>\r\nto be with gave him a new self-confidence; he had this one question on his<br>\r\nmind he had to ask Rouge. \"Why did you kiss me like that ?\"  \"You looked like<br>\r\nyou were going to pass out.\" Rouge asked. \"Tails I know you're nervous about<br>\r\nthis but relax, I'm your girlfriend and your allowed to feel them okay ?\" she ask<br>\r\npositively. \"Okay.\" Tails answered relieved. \"Now come here.\" as Rouge said<br>\r\ngrabbing Tails hand. She places his hand on her right boob and starts moving his<br>\r\nhand in a circular motion. Once she let go, Tails kept up with this motion.

Once she was there, she cried in passion at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\nAfter that, she grabbed Tails and held his head between her breast and started to <br>\r\ncuddle up. \"I love you Tails.\" Rouge said. \"I love you too Rouge.\" Then the both<br>\r\nstarted drift into sleep and slept for hours.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happens next ?</b></span></div></div>",

She agreed to raise the kid with me after I told her about what you did.\" \"How did she get you to say anything about it?\", Tails asked her. Eve told him, \"I got her to talk about it after we had a drink. Turns out, Ruru here can't hold her liquor.\" Tails turned to her before asking, \"Ruru?\" \"Yeah, its my petname for her. What do you think?\", Eve told him. \"I'm sorry, you two, but what about the baby?\", asked Rouge.\"Whoops! Escaped my mind She's right here.\", Tails pointed to the left. Both Eve and Rouge looked in that direction to see the most adorable thing. The baby in front of them looked a at least two years old. The two tails behind her were colored pink, red, and white. The body was colored lavender. The Elfin-like Kitsune ears on the sides made her look a little weird. The wings on top of its head is bat-like in appearance, while she had a pair of baby dragon wings on her back. Her eyes were the most unusual, though. You see, she had heterochromia, one eye green, the other, red. 'The eyes make it kinda cute', the parents thought. The child looked at both of them before crying. \"Oh, don't cry, little one.\" \"Hey kid, what's the matter?\", a worried Eve and Rouge said before rushing towards the child. She sniffed both of them before purring. \"She's...purring.\", a confused Rouge said. \"Yeah. It's actually cute!\", a relived Eve said. The child stopped purring to look at them before saying \"Mama!\", looking at Rouge. \"Daddy!\", looking at Eve. \"how come you're the dad!?\", a angry Rouge said. \"She knows I'm the male between the two of us.\", replied Eve. \"Anyway, we have to give her a name.\"Two things: One: how do you know it's a girl?\" \"Simple. Tails checked and put a pink blanket on her. what's the second?\" \"What do you think of Kyo?\" Eve looked at Rouge before saying, \"Kyo? That's a guy's name.\" \"Well, I've heard of some girls with the name Kyo.\", countered Rouge. \"...Good point.\", Eve then turned her attention to the kid. \"Do you like the name Kyo?\"  The kid smiled before hugging Eve. \"I guess that's a yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adventures of this family is only beginning.</span></div></div>",

I guess you never know until you try, eh girls?\" Rouge smirked, yanking of the lid and raising it in the air. \"NO!\" Tails shouted sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge drank every last drop in the container, all the while smiling wickedly at Tails. \"Oh no. Oh no!\" Tails whispered under his breath, truly horrified at the events to follow. \"Mmm... Tastes like strawberries!\" Rouge teased, still looking directly at Tails. She waited eagerly for 10 seconds. \"Any moment now\" Rouge chuckled. Almost instantaneously, she then began to feel an odd sensation occur in her tummy. \"Speak of the devil, it looks like it's beginning!\" Rouge laughed with glee. In a matter of seconds, Rouge then began, as did everybody else, to notice what the effects were. She was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 20 seconds passed, she had grown from 3ft to 13ft and counting.

She rubbed off the star on her cheek. <br>\r\n\"You're a MONSTER!\" Tails shouted up furiously at Rouge.<br>\r\n\"Technically, yes I am!\" Rouge replied, unable to hold back her laughter. \"It was YOU who wanted me to test out your inventions Tails!\"<br>\r\n\"Not like this yo-\" <br>\r\n\"Oh quit your whining will you?!\" Rouge bellowed, cutting off Tails, \"I make the rules around here now, capiche?

Tails then said, \"Okay Rouge, now, whenever I ring this cowbell...\" Tails grabbed his old cowbell he loved when he was little and made sure Rouge could see it, \"...you will act like a cow.\"<br>\r\n  \"Act like a cow...\" Rouge muttered emotionlessly.<br>\r\n  \"And,\" Tails continued, \"When I say, 'banana' you'll act like a rooster.\"<br>\r\n  \"Act like a rooster...\" Rouge echoed.<br>\r\n  \"Good, now Rouge,\" Tails held up the bell and rang it loudly.<br>\r\n  \"MOOO! MOOO!\" Rouge bellowed as louhd as she could, she got down on all fours and began moving her lips along the ground as is she were grazing. Sonic cracked up. \"Tails, you outdid yourself! Let me try!\"<br>\r\n  \"Rouge, would you like a banana right now?\" Sonci asked.<br>\r\n  \"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOOO!\" Rouge screamed, she began flapping her arms and hopped around. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\"<br>\r\n  Tails and Sonic hi-fived each other. \"This is amazing! Let's try something new!\" Tails said eagerly.<br>\r\n  It took a few moments for Rouge to stop 'cock-a-doodle-dooo-ing!' Again.<br>\r\n  \"Alright.\" Sonic saids in a low deep voice, \"Whenever I hold up this pair of scissors.\" Sonci grabbed a pair of woodshop scissors and waved them in front of Rouge, \"You will shriek like a little girl.\" Rouge nodded mutely. \"Shriek like a little girl...\"<br>\r\n  Tails snapped his fingers, Sonic waved the scissors in front of Rouge, and Rouge, well...<br>\r\n  \"EEEEEEEKKK!\" Rouge shrieked so loud the noise would run around in their ears for day s to come. But that didn't matter. Rouge didn't just scream, she tried to look for a place to hide, shrieking the whole time like she had just seen a monster. Tails and Sonic fell over, not from the noise, but because they were laughing too hard. Tails pounded the ground, while Sonic crashed into a table from rolling so much, it toppled over and fell over right in front of Sonic, which set them both off again. You could hear them laughing even over Rouge's screaming.<br>\r\n  Finally, Tails exclaimed, \"BANANA!\"<br>\r\n  \"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!\"<br>\r\n  Sonic managed to ring the bell.<br>\r\n  \"MOOO!\"<br>\r\n  \"BANANA!\"<br>\r\n  \"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!\"<br>\r\n  The cowbell rang loudly.<br>\r\n  \"MOOO!\"<br>\r\n  \"Banana! Banana! Banana!\"<br>\r\n  \"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO! COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO! COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!!!\"<br>\r\n  Finally, after twenty minutes of hypnosis fun. Rouge tried mooing once she heard the cowbell. But nothing came out. She tried again, still nothing. She lost her voice!<br>\r\n  Finally Sonic and Tails got a hold of themselves. Their ribs, faces, and stomachs hurt from laughing so hard. When the doorbell rang, \"I'll get it.\" Tails panted. he hobbled to the door, when he opened it a police officer handed Tails a piece of paper. \"A fine for noise pollution.\" He said. \"Good day.\"<br>\r\n  Tails read the note. it was 45$ just for noise pollution!<br>\r\n  \"That's crazy!\" Sonic exclaimed when he saw the note.<br>\r\n  \"What is?\" Rogue managed to rasp. <br>\r\n  Neither Tails or Sonic wanted to say, so Tails rang the cowbell. \"Moo!\" Rouge managed to cough out. It sounded incredibly silly.<br>\r\n  Sonic and Tails looked at each other, then they cracked up again.</span></div></div>",

Before she lost consciousness, she had time to wonder if maybe this hadn't been such a good idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rouge was awake. She knew she had been out for a long time, but she had no way of telling how long. She sat up and looked around, and, while she was still in Tails' lab, something was definitely wrong. Just then Tails entered the lab whistling. \"Ah I see you're adjusting rather well to your new form! That is excellent news! It means we can proceed with testing immediately!\" he said, a huge smile on his face. \"My new form?\" Rouge inquired. Hold on. Her voice sounded weird. Not bad exactly, just different. More, electronic. ELECTRONIC?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced down. What she saw made her wish she hadn't. She was covered in what looked like futuristic armor, and, judging by the sound of her voice, it probably went a lot further than just 'skin deep'. Rouge started to panic. She felt like she might faint! Oh god, <i>could</i> she still faint!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?!\" she screamed. \"What did you do?!\" \"Take it easy Rouge. I just put your brain in the body of an amphibious robot,\" Tails stated. \"Just put my- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! And what did you do with my original body? You didn't throw it out did you? Oh god, I can just see it rotting in some dumpster somewhere, being eaten away by-\" Suddenly there was a clanging noise, and Rouge was sent reeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROUGE! GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!\" Tails shouted. \"Your body is fine. I've got it on life support. I wouldn't just throw it out. That would be disgusting, and wasteful, and I'd have to deal with another investigation.\" Rouge stiffened, about to start panicking again. \"JOKING!\" Tails said quickly. \"Don't start panicking again please! If you start panicking, I'LL start panicking. And if I start panicking things will get really messy, really quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Okay. I'm calm. I'm calm. I've been placed in a robot body, but I'm calm.\" \"Thank you,\" Tails said. \"Now, can you PLEASE tell me WHY you did this?\" \"Oh, sure. There's a number of reasons. I wanted to test this new amphibious shell, and i didn't have any spare AI that could handle it. I had a new design for neural interface I wanted to test. And I wanted to do some tests to see how an ostensibly normal person might react to being converted into a full body cyborg. Your panic attack has proven most informative by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Rouge, \"Now, tell me why I shouldn't strangle the life out of you right now.\" \"I have three good reasons. One; you're a good person who couldn't live with a murder on their shoulders. Two, I'd cry like a little girl and no one wants to see that. Three you can't. Even if I hadn't put a safeguard in to prevent you from harming yourself or others, your new body isn't really all that much tougher than your normal one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge thought about this for a minute. \"You raise some excellent points and I have been convinced to live with the situation for now. So, what do we do next?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Barely even sticking out, although that didn't last to long. After her thighs lost definiton rouges ass started tofill out, badically blowing up like a balloon, except it jiggled no matterwhat. when she walked, talked, sat, it didnt matter.Thirty seconds later the soft flesh began filling out her stomach, basically giving her a belly that pooched out over her tights. After that the weight shifted up once again to her already big chest. Her once firm and strong breasts now got porky and flabby like the rest of her. Finnally her chin and cheeks were next in line, the chiseled face of rouge was no more. In place a double chin that shook when rouge talked, and her cheeks looked as if she were eating something, even when she wasn't.

The deal was she would test his experiments, not become his servant and wait on him hand and foot. Not that Tails didn't mind Rouge like this... but still. \"Uh... Rouge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge's look went from romantically happy, to surprised and worried. \"What is it!? Is something wrong with the food!?\" Rouge said in haste as she in a split second was right by Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! Its great! You made a delicious meal Rouge! I just feel wrong sitting here eating while you just sit over there waiting for me to tell you what to do next.\" Tails said looking somewhat ashamed of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge happy expression returned by Tail's kind words. She keeled down on one knee so that she was at eye level with him, and then put her arms around Tails and gave him a soft hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Tails, that was sweet of you to say.\" A smile formed on Tails face as well. As Rouge let go of him, Tails noticed a new expression on Rouges face. The kind that says she was up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you feel the need to repay me for the meal. There is something you can do for me.\" She said with a somewhat sly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails knew that tone well, but still asked \"What?\"</span></div></div>",

His eyes were first drawn at her enlarged breast (Why wouldn't they). Causing him to tense up. But then he noticed something else. On the apron she was still wearing there were three words written on it. Saying \"KISS THE COOK\". Tails then finally got what Rouge was aiming at. He went from tense to sweaty. In his mind he cursed himself for keeping that apron. Where did he even get that thing? Then it all came back to him. Amy originally gave it to Sonic too attract him, and then later gave it to Tails saying \"Maybe you'll find a better use for it buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot Sonic and Amy!\" Tails shouted in his head. Tails came back to reality when he realized Rouge was back at eye level staring at him. Tails was still nervous, he had never kissed a girl before. Granted Rouge had given him a few kisses on the cheek and on his head, but on the lips? What was he to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then shifted her head so her right cheek was facing him. Tails then started to relax a little. \"Oh, she just wants a quick peck on the cheek.\" he thought. That wasn't to hard.

His first reaction was to pull away, he didn't want Rouge to get the wrong idea from him. But before he could retract his lips he felt Rouge cup her hands on his cheeks as she lifted him up with her as he was now being held close to her body so the kiss could continue longer and deeper. Tails was now burning red in embarrassment. \"I don't believe it! My first kiss! And with Rouge of all people! The weird thing is... I'm kinda enjoying it.\" Tails thought as his body was now limp in Rouge's hands as the kiss still continued for a few more seconds. Finally they're lips parted, Tails would be on the floor if it weren't for Rouge still holding him in her hands. After a quick giggle at the goofy grin Tails had on his face Rouge lowered Tails back into his chair... which he fell right off and onto the floor, still blushing red with that goofy grin still on his face. Rouge just giggled at the site of him, blushing a little herself. She leaned against the wall and fanned herself with her hand, no doubt it was intense for her too. Tails finally sat up and turned to Rouge who stopped fanning when she saw him looking at her. Tails rubbed the back of his head in a nervous fashion, struggling to find the right words to say. \"Well... that was, new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge just giggled at him. \"What can I say, I'm a tricky bat.\" she said slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails just a chuckled and said, \"You sure are.\" Rouge then walked over to him and bended over to face him and ask, \"So... how was I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails started sweating again as he let out a gulp. \"Be honest Tail's, just say the first thing that comes to your mind.\" his conscience spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the greatest woman in the world.\" he quickly said. Tails mentally slapped himself. \"Let me rephrase that: Say the first normal thing that comes to your mind!\" his conscience spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge just gave a small giggle at that and said, \"Thank you, you are the greatest boy too Tails\" as she gave his cheek a small pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails just gave her a awkward smile and said \"So... do you wanna go back to the testing?\"</span></div></div>",

For every test she took, for every invention she tried, Tails would have to... to... kiss her? Well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Maybe a kiss on the cheek or... wait a minute that's what he thought the last time and look what happened! Plus this is Rouge we're talking about! He had to say no. Yes. Say no, thank her for her time, give her the emerald, show her to the door, and never speak of this again to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tails was about to say something he saw that Rouge was right in front look down at him. Tails backed away but Rouge just continued to approach until she had him backed into a corner. She lowered down to eye level with him and placed her hands on his shoulders. \"So? What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... what  about the chaos emerald?\" Tails asked. Maybe he could convince her to go back to the emerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge just gave a small giggle. \"I did want it earlier. But then I realized that there's 7 chaos emeralds, and only one two tailed fox in the world.\" she stated giving a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails blushed deep and then eyed her arms still holding his shoulders and noticed how big her muscles were. He realized he'd had forgotten about her new bigger body he had given her. How would she react to the rejection??? Probably either be saddened, or break him in half. Cornered by a girl who had thing for you and could make you hurt, sounds like a situation Sonic would be in. So Tails just thought. What would Sonic do? Run away using my fast speed and never look back. Dang it I can just fly, and only by so high. And with her increased height she grab him before he got far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looked at her face and noticed she was still waiting for his answer with a sly smile on her face. It might not be so bad. He get to test more things and keep the emerald at the same time. And maybe just a kiss on the chee- okay he was going around in circles. He had to give a answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails let out a sigh and said...</span></div></div>",

At first Tails though it was because she was embarrassed that she hugged him into that position, but when Tails looked at his hands he saw that they were touching her... well in order too pulls his head out he had to gain leverage so he grabbed onto the nearest thing. Tails quickly let go blushing and sweating at the same time. His first kiss, and now this? For a young boy Tails was growing up fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails nervously looked up at Rouge who was still holding on to him. She was looking away slightly embarrassed about the whole ordeal.

After a few sounds of pen writing on paper Rouge presented Tails with the document. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Signed your name here, and we can re-begin.\" She said in another seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looked at the paper as it said everything that Rouge said she would do, and he had said okay. So he signed with his real name \"Miles' Prower\", and handed it back to Rouge who looked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that was your real name. My, Tails your are full of secrets. I like it.\" She said with a sly tone. She then signed her name and even gave the document a kiss leaving a red lip mark on it.

Once it was in, and attached to the inside of the ribcage behind the heart, the autodoc closed him up and got to work removing his neck, reducing it to a span of smooth fur and skin from one shoulder to the other, only interrupted by two tiny silver dots, and a pair of openings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I want to incorporate the brains into the headless bodies, that way, they don't need the life-support plate.

I kinda like the idea of giving my body independence now that I've seen how well you and Etch seem to be getting along.\" \"Oh yes!\" Rouge exclaimed. \"This is going to be so much fun!\" [Well, alright Tails. If you're really sure about this...] \"Okay cool,\" Tails said. \"Just let me set up the surgeon robot for the procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proceeded to reveal a strange looking white robot, with multiple arms and a red cross painted on the front of it. While he was working on it, Etch picked up Rouge walked over to get a closer look. \"So this is some kind of robotic doctor?\" Rouge asked, as Etch nestled her between her sizable breasts. \"Yep,\" Tails replied, not even looking up because he was so concentrated on his work. \"I designed it to take some of the load off hospital doctors. It's actually better at it's job than most normal ones.\" [Wait,] Etch interrupted. [If it's so good, why didn't you use it when you created me? It isn't dangerous is it?:(] she asked, clearly worried. \"Oh no, it's not dangerous, just not very bright. It isn't good at inventing new procedures, it can only modify existing ones to suit changing circumstances. It not good enough to completely replace biological doctors yet. But I can't very well perform the operation on myself, so I'm programming it with the data it needs to do it for me. Aaaand... Done! Okay, let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Tails activated the robot, and went to lie down on the same operating table where Rouge and Etch had been separated. As soon as he was comfortable, the robot stood up, and went right to work. The robot copied the procedure Tails had performed on Rouge almost exactly, and with great efficiency. Soon it's work was done, and it returned to it's charging nacelle to power down. Etch carried rouge over to the table and put her down on it, before sitting down herself in a nearby chair, while they waited for the anesthetic to wear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they watched him, they couldn't help but think about how cute he was, both his head <i>and</i> his newly independent body. His disembodied head looked so small and helpless, while his body had curled up with it's tails cutely wrapped around itself. The whole scene just screamed 'adorable'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, both his head and his body began to awaken, with his head yawning cutely, while his body stretched it's arms. The head blinked and looked around sleepily. \"Rouge? Etch? Did it work?\" he asked, still feeling a bit blurry from the anesthetic. \"I'll say it did!\" Rouge exclaimed happily, while Etch, to excited for words, just scooped both Rouge and Tails up into the biggest hug she could muster. [Hey! What about me?] Tails' former body exclaimed in an indignant manner. Etch's hologram flickered in confusion for moment before pulling him into her loving embrace as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Rouge cleared her throat, and etch quickly released all of them in embarrassment. \"Well, now that Etch has finally stopped trying to crush us, what should we do now?\" she asked. [Well I, for one, think we should figure out the name situation, before anything else,] Etch suggested. This was met with a a general murmur of agreement, except for Tails' body, which flickered it hologram in agreement instead. \"Okay, so, who wants to be called what?\" Rouge asked. \"Tails' body, you go first.\" [Well, I was thinking about taking our old nickname, Tails, as my actual name. Seeing as I'm the one with the two tails and everything.] \"Alright, from now on Tails is <i>your</i> name. What about you, Tails' head? What would you like to be called?\" [Wait a moment,] Etch interjected. [Why don't we just call him Miles? I mean, that was his real name, right?] \"Yes, Miles is my real name, and I intend to keep it. But I don't really like people to call me by it. It just feels too official for my tastes,\" Tails' head explains. \"Alright, a nickname then. What do you want your new <i>nickname</i> to be?\" Rouge asked again. \"Well, your body renamed herself 'Etch'. How about 'Sketch'? I think it actually fits pretty well, considering I'm an inventor and everything.\" [Oh, that is just so cute!] Etch gushed. [We have matching names now!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Okay, now that we've figured out what our names are, I say we pair off and get to know one another better,] Tails decided. How do they pair off?</span></div></div>",

Etch seems to be rather curious as well, walking up behind him and reading the code over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if the nanotech in this serum is to be permanent, they'll need a way to recharge, so I'm modifying them to run off of the chaos drive I put in the neck-plate.\" Tails answers looking over at Rouge, \"and if these numbers are right it, taking over brain function will actually draw less power than keeping your brain inside your head. Huh... I'll have to remember that for later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the canister out of his machine and injecting about half of it into Rouge, passing what was left to Etch and politely asking her to put it back in the cabinet for him. Had she been on his operating table, she wouldn't have seen a thing, but his work bench had a mirror on it so he could see both sides of what he was working on. She watched curiously as Tails meticulously worked through the process of opening her skull, gently levering up her brain and cutting the connections to her senses. The brain stem didn't need to be cut, as it only had about an inch of spine attached to it, and slid out easily enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the brain was out, Tails inserted a rubber ring around the cut edges of the skull, a little hinge in the back, and a latch in the front. Leaving her head able to be opened and closed like a container, before closing her up and brushing her facial fur a bit to hide the seam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. All finished.\" He stated, triumphantly, taking a moment to admire his work and of course, give rouge her payment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Any ideas what to do with the brain?] Etch asked, coming up behind the two after putting the injection gun away.</span></div></div>",

[Now its your turn,] she said as she approached him. \"Umm.... no offense but I don't want to be crushed,\" said Tails nervously. [HA! Well you don't need to worry about THAT!] Etch laughed. [I just want a goodbye kiss is all.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looked at her, confused. \"But, where would I kiss you? You don't have a head,\" he pointed out. [I've already thought of that,] Etch responded. [I want you to kiss me riiight here,] she said, as she bent down and pointed to an exposed area of her breasts. Tails immediately went red, which caused Rouge to start laughing. \"Well, go on,\" said Rouge, still laughing. Nervously, Tails bent down and kissed Etch at the designated area, causing a shiver to run down her body. [And with that, I bid you both a fond farewell!] Etch said as she walked out the door, waving at the two of them.</span></div></div>",

So I'm going the wrong way, I'll need to find my way to a vein and follow it to the heart. No problem!\" he exclaimed, steering his ship along a massive tunnel. Huge discs considerably larger than his ship constantly whizzed along the artery - they were of course, Rouge's red blood cells. Tails took note of how big they were. \"Whoa! They're huge! Maybe I over did it on the shrinking...\" he thought. \"No matter, if I can get close enough, I should be able to hitch a ride on one of her red blood cells!\" He zoomed towards the nearest one. \"I'd better let Rouge know what's going on...\" Tails said, flicking a switch from red to green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge lay on the table, strapped in and anxious. All of a sudden she heard Tails voice over an intercom. \"Rouge, I'm about to hitch a ride on one of your red blood cells. It'll take me along your arm and turn me around once I reach your hand.\" Rouge was relieved that he was communicating with her. She wasn't sure she liked the idea of Tails taking a silent tour of her insides - who knows what he'd get up to. She spoke back. \"Roger that sugar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails waited for the blood cell to turn so that it was at least somewhat horizontal before landing his craft near it's centre. \"I'm on. The rest is up to you now Rouge. Just try to take it easy. Any unecessary activity could make my job a lot harder.\" Rouge responded with a casual \"no problem\" and did as she was told. Tails relaxed as well, observing the wonderous sights from the safety of the cockpit. He was definitely small. Rouge's red blood cell was the length of two football pitches in comparison to his craft. He considered taking a closer look outside, but then decided against it. He didn't want to get seperated from the ship at this size. He might never see the light of day again, unless Rouge burped him up or something. Not a pleasant thought. Instead, he simply leant back in his chair and turned the ship's power off. He took a moment to take in his situation. He watched as a flurry of equally gigantic red discs zoomed alongside his own. He listened as Rouge's heart pumped the blood through her body - he imagined the heart somewhere far away, a gargantuan living engine resting in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Tails had entered the insides of Rouge's left hand. He sat up and turrned the power on. \"Ah well, looks like the free ride's over.\" he said, pulling the joystick towards himself. His ship detatched itself from the massive vessel and floated away from it. Tails turned the ship and followed a different tunnel back the way he'd come. More red blood cells bustled along it and Tails soon found himself caught in a mighty torrent of them. \"Here we go Rouge! Full steam ahead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was unimpressed. \"So it took you all that effort to just turn around, not that YOU actually did much...\" she bit. She looked at her arm. \"Hey, it's not like I could fight against the flow of blood. My craft is extremely tiny you know!\" he argued, not wanting to let Rouge win. \"Ok fine, whatever. Just do your thing and be careful in there. My body's a finely crafted temple.\" she gloated. \"More like a planet...\" Tails muttered under his breath. He continued to maneuver past the gigantic blood cells, trying to beat them to the finish. All of a sudden he felt a massive rumble shake the craft as he lost all momentum. Warning lights flashed on the ship's console and the words \"Antibodies detected!\" flashed on the display sceen. Tails tried to accelerate, but nothing happened. He was stuck. \"Uh-oh! Rouge's antibodies are trying to destroy the craft! At this size it won't last long!\" He watched as a white gooey substance covered his sub - it had been absorbed by a white blood cell larger even than the massive red blood cells. It began it's attempt to dissolve the tiny vessel into nothing, but the sub held out for a time. Tails scrambled about the cockpit. \"Rouge! Bad news! Your antibodies are trying to destroy me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you want me to do? I'm strapped to a table and I can hardly control my inner bodily functions!\" she snapped. \"Don't you have any defences?\" Tails fumbled about the controls. \"I could electrify the hull but it would take time. Alternatively, I've got a chaos emerald wired in to the core of the ship, so I could warp out.\" he explained. Rouge's ears perked up at the mention of chaos emeralds. \"What!? You took a chaos emerald into my body!? And why don't you just use the warp to get to my brain? It'd have saved us alot of time.\" Tails struggled to stabilise the ship. \"If I use the emergency warp I could end up anywhere!\" Rouge almost rolled her eyes. \"Anywhere has to be better than in the company of my antibodies.\" she said. Tails decided to...</span></div></div>",

Hold tight, this might tickle!\" Tails said, fiddlingwith a few wires under the control panel and flicked a large red lever into position. \"Juice time!\" he yelled, pressing another button and waiting atop his chair as millions of volts of electricity channelled themselves through the metallic craft. The antibody was pulverised and drifted away in defeat as the ship stopped it's electrical assault. Tails jolted forward and punched the air. \"Yeah! I did it! That takes care of him! Now, where was I?\" he triumphantly went on. Rouge rolled her eyes and spoke to him. \"Finally! I thought you'd never stop complaining! It was your idea to turn yourself into the smallest inhabitant of my body.\" Tails grabbed the joystick and continued to zoom along the vein, dodging gigantic blood cells as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe further he went, the louder her heartbeat became. He knew he was going the right way now. The rythmic beating was everywhere. It echoed and reverberated through the entire area. Tails assessed the map and noticed he was just about leaving her shoulder and entering her chest area. \"Rouge, I'm about to enter your chest cavity.\" Rouge looked down at her breasts and imagined the microscopic fox pandering about in them. The little perve. \"Is that so?\" she asked. \"Yup. About to enter your heart - it's do or die time!\" Tails accelerated full speed towards the gigantic valve in the distance. It opened and closed so rythmically, with every beat of her heart. It was now a case of getting the timing correct. He gripped the control stick and stared into the heart of the gaping vortex as it closed. \"Now!\" he yelled, throwing the stick forwards. His craft zoomed at the valve with immense speed and slipped into it as it opened up again, swallowing him up with another beat. \"Success! I'm in your heart now! It's huge in here!\" \"Obviously because I've got a big heart!\" she retorted. Tails drove his craft onwards through the massive beating chamber. \"I have no idea which one of these is the right way...\" he says, looking at the number of different blood vessells going to and from the heart. \"Well you're in my chest, you need to go up to my head. It's pretty simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails surveyed the computer, his map provided no useful information. \"Damn it! The equipment's frazzled from the attack on the ship!\" he explained. \"Well don't blame me, you are trespassing inside me.\" Rouge snapped back. \"This is serious Rouge! I need to know I'm going the right way - I could end up in your appendix or something!\" Tails argued. Rouge felt the urge to stick her tongue but simply said \"Well just choose one and hope for the best, it's not like you can do much else.\" So he did. Tails zoomed into the nearest blood vessell and shot out of the bat's heart. He flew right out of the heart and into a large open tunnel. It in two directions endlessly. Tails picked one and zoomed through it, before coming out into a massive chamber and splashing into the green liquid below. \"Oh no... I went completely the wrong way! This must be your stomach!\" Tails complained. Rouge looked at her curvacious abdomen. \"I said up Tails, not down. I had no intention of eating you. But now you're in my belly how do you propose to get out?\" Just then the stomach shook violently and Tails craft was rocked about the gastric juices. \"I don't know if I can... I'm stuck in here... and what's worse, you're hungry!\"</span></div></div>",

He began to pilot the craft through Rouge's gas-filled bowels. This was easier said than done, due to the lack of light and the foggy air clouding his view. Without his map, he'd have been in much worse predicament. It appeared to be smooth sailing. The walls grumbled and roared and suddenly Tail's craft was struck by an almighty blast of air. It was knocked off course by this viscious hurricane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge felt the bubbling gasses in her abdomen. She had to do it. She let loose a tiny fart, feeling relieved and embarassed at the same time. \"Good thing Tails wasn't here to see that,\" she smiled, \"at least... I hope he didn't hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge couldn't have been more wrong. Tails heard it all right. He saw it, smelt it and felt it too. Like a huge vacuum it nearly blasted his ship to pieces. Tails read the on-screen display. \"Damage critical, engine damage 67%, hull breached, suggest evacuation.\" Tails was terrified. His sub was going nowhere! He quickly checked the on-board wardrobe, spying a special inner body scuba suit. He quickly donned the gear and filled a backpack with supplies. Securing his breath mask, he opened the entry hatch of his sub. He was hit by the full relentless stench of all of Rouge's past meals. Then, after a minute or so, he leapt out into the dangerous world of Rouge. He spun his tails and flew through her gaseous bowels.</span></div></div>",

Just a couple hundred metres away, the enormous portal twisted and turned. Tails mustered the last of his strength and zoomed straight for it's centre. The closer it got, the larger it became.

Tails jumped on the spot a couple of times, getting a feel for the land. Soft. He turned 180\u00ba and saw that his plain of soft ground stopped and turned upwards into a cliff. Two enormous mounds stuck out way above him, obstructing his view. <br>\r\nThe ground quaked violently and Tails heard the familiar groaning of Rouge's stomach... from below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on Rouge's stomach!\" exclaimed Tails. \"Beats being in it\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge leant foward, trying to free her legs from their restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta get to Rouge's brain before she breaks-\" he was interrupted as the world turned on it's side.

Tails' robot rushed to restrain her, but she simply bit gobbled it up.

It's quicker and It means I shouldn't tire out!\" he exclaimed, donning the gizmo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew from the wreckage as it submerged and melted away.

He then sped straight up her nose, hoping to reach her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was taking the city apart, devouring it bit by bit. The more she ate, the bigger she became.

As Tails Approced the Womb, He put his Pack Down and Began to Feel around Rouge's Womb to Find a Perfect Spot to Make his Entry Point, When all of a Sudden, His Hand Was Sucked in thought the womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What The! What's Going on!\" Yelled Tails in Fright and Surprise. \"Rouge What's Going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge answered in a Motherly Tone, \"Now Now, That's No Way to Talk to Your New Mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!

Tails Tried to Slam into the walls of the Womb trying to Escape, But it was no Use, there was No Budge. Tails then felt something wet on his feet, as he looked down He saw that the Womb was Filling up with Liquid. Slowly the Liquid Rose in the Womb, but it was getting a little faster and faster. The Liquid was up to his Chest, Tails was Getting Scared that he would soon Drown. But the liquid was the least of his Problems. Tails saw some sort of Fleshy Tube Coming out of the way, It was the Umbilical cord, Slowly getting Longer and Longer and it was moving towards Tails. Tails tried to get away, but it was no use, the liquid was Slowing him Down. And with that, The Umbilical cord attached Dirrectly to Tails' belly, right where his belly button is, even the knot of his belly button became undone. The liquid in the womb reach the top and finally filled the entire womb. Tails was floating in the womb, Luckily the Umbilical cord was keeping Tails from drowning. As Tails was Floating in the Womb, The Umbilical cord began to pump something into Tails, Tails was Getting More Scared by the minute but there was nothing he could do. The Stuff Pumping into Tails turned out to be thoughts from Rouge's Mind, Rouge was Trying to Force her Will into Tails Mind, Rouge's Thoughts began to enter Tails' Mind through the Umbilical cord. Once they entered Tails Mind, He Just Gave A blank stare Like He was in a trance, He then heard Rouge's Voice though his thoughts like A Mind Control Spell Saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Now My Baby...I Am Now your Mama...You Love Your Mama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails Then Replied in a Trance Tone : \"I am your Baby...You Are My Mama...Iove My Mama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Tails Closed his Eyes and Went into a Fetal Position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's a Good Boy.\" Rouge cooed while lightly rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails Limbs Began to become smaller and undeveloped, then his Body Began to do the same, Tails was Becoming an Embryo, the fitting form due to to his Microscophic Size. And with that his trasformation was Comeplete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge Felt the Transformation's Comepletion As well.

He knew they'd come for him eventually though. For now, it was fairly smooth sailing.

Tails activated the machine and there was a bright flash inside the pod. Rouge covered her eyes as it scanned her, analyzed her features and brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other pod, Nanites began to form into a metal skeleton, then flesh and clothes formed around it. Rouge stepped out of the pod, so did her duplicate. \"Rouge, meet Ro-1000.\" Said Tails. Ro-1000 looked exactly like Rouge. Rouge put a hand against her cheek. She felt so real! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Tails, you did a good job copying me.\" Said Rouge. \"But you'll never be able to best the original.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Said Ro-1000. \"I don't just best you, I exceed you!\" \"As you can see, you share the same personality.\" Said Tails. \"She knows everything you know. She can fight as well as you, and she even has some features you don't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Said Rouge? \"I'll show you.\" Said Ro-1000. Her eyes began to glow red. \"Duck!\" Yelled Tails. They both ducked as two lasers shot from RO-1000's eyes. They flew across the lab and burned a hole in the wall. \"And that's just one of my tricks.\" Said Ro-1000, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you fly?\" Asked Rouge. \"Of course.\" Jets activated on the bottom of Ro's feet. (I'm just gonna call her Ro now.) She flew up and hovered in the air. \"Her metal skeleton makes her too heavy for her wings to fly.\" Explained Tails. \"So she must use jet prepulsion. But, her wings are very sharp and can be used as weapons. She also has as much strength as Knuckles, and several other gadgets.      <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Well, we know that your machine works, now what?\" Said Rouge. \"I was thinking of using her as a guard for my lab.\" Said Tails. \"What!?\" Said Ro. \"I am not just some object for you to use as you please!\" \"I created you.\" Said Tails. \"And I can destroy you. It's your choice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ro.\" Said Rouge. \"How about we teach Shorty a lesson?\" They both grinned. Next thing Tails knew, he was tied to a chair, with two bats grinning at him. \"Let's test some of his inventions on him, and see how he likes it.\" Said Ro. \"Or, we could make him give us the emerald, and then go after the master emerald. Together, Knuckles wouldn't stand a chance against us!\" Said Rouge.   </span></div></div>",

Something as life changing as this made Rouge furious. She would no longer be able to steal jewels, she can't fly,and she would always have to buy extra large clothes( speaking of which, Rouge's jumpsuit did survive her sudden expansion, but there were rips throughout the suit indicating that it won't last if she gains more weight.) and it was all Tails's fault. Describing her as pissed was an understatement. She charged towards Tails like a bull would charge at a matador.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails could see the rage in her eyes and quickly flew up to try and avoid her attack. Unfortunately, Rouge had managed to grab his feet. He tried to get away, but her grip on his leg was too strong. Soon she slammed Tails onto the ground, giving Tails a lot of bruises. His punishment wasn't over yet. Rouge than slammed her heavy body right on top of Tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for ruining my life, you freak!\" Rouge yelled as loud as she could, once she got off Tails<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad Tails couldn't hear this though. He was out like a light and completely defenseless. Rouge was tempted to kill him while he was asleep, until she noticed something interesting. Tails looked a little chubbier. He wasn't as fat as Rouge, but it was clear that he had gained at least 30 pounds in a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Rouge long to figure out that the virus Tails had given her was contagious. She didn't understand why Tails wasn't as fat as her, but she guessed that it was probably because she got a concentrated version of the virus while Tails wasn't as infected as she was. Even though he wasn't as fat as her, if what Tails said was accurate, he would have to gain weight without hope for a cure like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sinister smirk appeared on Rouge's face as she imagined Tails suffering from the disease. Then even more sinister thoughts entered her head as she realized that she could infect anyone she wanted to! She could infect people that she despised, or use it to control people by threatening them with virus. Almost everyone would be afraid of a person that has a incurable virus that causes obesity, making Rouge a powerful threat to civilization.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST GOING TO TEST THE ANESTHETIC!\" Rouge shouts. \"I did say that. Now I need to see if it works. And I figured I could test some other things on your brain while I'm at it. Kill two birds with one stone, see?\" <br>\r\n\"But I don't want my brain removed!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Tails says in calming voice. \"if the anesthetic works you'll be fine, and if it doesn't I can easily fix everything.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'I'll be fine'?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, see the 'anesthetic' is actually a colony of nanobots, designed to inhibit pain and keep the user alive.

Thinking it over she responded.</span></div></div>",

Once she was completely satisfied, Amy gave Tails a hug so tight he thought he might have exploded.

Her focus became stronger, corresponding with the appearance of her own arms escaping Rouge's. Soon the rest of her body began to show, as if she were pushing herself out of the bat's body. Finally, her face emerged from Rouge's, the rest of her head soon following. As soon as Amy completely separated herself from Rouge, both girls collapsed, Rouge out of the exhaustion of being possessed and Amy out of the exhaustion of separating herself from her host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails caught Amy and proceeded to give her a full examination with a medical device he had made a few hours back. Everything seemed to be in order physically, but he would quickly need to evaluate her mental state. After securing Rouge to make sure she wouldn't try anything if she woke up soon, he turned his attention to the unconcsious pink hedgehog. \"Hey, Amy!\" he shouted as he shook her body. \"Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck his head closer to her body to hear an increased amount of activity, signalling that she would wake up soon. After a few minutes, Amy woke up to see Tails occupied on entering information into a computer before he looked up to see if she was up. He motioned her to walk over and promptly began asking her various questions to make sure that there was no damage done from the experience. Once he was satisfied with the results, he asked for the gloves back. She hesitated for a moment, and Tails noticed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him in the eye and said, \"Well, I kind of wanted to use Rouge's body for a little bit longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails's eyes narrowed. \"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was a cool experience to walk in someone else's shoes and be a part of such a scientific achievement...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is about Sonic, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed. \"Alright, yes. I just felt more confident being Rouge, and I thought he might like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails put a finger over her mouth, indicating that he had something to say. \"Amy, the reason Sonic keeps avoiding you is the way you try to approach him. By getting all flustered and trying far too hard, you're selling yourself short. If you keep a cooler head, I'm sure he'd give a meaningful relationship with you a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked stunned when Tails finished speaking but then realized that his words made sense. \"How come you're trying to help me out on this? Not that I'm complaining, but I thought you, as his best friend, would be the one who respected his wishes the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I'm his best friend that I want him to have a meaningful relationship, especially with a wonderful girl like you. Besides, I think you two would make such a cute couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushed at Tails's words and gave him a hug that made a rosy tint appear on his own cheeks. \"Alright, then. Here are the gloves back.\" She took off the gloves and gave them to him. \"So, what are you going to do with them now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails thought for a moment. \"I obviously can't trust Rouge to do experiments willingly. So, maybe I'll use the gloves myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pursed her lips together for a moment. \"Or, maybe you could help me out a bit with Sonic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails raised his eyebrows in a questioning manner. \"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm afraid that I might not be able to get a date, at least at first. You know him better than anyone else, so...would you be willing to warm him up to the idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I guess I could put in a good word for you, but I'm not sure if that would be enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed before another idea came into her head. \"I'm kinda afraid of screwing up if I tried to ask him out myself. Maybe you could do it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails frowned. \"Are you asking me to use these gloves on you and then ask Sonic out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gave a sheepish grin, confirming Tails's conjecture. \"Just this once, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails thought about the situation. He wanted to test the gloves for himself, and the idea of being either Amy or Rouge excited him. He wanted Amy to be able to get a relationship with Sonic going by herself, but perhaps his experience with Sonic could make the difference between Sonic flatly running off and Sonic sticking around to give her a chance. Amy was willing to be on both sides of his experiment, and he felt like helping her out a bit. However, he also wanted to ensure that Rouge didn't try anything funny. He needed his inventions tested, and Rouge was unwilling to do it herself. Even with the promise of the Chaos Emerald, she attempted to betray him and keep it all to herself. He had to ensure nothing like that happened again and get those experiments tested. By becoming her, he would kill two birds with one stone. What does Tails ultimately decide to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Tails thought about it again, he began to think that it would be much better to take up Amy's offer than to stay in the lab. With both her and Rouge, he would see for himself what it was like using the gloves, and he would be able to see whatever differences there might be if he used it rather than Amy. From there, though, he felt that being Amy would be far better than being Rouge. For one thing, he didn't really want much to do with Rouge after her betrayal. If he was going to possess her in order to make sure she wouldn't try to fool him again, he'd have to be her permanently. Amy, on the other hand, he\u2019d be helping to give her the one thing she truly wanted but hadn\u2019t been able to obtain. He\u2019d also be getting Sonic to stop his often childlike attempts to get away from her and to actually give love a chance. Furthermore, he wondered if there was any difference being invited would make. When Amy used the gloves on Rouge, it was clear that the simple refusal from Rouge made her entry look rather tough to go through, let alone the exit. Amy, however, was inviting him to use her body, an opportunity that he was sure he would probably not get again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Amy,\u201d Tails finally said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \u201cGreat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, though, I have to do something about Rouge.\u201d He walked towards the central console of his lab and pressed a few buttons. A hatch opened up nearby, and a replica of Tails soon appeared. It appeared to be an android, given the robotic parts evident in parts of it. He turned to Amy for a moment. \"This is an android I made of myself. I copied Eggman's schematics for his Shadow Androids and altered it to make this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails flipped a switch, and the android activated.  \u201cTails Android Unit 1 primed and ready!\u201d it exclaimed in a voice that mimicked the original\u2019s well. \u201cWhat are your commands, Creator?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as you can see, I have a lot of inventions that I need to test. I want you to test as many of them as you can on Rouge, but try not to use potentially dangerous ones. Keep her restrained so she doesn\u2019t escape. Continue to test all the inventions until I get back. Understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe android tilted its head for a moment before raising it again. \u201cOrders understood, Creator!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt saluted to Tails, who returned it before it went off to select a suitable invention. He then turned to Amy. \u201cAlright, Amy,\u201d he said as he put the gloves on. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nervously nodded. \u201cA little bit nervous but otherwise yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to do this, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026but I still want to go through with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails nodded and activated the gloves. He made contact with her back and felt himself being drawn in. Amy seemed to shudder a bit but maintained a brave face. As Tails disappeared further, Amy\u2019s shaking subsided. Once he completely vanished, her body completely relaxed while standing up. Her eyes opened, but it was Tails who was now seeing through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d he said in his new voice. \u201cThis is incredible!\u201d The mirror reappeared as he checked his new body out. He was soon fully satisfied that the gloves worked to perfection. \u201cWell, no time to waste!\u201d He then headed out in search of Sonic.</span></div></div>",

His thoughts couldn't think of 'himself' as Tails. Only as Amy. Tails was somebody exterior, someone different from Amy. Her mind couldn't think this way, think of herself as Tails, so he could not force hers to. *This way once Tails leaves me, I'll know exactly how to make sure Sonic still likes me.* Tails continued his and Amy's thought, smiling to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a couple hours on the train before she got back to Station Square as she just walked around, Tails quickly getting accustomed to Amy's body and way of thinking. He couldn't completely change the way she thought, but he could push her in the right direction, as long as he could come up with a reason Amy's mind accepted. *Tails'll have to remember that for when he becomes Rouge...* She pondered, feeling a strange pang of jealousy at the thought. Why was she jealous of... *Of course I'm jealous Tails gets to be Rouge.* She thought in a sudden tone of realization. *Its because I'm not Tails, he's just...  Driving me.* Tails continued experimenting with controlling Amy's thoughts, seeing where the barrier between his thoughts and hers were, what all he could get away with as her...

She now knew all of his normal hangouts, and where it'd be most likely to 'accidentally' bump into him. After about an hour of hanging around one of the city's Chili Dog stands, there he was, getting about 10 on a platter. She took a deep breath, nodding to herself...

I know you don't want to stick around too long, but it'd be nice if we could just take a little time and talk about more than the new plot you have to go and stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic just gave a chuckle and a smile at that. This was a side of her he hadn't seen...  Normally she was trying to cling all over him by now. She was being fairly calm and composed. They sat there and talked for a while, about the weather, about Amy's new apartment and about Sonic's new running shoes that Tails had designed. Sonic actually stayed there for much longer than he normally would, enjoying Amy's company. It was...  Weird. Something was different about her now. He saw her in a whole new light now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, its been nice talking to you, Sonic...  Hey, would you like to...  To maybe go out and do something together? It wouldn't have to be a date, it could be just as friends, but...  I would like it to be a date.\" She gave a blush as Sonic scratched the back of his head, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uhhh... Well...  Sure, why not? Tomorrow at 7, OK?\" He gave her a hug as Amy froze up, smiling as he dashed off. She stood there, frozen for about a minute before she came to her senses and went back to her apartment. She closed her eyes, concentrating on Tails separating from her as his hands began to make hers bulge... And he slowly left her body with a gasp. Amy collapsed, but was still conscious this time, tingling all over and cooing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails, that was...  I...  I couldn't tell that was you! I mean... I knew you were in me, and I knew you would be leading my thoughts...  But it all felt like me! I...\"</span></div></div>",

Technically, she quietly mused, it wasn't just Amy in that room. Several years earlier, Tails had agreed to help her get Sonic to be her boyfriend by possessing her body in order to do and say just the right things to get him interested. The experience with the gloves, however, had changed both him and Amy. For Amy, she still felt like she was completely in control of herself, just with a new personality that she loved. For Tails, he loved the experience so much that he had felt like he simply was her, an experience that nearly prevented him from separating from her body after he had successfully gotten a first date with Sonic. As Amy had made the confession that she wanted Tails to be her forever, he was all to eager to oblige. Of course, Tails couldn't just simply hop into Amy's body again. His disappearance would be suspicious, as would Rouge's. However, he had a solution to these problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had made a cloning machine and used it to make two clones of himself that he could program. The first was to act completely as himself, having only the data from the experiments as proof of their occurrence. The second was to take over Rouge with a second pair of gloves he had quickly fashioned. That clone was to act like Rouge but still have his own traits and memories driving her once the possession had occurred so that another scenario of Rouge trying to take over the lab would not happen. Needless to say, both clones had executed their roles perfectly, not even acknowledging to themselves or to the original that any change had taken place. After finally tying up those loose ends, Tails donned the first set of gloves once more and re-entered Amy's body, the sensation of becoming her even more powerful than the first time. As Tails' body physically disappeared, Amy's awoke with her eyes a shimmering sky blue before settling down to their normal green. A smile of complete ecstasy crossed her face as Tails' change was finally complete, this time knowing that the beautiful girl in the mirror was truly him for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook herself from those thoughts of the past. All that really mattered was that she was Amy Rose, happily in a relationship with the heroic Sonic. She dressed herself slowly, still enjoying every second but also very eager for the day ahead. She had another date with Sonic, which might involve anything from dinner to a nice restaurant to crushing Eggman's latest scheme for world domination. For all she knew, it might be the day he finally proposed to her, something that any outsider might have deemed impossible several years earlier. As she finally finished and got ready to go out, she spared one last thought about Tails, wondering how he was managing the lab in the original's stead. She quickly brushed it off, though. She was happy, and she had absolutely no regrets.</span></div></div>",

What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they work a bit too well. You see, when I was in your body, I eventually felt like I was completely you. That Tails was someone other than me and that I had always been you. The only thing that got me to remember I wasn't actually you was the hug from Sonic. While it probably felt good to you, it caused me to feel very uncomfortable because I'm Sonic's best friend, definitely not his girlfriend. Without that happening, I might not have been able to separate myself from you. Now, if that were to happen with Rouge, I'd end up allowing something dangerous to happen instead of preventing it. I need to modify these gloves a bit so that I'll stay in complete control without causing my mind to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded in understanding and helped Tails gather supplies he needed to fix the gloves. About an hour later, he was finished. \"That should do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's going to happen now?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need to make sure these gloves will work fine. Would you care to help me test them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so? Are you going to use them on me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the first choice. I'd be able to feel the differences with the gloves myself and make adjustments as necessary. Still, I already had the opportunity to be you. It would only be fair to give you the chance to be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy considered this offer. Being Rouge was an amazing sensation, but she was curious about what it was like to be a guy. Although she trusted Tails, she wasn't sure if she wanted to be possessed with the altered gloves. Then again, maybe Tails would be able to lend a helping hand for that date with Sonic. After thinking for a while, she finally gave an answer.</span></div></div>",
