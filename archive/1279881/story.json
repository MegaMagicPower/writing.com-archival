            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Koa and Derek walked in with there bags on their shoulders, excited about their first day of college. They\u2019ve been dreaming about this day since they started high school. So far, college was everything that they expected it to be. The day was going out with no problems, just like Koa wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think of our room?\u201d Derek said, \u201cpretty sweet, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s nice,\u201d Koa said, looking around, \u201cIt\u2019s blue. The tiling and carpeting is nicely done. It\u2019s clean. That\u2019s a bonus. Don\u2019t mess it up to much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir dorm room was pretty big. They had their own separate rooms, a bathroom, a kitchen that was connected to the living room that had two couched sitting in a right angle. Derek went to his room and set his bags down. He took in a deep breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is nice,\u201d Derek said. \u201cHey, want to go down and meet some people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...no, thanks,\u201d Koa said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll get settled in. Maybe I\u2019ll meet you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay,\u201d Derek said, \u201cand hey, while your at this settling in thing, could you unpack my stuff too? You always do it so neat.\u201d And with that, he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, shut the door!\u201d Koa yelled after him. He didn\u2019t come back. Oh well, maybe someone will come in and introduce themselves. Koa started to unpack. Within the hour, he was done. The only thing about the room was the hole in his wall. He didn\u2019t have any more posters to cover it up with either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Derek won\u2019t mind if I take on of his, Koa thought. He went over to Derek\u2019s room and opened the bag. He threw out a bunch of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSocks, shirts, ah, the poster I want,\u201d Koa said out loud, and went back to his room. He started to cover up the wall, but noticed something shiny in the hole. He looked closer and saw that it was a bottle with some red stuff inside. He looked around and found a coat hanger to get it with. After 10 minutes fighting with the wall, he finally got it out. It just looked like fruit punch to him. He set the bottle down and put the poster up. He picked the bottle back up and decided to taste it. There was only a on drink in it anyways. He gulped it down, and felt funny. It didn\u2019t taste like fruit punch. It kind of tasted like old chocolate mixed with math balls. He set the bottle down on his nightstand, and started to walk out of his room, when he suddenly felt sick to his stomach. He held his stomach and fell to the floor. Then, everything went dark.<br>\r\nHe woke up minutes later, and found out that he shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs in his head what he thinks he should when he heard something behind him.</span></div></div>",

He shrusg and walks over to his room, when the poster that Koa set up in his room caught his eye. He walks into the room to take down the poster. He sees the hole in the wall and puts it back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks over to the couch and lays down on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rough day,' he thinks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoa looks up and up to see that his friend Derek, who was now a giant, walk into the room. Koa looked at Derek's magnificent form as he called out his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KOA?!\" Derek called out. Koa covered his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoa watched as Derek started walking over to his room, and then stop. Koa was so hypnotized that his friend was now a giant monster, that he just realized in time that Derek was walking his way, and jumped just in time. Derek walked to the poster and then walked back out, nearly crushing Koa again, and went to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoa now has a decision. Go get Derek now while he is asleep, or wait until a better opportunity?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Koa looked over, and saw Derek standing in the doorway with 3 other people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDerek!\u201d Koa yelled as loud as he could. No one heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY,\u201d Derek said, with a smile, \u201cDID I LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoa covered his ears. Their voices were a thousand times louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKOA, YOU HERE?\u201d Derek asked, \u201cTHAT\u2019S MY ROOMMATE. I WANTED HIM TO MEET YOU GUYS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL, TYLER, MATT, AND DYLAN,\u201d Derek said, \"YOU CAN SIT DOWN IF YOU WANT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek\u2019s new friends were easy on the eyes as well. Tyler and Matt had brown hair, and Dylan had blond hair. They all had some sort of band shirt on, and shorts. Tyler was wearing white shoes, and Matt and Dylan were both wearing flip flops. Koa had to come up with a plan. He just had to get Derek\u2019s attention somehow. While he was figuring that out, the ground started to shake, and he noticed the buys all sat down on the couches and started to chat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH, HEY, \u201cDerek said, \u201cKOA UNPACKED HIS THINGS...AND NOT MINE. AW, AND HE EVEN TOOK MY POSTER!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to Koa\u2019s room. Koa ran to the side as Derek\u2019s foot came crashing down near him. He realized this was not a safe place to be, and walked against the wall to another place. Derek took the poster down, and saw the hole, and decided to put it back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI GUESS I\u2019LL HAVE TO UNPACK LATER,\u201d he boomed, and walked back out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoa was almost near the couches. If he was going to get anyone\u2019s attention, it would be Derek\u2019s. He didn\u2019t know the other guys. When he got to the couches, he noticed that it was Matt who was closer. Derek was on the far side of the couch, and he didn\u2019t want to risk going around anyone. He went slowly closer to Matt. He was tapping his foot up and down, and his other foot was on the couch. He walked over to his foot. He stopped and realized for the first time, that being this small was pretty cool. He noticed things that he never noticed before. He could see in Matt\u2019s foot the detail and everything. He snapped out of it and tried to decide the best way to approach this giant. He decided to go for the toes. It seemed easiest, and he would less likely be crushed. He walked over to them and with a struggle, climbed the sandal. It was at that moment, Matt decided to being both feet up to the couch. As he brought his feet up, he put his foot at an angle, and Koa fell right in between his big and second toe. Koa didn\u2019t know what to do. Should he move? If he did, would the giant notice and think he was a bug or something? Koa stood as still as he could, but was still moving around and he brushed his back against the skin of the toe. Koa froze. He slowly looked up and realize Matt didn\u2019t even feel a thing. He breathed a sigh of relief. He stared up at Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...amazing,\u201d was all that Koa could get out. Then, the ground beneath him started to shake. He looked around and saw Matt was scratching his other foot, which was overlapping the one Koa was on. After he finished, he put his foot back down on the ground. Koa held onto the strap of the sandal and hoped that Matt didn\u2019t feel him. When the shaking stopped, he thought that if he didn\u2019t feel him so far, he wasn\u2019t going to feel him at all. Koa climbed out from the toes, and onto the top of the foot and looked at his new landscape. They hairs on the toes were just a little bit bigger than he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL, MAYBE DYLAN AND I SHOULD BE GETTING BACK TO OUR DORM,\u201d Matt said. Koa was startled by this. If they went back to their dorm, wherever that was, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get Derek\u2019s attention, and he would be with giants that he didn\u2019t even know! As Matt got up, Koa held onto one of the hairs. Matt walked out into the hall, and Koa closed his eyes. The whole ordeal was like a roller coaster ride. When he opened them, he was in a completely different room. This room was green, and only had one room. Koa put two and two together and figured that Matt and Dylan were probably a couple. Koa held on longer and Matt went into the room and sat down on the bed, took off his sandals, and rested his feet up onto the bed. Koa let go of the hair, slid down the giants foot, and walked quickly away from his monstrous feet.. It didn\u2019t take long for Matt to fall asleep. Koa looked at his watched and noticed that it was 8:00. Classes started tomorrow. At this size, he wouldn\u2019t be able to go. He decided also to get some shut-eye. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Koa desperately struggled with his limited options. He could wait here until Derek or another student came by, or he could go find someone. Suddenly, he remembered a few names that struck him as choices, and most of them were close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, there is Mike Zarinski, a good friend who lives across the hall. Blond-haired, blue-eyed Mike has the figure of an Olympic athlete in his prime. He is both very strong and very smart for his young age of 15. Despite being young, he is quite mature. The only problem is that he sometimes hits on Koa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second choice would be Samantha Cleery a couple dorms down. With red hair and bright green eyes, she tends to stand out, especially with her big breasts. A carefree kind of girl, she's a sophomore, and she loves to party it up. She's not known for taking things seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is the hippie dude Kyle Vandenburg. His artistic skills are top and he has a massive art collection in his dorm down the hall. Brown hair and eyes, cover his well-thinking mind. He's sometimes a bit out of it, though, especially after meditating sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know of a few other's but they don't seem too reliable or too close.</span></div></div>",

Everything was huge! His bed was the size of a sky scraper, only bigger, and the ceiling reached out forever. He looked around and saw the reason for the thunder. There was some college guy walking around his dorm, and a good-looking one at that. He had blonde hair, and blue eyes from what Koa could tell. He was wearing a polo shirt, blue jeans, and some Nikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Koa called out. The guy didn\u2019t even notice. Koa felt stupid. No wonder he didn\u2019t hear him. He was half an inch tall! Well, he assumed anyways. It was then that it really hit him. If he was shrunk, and that small, then how could he get anyone\u2019s attention? He decided that his best bet was to go for the mysterious student. He was about to start walking over to him when he realized the guy was walking over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly - -!\u201d Koa yelled, and dived out of the way before a giant sneaker almost crushed him. The giant stopped where he was, looking into the room. Koa was petrified.. The tip of the shoe was even higher than him. He back up away from the shoe and against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoa decided that this giant was better than no giant. He needs help.</span></div></div>",
