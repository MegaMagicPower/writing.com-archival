But the room outside had a ton of scientific equipment &amp; a high roof to make room for the larger equipment. There were also four tesla coils on each corner of the room. You went to the cell bars &amp; looked up at the roof. Looking up made your headache worse but you thought you were in some sort of warehouse. You saw some hangar doors at the other end of the warehouse. You then saw two men outside your cell. \"Umm hello?\" you asked nervously. You got no response from them. \"... Can yous hear me?\" you asked him. \"Shut up! We are focusing,\" one of them said. You remained quiet for a bit.</span></div></div>",

You then got to your feet &amp; looked at them. \"Initiating now,\" one man said as he hit a button. The tesla coils around you started flickering purple electricity. \"What the!?\" you said looking at them. The electricity from them suddenly shifted into you. You were in alot of pain from it. You then fell to your knees. It felt like your insides were were being wringed out. You then saw something odd. Your skin was going dark grey. You saw black claws come out of your fingernails. You then saw something coming out of your wrists. It appeared to shark fins. You then let groan of pain as it felt like your bones were changing. Only it didn't sound like you. It sounded rougher. You felt something grow out your back. You looked to see it was a large fin. You also had a large shark like tail. You then felt yourself growing for some reason. You saw that you were getting thick with muscle but you were growing. By the time you stopped growing, you appeared to be 13 ft 6 inch. \"What did you do?\" you said in a rough voice. \"You will obey us &amp; fight for us,\" one man said. \"Why should I?\" you said to them with a glare, \"You made me into this &amp; I dont find that fair.\" You then saw the other man whisper something to him.</span></div></div>",

This got the attention of the scientists. \"Dont do that!\" one yelled. You just smiled &amp; continued kicking them out. A scientist picked up a radio &amp; said, \"This is Aqua cell. we are having a security breach... All the other cells have had breaches too!?\" He then got a Pistol just as you got out. You then kicked the pistol out of his hand &amp; slammed them to the wall with your tail.

You then looked into his blue eyes &amp; saw fear. \"Dont hurt me,\" he said closing his eyes. <i>Oops</i>, you thought embaressed. \"Were you human?\" you asked embarassed. \"Y-yes I was,\" he said nervously. You then got off &amp; stepped back a bit. You looked down &amp; said, \"... Sorry.\" \"Its ok... I dont blame you,\" he said getting to his feet. You then looked down shyly. \"I am not much of a people person,\" you said shyly, \".. I stick to computer games &amp; laser skirmish.\" \"In all honesty I'm not much of a people person eather,\" he replied, \"...I generaly hide behind games.\" \"Yeah,\" you said still shy, \"...I have a like for altering games temporally. Have you tried an Aussult rifle that shoots rockets in Halo?\" He then looked at you. \"They have that?\" he asked. \"If you have the right programs you can alter a map with various codes &amp; ... I will stop talking.\" <i>You are such a nerd Scott</i>, you thought. \"Why? I'm interested in that sort of thing,\" he said. \"Umm ok. You have a Transfer cable &amp; there are various fanmade alteration programs designed for mapping &amp; modding,\" you said. \"Hmm thats cool,\" he said scratching his chin. \"Anyway, my name is Scott,\" you said. \"Nice to meet you Scott,\" he said, \"My name is Donald.\" \"Good to meet you,\" you said. You then looked over yourself. You body looked muscly &amp; terrifying. \"I cant go home now,\" you said sadly as you sat down. \"Why did they do this to us?\" he said angrily, \"Its not fair!!\" He then punched a wall which demolished it. \"Yeah I know,\" you said thinking about your family, \"We are practically outcasts because of this. But what will we do?\" He then looked at the warehouses. \"If they where planing to use us as weapons, they would need a cover up,\" he said. Yeah..

It\u2019s gonna be like minecraft haha.\u201d \u201cHaha you play that too?\u201d he asked when he looked around. \u201cYeah. I have it on my laptop at home,\u201d you said, \u201cI wish I could either get a new laptop or get my laptop.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d Donald said as he looked at an old computer. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d you asked. He turned on the computer. \u201cThis still works\u2026 A little old though,\u201d he said as he was looking at the computer. \u201cBut if you haven\u2019t noticed,\u201d you said as you put a finger half the size of the computer on it, \u201cWe are too big to use it.\u201d \u201cI know but I\u2019m just curious,\u201d he said as he attempted to type with his claw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched him as he typed on the computer. \u201cLet\u2019s see you see anything we might find interesting... Maybe what they were doing?\u201d he said as he looked. \u201cOk,\u201d you said as you then pointed to a file with the name \u201cWere army\u201d, \u201cThat should say it.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Donald said as he clicked the file. You saw a lot of code on the file. \u201cHmmm,\u201d he said looking at it. \u201cIt\u2019s an encrypted file. They must have decryption software on this computer,\u201d you said. \u201cHmm ok,\u201d Donald said as he started looking on the computer, \u201cPascal Class don\u2019t fail me now.\u201d You then started looking around. \u201cHere we go,\u201d Donald say as he found a program and he started it up. You then picked up a pistol. \u201cThis would be useless haha,\u201d you said. Donald looked at you. \u201cHaha you think if they were doing this they would beef up security measures,\u201d he replied. \u201cYeah I would think that,\u201d you said thinking, \u201cMaybe our size was not what they expected.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cEven if they could \u201cControl us\u201d, how would they be able to cover it?\u201d \u201cMaybe night ops,\u201d you said, \u201cThink about it. Hardly anyone is on the streets at night\u201d \u201cYeah maybe,\u201d he said looking at the computer, \u201cDarn DOS is so slow.\u201d \u201cIt looks like windows Vista,\u201d you said, \u201cXP is a lot better because of the performance. Vista takes up too much RAM.\u201d \u201cYeah Vista is stupid. It just looks pretty and nothing more,\u201d he said as you then scratch your head, \u201cWe're geeks aren\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cI think so haha,\u201d you laughed, \u201cHaha well at least there is common ground.\u201d He then looked at the computer. \u201cFinally,\u201d he said as he looked at the file. You put the pistol down &amp; walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d you asked. \u201cSomething about Experimental Lycanthropy,\u201d he said as he read it, \u201cLooks like they were seeing if an unwilling mind could be controlled since they only had a few trys.\u201d \u201cOh. So they were going to have a control on us,\u201d you said, \u201cI may have heard something when I woke up. I had a large headache so I don\u2019t remember what they said\u201d \u201cSame here. But apparently it failed not just for use but whoever else was here,\u201d Donald said. \u201cSo I wonder how though. But I never thought this was possible though,\u201d you said as you punched your chest hard not feeling anything. \u201cWell it goes into detail but I can't understand this except it takes a ton of power to pull off,\u201d he said as he read on. \u201cYeah,\u201d you said, \u201cThat Purple electricity. Dose it mention anything about it?\u201d \u201cYep,\u201d he said as he kept looking, \u201cI can't help the feeling that there is some sort of off switch to this.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you asked. \u201cWell what if the government was to investigate them. I don't think they would take this lightly,\u201d Donald said as he gestured to himself and you, \u201cEspecially at this size.\u201d \u201cYour right,\u201d you said, \u201cI wonder if we can control it?\u201d \u201cI wonder too,\u201d he said as he rub his eyes, \u201cThis is killing my eyes having to squint like this.\u201d \u201cI might try transforming back,\u201d you said as you closed your eyes.\u2026</span></div></div>",

Just then you heard a car park outside. \u201cUh oh,\u201d Donald said. 6 troopers in black then ran into the warehouse. You grabbed the pistol that was on the table and pointed it at them. \u201cSurrender and you will be unharmed,\u201d one of the troopers said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Donald asked. \u201cWe are part of an organization called Lycans return. Do you surrender?\u201d another asked. \u201cWhat will you do if I do?\u201d Donald asked. \u201cWe can guarantee your safety and you will be given a new life,\u201d the trooper said. \u201cLycans Return is the group who runs this operation,\u201d you whispered as you looked at the computer.

You took the pistol off the table &amp; peeked around the metal plate &amp; aimed down the sight then shot a trooper with a shotgun in the head. \u201cRight between the eyes!\u201d you said as you got back behind cover. \u201cOk,\u201d Donald said as he peeked around the plate. Two troopers with assault rifles start to shooting at him. \u201cGah!\u201d he said as he got back behind cover. You then felt a power welling up inside of you. \u201cGrrrrr\u2026\u201d you growled. You then dashed out from behind cover. Everything felt slow to you. \u201cFeel the blood rage!\u201d you yelled. You then shot 4 troopers consecutively. You dashed at the last one &amp; gave him a nasty pistol whip to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt everyhing returning to normal. \u201cW-wow,\u201d you heard Donald say. \u201cI have no clue how I did that?\u201d you said suprised. Donald then put the metal plate down &amp; closed his eyes. \u201cMust have been something they did,\u201d he said as he flickered with purple electricity. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you said, \u201cI felt a power inside me. It felt like everything was slowing down.\u201d Donald was then back in his normal form. \u201cWell we should get out of here,\u201d Donald said. \u201cWait. I just had a thought,\u201d you said, \u201cThey know who we are. We should probably stay here.\u201d \u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Donald said as he scratched his head. \u201cI am just thinking because they could come after our family,\u201d you said, \u201cThey probably have been gathering intelligence on us. If we go back it could be an excuse for them to use our family as leverage.\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t they do that anyway?\u201d Donald asked. \u201cThey probably wouldn't want to risk exposure unless we are there,\u201d you said as you looked around at all the scientific equipment, \u201cHow much do you think this is worth?\u201d \u201cProbably a lot for the right person,\u201d Donald replied as he looked around. \u201cYeah. We are probably worth thousands now. Maybe even hundreds of thousands,\u201d you said. \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing they will keep after us,\u201d Donald said thinking, \u201cProbably use any means to get us.\u201d \u201cYes we will have be ready,\u201d you said. </span></div></div>",

You shrugged and said, \u201cMaybe we should get a jacket or something.\u201d \u201cHmm ok,\" he replied as he grabbed an ammo clip off a trooper, \u201cEww what is this?\u201d You looked &amp; saw it was an ammo clip for a sniper rifle. \u201cThat\u2019s an ammo clip,\u201d you said looking over at him, \u201cLooks like it\u2019s for a sniper rifle.\u201d \u201cOk then,\u201d he replied as kept looking for more clips. The pistol you had reminded you of James Bond. You then started thinking about Lycans Return. \u201cSomething up?\u201d Donald asked. \u201cJust thinking about stuff,\u201d you said, \u201cWho are these people &amp; what are they planning. But I get the feeling that the less we know the better.\u201d \u201cYeah I guess so,\u201d Donald said as he ran to the hanger door and looked outside, \u201cHmm.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we will just have to survive,\u201d you said following him, \u201cDo you want to go for a swim?\u201d \u201cThat sounds fun,\u201d he said as you look around. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d you asked. \u201cJust a bit cautious,\u201d he replied. \u201cOk,\u201d you said as you focused. Purple electricity appeared on you as you changed into your Wereshark form. You then dived into the water and made a huge splash. You then peeked your head up. \u201cHahaha are you going to join the shark in the water?\u201d you asked him. \u201cHaha I might,\u201d he said as he walked to the edge of the water. He started to crackle with purple electricity as he started to change to his werewolf form. \u201cHere I go,\u201d he said as he jumped into the water. He then came back up. \u201cCOLD!!\u201d he yelled. \u201cHahahaha\u201d you laughed as you swam to him. \u201cCold cold cold very cold,\u201d he said half laughing. \u201cHaha it\u2019s not cold to me,\u201d you laughed. \u201cHaha I wouldn't doubt that. You\u2019re a shark this is your element,\u201d he said. \u201cHaha I suppose,\u201d you said as you splashed him. \u201cHaha hey,\u201d he said as he splashed you back. You then dived under the water. You then came up behind him &amp; splashed him. \u201cHaha Hey!\u201d he said as he turned around. \u201cHaha Attack of Scott,\u201d you said as you made a huge splash with your tail. \u201cHaha hey!\u201d Donald laughed. \u201cHaha that was fun.\u201d you said as you climbed out of the water. \u201cHaha yeah,\u201d Donald say as he climbed out.He shook the water off him &amp; his fur poofed out &amp; he looked fluffy. \u201cDonald\u2026,\u201d you said giggling, \u201cYour fur looks fluffy.\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d he said as he looked at himself. \u201cHaha You\u2019re so soft and fluffy,\u201d you laughed as you felt his arm. \u201cHaha yeah,\u201d he laughed back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard your stomach growl. \u201cI wonder what time is it?\u201d you asked. \u201cSounds like we need to find some food,\u201d he replied. \u201cYeah I think so,\u201d you said \u201cI think we should go get some food. We may have to steal it though.\u201d He then looked to the ground with a worried look on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way,\u201d you said, \u201cGoing out in the day would be like a target on us.\u201d \u201cI know, but it doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Donald replied. \u201cIt is the only way,\u201d you said, \u201cThe only other way is\u2026 let\u2019s not say it.\u201d \u201cI know\u2026\u201d he said as he sat down \u201cJust don\u2019t to become a convict in the process.\u201d \u201cI know\u2026,\u201d you replied, \u201cBut it\u2019s the only way we can survive.\u201d \u201c(sigh) Why did it have to be us?\u201d Donald said as he clenched his fist in anger, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!!!\u201d \u201cI know\u2026\u201d you replied, \u201cBut let\u2019s just get something to eat then worry about it. \u201cOk\u201d he said as he calmed down. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d you said as you walked to the exit of the docks.

Looking on, you see that you're not the only one taking his leave, you see the marine iguana taking a swim, and in a distance you see two more making a swim, a shark and a wolf. You decide to make some other exit and you spot it, a forest path so you make a run accross, jumping from roof to roof and a daring leap, clearing the fence. Unfortunatly there was a guard on duty by one of the warehouses in the corner. You hear a siren wail and hear \"Attention all guards, one of the experiments is escaping. North of the complex. Recapture him at all costs.\" In a road ahead there's another SUV with the same Lycan insignia as the one you saw earlier, you turn to the trees and it seems to be following you. \"Oh no, I have to get away.\" you think. You manage to reach the forest but your too big to fit between the trees and end up knocking down one, then you got an idea. You picked up the fallen tree and tossed it towards the SUV like a spear, it hits it's hood. causing the knocking the vehicle's engine off. You quickly went back to human form and enter the forest, You hear the doors open then close. You hear the guards yell \"You think that's goning to stop us, think again.\" You have to be tricky with these guys. You look around and see many things to take down the guards. You see a cave and carefully look inside and see a sleeping bear. You leave the cave quietly and quicly hide behind a tree near the cave. Two of the guards comes in \"Might as well give up, you can't escape from us.\" You manage to throw your voice in the cave and say \"Oh yeah? I'm sure going to try.\" One of the guards points to the cave while the other one says \"Not today!\" they rush in and you hear the bear growl in anger and the two men yell the two men ran out tripped on a rock and knock themselves out. \"Good thing Greg taught me ventriloquism.\" You go to anther part of the forest and climbed the tree with one branch above another. The other two guards come in and stopped below you where you kick one of the branches loose \"BOMBS AWAY!\" You yell the two guards looked up as the heavy branch lands right on top of them. Knocking them out. You go into a clearing where you hear buzzing, you look up and see a hornets nest on one of the trees. You hear the last two guards coming \"As soon as we capture this one, we need to find the rest of the experiments, they too are reported missing.\" \"We'll search the town close by.\" You quickly hide and picked up a rock as the two guards comes in, you toss the rock at the hornets nest, it falls and the hornets soon are all over the guards, they yell in pain as they are stung. The ran in madness and ran right into a tree. Knocking themselves out. Your soon back at the SUV with all 6 guards, tied with vines. and gagged with pinecones. You hear your stomech growl, \"Whoa, I sure worked up an appitite.\" You check the SUV and you find a bag in the back, opening the bag you find hamburgers, about a dozen of them. \"Ooh, just what the doctor ordered.\" Then you have second thoughts, what about the rest? I'm sure they could be hungrey too.</span></div></div>",

You could use a bag of chips and a Pepsi with your burgers. But as you approach the town, something strange happens, your vision suddenly turns blue. You blink and shake your head trying to get your vision normal. \"Wha? That's strange.\" You say out loud. You suddenly feel something wrap around one of your ankles and then suddenly your hanging upside down from a nearby tree \"Well well, look what we caught.\" You hear a voice say, looking down, one of the guards looks at you with a menacing grin. \"One down, three to go.\" he says. A chirp from a device is heard from his belt. He picks up his two-way radio \"Report.\" He says in it. A voice says \"Bravo team here, spotted two entering the convenience store.\" The guard says \"Have two troopers follow them. But be careful, we're wanted men.\" The voice says \"So noted, Bravo team out.\" As the guard puts away his radio, I said \"So, you guys are nothing but criminals. \"So we are,\" he said, \"do you think that we'll ever let you go to tell anyone? Forget it.\" He yells out \"Jameson! Hunter!  Get the cage!\" \"Yes Commander. \" said another voice, two more guards wheel in a cage and place is under me where I was lowered into it and then locked in.  The commander picks up the bag of burgers I dropped and the DVD that fell out of my pocket \"What's this?\" He says \"Stealing our lunch is one thing, but hacking our computer is another. You're really in trouble now.\" I was weeled up the road I spotted one of their SUVs but it's being hoised up by a tow truck, the commander then goes to the towtruck operator \"Hey! This is our car!\" The man points to a sign: No Parking, Tow Away Zone. \"Can't you read that?\" The commander looks at Jameson in which he says \"That sign wasn't there when I parked it.\" The commander takes out his wallet \"How much do I owe?\" The man said \"$3500.00, you know the drill. Pay at the police station. Not me gringo.\" as the commander argues with the towtruck operator, I studied the sign and noticed that the ground at the base was freshly dug up, which means the sign was recently planted. I don't know who did it, but I do admire the prankster's work. As the towtruck drives away with the SUV in tow. The commander says \"Looks like whe have to go to the wharf, there's a boat there big enough to carry our cargo. We'll go by water.\" As I was wheeled towards the river, I decided to make things harder for them by transforming into my tiger form. Hunter, Jameson and the commander grunted as the cage became heavier, 5 minutes later we arive at a small dock where a tugboat is tied up to it. All three guards sat down near a bench \"Bad enough to loose transportation but lugging a thousand pound tiger?\" The commander says \"You guys need to work out more, I thought you millatary types are always in shape.\" The commander says \"I'll get the burgers out, we work up quite an appitite.\" Then...</span></div></div>",
