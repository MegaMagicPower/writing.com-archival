The crowds moving to and from through this entrance was a constant, as never ending it seemed as the ocean's tides to the west of the great city.  Within the auction was larger than some sizable villages could attest to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLining the walls were upraised pavilions and stage-like structures where auctioneers shouted prices and qualities of their wares.  Those were the more common of slave, good money for good property... but the center of the huge market was where the truly priceless items were offered.  Lit from above by the magical globes, an array of unique slaves were kept under constant guard.  The buyers communicated with a wave of their hand, and the barkers never spoke above a guarded volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such seller brought a young girl to stand before the small throng by a chain connected to the collar about her neck.  She was dressed in white, pointed ears appearing through her beautiful nut brown hair.  \"This lovely article hails from the Thistlepath Forests.  As you can all see, she is as beautiful as she is untouched.  Guaranteed pure, and softer than silk.  My starting price is fifteen hundred riol.\"  The elven maiden, barely old enough to hold that title, watched through teared eyes as her life was bartered away.  A buyer made the final bid and the girl was led away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barker grinned as he held out his hand to the stairs behind him.  \"As promised, I always have an item to interest you...\"</span></div></div>",

She had been an easily acquired prospect... but the tantalizing thought of betters to come had been more appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoney was no object, but a status symbol such as a slave bought at Veru'Vada was something above meager riol.  Gold coins were trifles.  This was priceless.  And as expected, an item of obvious worth was brought forward.  The opening bid seemed low for such a creature.  Within mere moments it was down to two.

He led her through the city on a leash attached to leather cuffs. His long strides forcing her to trot, hoofed feet clopping along behind his boots. She had no idea what he was, but when he had introduced himself as Captain Scales, the overseer, the huge scarred man tasked with keeping the peace in the slave pens, had gone pale.<br>\r\nShe sniffed, her bovine snout taking in the unfamiliar smells of a port city. She sniffed again, this time holding back her tears. She was a long way from the valley were she had lived. A long way from her mother and father and brothers and sisters. But she just had to see what was over the next hill. And that was when the slavers had taken her. Now she didn't know if she would ever see home again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScales had excellent hearing. Even over the sounds of the bustling city, he could hear the bovine girl fighting back tears. He nodded to himself. A young one far from home. At least the slave trade had stripped her of the needless bravado all to common in would be pirates. She would survive. She might not like it at first, but she would survive.<br>\r\nHe stopped at the foot of a gangplank and nodded at the young lycan that stood next to it. \"Is Stavos back yet?\"<br>\r\n\"No, sir.\" the lycan looked curiously at the minotaur that was with his captain, hand absently resting on the hilt of his cutlass. \"She just left the ship a couple hours ago. Something about finding a decent brothel and...\" <br>\r\n\"Scales!\" A tall muscular woman strode down the dock. \"What in the hells did you drag back this time?\" <br>\r\n\"New crew member.\" Scales tossed his first mate the lead to the young slave. \"Get her a berth and show her around. She should be in weapons.\" And with that he strode up the gangplank and disappeared.<br>\r\nThe sea-woman shook her head at her captain's behavior before turning to the bewildered minotaur. \"Well miss I guess I'm the first to welcome you aboard the <i>Reaver</i>. Let's get you aboard and get that leash off of you.\" Stavos led the girl past the lycan guard, who had returned to scanning the dock. Anyone who wasn't a crew member would be immediately stopped by him. Anyone that tried to overpower him and board would find that there was a large hole in his chest for some strange reason. Lycans were fiercely loyal to anyone who proved their worth, and Captain Scales had earned the loyalty of the pack that was a part of the <i>Reaver's</i> crew many times over. \"Do you have a name, girl?\"<br>\r\n\"Elvira, missus.\" Elvira looked around, bewildered by the ship. She had never conceived of something like the <i>Reaver</i> and had only vague ideas about the thing people kept calling the sea. She felt a little overwhelmed.<br>\r\n\"Sir,\" Stavos looked over the minotaur. Elvira's legs were covered in a brown fur, but her torso was bare of anything by sun bronzed skin. On her shoulder's was the horned cow's head typical of her race. Stavos looked down at Elvira's wrists, held together by leather cuffs, and noted the hard black nails. The looked to be just as hard as the hoofs and the mino-girl's legs. Stavos also noted that the girl had quite a bit of fat on her. She remembered hearing something about minotaurs, while the bulls looked like the were carved out of stone the heifers carried quite a bit of extra weight. \"The proper term of address for a superior on this ship is sir. How old are you, Elvira?\" She fired off that last question as a test to see how fast the girl could learn.<br>\r\n\"Fourteen years, mi-sir.\"<br>\r\nAt that Stavos stopped and stared. By her estimate Elvira was more than six feet tall, and had breasts bigger than most human woman. And the girl was only <i>fourteen</i>. \"Hells girl, how big are you going to get?!\"<br>\r\n\"My mama is just over seven feet tall, sir.\"<br>\r\nStavos blinked, regaining her composure. \"Well, Elvira. I'm Alicia Stavos. First mate aboard the <i>Reaver</i>.\" She turned and waved for Elvira to follow her below deck. \"Let's see about getting that leash off and some clothes on you.\"<br>\r\n\"Why do I need clothes, Sir?\"<br>\r\nStavos turned back to stare again. Elvira blinked her big cow eyes. \"It's normal to wear clothes where you're from isn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\" Elvira said slowly, \"But, it's sunny right now.\" <br>\r\nStavos realized how Elvira had such a dark tan. It seemed the minotaur had no inhibitions regarding nudity. And Stavos had an explanation in front of her. \"Look, Elvira. It may be different were you are from, but in human society women, and girls,\" she added taking into account Elvira's age,\"Who walk around bare-chested are usually considered to be...whores. So unless you want men who meet you to get the wrong idea, we need to at least get your nipples covered up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after Elvira had been clad in a loincloth and leather vest, the first mate showed the new crew member around. Stavos wasn't entirely happy with the vest, It had been pilfered from one of the smaller members of the crew and it strained to restrained the mino-girl's chest, drawing almost as much attention as if Elvira had just walked around naked. But the girl had flatly refused a canvas shirt. Stavos, resigned to the girl's whims in this matter proceeded to show her around.<br>\r\nEventually Elvira asked the inevitable question. \"How does this thing move?\"</span></div></div>",

This frees up certain amount of crew for other duties.\"<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n\"Manning the weapons and boarding ships of course. We are privateers after all.\" No one familiar with ships would mistake them for anything else. The <i>Reaver's</i> lean form was all predator. She was built to come in fast and tear her prey of part.<br>\r\nElvira looked confused, \"What do we do?\"<br>\r\nStavos reminded herself of the girls inexperience. \"Privateers are a type of bandit, employed by the Empire to attack and harass the ships of her enemies.\"<br>\r\n\"Bandits?\" The mino-girl sounded rather alarmed.<br>\r\nStavos looked at the youngster kindly,\"We aren't the nicest of people, Elvira. But we take care of our own. And as of right now, you are one of our own.\"<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by uneventfully. Stavos showed the young girl around familiarizing the girl with the massive levin bolt casters affixed to the gun deck for ship to ship combat, as well as the smaller versions in the weapons locker which only the strongest could carry. Stavos watched enviously the ease with which Elvira hefted the small cannons. The girl could definitely be an asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun fell below the horizon and the rest of the crew returned to the ship. Some wished that the were in the arms of their sweetheart or a well payed whore, but knew better than to tempt fate the night before the <i>Reaver</i> left port. By ones and twos they slipped below deck to rest for the voyage.<br>\r\nScales looked up from his charts when someone rapped on the door to his cabin, \"Come.\"<br>\r\nStavos slipped inside. \"How much do you know about that slave you bought today?\"<br>\r\n\"Minotaur, female. Fourteen or fifteen years old. Probably from one of the more isolated valleys in the southern provinces. Why?\"<br>\r\nStavos shook her head. \"Why did you buy her?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n\"You never do.\" Just like when he disappeared when they were kids. Years later he showed up just as she left the Navy saying he had a ship and needed a first mate. He hadn't changed much in the years between. And he was so different from the boy she had run wild with in the capitols streets. \"Did you get any special orders this time?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, the Republic has finally built itself a Chaos Cruiser. We are tasked to find, disable and, after learning everything we can, destroy it.\"<br>\r\n\"They're sending us on a search and destroy mission? For a warship?\" Stavos screeched, \"Have they lost their minds?\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" Scales rubbed his fingers through his ink black hair, \"Deniability. No one is about to get blamed for setting the <i>Reaver</i> on the ship of an ally. After all it is a pirate ship.\"<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" Stavos snarled, \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\nScales looked at his old friend, \"This is my last voyage.\"<br>\r\nThat stopped her, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know why, Not yet.\" He played idly with a ball of flame that appeared in his hand. \"Only that it is to be.\"<br>\r\nStavos sighed, \"You and your hells cursed premonitions. And what will happen to the <i>Reaver</i> when your gone?\"<br>\r\n\"You will be captain. I already confirmed the succession with the lycans.\" Scales smiled wickedly as his first mate spluttered, \"Good night, Alicia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ship!

Her lithe frame covered by a simple shift that was barely long enough to preserve her modesty, and a plain leather collar around her neck.

If this was the best the freakish human could do it was amazing that she could afford Baeliss at all. Not that the human paid full price for one such as herself. It galled Baeliss that she had been sold as a common female. \"Young, reasonably fit. Female.\" She believed the auctioneer had called out. There had been no mention of her status as a priestess. And from the look of some of the potential buyers the only dancing they saw in her future was to be preformed on her back. Baeliss may have been only sixteen, but she knew she didn't want to lose her virginity as a man's private whore.<br>\r\n\"Brokenshield!\" A deep voice boomed. The pair turned to see a man striding purposefully towards them. \"There you are! The Duchess Dastell wishes to discuss the arrangements for her daughter. She apparently has taken a disliking to me can you believe that.\" The man stopped just in front of them, a head shorter than Baeliss's owner but just as broad. He looked incredulously at the small felis. \"Siri's Sword! Who did you kill to get that?\"<br>\r\n\"<i>Her</i> name,\" Brokenshield put the emphasis on the pronoun. She shifted slightly, putting her elbow in front of the slave. \"Is Baeliss. And she will be staying with me.\"<br>\r\n\"Baeliss, huh. So is there a chance I can...\"<br>\r\n\"Jibbinsyn!\" A grey haired matron stormed in, \"There you are! Milord said you were on laundry detail and gods above you will do laundry.\" A thick arm snaked out and took the man by the ear. Dragging him away she called over her shoulder, \"Wyna dear, Milord would like to speak with you. He's in his study.\"<br>\r\nBaeliss stood still, nonplussed by the sudden activity around her. Her owner, stepped forward and gestured for the slave to follow. As Baeliss followed she realized that not once had the woman touched her. Baeliss wondered just what kind of person had bought her. They stopped just outside a door that she assumed led to \"Milord's\" study. Her owner turned to look at her, \"While we are in this room do not speak unless spoken to. Understood?\" Baelliss nodded.<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me Sir Brian?\"<br>\r\nThe silver haired knight looked up from his desk. \" Ah Brokenshield, yes I did. You have met the Duchess Dastell, yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" Turning, Baeliss's owner indicated that she could take the unoccupied chair.<br>\r\n\"Good what do you think about...\" What followed was a rapid exchange that Baeliss could barely follow. It reminded her of the time when she got caught in a ongoing philosophical debate between two senior priests. Both parties knew the subject intimately, and so only half of the conversation was actually said. \"Very well. I will arrange for a carriage to take you to their home tomorrow. Who is this?\"<br>\r\nBaeliss suddenly found her self the center of attention. She opened her mouth to speak, then clamped it shut remembering her owner's instructions. \"This is Baeliss. She will be staying with me.\"<br>\r\n\"How in the world did you afford her? I knew you were frugal, but I had never imagined you has accumulated that much wealth.\" Sir Brian looked impressed. \"I will make sure Lisa knows to send a cot to your quarters. You are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\" Baeliss once more found herself following her master. This time they entered what was clearly someones room. Her master turned to address her. \"These are my quarters. You will be staying here with me. Alright?\"<br>\r\nBaeliss spoke for the first time since the auction. \"Yes, master.\"<br>\r\n\"Call me Wyna.\" The tall human smiled. \"Lisa should bring a cot up soon. I'm going to go downstairs for a bit, can I get you anything? Food? Drink?\" Wyna paused, \"An instrument?\"<br>\r\nBaeliss gasped. How did the human know? Her mind flashed to a beautifully carved flute made from her grandmothers bone. It had been her most prized possession. And know she might never see it again. Wyna, perhaps sensing Baeliss's dicomfort turned to leave. \"A flute!\" Baeliss said quickly. Wyna turned back. \"I play the flute.\"<br>\r\nWyna smlied. \"I'll try to find a flute.\"</span></div></div>",

The Salaket slave looks around and sees more of what he say back at the City Square: More people stabbing and dragging the guards away. He continues to look around on the rooftops and sees a glimpse of the Black-Robed Man he saw at the auction house on the roofs. The strange man turns and leaves the view.

They walk through the gate and as the Salaket slave looks around at the other slaves maintaining the property and working in the fields of sugar cane. They continue their way to the back of the property and towards the Slave Quarters where some slaves who have done their work are relaxing and eating and drinking. There are many slaves including a dragon slave and a kobold slave, and other races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe this is where you come in Slave Master.\" The noble businessman says to the high-ranking guard from the escort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do what I always do.\" He says as the businessman turns back to his villa. \"You two,\" he commands to two guards, \" Hold him down.\" Those words are infamous to the other slaves as some of them gasp in horror at what's about to happen. The two guards hold the Salaket slave and bend him over. The Slave master pulls a branding iron from the burning fire pit as he presses the hot piece of metal against the skin of the Salaket. The slave cries in pain as he is unable to scream thanks to the metal muzzle prevents him from opening his mouth. As the slave master removes the branding iron, he puts it in a container full of water and back into the fire pit. \"All done,\" he says as he lowers his head to the still crying slave's face, \"Wasn't that quite lovely?\" He asks as if this was a sick game to him. Then the noble businessman comes back as he tells the slave what to do. </span></div></div>",

Imagine, not only the noteriety of being able to actually have bought from the Veru'Vada auction but to have bought royalty! To have a king wipe your arse if you so demanded it! It was too much for many to pass up! Scuffles broke out within the crowd as bids were cast and then instantly outbid.

I used to be a gladiator myself, so you'll be learning from the best. So, what are your names?\" Scorpio asked.<br>\r\nYou didn't expect this.

Those names are perfect! You'll be Trevor the Terrible and Lunatic Luna! Oh, you're going to be winners, I know it.\" Scorpio said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon reached Scorpio's mansion, a two-storied stone house on the edge of town. Scorpio didn't have a team of butlers and maids,  but he kept the place looking nice himself.<br>\r\n\"Come on, you two. You have to learn the basics. Now.\" Scorpio said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScorpio took you inside and gave the two of you wooden practice swords. He quickly taught you a basic combination strike and how to block. Whenever you did it incorrectly, he would smack you furiously, leaving you crying on the floor. Your dad had smacked you when you were bad before, but not like this. One time, he hit you especially hard and you didn't want to get back up.<br>\r\n\"Get up! Come on! You want to survive, you need to be able to take the pain!\" Scorpio said.<br>\r\n\"I.. I'm just a kid...\" You whimpered.<br>\r\n\"Bah! Bullshit! Your childhood is over here and now! You are no longer a kid, you are a warrior!\" Scorpio said.<br>\r\nYou tried to get back up, but you stumbled pathetically. Something about it softened Scorpio's hard, shriveled dark heart. He reached down and helped you up, and wiped your tears away like your father used to. Maybe... just maybe... you hoped one day Scorpio could be like a father to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. How about you and Trevor spar. Just practice striking and blocking.\" Scorpio said.<br>\r\nYou and Trevor held your wooden swords and faced off.</span></div></div>",

Her green robe was cut and torn in places from swords and knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the worst moment of her life, she'd been out collecting herbs for potion making when the slavers ambushed her, she'd killed four of them and wounded many others but in the end she'd been overwhelmed and dragged across the Empire to this auction house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was immortal and now she would spend countless years a slave to whoever had the money and depravity to buy her.

As it turned out she was not into men and as far as she was concerned she hated the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't what worried her though<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer buyer was a noble of the Empire, that already worried her as the Emperor heavily frowned on nobles who practiced slavery. So either this man was a rotten degenerate who didn't care what the Emperor thought of him, or he was a man who was in the Emperor's good graces through whatever sorts of bribes and deals he'd made. Both options were incredibly bad for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard holding her arm roughly pushes her to her knees, her robe protecting her knees from the rough stone, while the other guard handed her chain to the noble who accepted it silently.  Her buyer was flanked by several men, some in armor and others in grandiose tunics, obviously his guards and retainers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, and walk with us elf.\" he says simply and hands the chain to one of his aides. She can feel the magic collar forcing her to rise and follow, the chain is little more than an aesthetic as she can't disobey the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drearily looks around her as she walks, she never really got the chance to look at any of the other slaves besides the ones who were on the special slots. She silently prays for the elf maiden that was sold before her and for Sava who would be sold next. She can see the sorrow and hopelessness in the eyes of the slaves she passes, men and women, human, elf, dragonkin, and others as the buyers ruthlessly inspect them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she is out of the auction house and being led to a carriage. Horses were saddled next to it, probably for the guards to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne guard opens the door and the noble steps in followed by some of his aides. She feels the chain drag her into the carriage with them as the guard steps in behind her and closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's placed on one side, next to the guard while the noble and his aides sit across.

He could tell her to kill herself or do any number of shameful things and she could not disobey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can feel in addition to see his eyes bore into her, there is a fierce nobility in his eyes and almost instinctively her back straightens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a mage, or you were one. You are useful in many ways, and I can recognize talent when I see it. Your duties are simple, you will make potions of various kinds for the my use and the use of the people I am in charge of. I can also assume that you are knowledgeable about various parts of elven history and culture. You will be instructing the children of my retainers and my immediate family in these customs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalaina nodded, the first part was understandable and even expected, her skills as a mage included alchemy and there were numerous potions to enhance a person's abilities temporarily that would aid soldiers in the field and workers in their craft. But the second part confused her, why would he want her to teach about the history and culture of her people? Humans had been trying to negotiate better with the elven lands, especially the Empire. It made sense that learning their history and customs would help them work better with elven diplomats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut elves had a natural distrust of humans, after all who wouldn't distrust a species that tended to sell it's own into slavery. Elves hated slavery and it was firmly outlawed in their lands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way she was doomed to making potions and teaching for the rest of her life. So lost was she in her misery she almost missed his next words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, as a noble of the Empire and governor of Caesia it would not look well for me to have a slave in they eyes of the Emperor. So, your slavery will last as long as it takes for you to work off your debt.\" He said crisply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas, was he really telling her that she wouldn't be a slave forever? She only had to work off her debt, but how much was that, how long would it take? She couldn't remember how much she'd been sold for, though she knew it was extraordinarily high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bought you for 200 gold coins, an incredible amount, but a mage is an incredibly rare catch for slavers. So I imagine it'll take several years for you to work off such a debt.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll hope of a quick and easy sentence flew away, 200 gold coins was enough to buy a minor estate and still have enough money to furnish it, hire servants and still have enough to live comfortably. She'd be working for 5 to 6 years at the least. But she was immortal, it would work out. She'd deal these six years and be free. After that she swore to never be caught again, she would become so strong that no one would dare try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we arrive in the city you will be handed off to Sela. She will explain everything else you need to know.\" He closed his eyes and leaned back in his seat, obviously done saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her own eyes, deciding she'd get as much sleep as she could.</span></div></div>",

It was set at the crossroads leading from the capital, then to the sea, and to the border of the Kingdom of Arisia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThusly it was a major hub where travelers stopped from all across the land, mixing culture from many different people in one city. Merchants brought goods from across the world to sell and the city prospered. You could literally find something from any land in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the carriage rumbled through the streets, Malaina stared out at the people walking down the streets. Humans, elves, dwarves, she even saw a dragonkin exiting an inn. Some stopped to stare at the carriage as it went by while others went about their business. This city would be her home for the next 6 years, she hated it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage stopped at a large manor that extended to several other attached compounds. More guards roamed the estate, some patrolling the grounds while others could be seen in the shadows of the building. There were others there too, male and female, some had collars like hers on while others did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he hire regular servants? If so then what was the point of buying slaves? She remembered him saying that the slaves he bought worked off their freedom, maybe these were freed slaves who'd stayed to work for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the carriage were opened and she was dragged out again, standing in the midst of several guards. The lord waved most of them away and walked forward, beckoning for her to follow, as if she had a choice in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led her to a small building attached to the main compound. The inside was sparsely furnished with just a few tables and chairs, along with rows of bunks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you will be sleeping at night, it will take a few days to prepare your workroom so until then you will teach my three nephews and nieces starting tomorrow before noon.\"  He turned around and yelled something in a foreign tongue and a small, elderly human woman came walking from across the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sela, this is a new edition to your building. Show her around please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, who apparently was not a slave, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, master Rodrick.\" Sela replied as Rodrick walked away with his escort. Sela turned towards her and frowned, sizing her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you just a frail little thing. Gonna have to toughen you up, put some meat on those bones while you're here eh.\" Her speech had a small verbal tic to it that Malaina couldn't place, not that she'd been many places outside elven lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you got a name girl?\" Sela asked expectantly and she pondered the thought of telling her. Of course she could probably force it out of her so not saying anything was pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malaina.\" she said slowly, not wanting to really interact with any of them if she could avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSela gave her a knowing look and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then Malaina, let's go show you around.\"</span></div></div>",

Who was the new slave, was she pretty, why had she been bought and what was her purpose. She got these looks from slaves and free men alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe estate was busy, there were the patrolling guards who payed her little mind if they even took notice of her at all. The servants, she envied them the most, they were free men and women who'd gone to work here willingly unlike her. It wasn't fair! She was supposed to be back at home right now, studying magic and all its myriad forms. She had dreams of being a powerful mage, scholarly in her knowledge. Now she would be a slave for the next 6 years.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slaves were almost as bad as the servants, at least two dozen of them, all doing their work with a smile, waving at her and chatting amongst each other. Had they been so broken that they enjoyed their slavery to this man? She couldn't envision ever enjoying this, she wanted nothing more than to start flinging fireballs everywhere, to see this place and everyone in it burn in her wrath/ Unfortunately the magical collar around her neck prevented it, at least they had removed the chain leash attached to it, it was far less mortifying than it would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Sela was talking and it would be best to listen, she didn't want to be hit for not learning something. But it was all boring things that she really didn't want to learn or understand, all she cared about was getting through the six years and then running as far away from here as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you'll only really need to know your room, workstation, and the yard where you'll be teaching the young masters. Do a good job and you'll be payed well for your services girl.\" Sela said, snapping her out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paid? I'm a slave, I don't get to keep anything I make.\" Malaina replied angrily, that was part of the reason she was upset about her job, she had no desire to make money she couldn't use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSela gave her a patronizing look,, that just made her even angrier. Why was she looking at her like that, like she knew something Malaina didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually that would be true, but Rodrick believees that giving slaves an investment in their work makes them work better, so you'll get a small portion of the profits you make, you can put them toward  paying your debt or just for your own enjoyment. Rodrick has little organized excursions for the slaves at certain times of the week. It's all monitored so they don't run or get into too much trouble but otherwise they are allowed to buy things and decorate their rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalaina was genuinely confused, this made no legitimate sense. She couldn't really think of a good reason why someone would do something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he do that? If what you said is true then why does he even buy slaves, why not hire servants to do the work.\" Slaves were expensive and hard to maintain, giving them a profit just lowered his own profits. Sela must have seen the look on her face because she chuckled and shook her head like she was dealing with a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalaina hated that, she was probably older than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think most of the servants here are? Most of us were slaves who earned our freedom and kept working. We had nowhere else to go, we had free lodging and food with the potential to earn money so why leave?\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about it for a moment before the brilliance of the plan hit her. By giving the slaves a profit he actually lengthened the amount of time they served him. Alchemy was an expensive practice, she could make considerable money on her own and even a small cut of the profits would net her some substantial money. If she were to put everything she earned towards her debt she would be out of her in less than half the time, but she'd have nothing and be miserable the entire time. Especially if she saw other slaves with personal effects of their own. He was using a carrot and stick method with additional peer pressure to not only get his slaves to work longer but to enjoy themselves while they did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to admit he was a clever bastard. She could be miserable for roughly two years or have a relatively east servitude for six years. She both hated and respected him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who are these brats I'm teaching.\" she said just as Sela turned on her, an anger in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call them like that, Master Rodrick is giving you an arguably better life than you would get elsewhere. You will show proper humility and respect. His three sons are young, roughly nine to ten each.\" Sela huffed angrily and kept walking, leading her back towards the slave quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she'd be teaching kids just about to come into puberty for six years, she wondered if there was an ulterior motive to this move but the promise of food and sleep was overwhelming so she just followed.</span></div></div>",

A few of the women in the crowd were in awe. The prince was the most handsome male in the region. He had a wondrous face, piercing eyes, and beautiful black hair. He came to the vendor and gave him the bag. \"This should be enough for the naga, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vendor trembled a bit, \"Y-Yes your lordship! I-I can set up the cage and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need\" he spoke. \"Simply put some chains on her and I will be off.\" The entire crowd gasped, including the vendor. The prisoner, however, was intrigued. The prince knew of a naga's intelligence, being identical if not more than that of a human's. He was also not very big on slaves. All of the servants at the castle were treated like citizens. The prince focused his gaze at the vendor, \"You are not questioning me...are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No sir! I will get on it right away!\" Several other men assisted him with this task. They put chains onto the naga's neck, wrists, waist, and parts of her tail. The vendor reapproached with the main chain and the key. \"H-Here you are sir...are you sure you do not want the cage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, I have my guards here to aid me.\" He gently tugged on the chain, signaling the naga that he was leaving. Alongside him were his two most trusted and skilled guards. The naga shifted her eyes between them. The chains on her were placed properly so that they restricted her movements so she could not attack.</span></div></div>",

The markings prove this one is indeed of the Dragonkin.\"  The barker motioned for all eyes to see the intricate scar-like marks that crisscrossed in hypnotic patterns all across the girl's skin.  But, unlike any normal scar, these looked charred; utterly black except on the very outer edges which held a red tint.  \"I know what you all think you've heard, how dangerous these dragonspawn are... well I assure you that it is as harmless as a puppy just as long as you keep the collar on.\"  The barker gave the chain a quick yank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava wanted to snarl at the idiot that had just jerked her neck... more than that, she wanted to sink her teeth into his face.  To her dismay though, he was right.  Like an invisible force held her steady, the collar made sure she remained docile.  She felt him touch her again and a shiver ran up her spine... gods his hands were cold!  \"What's more, these creatures are as wily as the beasts they hail from.  It looks like us, true enough... but what could it be hiding?  Wings perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the command take root, Sava couldn't fight the feeling of her wings unfurling.  Like liquid turning solid the wings took shape and spread behind her, great leathery things with hooked claws and ending in sickle-like horns.  Like her marks, Sava's wings were as black as demon blood.  The crowd awed at her display, a wingspan several times her own height that spread farther than the stage was wide... their marvel disgusted her.  Why care?  They were simply wings, all her brothers and sisters had them, it was natural.  She didn't awe at humans or elves for having hair on their arms... occasionally at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can she do besides scowl?\"  A voice called from the crowd.  This was the first time in weeks Sava had not been called an it.  She hated being called \"it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What type of question is that, good sir?  I sell the finest merchandise around, not simply decorations.  This commodity is as beautiful as it is powerful.\"  Another cold hand ran through Sava's hair, showing off the coal-colored locks.  She managed a barely audible hiss.  \"Such size belays its strength.  Were it inclined, which is assured ladies and gentleman the collar prevents, it could lift and toss my whole body clean out of the marketplace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava couldn't bring herself to grin for the devilish warmth she felt at the thought of chucking the cold man out that archway... or headfirst through a wall.  Watching his bloody corpse slump to the ground would have been far more appealing than simply gnawing on him like she originally wanted.  \"Is there anything further before I begin the bidding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she breath fire?\"  Sava rolled her eyes, something she could thankfully still do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry my young sir, but no.  So, without further issue I will start the bid at five thousand riol!\"  Another thing Sava barely understood, and that was money.  Why the likes of people before her bartered in gold coins, not useful things like territory or food.  Their thinking didn't make sense.  Even as they bartered for the right to her very life, she still scowled at their greed.  To think she herself had once been fully human left a weight in the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her mind leave the confines of the auction as she remembered better times.  Times before a group of masked men had attacked her while she bathed.  She had made several of them regret it, but the remainder had succeeded in stealing her away.  Men and women trading the lives of others for shiny metal... it was truly pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava was not given more time to ponder when the barker yanked on her chain as he screamed, \"sold!\"  Immediately led to the stairs, Sava was handed to a guard and practically dragged away from the stage.  There was a small group of people waiting outside the rigid tent that housed the slaves.  Despite their number, Sava could smell a leader's confidence.  She looked straight at the one standing at front... this was the one who'd purchased her life.  One the collar would force her to call \"master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought turned her stomach.</span></div></div>",

Despite the collar's influence, a series of short hisses passed through Sava's lips.  She was giggling, but only the guard took notice.  He looked ready to strike but no blow fell.  \"Of course, your grace.  We hope to see you again in a year's time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"  The guard returned to the block at that, leaving Sava standing alone and barely clothed under many pairs of eyes.  She did not waver, but stood tall... even flaunting herself slightly.  She had claws, a tail with dusky scales that ran up over most of her back and rear... there were even small spikes lining her spine.  But, despite all this, her body was for lack of a better term... perfect.  She had every right curve, slim and trimmed in all the best spots.  Slender and sightly, she was indeed as beautiful as proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though at that moment Sava's collar held her immobile and docile, what with her wings drooped and tail slumped haphazardly on the ground... despite it all she was no passing sight.  \"I see the tales were not simply that, but true.  She is a marvel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And vicious as they say, my lord.  She may look calm, but there is fire behind those dragon eyes.\"  The man who spoke immediately stiffened as Sava's piercing sapphire eyes fell on him.  The hair-line pupil widened slightly as she focused, reading his breathing and perspiration.  This man was afraid.  They all were... all but the one they called their lord.  He stood impassive; she could hear his steady heartbeat and his calm breaths.  Despite the facades of bravado he had around him, this man had true courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava had to check herself, did she find an inkling of respect?  No... it had to be the collar.  This man had just, for all rights, bought her soul.  The confounded collar was even trying to make her want it!  Almost on queue with her thoughts, the lord spoke again.  \"Do not look so pitiful.  You are a proud creature, appear so.\"  There was freedom in those words, that of movement.  Stiff muscles creaked as the collar unlocked them, sore joints worked out kinks as Sava stretched.  Her barely clothed body moved as fluidly as a cat's as she loosened herself. The sight drifted further from the norm as Sava lifted her wings to sit comfortably furled, her tail lifting off the ground to sway behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could almost smell the different thoughts floating through the air.  She ignored the lusting glances, keeping her gaze on the lord.  If she was to serve, it had damn well better be someone worth her attention.  \"That's better.  Come, it is a long journey to your new home.\"  He simply motioned after that, once again offering the freedom for Sava to move on her own.  She stepped forth lithly, bare soles pattering on the stones as she followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man even tried to take hold of the chain, the means for absolute control... but a glare from Sava's new master made the servant immediately drop it.  \"Be sure to have that chain removed as soon as possible.  It is unsightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my lord, it is part of the control collar!\"  One man complained, audibly squeaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt there will be issue.  Will you prove a problem if I do this?\"  He had asked her a direct question.  Sava blinked... unsure for a moment before glaring at the squeaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... my master,\" she said in a voice that barely registered above a growl.  She had not heard her own words in so long.  She made sure they were edged like a sword at squeaker, she didn't know the next time she could use her tongue for more than tasting her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... I knew I should have brought my knights.  You lot are making yourselves look like fools.\"  The group continued on as Sava took a spot just behind and to the right side of her master.  She felt curious hands tap at her tail, wings, and brave ones at her spines even... but none for more than a moment.  She ignored these, deciding instead to watch this lord as he led the group to wherever their destination was.  He held himself high, spoke little, and was as mindful of her as she was of him.  He didn't even need to glance at her for her to know he was examining her.  He used his ears, but that's all that was required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a very interesting man.  Again Sava mentally slapped herself, she would not give into the collar's influence so easily.  The slavers had not broken her, and neither would it.  She removed herself from the mental reprimand as the group reached a caravan just inside the city's second inner wall.  The lord waved a man over and spoke in a hushed whisper.  His words may have been low, but Sava heard just fine.  \"We will return a different way than we came.  I know how some of these slavers operate.  Make haste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord,\" the man spoke with a bow of his head.  The group all moved to mount a number of horses as a wagon of some type was loaded with a multitude of items and objects.  \"My lord... the slave, how will we transport her?  We did not bring a spare horse and the wagon is full.\"  This illicited an audible growl from Sava's throat.  The thought for her to ride in any way on a creature she would sooner eat alive then consider of any other use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A horse?  Are you mad, she would frighten it.\"  The lord spoke as if he were scolding a child.  \"She has wings, she can use them.  Unless they are just for show.\"  Excitement like icy thunder swept through Sava's veins.  Would he allow her?  She instantly spread her wings to full and hunch slightly, as if waiting for the go ahead.  \"You see?  She knows herself well, we should not doubt that.  Fly, and follow us from above.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had those words fallen from the lord's lips did a blast of air spread over the whole group as Sava took off with sleek form.  Her wings spread to full once more as she caught an updraft and soared.  At that moment she didn't care if it was the collar or not.  She liked this master, if even a little bit.  Shed been grounded far too long, and it was like a wave of relief flushed through her at the feeling of wind and air all around.  This was where she belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her fly high above, the lord grinned.  \"What a magnificent creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord... what exactly do you intend to do with it?  It is not as if she would serve as a kitchen slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much.  I have not yet decided on a definite purpose for her.  Though it will be one that suits her unique... heh... abilities.  That is for certain.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night fell quickly.  Fires were lit all about the halted caravan as men and women sat about them, eating and talking.  Laughter sometimes echoed through the starry sky, with guards posted the group was much without care.  The lord sat in silence by his lonesome, simply watching the fire before him crackle and snap.  He thought much about what this journey had brought him.  Three months gone was too long, but the necessity had forced such measures.  With the sickness amongst his people, it had been his responsability to make sure it was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon girl... she had simply been an item he was too fascinated to pass on.  He turned only his head to look at her wispy form perched upon the caravan's supply wagon.  She was statuesque, only moving every moment or so to sniff the air or look around.  He could tell she made the horses nervous, but they did not complain.  The stories he had heard of the dragonkin were many, though few rang true it seemed.  Creatures born of dragons and other races seemed impossible.  The great beasts did not even allow small camps within their territories, sooner raining fire from the sky than \"lesser\" races stay amongst them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord,\" a voice broke him from his reverie.  Several of the lord's charges sat amongst his fire, bringing with them food and drink.  \"You must be hungry, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am.\"  He took the plate and cup, again casting a glance to the winged girl.  \"Such a remarkable being.  I confess my interest in her was more marvel than practical.  Now though...\"  he seemed to pass once again to thought, leaving a silence long enough for discomfort to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though this is true, my lord... what possible use could you have for such a creature?  She is untamed, unnatural.  She would sooner rip out your throat and drink from your veins that serve as a slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my dislike of that word, Greigen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, sir.  But the truth remains as said.  She is vicious and wild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what interests me so.  She is a mystery.  As feral as she acts and appears, do you not see the intelligence coiling behind her eyes.  She proved she can speak and understand, that alone disproves rumors enough about her kind.\"  Two pricks of soft blue glow were aimed towards the lord as he looked to the dragon girl again.  Sharp ears she had, likely having heard everything.  With a wave of his hand the lord summoned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leapt from the wagon into the dark, vanishing until the fire's glow illuminated her once more.  She sauntered, bare feet making barely a rustle through the grass as she sat down by the fire.  All eyes now locked on as she gazed into the flames, face almost reminiscent.  \"Have you eaten?\"  The lord's question seemed to take aback several of his companions, but one in particular just grinned.  The others were new to the service of his lord, they did not know of his actions seemingly unbecoming a lord of the empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon girl just stared at the lord, then at the plate in his hand.  Cooked pheasant and greens with a cup of ale.  She visibly grimaced.  \"I take it that you eat something different then?\"  She simply gazed out into the dark.  Language built on subtle motion more than words, that action alone spoke tales.  \"Go find your dinner then and return.\"  Like a ghost the girl hissed and leapt over the fire and into the night.  Several men shouted in surprise, falling back from the puff of air turning the flames at them.  As the laughter from the others died down, a sharp cry came the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll attention was to the inky black all around, the sounds of a struggle were coming from nearby.  Sharp hisses, a yelp, then something like a shrieking howl filled their ears.  \"Seems she'd had her eyes on something beforehand.\"  The lord was as collected as ever as he took another bite from his plate.  \"Her senses are sharper than I thought.\"  It was if it were the most normal thing in the world as a dead creature dropped with a thump next to the campfire.  This was followed quickly by its killer, bloody claws still dug into the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A badger?  She killed a badger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!  Was that your yelp we heard then?\"  One man chuckled as the dragon girl looked down at her kill, then back at the lord.  It was as if she were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe she is waiting for your say-so, sir.  The collar is meant to control such baser instincts.\"  The girl snorted, looking at the speaker like one would an ignorant child before whipping her attention back to staring at her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or are you waiting because that is your nature?  You may eat.\"  Without a moment's hesitation the girl dug her razor teeth into the dead animal's flesh.  She spat away the skin and fur before plunging into the bloody meat beneath.  Ripping a mouthful from the corpse she threw her head back and gulleted the bite before repeating again and again.  Her mouth and chest were already soaked in blood, but this only seemed to make her more frenzied in her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men watching her had a mix of horror, fascination, and disgust as devoured her kill like an animal.  small drops of blood were thrown into the fire, making the coals hiss in response.  \"Well... little can be said for manners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she even chew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She eats like a dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough.\"  A wave of his hand and the lord silenced the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, to say it would takes even weeks to properly train this... animal... what more use could you have for her than as a pet?  She is as wild as a beast.\"  All eyes fell on Greigen.  It was one matter to speak freely when around the lord, but to openly rebuke in such a way drew a long silence.  Even the girl stopped her ravaging and glared at him, mouth still hidden in her kill's flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For that thinking, I have little to no intent to... 'train' this girl.  I did not purchase her rights to crush the instincts and spirit that make her what she is.  I do not desire a pet or a slave, as you would so elegantly put it.  I have plenty of both and have no need nor want for more.  I do not know how you handled the hands within your household... but when you are in my presence, and under my authority, you will stay your tongue from questioning my judgment.  Let your words stray again, and it will be claws and not a rebuke to silence you.\"  The dragon girl licked blood from her lips at the mention of what no one doubted were <i>her</i> talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a confused and frightened expression, Greigen looked to the dirt and remained silent as the grave.  The remainder of the night went by quickly.  The lord retired to his tent once his meal was finished, opting for a pair of guards and the dragon girl to keep watch.  Every so often the guards would see her slinking about in the dark, walking on all fours and keeping low, ready to pounce at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last legs of the journey flew by, quite literally at some times.  Sava, while wary at all times, had come to honestly question if her collar was the source of the growing respect she bore for her master.  Granted, she was compelled to obey his every command... but she started to wonder if without it would be any different?  He acted much like Mire had amongst her brothers and sisters, the alpha.  His word was law, and this lord held himself just as the lead brother would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreedom was allowed, but his authority even to a single word was absolute.  There was no question nor hesitation in obediance to an alpha, the most capable of the patriach's kin.  The lord, Sava's master... he was her alpha now.  She was there not by her choice, but she steeled herself by the fact that it was still her decision to whom she could look to for guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer master was a strong and capable man, and despite him not being of the patriarch's kin... she would follow him.  She knew this was not the collar's doing, but her own.  The choice was made.  Looking down from her lofty glide, sava watched the specks that were the caravan moving along the road.  Many leagues further along the same path, a pass through a range of mountains could be seen.  She knew from listening to nighttime voices that that was where the lord's home resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanking and diving swiftly to the ground, Sava landed hard on the wooden back of the wagon, startling the horsedriver.  He scowled at her, but otherwise kept to his duty.  Soon enough a large group of armored men rode up to greet the caravan, taking their places alongside as escorts.  Leading into the pass was not a sight of awe for Sava as it was for others.  High rocky walls, crags, and the likes were where she had called home.  In fact, it was a welcome thing to be again amongst the cold embrace of rock once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the caravan and escorts passed through the massive gates at the opening to the valley, Sava contented herself with her wagon perch and watched with intensity.  This was to be her new home, and some small part of her was curious.  What surprises were held for her within were a mystery, but she would meet them head on.  This was her only rule.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Past the gates to the valley was hardly what Sava expected.  There was a great town, with buildings and cottages, markets and stables along the winding road up into the mountain.  The city she had just left had been massive, but this place was no small group of huts.  What impressed though was at the top of that mountain sat a fortress.  Towers and walls, bastions and culverts that gave the image of raw power.  Despite banners and colors flying from towers and hanging from the walls, the feeling of solitude resounded through the entire valley.  This was a place made to seperate from the outisde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the caravan passed over the main road, people of all ages stopped their work, children stopped their play, and all stood to watch the passing of their lord.  Weary faces, tired souls... all prepared for a hard day's labor and yet they called and greeted their ruler with smiling faces and excited words.  What interest this brought in Sava faded as her eyes locked on some goats and her stomach growled.  The goats saw her too, flitting about nervously as they sensed a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of food was enticing, but Sava was more enthralled by the high arches passing above her as they approached the keep.  The arches had towers at each end, and along them were lined many men.  This place was well defended.  Wise to guard one's home however possible, Sava could relate to such thought.  Then again her home was protected by a pack of vicious and merciless dragonkin, not swords or bows.  Still, the defenses were admirable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it occured to her, Sava paid little mind to the number of eyes following her.  Curious children pointed, men and women stared... and even a few guards knocked arrows.  Keeping to her seat Sava simply grumbled and snuffed as she took in sights and smells.  She was already quite used to stares, and she was hardly going to let it bother her.  This place smelled differently than her mountain home.  Smelled of fire and metal, animals and people.  She caught hints of flowers, grass, even trees... but they were almost overpowered.  The smells of man were all around, but unlike the city they bled into more familiar scents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even realized she was lost to the surrounding smells, the caravan had climbed the winding path and passed through the gates of the keep.  The thick walls rose high into the air, honeycombed by windows, stairs, and the doors they led to.  But in front of her, Sava looked out at an immense courtyard.  The path to the keep's door was lined by trees, as if they had built the fortress around a forest.  At the end of the short wooded path was the keep's inner door, and a small group awaiting the approaching horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young child seemed the most anxious as she tugged on the arm of the woman beside her.  As the lord's horse pass through the wooded path the girl broke away, excitement in every crease of her joyous expression.  \"Father!\"  In turn the lord leapt from his horse and lifted the young girl in an embrace.  The woman ran forward and latched to the man as well.  Sava knew a family when she saw one, but snorted at the open affection.  There had no need for such displays amongst her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, you were successful?\"  The woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medicine and supplies.  I dislike having needed outside aid, but the deed is done.\"  The lord waved to a waiting guard and the man ran over and gave a swift salute.  \"Make sure these supplies reach our clerics.  They know more than I on how to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord.\"  The man bowed his head only a moment before shouting for hands to carry what the wagon held.  Sava took this as a good time to dismount, landing with barely a sound on the stone ground.  She flapped her wings once for measure and furled them behind her.  The sudden silence was enough that Sava knew all eyes were... again... on her.  No one spoke, though more than one gasp had been uttered by the women in the group of greeters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until a shrill but musical laugh filled the air did anyone even twitch.  \"Big lizard!\"  The young girl squirmed from the lord's arms and dashed right at Sava.  Her mother shrieked for the girl to stop.  She did not, opting instead to run between Sava's long legs and wrapping her entire body around the swishing tail.  \"Big lizard lady!\"  The presence of a child. Attached to it did not even slow the leisurely sway of the tail.  In fact, the only thing it did was fill the air with more laughter.  \"Swing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from that... Mearza come back this instant!\"  The lord held his wife back from charging headlong at Sava with a single large hand.  It was instead a young man who approached.  He was well dressed, like the others... no doubt another of the lord's children.  He bore a sword at his waist, but made no move to draw it.  He simply walked until coming within arm's length of Sava and stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him right in the eyes.  Yes, this youth was with no questioon the son of her master.  He had the same calm, steeled courage as his father.  He hid no fear because there was none to hide.  \"Mearza, she is not a plaything.  You are frightening mother, come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Swing me faster!\"  Sava's eyes suddenly blinked twice as the collar took over.  She grimaced as her tail began to swing left and right, taking the young man by surprise as he stepped back to avoid the tip.  The child's mother panicked as she saw her daughter swing like from the end of a whip, cackling with glee as she swooped through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava on the other hand knew if her powerful tail truck anything, the child would be crushed.  Her heart beat with adrenaline as she fought to regain control, but her legs were locked and her tail swinging faster and faster.  In the end she could think of only one thing, she grabbed the collar with both hands and tried with all her might to remove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a mechanism in the magic seal of the collar.  It was a punishment for trying to remove it, and with full knowledge Sava activated it.  The swinging ceased as she collapsed to the ground with a cry of pain, convulsing as wave upon wave of agony tore through her body.  Now even the lord was running up, kneeling over Sava as she shook, pulling her limbs to her chest in the futile attempt to ward away the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments the punishment ceased, leaving Sava shuddering on the cold stones.  Tears poured from her eyes despite how tightly they were shut.  She managed to open one slightly, peeking out of the corner of her eye up to see her master and his son looking at her and confused as for what to do.  They spoke, but her mind was reeling.  She could not comprehend their words.  With one final shiver, she fell into blissful unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She tried to kill my baby, that's what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother... Mearza gave a command, don't you see she's wearing a control collar?  She had no choice but to obey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not scold me like a child, Tristan!  I am your mother still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the boy is correct, Nanya.  I'm sorry, I should have sent prior word of my return... and with what I returned.\"  Lady Nanya took a moment from cradling her daughter to smack her husband on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how you were bringing home a monster!  An enslaved one to make matters all the worse!  You swore off slavery despite being a lord of the empire.  You take the time now to fall back on your word?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no intention of falling back from anything, my dear.  I just witnessed something remarkable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter being flung like a rag doll by the tail of some... creature?!  She could have been killed!\"  Nanya's voice was quickly shifting from fearful to enraged.  Though another voice, calm and collected, spoke exactly what was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knew she couldn't fight the collar so she tried to remove it.  All those who wear the collar of a slave know the consequence of trying to take it off, but the pain it inflicts would also halt anything she was doing.  She did that on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She inflicted incredible pain on herself to safeguard Mearza.  I've never seen someone willfully do that.\"  The lord turned Sava's head towards him to look at her face.  It was no longer locked in an expression of agony, but the calm of sleep.  \"She looks human... she may have even been once if rumors speak true.  I purchased her rights out of sordid curiosity even after swearing never again to enslave another.  But I still felt compelled to do so.\"  Even Nanya was quieted by the lord's words.  He looked carefully at the dragonkin's face, noting the age she appeared.  A child barely older than his son, it was a crime for her to be forced into a life not her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... the danger she presented was not lost on him.  \"Father, allow me to tend to her for now... unless you had other plans,\" Tristan asked, kneeling beside Sava as well.  The lord pondered for a moment, then nodded in agreement.  Sliding his arms beneath her, Tristan was sure to collect up her tail as he lifted her off the ground.  She was lighter than he expected, but still weighted enough to be a burden.  \"What will we do with her now then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord thought hard about that as he stood.  She had willfully harmed herself to keep young Mearza from harm... and she had been wholly obedient to him.  But, had that been the collar or had she done it willingly?  He couldn't know for certain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was best to leave it on, at least till he could be sure.  The more pressing matter at hand was thus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was to be done with her?</span></div></div>",

Wings bent, arms sore, tail bound... unable to move.  Another blow, a kick to the nose, blood... red blood... blood everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snarling hiss Sava shot upright, baring fangs and claws as she shook off the dream.  Her breathing was hard and ragged, droplets of sweat beaded on the scaleless portions of her skin.  She couldn't remember the dream, but she did recall the fear and the pain.  As the adrenaline lessened, she let out a long breath that growled from her throat.  It was unbecoming to allow a dream the power to dictate her actions.  Sava had been kept awake many a night amongst her kin before truly learning that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt calm over her again, she took in her environment with as much caution as confusion.  Where was she?  She was covered by sheets of cloth, and was on top of something soft and pliable.  Bed and blankets... she could barely remember but knew those were their names.  She stepped off the bed and wandered to the center of the room, taking in the bits of furniture and other arrangements it contained.  There was even a small fireplace lit and crackling at the far end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava remembered now what had happened.  The young girl, and then the pain.  It was a bad memory, and not one to dwell on.  Instead Sava focused on the fire, the familiar flicker of flame and crack of embers.  She lost herself so deep she did not notice a knock.  The door opened as someone poked their head in.  \"She's up.\"  A young man's voice.  Sava turned and watched the son... Tristan as she recalled his name to be, as he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe too noticed Sava and grinned, his mouth apparently moving faster than his eyes.  \"I'm glad you're awaaaoa...\" his voice split off as he covered his his face and turned away.  \"Awake, and naked... um, yes, ahem... unclothed.  Um, sorry, there are garments in the drawer there.\"  He pointed to a wooden chest and Sava just stared.  They were going to put more cloth on her?  Cloth itched and bugged, it kept the wind from whistling through her scales.  \"If you don't mind, please be a bit more, ah, modest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collar remained quiet, but Sava did as she was asked.  Within a moment she had pulled on two shirts, a pair of trousers and a dress, none of which were on the correct parts of the body for which they were designed.  Sava just grumbled and Tristan uncovered his face only to immediately burst out laughing.  \"On your head?\"  He was drawn back into another fit of laughs at Sava's appearance.  She growled, unsure as to what exactly was so humorous.  \"I, ahem, I take it you do not clothe yourself in such a manner from where you hail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  She muttered as he pulled the dress from her wing.  Though the moment she did speak he froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you spoke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can you say more than just yes or no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you are just making fun.\"  Sava simply blinked, her expression confused.  But like that it vanished as the almost everpresent scowl returned.  \"Well, you've been asleep nearly all day.  I brought you to my spare quarters so you would not be bothered.  Now though; my mother is wishing to see you and you have to be at least partially presentable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan tried to pull the dress over Sava's head, but she just snorted and lifted up her wings to get in the way.  \"You've already proven your impecable skill at dressing yourself, or lack thereof.  Just hold still and let me put something on.\"  The collar confirmed the command and Sava went limp, all except her legs.  Tristan took instant note and scowled himself.  \"Despicable things, I hate them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quickly discovered that even without her being stubborn, Tristan could not get anything down over Sava's head past. her wings.  Finally, in exasperation he cut the back from a pair of trousers and wrapped her chest in a ripped sheet.  \"Well... you are dressed as a miner, but it is better than the rags we pulled off you.  I'm afraid the only shoes I have are boots though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shoes.\"  Sava found she was still able to speak, the collar was not being so picky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  What do you mean no shoes?  You just go barefoot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  The collar had ceased its hold, and Sava simply scraped her feet against the floor a few times.  \"Strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think some would be more worried about dirt.\"  With a smirk Sava spread her wings a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dirt in sky.  Floor clean, clean feet a lot.  No shoes.\"  While the collar could compel her to respond perfectly, when under her own power Sava's words were barely those of a child.  It was Tristan's turn to smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this will certainly be interesting.\"  Again met with a confused look, Tristan motioned to follow.  Sava knew her inaptitude for speech was a handicap, but at least she could understand others.  How though was something not even she fully understood.  Once again, she thought of the collar and snorted.  \"Ah, I think it best not to, um, make that sound for a while.  My father spent the better part of the day listening to my mother rant of throwing you to the wolves.  Such noises may be less than convincing of you not being an animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked through the halls, Sava took in the sights as she always did.  Carpeted floors, high ceimings and walls covered with art and decorations.  \"Colors...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this wing contains much of the art and other items a keep \"must have' as my father's advisors say.  Such is the nature of things I imagine.  This is also where my family and I live, opposite the side where business of the state is conducted.\"  He barely retained any of Sava's attention as she peered out passing windows.  She more wondered whether other kin lived in the high peaks than what was what in a giant stone fortress.  As big as it was, she felt awfully stifling.  She needed open sky, room to hunt, and speaking of which she felt her stomach growl again.  This was not the time, and she ignored the hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching a large door, Sava watched as two armed men opened them to a great hall.  An enormous wooden table sat in the center astride an almost equally large fireplace.  Standing before the blaze was the lord and his wife.  The uproar Tristan had claimed she was in must have died down greatly for she was speaking softly, and without anger.  \"I know you say you meant well, but you further serve to fund their trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If not I than another.  There is no slowing the trade of life in the empire, Nanya.  But at least I do not condone the governing of life as do others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this, my lord.  But...\" her voice trailed away as she saw her son and the being in question approach.  \"But she is as you said, one of the Dragonkin.  They are a brutal and feral kind, my lord!  They are raised among dragons, fight to live every single day.  Are not these traits of animals?\"  This brought a rumbling hiss from Sava's throat.  The light of the fire danced in her eyes as she looked from Nanya to her master.  \"You see?  No human nor elf nor any mindful being would make such a sound.  Why it is by the very device you despise that she remains docile enough to exist among us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my doubts on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you have said again and again!  Well I have doubts also!  One that you would, in right mind I add, suggest such a creature serve as a guard for our only daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have many enemies, my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not so leisurely use that word to me when making claims bordering the insane.  Why else are we guarded day in and day out?  Why else is there an army of soldiers posted at all times on and within a wall built to withstand giants?  I know of your enemies.  I have met one.\"  Turning away, Sava caught glimpse of an ugly scar on the woman's exposed shoulder.  \"I am more concerned for the harm that could be left on my baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, she purposefully tortured herself to keep Mearza from harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am aware.  That is the only reason my mind has even a chance of sway.  The thought of it, she likely does not even have a name amongst her kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sava.\"  The word was more a growl, but a word nonetheless came from her lips.  \"Sava.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sava, a good name.\"  The lord looked as pleased as Sava felt from the praise.  \"Perhaps then she can speak for herself.\"  All eyes then turned to the dragon girl as she looked again into the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Words not good.  Taken from kin... collar put on, hit lots, no food.\"  Her body language seemed to fill in what gaps were left by her words.  By the sound of her voice, they could all tell hers was not one often used.  \"Found by master... let fly, hunt... be free.  Still have collar, but for keep nice.  Master give freedom, I follow.\"  The one word that held all the meaning was just that.  Freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Nanya turned and lost herself in thought.</span></div></div>",

If there is anyone to blame it is I.  There is no need to throw her to the wolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might be an enigma for us, but think of what that would mean for father's rivals.  I've had a thought from that,\" Tristan spoke confidently. \"Father is the target for assassins from many of his fellow lords because he has renounced tradition.  They cannot deign themselves to believe he would entrust his life to a slave, no matter the one held by a collar.\"  As he crossed his arms, the young man gave a sly glance to Sava as she remained transfixed on the blaze before her.  \"It would be unexpected indeed, but what if we allowed her to act as a protector?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you suggest we simply put our lives in the hope she honors loyalty?  Loyalty to those who pay gold for the rights to a life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I cringe to voice it, the matter is she has little choice.  We could remove the collar, but without any prior knowledge on whether doing so would unlock whatever aggression is inhibited, the results could be disasterous.\"  All eyes, even Sava's, were on Tristan now.  \"She herself said it kept her passive.  As much as I hate myself for saying it, we should consider all options before choosing one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we stoop once more to the very ideals we swore off.  All for your damnable curiosities.  Even your own son must come to your defense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound as if I am trying to rationalize for myself and am dragging our children with me.  No, I would never do that.  Whatever reason or force behind my going into the Veru'Vadan market aside, it is no mere whimsy or crude fancy I came to bring this girl with me.\"  The lord's collected tone brought the tension that had filled the room to a lull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is infuriating how you always see the greater good sometimes.  How aggravating your ideals can be.\"  With a hand covering her mouth in deep thought, Nanya stared as Sava sat down in front of the fire and curled her tail and wings about herself.  The look of her as she enjoyed the warmth was almost endearing.  \"I am not swayed... but I can see what about her it is that you are so moved by.  For all her image, I can't help but see a child trapped beneath scale and claw.  I cannot in right mind enslave a child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No child.\"  Sava's voice was clear.  \"Maybe once... no more.\"  She turned her head from the fire, blue eyes sparkling as if from their own inner light.  \"With collar... without... still a slave.  Slave to humans, or slave to patriarch.  Doesn't matter.  Still a slave.\"  This simple statement left all others silent.  Sava just turned back to the fireplace and silence once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, always a slave?\"  Tristan voiced what everyone was thinking.  \"And who, or what, is patriarch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much talk.  Always talk.  Leave alone.\"  In two simple words, Sava had summed up enough longing, sadness, and loneliness to be near palpable.  She put on a strong front, but the shock she'd been through had opened a floodgate.  There was still a girl underneath, just as Nanya had said.  The lord understood and motioned to his wife to walk with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, let's go and see to Mearza for now before something is lit aflame... again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not see this discussion as closed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor do I, but I think it best we leave it in our son's more capable hands.  Of anyone, he is the most understanding in matters such as these.\"  After a skeptical glance Nanya agreed.  The two rulers quietly left the great hall, leaving only the youth remaining in company.  Sava watched out of the corner of her eye as Tristan sat on the floor, much like her, before the fire.  He was a few paces away though, and silence fell for a lengthening time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was calming.  Just the wispy cracks of the wood and coals, embers aglow through the long fireplace.  To most such a lull would be disheartening, uncomfortable.  To Tristan it was as peaceful as the sound of lapping waves over rocky shores.  Minutes passed without so much as a word or move from either of them, not until Tristan turned himself to sit facing the dragon girl.  She only turned her eyes to meet his, expression unreadable.  \"I have a simple question.  Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole head turned and faced him.  All her scars, her black markings, and scales; and for all these things, her face was flawless.  Not a mark, not a blemish, only sparkling sapphire eyes with a piercing hairline pupil.  \"What why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do that to yourself, all to save a girl you've never met.\"  He half expected her to snort, but Sava didn't even growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little girl curious, only having fun.  Didn't want to hurt her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  You know, you are not the first dragonkin I've met.\"  This definitely caught her attention, even her expression showed surprise.  \"He was a vicious brute.  Never seen anything take so much sadistic pleasure in killing.  But at the end of every day, I would find him crying.\"  This made Sava scoff, but she still seemed keen on listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragon in him yearned for blood and death, but the small child he had once been still lived.  And every night that little boy wept not for himself, but for the people he hurt.\"  Taking a poker in hand, Tristan set aside a moment's break to shift a log.  Sava seemed a little annoyed, she was interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This kin, he only ever showed me this side of him.  Any other would have been torn apart, but not I.  It was a wonder for me as to why this was.  But what I saw today answered a question that has plagued me for many years.  Just like the kin I knew when I was very young, you would have let yourself die rather than harm a child.  I was a small boy at that time, he a fair deal older.  I'd have died if it were not for him.  And in the end, it was he that gave up his life so I could live on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That question has burned a hole in my heart.  I may never know his reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Why you know a kin.  You are son of master.  Live in this place.  Talk of killing... knowing kin.  Why?  How?\"  The faint grin the pulled at the edges of Tristan's mouth were sincere as he set down his poker and pulled back the collar of his shirt.  Around his neck was a burn scar, perfectly shaped.  The shape itself was the most surprising, and Sava found her hand unconsciously reaching for her own neck.  The scar as in the same place and was the same shape as her collar.  A slave collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not his son.  I'm adopted.  I was raised in the slave pits of Terr'Duga as fodder for the gladiators.  It would have been a short life if not for the kin there.\"  The young man's expression became forlorn, his eyes closed in thought.  \"My real father had sold me to that retched place.  The same place a dragonkin gave his life for me to escape from.  And now what do I see today but a dragonkin nearly give up her own life just to save a child from harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took that moment to stand, Sava's head following him as he brushed himself down.  \"What my adopted mother says may be true to some, but I know the differences.  Dragonkin are noble in ways most men cannot fathom.  You proved that to me today just as he did years back. What I said to my parents before is one thing, but this is something I feel I must do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite every instinct screaming for her to move, Sava forced herself to remain still as Tristan came to kneel right beside her.  \"I cannot, for everything I have lived for, allow this to continue.  You do not deserve what fate has dealt.  I cannot changed what has occured, but I can choose what will.\"  His hands rose and grasped the collar around Sava's neck.  She stiffened, eyes wide as saucers.  She could feel him looking for the clasp, something only a person not attached to it could use.  He was going to remove the collar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heartbeat began to quicken, the excitement very strong as so many thoughts rushed through her head.  She would be free again.  Free to fly, to run, to return home!  Home... she didn't even know what direction it was in.  She just knew it had been mountainous.  Searching every mountain and crag would be hopeless.  She had already resigned that she would never see that place again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she would still be free!  Her claws twitched at the image of the moment the collar's power was released.  Sinking her fangs into the first thing she could, spilling blood and innards and shrieking her triumph.  Sava blinked, the image played over and over as suppressed instinct bubbled within her like boiling water about to overflow.  She knew the second that collar was off, fury and rage unbound would crash like a tidal wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, through the maelstrom of bloodlust and anger, a voice cried out in Sava's mind.  It was an unfamiliar one, but somehow she knew it had always been there.  The voice pleaded, and even through the images Sava understood.  Her hands raced up and grabbed Tristan's wrists, surprising him.  \"No.  Leave it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it.  Made up mind.  No home to go back to, no place else.  Stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then at least let me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Leave it on.\"  Her words did not sound like a demand... they were a plea.  She was begging him.  It took Tristan a moment, but he finally relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is what you wish.  I will honor that.  But I promise you, you will have a home here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava nodded, returning her gaze to the flames.</span></div></div>",

Once they got there,the leader of the group took of the hood that covered his head and the upper part of the shoulder part of the armor he was wearing. Sava noticed that the armor was white in color, except for the borders of each piece of said armor, which were black. Sava then looked at the man himself. He was quite young, a teenager probably. He had big eyes that were sapphire blue in color. She found that odd because it was a very rare color of eyes. He also had short black hair that ended in what looked like three spiked inverted waves on the front side of his head. All of the tips pointed left. The next thing she noticed was that, if the armors size and shape were any indicators, his body was quite well built. She also noticed the sword and two medium sized bags he had attached to his armors belt. This mas was most likely from royalty. When the guard was in front of him, he extended his hand to claim the bidden value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"The money, please, sir. I can only hand it to you after I receive the accorded sum. \", the guard said, smiling with malice, while looking at Sava. He knew that she hated being called \"it\".</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, Sava noticed, didn't looked amused at all. Heck, if she had to guess, she'd say that he was angered by the guards comment. Although she could be wrong, since he tried to keep as serious as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Of course. I understand.\"</span>, he said in a cold voice that sent shivers down both, the guards and Sava's spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then grabbed the two bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Here you go, guard. Thank you for bringing HER to me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he called her \"her\"? Maybe she was right and he indeed was angered at what the guard had said?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"N-no sir, I'm the one w-who should be thankful.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard was obviously afraid of the tone in the young man's voice. Yet, he questioned him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"S-sir. I may be out of place by saying this but, this is a dragon, it does not have feelings nor the capacity to think or act in a rational way. So, I think it would be wiser to call this thing an \"it\".\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava was outraged by what this guard was saying. And, had the collar allowed it, she would be also enraged and would have killed the guard already. But, to her surprise, the man who had bought her punched the guard's face and sent him a few good meters away. If Sava had to guess, it was somewhere between 50 to 60 meters. When the guard landed, a *CRACK* sound was head, meaning that something had broken. The guard, who now was bleeding, looked in shock, confusion and fear upon the man that was standing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"How dare you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid the young man in a tone that surprised the guard and Sava. For it carried a lot or anger on it, and the glare he was giving the guard was so intense that Sava felt like he was staring at the guard's very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"How dare you speak of HER like that! SHE is a sentient being, like you, me and everyone else in this or any other place. SHE CAN feel and SHE CAN think rationally. Hell, she can think more rationally that many humans here! Dragons are wise and beautiful creatures and should be treated with respect! Also, she is mine now. And if you talk like that about HER again, you'll be dead before you can blink, was I clear?\"</span>, said the young man loudly, but not loud enough to alert the other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard couldn't answer. He was trying to process the situation. But the man was loosing his patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I asked, <i>WAS, I, CLEAR</i>?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the guard answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Y-yes, sir. Y-you couldn't have been more clear. T-then, excuse me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard the began to half walk, half crawl back to his post. The man then turned to Sava. Surprisingly though, he was calm and smiling in a kind way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I apologize for this scene.\"</span>, he said getting closer, until he was standing in front of Sava. <span class=\"cblue\">\"My name is Leon.\"</span> he said, bowing. <span class=\"cblue\">\"What is yours, miss?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">*Miss?*</span></i> <span class=\"cred\">\"My name is Sava.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then extended his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Nice to meet you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava then took the man's hand and shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I wish I could say the same.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I know this looks bad. But you don't need to worry. It won't last long\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Liar. I'm going to be a slave for the rest of my life. Why wouldn't I have to worry?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I'm not lying. I'm not going to keep you as a slave.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"What?! Then, why did you bought me?!\"</span>, asked Sava, utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I can't tell you here. I'll tell you once we get to my place, where we wont be heard by malicious ears.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned to the men that where behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I'll take her. I trust you to keep the good job.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then spoke to the hooded figure at his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Okay, Satsuki. You'll lead them and we'll meet back at the rendezvous point, alright?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Yes, Leon.\"</span>, said a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon and Sava then went to the gates and, once the gates were closed and they were at about 100 meters away Leon told Sava that now they could go calmly to where he would meet the others after they were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the rendezvous point?</span></div></div>",

Now for the new characters: <span class=\"cblack\">Jack</span>, <span class=\"cviolet\">Fleur</span>, <span class=\"cindigo\">Yuki</span> and <span class=\"corange\">Seira</span>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been about half an hour or so since her Sava and Leon had been walking after leaving the market. Right now, they were on a thick and dense forest. The kind of forest that you had to know your way around, or you could get lost and take ages to find the exit, provided that some of the dangerous inhabitants of the forest didn't got you first. However, Sava noticed that Leon didn't looked scared or concerned at all, meaning that, either he knew this place well, the beasts here thought that he, or maybe herself, were more dangerous than they were, or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I think this is far enough.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Far enough for what?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"To remove the collar.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"You can do that?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Then, why didn't you do it before?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Because it requires magic. And if had used magic near the market, where we were in plain view, I would have drawn attention and I would be watched every time I went to that place, thus, jeopardizing future missions.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Future missions? What are you talking about?! Who the hell are you?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"You'll have your answers soon. Now, do you want me to remove the collar or not?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Y-yes, please. Sorry for yelling. It's just that...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I know. I know what that collar does. It's a despissable tool to make anyone who wears it obey your will. You're tired of it. Of being restricted. Of being traped by it. Also, that collar, as well as the \"status\" of slave, if it can be called that, is already humiliating, but for dragons, who are prideful creatures, it's even more so. Am I right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Y-yes. A-all of it is true.\"</span>, by now, Sava had turned around and was sniffing and on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven tough this man was kind to her, like he said, dragons are prideful by nature, thus, she didn't wanted him or anyone else to see her crying. Then, to her surprise, she felt two strong and armored arms, which she knew that belonged to Leon, after all, they were the only two persons there, wraping around her belly and hugging her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"It's okay, Sava. Altough I can't know your pain, as I have never been a slave, I CAN imagine how all of that horrendous experience must have hurt. Being sparated from your family, not knowing where you are and always wondering about what will be your fate. But don't worry, my friends and I won't let nor you nor anyone suffer that fate ever again. Not if we can help it, my friend.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava couldn't help it anymore. She turned to face Leon, tears running down her cheecks freely, and hugged the man back with all of her might. At that moment, Leon, while appreciatting the hug, was happy that he was wearing armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"T-thank you, Leon. Thank you so much! You don't know how much those words mean to me! It's meen so long since anyone has trated me kindly, with respect and as an equal...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Shh. It's okay. Let it all out.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they stood there. Leon being Sava's support and Sava happy that, after a long, long time, she had someone to call friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Meanwhile, back at the market-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatsuki was a quite young woman. She had 18 years old. But she already knew how life around here went. And she didn't liked how the nobles treated the other, like they were property. That's why she had joined Leon, her commander. She had long cascaded brown hair that reached the end of her back, emerald eyes, fair skin, and a body that women would die to have. She tood at 6'10'' with twin DD breasts and had a butt to match. She had given orders for every member of the group to go and purchase as many slaves as possible with they money they had. But she had told to buy one and let one go. That way, they raised less suspicion and had less chance of being caught or tricked by fellow buyers. It didn't mattered what species or gender the slave was. The only thing that mattered was that they bought them, so they could set them free later. Unfortunately, also to not raise suspicion, they had a limit of three to four slaves per member. After the purchases were done and the quota had been reached, each member and their temporary slaves were to exit the market and go to the rendezvous point through different routes. Making it difficult for anyone who dared to follow them to reach their place or to identify them in future missions. Satsuki had gotten lucky. She had managed to complete her quota and was already on her way to the meeting point with four slaves behind her. One male and three females. The male was an uncommon one. He has an \"incomplete\" Incubus. He was incomplete because he had managed to escape his Succubus mistress control befor he lost all of his humanity, altough he had some demonic traits, like a tail that ended in an arrow shape, two small horns, small bat-like wings, too small to fly, and his skin was somewhat darker that the usual tone. His name was Jack. The females were all of diferent kinds. Their names were Yuki, Luchia and Fleur. Yuki appeared like a normal teenager girl, but in reality, she was a vampire. She had shoulder lenght black, straight hair, pale skin, was 5'2'' tall and piercing red eyes that gained a black slit in the middle when she was angry. She appeared to be 15, but, being that vapires are immortal, god knew what her true age was. Seira was a mermaid. Altough she was human now, whenever she was on the water or simply got wet, her leges would turn into her mermaid lower half. Her mermaid tail was a beautiful orange color, her hair was almost completely straight but ended in upward waves and was also orange colored. She was 18 years old and her height, when human, was 6'0'' and when mermaid, it was 6'5''. Her eyes were black on the outside and had orange pupils. Finally, Fleur was the rarest of all. She was a Unicorn. The chances of even seeing a Unicorn were, like, 1 in a 1.000.000, let alone owning one. Like Yuki, she was immortal, so her true age was unknown. But she appeared to be in the early 20's. Her skin, or rather, her fur, was white as snow, her eyes, a peculiar baby pink, her horn, long and majestic, indicating her status and power, was currently with a non-maigic ring around it, nullyfying any attempt at magic she could try. Her mane and tail had traces of baby pink and violet. Another curious thing about Fleur, was that she wasn't a regular Unicor, she was an anthro. Meaning that she had Unicorn body but stood and walked on two legs, like humans. Her height, counting with her horn, was 6'8''.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Okay, everyone. Listed up. I know you all must think that I some vile person who bought you fot her pleasure, prestige and all that stuff.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Of course! Why would you buy us other wise?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"That's right! You humans are all the same!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"I agree. All you want is power.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack only grunted and gave a nod. Signaling that he agreed with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"That's not true at all.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">\"Oh? How so?\"</span>, Jack spoke for the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I'm not gonna keep-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Great! So your taking us-</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Let me finish! As I was saying, I'm not going to keep you, because, as soon as I arrive at the rendezvous point, you and all of the slaves me and my comrades purchased are going to be freed.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"What?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yeah, right.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Like we're going to believe a human's words!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"To belive or not is your choice. You'll see for yourselves when we arrive anyway.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back with Sava and Leon-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSava and Leon had resumed walking a few minutes ago, after Sava had calmed down. She was feeling lighter, as if a great weight had been lifted of her chest and had a better opinion on Leon. Leon hasd already removed Sava's collar and now, instead on walking, Sava was flying. Altough she was flying low, so as to not draw unwanted attetion for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Ah!!! It feels SO good to finally be able to stretch my wings! It feel like ages have passed since I last flew.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I'm glad you feeling better, Sava.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Say, Leon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Before, you spoke true facts about my kind. You sounded familiar with dragons. Why is that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, I have met dragons before, both, male and female. Also, when I was a kid, the village where I lived in had a strong relationship with a dragon clan that was nearby. We protected each other and were in quite friendly terms.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I see. Interesting.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the rest of the way making small talk and, before you noticed, you had arrived at a house that tower like, in the sense that it was very tall. The house had fivbe floors and a few commodities outside, like a garden with a spring, a place ofr little ones to play and a big pool with a smaller section for children. The house itself was made of bricks and concrete. It was white colored, with vines on the walls for camouflage, although they did added a certain charm to the place. The windows were the kind that allowed people inside to see people on the outside but didn't allowed people outside to see inside ther house. The roofs were had special mirrors on them that reflected the natural view, so as to elude and confuse people who came looking for the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, here we are.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Quite a nice place, I say.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"He, he. Wait until you see inside. Well then, shall we enter?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Yes. We shall.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the pair entered the house.</span></div></div>",

She wore barely anything just to show off her skin and body.  Sapphire scales so small they appeared like glossy skin, she'd been washed thoroughly to make sure they shone.  The scrubbing had left the fins lining her arms, back, and legs very sore, enough to leave her battling back tears... situation notwithstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollared, cold, and frightened... her family would have been proud of her for such composure.  Every cold breeze made her antenna twitch and her knees creak.  \"If I may have your attention back ladies and gentlemen... for a first among my items, I have a Meriad.  No, I assure you all she is the genuine article.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meriads have fish tails instead of legs!\"  Someone yelled from the crowd.  It made a burst of hot anger flit through Chiani's veins.  To suggest she was anything like a fish was insulting.  She did not suggest humans and the like were related to cattle.  Once again she was forced to calm her mind, anger would achieve nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see good sir, her tail is the source of such rumor.\"  The barker put a hand underneath Chiani's tail and lifted it, making her stiffen... it was her only covering on that side.  \"See how it flattens, much like an incredibly long fin?  This is where such rumors arose.\"  The barker's hand slid down the side of Chiani's tail, making her shudder again.  \"As you all can very well see, it is a choice example of a truly rare people.  I will start the bidding at ten thousand riol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been a few weeks that Chiani had been stolen from the water's warm embrace and thrust into such a hopeless destiny... but she had never been so frightened as to just how many hands went up to secure her as a prize.  The price skyrocketed, and soon only a few hands continued to move.  Finally, it came down to two.  One was of regal bearing, the other dressed as one would to travel a long way.  Chiani did not have the chance to give it further thought when only one hand remained in the air.  \"Sold for twenty-one thousand riol!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiani knew what this meant.  As long as she wore the collar she was forced to obey.  All she could do was stare at her buyer.  The guards took the chain and led her down the stairs and to her new master...</span></div></div>",

Merchants from all the lands come to trade their wares in the largest bazaar imaginable.  There is almost anything one can imagine to be bought there.  But, at the center of the marketplaces is the pride of the items for sale.  The largest slave auction in the empire, held only once a year, remains a great bringer of buyers and sellers alike.  No item sold is questioned for anything but quality.  An elf of royal blood, a human with dragonblood marks, the very dragon that imbued the marks.  Anything you can imagine can be bought, any gender of any age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Veru'Vadan auction is a place promised to quality.  No half price items or pantry slaves are peddled at this, but only the most expensive and meaningful of properties.  To sell there you must be someone, and to buy there you ARE someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a choice, master or slave.  Buy or be bought.  Nearly anything imaginable is at your disposal, be it. Money or power, secrets or desires.  Do you seek dominance, or are you forced under the heel of a master?  The choice is yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;this story has very few limitations.  I want the readers and writers to have fair leverage on what they want.  I have only two requests.  Please put more or less well written chapters a minimum of two paragraphs long.  My other request is keep a story flowing, abrupt ends or awkward points (such as master summoning slave for sex and the scene is written robotically, a la only descriptive action phrases) are frowned upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a world of magic.
