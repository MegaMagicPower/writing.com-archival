Her book, <i>Dynamic Habits for Dynamic Kids: The Young Gain-A-Life System,</i> was rare, in that it failed to reach the bestseller list. Not because it was poorly received, it was simply harder to market self-help to children than adults. Lucy would be lucky to sell five books today. Her appearance fee would just barely cover her flight and car rental. Elementary school assemblies were simply not profitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was more to life than money. Better study habits, time management skills, and positive life assessment needed to be instilled in people early. The younger, the better. She was proud of her book, even if it didn't sell well. She knew she could help kids, even if she needed to give away her advice for free. And that is why she spoke at elementary schools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne small benefit to youth seminars, Lucy could speak in a more casual, relaxed attitude. If she wore a power suit today, kids would only see her as another adult authority, talking down to them. Judging them. Demeaning them. She wanted to have a dialogue with the kids. She wore a pair of slacks, bright yellow tennis shoes, and a t-shirt that said \"Success\" in a fun script. Today's seminar featured less psychology and statistics, and more stories punctuated with jokes. Humor was the easiest way to capture a child's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enough speeches, Lucy recognized a distinct pattern. The kids would politely listen, mostly thankful for an assembly and a half hour outside of class. But only 20% were actively hanging on her words, taking in her advice. 79% would try to pay attention, they'd laugh at the jokes, but would drift off and daydream throughout the presentation. Lucy didn't fault them. That's just life as a child. But then there was the final 1%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat final percent were the troublemakers. Whether they were starved for attention, conceited smart-alecks, vocally rude, or just bad seeds, there was always one boy who tried to derail the assembly. And it was always a boy. Lucy didn't pay them any attention. She was a professional. She soldiered forth, continuing on, letting teachers remove the problematic child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's seminar was no different. Just as always, she delivered her presentation, had a brief Q&amp;A session, and thanked the kids. The teachers would guide the students back to class, go over the major talking points together, and hand out fliers advertising Lucy's website store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy, meanwhile, would have a one-on-one session with today's problematic student. The Young Gain-A-Life System was tried and tested. And today, Lucy would help a brand new Young GAL graduate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of boy is Lucy helping today?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The school's guidance counselor was kind enough to loan Lucy her office. Young Tyler Jacobson sat in a chair, arms crossed in defiance, waiting for his punishment. This wasn't the first time his attitude got him in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Tyler,\" Lucy said, taking the seat opposite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" he said, in an attitude fully reflecting his unhappiness. The other kids were out at recess, and here he was, talking one-on-one with some lady. He just listened to her talk for almost an hour. Now he was forced to listen to her talk even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't like the assembly today, did you?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Tyler said, matter of fact. Lucy appreciated the boy's honesty. When she confronted adults in similar manners, they always tried to deny their arrogance or misogyny. They tried to walk back their deeds and words. They tried to lie about what just happened. But children were direct. It saved a lot of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little upset, Tyler. I came all this way to speak to your school. I tried to be helpful and friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay if you didn't like my speech. You don't have to. No one was making you. But there were lots of students in the room who did want to hear me speak. And when you acted out, you were denying them of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler tried to find the right words. He considered for a moment trying to fake an apology to get back to class. But he realized Lucy wasn't a teacher. She wasn't staff. She was just some lady who liked to talk. She had no authority over Tyler. She couldn't punish him any more than he already was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so stupid,\" he said. \"You're not saying anything important. 'Do your homework, try your hardest, set reasonable goals.' Any dope could figure that out on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy took a moment to collect herself. Tyler was impetuous and rude, but he was a child. She couldn't just recite the rules and tell him he was wrong. She needed him to understand his transgressions on his own terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, I can tell you are a very smart young man,\" Lucy said, with a knowing nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Tyler replied, as though Lucy just told him the sun was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being smart is a gift. Whether you were born smart, or had to work hard to learn everything, you possess wisdom. No one else in your grade has a mind like yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded along, trying to speed up the platitudes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy continued. \"When you possess wisdom, you can either use it to help others, or let it corrupt you. And I'm sorry, I'm beginning to see you've been corrupted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? I don't care,\" Tyler said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've started down a path long before you ever met me, Tyler. You'll continue down that path long after I'm gone. All I'm saying is this: try to consider what type of person you want to become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily, Lucy would offer a handshake or a formal goodbye, but Tyler was being obstinate. He didn't want to be here, he didn't want to listen, and he didn't like Lucy telling him what to do. She had said all she could. She stood up, and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecess was still going on for another 10 minutes. Tyler was stuck in the guidance counselor's office for the duration. Maybe even longer. Tyler stared upwards at the ceiling tiles. They were boring, but they had all his attention. He didn't even notice Lucy leaving a copy of her Young Gain-A-Life System book on the table.</span></div></div>",

Every so often, in between corporate retreats and major panels, she liked to do a few school assemblies, after all, no one needs more help than the children of today, who are the adults of tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough that tomorrow was far closer for the subjects of today's assembly. It was a bright September morning when Lucy Wong stood on the stage of Maple River High School's auditorium, giving her speech to the class of seniors that would graduate in the spring, and be sent off into the world of college and then beyond. The most lost and overwhelmed they'd ever be, and needing more guidance than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that was what inspired the principal of Maple River High to invite Lucy to the school in the first place. Give the kids one last kick in the pants to ensure that they'd make something of themselves. Lucy was more than happy to do it, while she didn't charge as much for schools, there was always the chance of some teachers would buy a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy enjoyed helping to shape young minds, and looked out on the sea of students, some attentive, some having side-conversations, and some just napping, before she began her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy usually found one student in particular who needed her help more than the others, in this case:</span></div></div>",

Those who might need a personal touch. In schools, it was even more important, since Lucy's actions could help completely alter the course of the student's life at just the right moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only is it important for you to want to get better, but you need to have the initiative and vision to achieve your goals.\" Lucy scanned the crowd, noticing one student in particular, sitting close to one of the exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad in a wrinkled hoodie and a beanie, the shaggy haired senior was doing his best to not take the talk seriously. Which was fairly easy with his bloodshot eyes and the scent of marijuana that Lucy could smell wafting up from him. Lucy had seen his kind before, and she'd gotten through to them in the past. He was talking with his group of friends, to several quiet reprimands from teachers, or just generally checking his phone, and ignoring Lucy. But she'd been doing this long enough to not be offended. Of course, she could single him out during the talk, but she always preferred a direct approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being thanked by the principal, Lucy was preparing to depart the school, taking a stroll in the hallway, after the students had returned to class, pulling her rolling suitcase behind her, the only sound in the hallway coming from the click of her heels across the linoleum floors. Turning a corner, Lucy spotted the young man that she'd seen during the assembly shaking a can of spray paint next to a half-graffitied locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy stepped forward, the clicking of her heels causing the young man to jump and turn around, trying desperately to hide the can of paint behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice speech...\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Lucy started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor.\" the young man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed you, Taylor. You didn't seem to care much about the assembly.\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should I?\" Taylor asked. \"No offense, but I don't buy into your self-help BS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.\" Lucy said. \"Why don't you buy into it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People don't change, if you're gonna be a CEO, you've gotta be born into it, and if you're someone like me, college is a waste of time, anyway. If I'm gonna end up in a crappy, dead-end job anyway, why go into debt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"College isn't a waste, trust me. It can open up so many doors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not interested, so you can go peddle your crap somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy had heard the arguments before. This was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself. By the way, if you have a passion for art, there are better ways to express it than graffiti.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor dropped the can in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... are you gonna tell anyone it was me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just here to peddle my BS, not to rat you out.\" Lucy winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, before I go, I'd like you have this. In case you change your mind.\" Lucy began to dig through her suitcase, pulling out something.</span></div></div>",

An aspiring baseball player isn't likely to learn how to to hone his craft if he spends all his time at a skating rink, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's not bad advice... makes sense, too.\" Taylor remarked to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even starting to awaken questions within Taylor. What did he want to be like? Or rather, who did he want to be like? Surely his ambition wasn't to be a slacker burnout like all his friends, that just sorta happened to be the crowd he fell in with. He still didn't care about college, but a person has to have goals, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter study hall, it was time for lunch, and Taylor walked into the lunchroom.

He'd never really been a sports person, but they seemed to know where they were going, and Taylor needed direction. If anything, it'd be a learning experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor sat down at the table, and turned to the group of his peers, several members of the football and baseball teams, discussing whatever local sports game had recently aired on TV, and their rivals' chances of beating them at their next games. Nobody really noticed him, but on the other hand, no one rejected him from the table. It was a good start. Feeling a tad inadequate, Taylor unconsciously puffed out his chest, but just couldn't compare. Taylor remembered another excerpt from the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But most important of all, you must be true to yourself. Don't try to attain a goal of being someone so unlike yourself, that you lose what makes you special.\" a boring platitude, but another logical observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor would never be like the jocks, he could tell from simple comparison. They were strong, and Taylor was gangly, this entire exercise had been a waste of time. Taylor started to gather his bag to stand up, when he was tapped on the shoulder. He turned to see a beautiful girl, who he recognized from some of his classes, standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anyone sitting there?\" she pointed to the empty space next to Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... no.\" Taylor replied. Girls like that didn't usually acknowledge his existence, let alone desired to sit next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and looked Taylor up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't usually sit here... Taylor, right? I think we're in French together.\" she said. \"I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophia Marcus.\" Taylor finished. \"You sit a few rows behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you to this table, today? Your usual one full up?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor was amazed, Sophia was a cheerleader, and they usually steered clear of the greasy stoner kids, yet she's actually talking to him! Maybe the book was right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was that assembly this morning... Lucy Wong got me thinking about a change of scenery.\" Taylor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's awesome. It was so inspirational, I wish she'd done a meet and greet after, I'd have loved to chat with her.\" Sophia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran into her in the hallway.

Taylor felt conspicuous, until Sophia spotted him, smiled and waved at him. It was a good feeling to be welcomed to watch. And it was an even better feeling to see the cheerleaders doing all their stretching, jumping and gymnastic feats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching this beats hotboxing with the guys, any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Taylor thought to himself as he reached into his pocket, pulling out a small joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started looking for his lighter, and for the quickest exit to the outside. He spotted one and quickly ducked away as the cheerleaders started assembling their tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting outside, he lit up the joint and took a big puff off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd immediately regretted it. Taylor began hacking up a lung and gagging, rushing to a nearby garbage can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\" Taylor felt another retch coming on, but managed to hold it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor steadied himself and calmed himself down, dropping the joint onto the floor and stepping on it, before picking it back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened?\" Taylor wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn-fact, he tried to remember where he'd gotten that joint or how long it had been sitting in that pocket. Clearly far too long if it tasted so disgusting. He'd never had any problems with pot before, heck, he'd lit up only that morning, and it was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should take a break from this stuff.\" Taylor sighed as he tossed the joint into the garbage and returned to watch the cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause he was looking to forget all about that wretched taste, Taylor found himself enraptured by the cheerleading practice. The gymnastics, the chants... not that he'd ever admit it to himself, but it looked... fun. Not that he'd actually want to try it, but if Sophia asked, he might give it a shot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet that was pretty boring.\" Sophia said, breaking Taylor from his reverie. She was out of her uniform, already? How long had Taylor been lost in thought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... it was cool though, all the flips and stuff.\" Taylor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to give it a try?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think my body is meant to bend that way.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna know a little secret? No one's is at first, it takes a lot of practice and a lot of stretching to get like that.\" Sophia giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor smiled in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finished it in study hall, such a good book, lots of great motivational stuff. I bet you'll love it.\" Sophia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" Taylor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia's phone chimed and she checked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot, I've gotta run, but I'll see you around, right?\" Sophia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Taylor smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor basically floated home, he was friends with a cheerleader! Normally this would call for a celebration bong hit but... he wanted to take it easy.</span></div></div>",

Usually, he would light up for a bit, but today, Taylor was content to just relax. He turned the book over in his hands and flipped through it, checking to see if he could see which section Sophia liked the most. Upon not finding much, he settled on just reading the next chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep 1 had seemed to work fairly well. Sure, Taylor didn't quite know his purpose or direction yet, but at least he was making new friends. As he read, he absentmindedly twirled his hair on his finger, like he'd seen Sophia do a few times in French class, not that he recognized that he was even performing the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chapter 2...\" Taylor began to read aloud to himself. \"Setting attainable goals is important for personal growth. They can be small, such as to do yoga once a week, or large, like losing weight. The important thing to remember is to make sure they are positive goals. If you want to change, you've got to put in the work for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor began to think about his own goals... or rather his lack of them. He'd admitted as much to Lucy Wong that he didn't plan on going to college, but the more he thought about it, the less he liked the idea. Sure, college was expensive, and he'd probably have to take out loans, but that didn't mean it wasn't worth it. In fact, the jocks have direction because they're probably all getting scholarships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should look into a scholarship...\" Taylor mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcademics was never his strong suit, but he could try, or maybe there's an extra-curricular or sport he could get into. The only one coming to his mind at the moment was cheerleading, probably because he couldn't get Sophia out of his head, but he'd think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor suddenly realized that he'd zoned out for hours and it was getting late, so he started getting ready for bed.</span></div></div>",

Typically it included a shower, getting dressed, and if there was time, some goofing off on his phone before he had to hightail it off to school. With two working parents, Taylor had taken on all the onus for getting himself ready for school by the time he was in junior high, so this routine was long-ingrained into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually after a shower, Taylor simply brushed his hair out, sloppily dried it, and called it a day, but for some reason, that wasn't cutting it today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my hair... shinier?\" Taylor questioned as he observed a strand in the mirror. \"Then again, it's been a few days since I washed it, maybe I just didn't get all the oil out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor tried several ways of styling it, brushing it both over and behind his ears, but nothing seemed to satisfy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Taylor gave up and returned to his bedroom, grabbing the Lucy Wong book off his nightstand and as he picked it up, something small fell out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor knelt over to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... hair tie?\" Taylor examined the object in his hand. It was a baby-blue hair tie. \"How did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor wondered how the hair tie got into his book, until he remembered who he lent it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophia's, probably. Must've gotten stuck in there when it was in her bag. But I wonder why I didn't find it last night while reading...\" Taylor ignored that question, because he had just gotten an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed back to the mirror and pulled his hair into the hair tie. He'd never been one to tie his hair back, but maybe, just maybe, this style would satisfy him. Taylor was unskilled with the hair tie, so in his attempt to make a low ponytail, he ended up slightly higher, but that was for the best, since Taylor was finally happy with his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Taylor smiled. \"Let's just hope Sophia doesn't ask for it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor gathered his things and headed off to school. As he grabbed some things from his locker,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Taylor!\" a voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor shut his locker to find a familiar person standing next to it.

Who would be the best group of people to emulate? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral members of the debate team were seated along the wall. They were pretty smart, and certainly confident and well-spoken. Most already knew where they headed after graduation. Maybe if Taylor got in their good graces, he could piggyback off their success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team were hunched over notebooks, binders and index cards, researching and preparing their various arguments. None of them saw Taylor approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" he said to the studious bunch. \"Do you care if I sit here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" said one of the kids, reading a hardcover book. It looked complicated and boring. Certainly, nothing Taylor would dare try reading. \"Just don't spill anything, okay? The last thing I need is more food stains on my notes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry, Jake,\" one of the girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should have been using your head. You didn't think spaghetti sauce was going to spatter everywhere? Come on, Iris. You eat like a four year-old,\" he shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris stuck out her tongue at Jake in defiance. She returned to her notes, highlighting key passages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all seem pretty testy,\" Taylor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in big trouble,\" Iris said. \"We have a meet this weekend, and one of our co-captains is in the hospital with appendicitis. We're all struggling to piece together his argument from his leftover notes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I can do to help?\" Taylor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jake said, \"I mean, if you want to.

You won't know whether you're arguing for or against the topic until the debate begins. You need to be prepared to defend either side of the argument. Come up with every possible topic, and be ready to counter it or support it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of work,\" Taylor said. He was halfway hoping Jake and Iris and the rest would let him renege on his promise, and he could go back to playing video games in the back corner of the library, back where the librarian couldn't see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the beaming face of Lucy Wong smiled up at him from his book. Taylor wanted to be a better person, and he wasn't going to do so by being lazy and breaking promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll do it,\" Taylor said. Jake handed him the notes of his hospitalized teammate, and Taylor began looking up articles on his phone to help research the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange though, his normally blue cell phone case looked remarkably lighter today. Almost baby blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor ascribed the oddity to lighting, and went back to reading, beginning with the history of school uniforms. As he read, he itched his legs with the toe of his shoes. His leg hairs bristled as his socks began slowly growing, climbing up his legs. The normally ankle-length socks snaked upwards, stopping just shy of his knees.</span></div></div>",

He needed to get some food in his stomach. That would help him concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor got up from the table and headed to the cafeteria line. Normally, he would chow down on a cheeseburger, a slice of pepperoni pizza, or a plate of tacos, each served with a mound of french fries. Along with, he would chug down a bottle of Dr Pepper. Today, none of his usual fare seemed appetizing. Everything seemed greasy and nauseating. He was still hungry, but he <br>\r\nwanted something that wouldn't sit in his stomach like a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerusing his remaining options, he selected a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes. He opted for a bottle of water along with it. As he grabbed his wallet from his pockets, he noticed his shorts looking substantially more blue than before. What's more, they seemed to be creased now. How oddly was he sitting to crease them like that, he wondered? Taylor had never needed to know the term 'pleated' before, which is why he didn't recognize the style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying the lunch lady, Taylor attempted to return his wallet to his pockets, but noticed it no longer fit. Was it somehow larger than before, or had his pockets shrunk? Both, actually, not that he had any idea how such a thing could happen. As he sheepishly tried to shove his oversized wallet back into a pocket that was gradually being sewn up, he realized he was holding up the lunch line. He took his sandwich and water, heading back to his seat, wallet in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at his questionable billfold, he noticed it looked not just larger, but bulging. Distended. As though it were ballooning, capable of holding much more than just paper money. The curiosity of the situation took all of Taylor's attention, making him completely oblivious to his leg hairs disappearing completely. </span></div></div>",

He took a small bite of his sandwich, opened one of the books, and began skimming the various arguments in favor of school uniforms. Surprisingly, his eyes were moving faster than he was accustomed to. The words were sinking in. He was blitzing through page after page, and what's more, retaining the actual subjects. He hadn't read this easily since books stopped being about cats in hats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor took a few drinks of his water, trying to cool himself down. The room had suddenly gotten much warmer. Was he sitting under an air duct? He started fidgeting with the collar of his shirt, trying to cool down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor's sleeves had grown down his arms, all the way to his wrists. Before they could envelope his hands, they folded back on themselves, becoming a pair of dress cuffs. The soft cotton fabric of his tee became starched, bleaching from the black it once was to a pure white. The skate punk logo on the front split in two as the shirt was cut from his neck to his waist, being clasped closed by buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a rising loaf of bread, the fabric along Taylor's back, shoulders, and chest began to swell. It expanded, leaving his newly formed sleeves and starched collar alone. As the fabric swelled, the outside facing Iris, Jake and the others turned thicker and softer. The inside, still grazing Taylor's softening, hairless skin was cotton. The outside was wool, darkening, turning the same royal blue as his pleated shorts.  With a small shoulder roll, the two garments separated, leaving Taylor with a crisp white blouse and a blue sweater vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay, Taylor?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor stopped and thought. Wasn't he hot just a moment ago? He guessed not. Perhaps it was just the stress getting to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peachy,\" Taylor said, perplexed by his odd choice of words. He finished his bottle of water and stood from the table. \"Excuse me, I need to use the, um, facilities.\" Taylor tried to say he was going to take a piss, but his tongue betrayed him. Why had it come out so eloquent?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with you,\" Iris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor stood confused for a moment by the offer, but Iris paid him no mind. She walked off to the bathroom. Taylor, not wanting to betray his bladder, followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two steps, he doubled back to the table to grab his wallet. His confusion was so vast, he didn't even notice the leather strap now hanging from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And gosh darn it, why am I talking so strange?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor arrived at the restrooms, and almost blindly followed Iris into the girl's room, but stopped before crossing the threshold. Something may be bothering him, but he still had to keep his wits about. He backed up and proceeded into the boy's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was empty, except for Taylor. He stepped up the urinals, but they all seemed to be out of order. Probably vandalism, or a plumbing issue. Shrugging off the inconvenience, Taylor entered one of the stalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor tried to lift the seat, but found it stuck firm. No matter how hard he pulled, he couldn't move it more than a few inches. More than that, whenever he let go, it fell back down to its resting position. Taylor hung his engorged wallet on the provided hook in the stall. He braced one of his feet atop the toilet paper dispenser and tried one more pull with all his might. He strained and groaned, until he heard a rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't tell from his vantage point, but Taylor ripped the crotch of his shorts. He felt between his legs, and sure enough, he could feel his underpants. Taylor sized up his options. There wasn't enough time in his lunch period to run down to the locker room and change into his gym shorts. He could probably find some replacement pants in the lost and found, but what are the odds anything would fit him? Taylor just resolved to take small steps. Nobody would notice if he took small steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, Taylor reluctantly sat down on the toilet to relieve himself. Examining his shorts further, the hole was much larger than he initially worried. He didn't recall where he purchased them, but they must have been very cheap. Taylor couldn't even discern where one leg started and the other began. It was almost like his shorts were one giant pant leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor thought he felt some water splash up on him. He delicately patted himself dry before standing up and flushing. He pulled up his underwear, which felt thinner than he remembered. It also sat much higher on his hips than he was used to. He fastened his shorts, and sure enough, he could feel his thighs rubbing against one another. He reminded himself to take small, calculated steps, almost like he was walking a tightrope. One foot in front of the other, lest anyone notice he ripped the crotch of his shorts into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his wallet from the hook, he couldn't help but notice just how large it had become. How strange an ordinary everyday object could go so un-examined. He had never noticed how big his wallet was. Or how the purple leather looked in this light. Or how the brass zipper... wait, since when do wallets have zippers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay in there, Taylor?\" came a voice from beyond the stall doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine,\" he lied. Taylor grabbed his belongings and unlocked the stall door. There, he was greeted face to face with Iris. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I heard you flush, then you were just kind of standing around in there,\" Iris replied. \"I didn't know if you needed a pad or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor was shocked. He meant to ask why Iris was in the boy's room, not outside his stall. And what would he need a pad for? Why would he be taking notes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor looked around. The urinals were gone. There was no evidence they were ever there. Just more bathroom stalls. Iris wasn't in the boy's room, Taylor was in the girl's room! How could he have possibly made such a mistake? He was so careful. How gracious of Iris not to freak out about this. Taylor simply slumped his head in embarrassment and moved towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't go,\" Iris said. \"I need you to hold my purse while I... you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor fidgeted in anxious nerves, ready to dart for the door at the first moment. \"Can't you just put it on the hook?\" he asked, looking for his escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm always paranoid someone's going to come by and reach over the door and grab it. Please, please, please, I'll just be a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor relented. \"Okay, just be quick.\" Iris smiled and handed Taylor her bag, excusing herself to a stall. Taylor examined Iris's purse. Then he looked at his wallet. Then her purse again. Then his wallet again. There was something odd about the two of them. Something almost familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was giving him a headache to think about. Taylor put both bags down on the shelf by the sink. He turned on the faucet and lathered up with soap. He couldn't help but notice just how clean and trim his nails were. And shiny too. As though they were polished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Get a grip,' Taylor thought to himself. 'You'll be fine. Nothing else bad is going to happen to you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor stopped mid-thought. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw someone standing in the doorway. Anybody seeing him in the girl's room would be bad enough, but this was Carrie Applegate. Carrie was one of the cruelest mean girls to attend his school. In five minutes, Carrie would be texting the entire student body that Taylor was some sort of creepy pervert who spied on girls on toilet. At least, that's what Taylor feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Carrie just looked Taylor up and down and said:</span></div></div>",

You look fine.\u201d Taylor glanced at his reflection. It looked...slightly different than he was used to. A bit lighter, a bit smoother. And his hair looked a bit longer than it was this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was confusing to think about, and the thought disappeared as Iris spoke up. \u201cThanks for holding my purse,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you\u2019re welcome,\u201d Taylor replied, handing it over. As the two left the bathroom, Taylor snuck a glance at the sign on the door. Obviously, it was the girls\u2019 room. But why hadn\u2019t Iris or Carrie said anything? They had both acted like it was normal for him to be in there. Taylor followed Iris as the two walked back to the lunch table. Nobody seemed to notice the tear in Taylor\u2019s shorts, nor the way he was walking in an attempt to hide it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris and Taylor returned to their seats, Taylor placing his now-much-larger wallet on the table again, next to the debate books. He, and the rest of the team, finished off their lunch while continuing to study. Soon, it was the end of lunch period and time for the next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you like me to do, everyone?\u201d Taylor asked, still speaking more politely than he expected.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taylor studied throughout the remainder of the lunch period. Somehow, he had gone through the entire notebook. He not only had a full grasp of the arguments, he felt as though he had written them himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang. Jake and Iris collected their things and prepared to depart. \"I guess we'll see you after school,\" Jake said. \"We'll go through a trial run to make sure you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait,\" Taylor said, \"I'll walk with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, hon,\" Iris said, \"But don't you have to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Taylor asked confused. \"I'm going to sixth period, just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's why you need to get going,\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor was confused. Maybe he ran in different circles than these debaters, but they didn't have to shun him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Taylor said, crossing his arms. The motion felt weird. Like something was getting in the way of arms. \"What are you implying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Tay-Tay,\" Jake said playfully. \"Isn't The Redding Academy like a fifteen minute drive? I mean, aren't they sticklers for rules and such? Show up tardy and they smack your wrists with a ruler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor rolled his eyes. The Redding Academy was a prestigious institute of learning, not some stereotypical Catholic girl's school. The teachers weren't nuns. There was no corporal punishment. And sure, maybe there was an emphasis on decorum and punctuality--- Taylor stopped his train of thought. How did he know all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself. His hair was now shoulder length, and draped over a crisp white blouse. His navy blue sweater vest matched his pleated knee-length skirt. An inch of skin showed beneath the flared hemline before his legs were covered in ivory white knee socks. Emblazoned over his left breast was the Redding Academy logo, and yes, he indeed had breasts now. He could feel their weight in his bra. Taylor pursed his lips in fear. He could taste lip gloss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Taylor didn't go to this school anymore, he reasoned. Students at this school didn't wear uniforms. He was wearing a uniform. He went to another school. He went to Redding Academy. Taylor whipped open his purse. There, among the cosmetics, was his school ID. Redding Academy. Name: Taylor Kirtchner. Sex: F.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor knew all this, but still knew enough that this was all wrong. He grabbed his purse and his notes and took off running. As he bounded down the hallways with each step, his shoes lost their laces. The black Nikes he had been wearing became thinner, smaller, and grew a slight heel. When he was just 500 feet short of the school's front door, they had become a pair of patent leather loafers with a one inch heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped as he approached the glass front door. There, parked outside was a school bus reading \"Redding Academy\" on the side. A formal, but polite looking woman looked at him. \"Miss Kirtchner, there you are. Please, get on the bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please,\" Taylor began to mewl. \"I can't go... I can't... I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late enough as is. Get on the bus with the rest of the girls, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand rested gently on the small of Taylor's back. \"I'm so sorry,\" Lucy said. \"Taylor and I met up after the assembly. She had some questions, and I was trying to assist her as best I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" the teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Lucy said. \"Taylor took issue with my self-help seminar. She felt the power of positive thinking was nice, but lacked any sort of applicability for herself. She's been quite a bit concerned about college and the ensuing debt. While the Redding Academy is quite nice in terms of academics, it's rather lacking in extracurricular activities. So, I pulled a few strings, and now Taylor will be representing this school in the district's debate tournament. The prize is quite a sizable scholarship. And as it turns out, many past recipients have gone on to receive internships in government and major corporations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Well, congratulations Taylor. It looks like you're on the fast track to success now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now,\" Lucy said. \"She was always on the right track. She just needed to see the opportunities available a little more clearly. That's what thinking positive can achieve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor saw flashes of her future. College life. Academic awards. Career opportunities. It made her little knees tremble. Maybe... Maybe this wouldn't be so bad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh by the way, Taylor,\" Lucy said. \"Before you go, you left this behind.\" Lucy handed Taylor her book once again. <i>Seven Steps to a More Highly Effective You!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy had even autographed it. \"To Taylor, So glad I could <b>B</b>olster your <b>S</b>pirits. - Lucy Wong.\"</span></div></div>",

Muscle memory and instinct guided Taylor through her classes and around the halls of Redding Academy. Familiar faces greeted her, even though she knew with certainty she had never met them before. She slipped into this life and routine seamlessly. It was made for her, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new classes were challenging, but engaging. Her new classmates weren't any more stuck-up or elitist than other teenagers her age. And her new body was so comfortable and familiar, she began to forget it wasn't the same body she had this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived home, she found her family unchanged except for their memories. They had no idea Taylor ever was a boy. She had simply always been as she is. The photographs hanging in the hallway reflected this is how it always had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor's bedroom was the biggest change of all. Not outlandishly girly, it simply looked neat and tidy. The bedroom of a fastidious individual who appreciated things orderly and clean. Taylor took his transformation into a teenage girl in stride. Turning into a preppy, goody two shoes was the big adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor laid out a new outfit to replace her school uniform. A pink polo to replace the sweater vest and blouse. A pair of high-waisted khakis to take the place of her skirt. A simple pair of ballet flats on her feet and a strand of pearls to complete the classy, casual look. Taylor hung her uniform on a hanger, returning it to the closet for tomorrow. And the day after. And for the rest of the year. And every year until she graduated, summa cum laude, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor considered calling her old friends, checking in on them, seeing if they even remembered who he or she was, but decided against it. The more time passed, the more her old life seemed like a dull movie she once watched. She then considered calling her new friends, but was similarly disinclined. If she didn't start her homework now, she wouldn't have time to finish her chores before dinner. And if she didn't finish her chores, there wouldn't be time before sunset to go running in the park. And after all that, she still needed to prep for the debate tournament before going to bed at 9:00 sharp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor sighed as she fastened the clasp of pearls around her neck. Taylor knew a day this busy was the new normal. This was her life. Nothing good ever came easy. And Taylor was a very good girl.</span></div></div>",

Fairly standard stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" Lucy asked calmly, having had encounters with many people before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, s-sorry,\" the man said. \"Got a little nervous is all. I'm David Thomas, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was a pretty sincere man, and many would describe him as someone with a good heart. However, things weren't exactly the best with his situation. He had a college degree, but it went absolutely nowhere, still being stuck on minimum wage to this day. He had gone to numerous job fairs like this one, hoping to find at least someone to give him a chance. Appearance-wise, he had a rather average build, not exactly the most exercised, but still relatively thin. He had short red-blonde hair with blue eyes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and the primary reason he happened to be standing where he was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I just wanted...to ask for an autograph, ma'am,\" he asked. \"I saw your last special on TV last week and I thought it was pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, that had to be when she did her program in the next town over. Been a little while since she had seen someone approach her for an autograph, but she was happy to do so all the same. Heck, the kids loved it the last time she showed up at a daycare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, young man,\" Lucy smiled, proceeding to do just what he asked. \"And what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David...David Thomas,\" he smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you,\" she said, handing his notebook back. \"And if I may ask, what are you looking for here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, once David was assured he wasn't holding her up, he recounted most of what had already happened with him. All the school and job stuff he struggled with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mainly I just....want to get a chance somewhere. I can move out and not be a burden on my parents,\" he sighed a bit before looking back at Lucy. \"Oh sorry...I kind of rambled there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright,\" Lucy nodded, looking contemplative. \"There are plenty of young men like you looking to make such a mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could only imagine what would happen from here.</span></div></div>",

Most likely by the front door, David reasoned. As he navigated the labyrinthine convention center, he couldn't help but stop as his toes started hurting.

His toes were being rubbed raw, as though he weren't wearing any socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sat down on a bench, and undid the laces of his shoe so he could rub his aching toes. The black socks he was wearing looked strange to him. The material was much thinner than he last remembered.

David couldn\u2019t make out who the guy was very clearly but he could swear it looked just like his best friend Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final strange thing David found was a business card in the purse which had her name on it. Apparently she was a receptionist at a rather prestigious law firm...CKA. Or Cooper, Kauffman, and Associates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all too much for David. He put everything back where he found it and got up and decided to leave this career fair and just go home. David rushed out of the auditorium and to his car breathing heavily as he almost ran out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid hadn\u2019t even noticed yet his socks had continued their changes this whole time turning into a very fine pair of pantyhose as the fronts of his shoes were melting away as a small heel was developing on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid spun out of the parking lot driving the car like he stole it taking in a deep sigh of relief not even bothering to check his back seat as a very familiar looking purse was sitting there...</span></div></div>",

And to think he thought things might turn around with getting a chance to see Lucy Wong in person, though come to think of it, he never even stayed around to hear her speech given how fast he ran out. He looked over to his cupholder, where he had inserted that pen. It still looked the same, having the same words as before. Honestly, he wasn't sure what to think of his meeting with her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nothing to it then,\" he sighed again as he made a left turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess he might as well head back to his apartment, back to his own place of privacy. He had just enough money to live on his own in an apartment, even if it wasn't by much. Still, it could be worse all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he came up to a red light, making a stop there. Granted, it was a section notorious for taking a while so he would be waiting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" he groaned, knowing this would take a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there though, something felt a little off. His head felt...itchy all of a sudden. Perhaps because of all the agitation he had just felt over the past few minutes or so. He reached a hand up to scratch it, just to get his mind off of it. However, once he was doing that, the hair he was feeling felt....different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he spoke as he looked up to the mirror to get a better view. Honestly, he wished he hadn't soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight where his hand was was some noticeably longer hair. Considering he just had a hair cut the week before, the difference was staggering was it getting long enough to cover his ears. Actually, if you looked closely, you could even see it slowly growing longer right before his eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" he cried out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther more, some strands of his hair were starting to look considerably blonder, the little bit of red he had slowly fading out in certain places. The roots especially were looking much brighter, starting to trail off into the longer strands. A slight shiver went down his body as it felt it begin to touch his neck, hair flowing a little more loosely now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....this must be a dream....\" he muttered to himself, eyes wide and nearly in a panic. \"It's not real....It's not real....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the light finally went green, and he began going before someone could honk him. However, as he put his foot on the gas, he felt a little ache, making him grunt a bit. Sparing a look further down, he was greeted with another surprise. He could see his toes! They were clad in...something tan? Certainly not the dress socks he had before. Also, his shoes seemed much smaller and conforming to his feet, even lacking laces and a tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even more so, they were cracking and reshaping as a little heel was growing even longer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David was on the verge of having a panic attack so to calm down he sped into a nearby gas station to get a look at what was happening to him. He needed to see this with his own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got out of the car he ran up to the door and surprisingly a random guy opened the door for him. What was weirder was the guy gave David a rather creepy smile and a small wink like he was checking him out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot stopping to dwell on it David rushed to the bathroom and confirmed his worst fears. His hair was much longer now and was still getting brighter in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god...\u201d He said in shock and disbelief as he held the handfuls of hair in his hands. It was long enough to touch his shoulders now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave couldn\u2019t stand for this. He stormed out of the bathroom and went into one of the aisles and found a pair of scissors and marched back into the bathroom and began cutting away. Lock after lock of hair he cut and cut going as short as possible. After a few minutes David stood there panting looking like he just lost a fight with a lawn mower....He looked like a total mess but it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever not even a minute passed after he had finished cutting his hair when his scalp began to burn and itch. He began to itch and scratch his head as he saw in the mirror new hairs growing from his scalp these ones much more blonde than before. They grew and grew and grew and grew inches in a matter of seconds this time even longer before as in a matter of minutes he now had beautiful head of golden blonde hair that came passed his shoulders down to his kid back....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid couldn\u2019t believe this! It had to be a curse or something! Grabbing the scissors once more he went to town again on his new lock shredding them down as short as humanly possible. By the time he was done this time his head looked almost bald...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood....now stay there...\u201d David said in defiance looking at his mess of a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever his request was denied....and in such spectacular fashion it even left David speechless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe itching returned but rather than a slowly growth the remaining hairs on his head actually began to fall out....The bright blonde locks simply fell off his head...Every last hair on his head disappearing right before his eyes as he was soon as bald and smooth as a china doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...that\u2019s better than the alternative...\u201d David said rubbing his smooth head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this too was not meant to be...David soon felt the itching returned as new hairs were sprouting on his head. This time they were much brighter and longer than before...However unlike before these hairs weren\u2019t just blonde they were a bright platinum blonde. Natural to roots as they were growing rapidly....Longer and longer they grew like pure silvery platinum silk the hair cascaded down his shoulders and back not resting until it was down past his waist...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the hair of a model, perfectly silky and well maintained. Something that most women would kill for. It hung there perfectly off his head mocking him as if to teach him a lesson to stop trying to cut it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood there shocked and defeated as he dropped the scissors. Any further attempts to stop this would only make it worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea what to do next when all of a sudden two random women walked into the bathroom and saw David. It was then David released he was actually in the ladies room. He stood there trying to think of an excuse but both of the women just stared and him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like your hair.\u201d One of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...How do you get it so straight and silky like that? What products do you use?\u201d The other said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither woman seemed disturbed at him being there as David didn\u2019t respond and just left there awkwardly getting back into his car and driving off. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suffice to say, this was completely cuts. David took a little time to breathe before getting the car running again, thankfully not as fast this time so he wasn't swerving around cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?!\" he asked in frustration to just about no one. \"It's like something out of a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow in the world was this happening to him? Like some weird magic? That shouldn't even be a thing right? Well, unless he was hallucinating, it was very much real, and it seemed like it was trying to remind him of that. His long platinum blonde hair constantly tickled his shoulders, and he could feel it down his back the whole time. It was kind of annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, he didn't want to risk any more stops like that, lest he get noticed by anyone. It was particularly unnerving how those women just asked him questions like that as if everything was perfectly normal. That was spooky in and of itself. He didn't want to have to deal with any more of those. Thankfully his apartment wasn't too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it....he had basically gone all the way to the bathroom in the heels his shoes were turning into. How did that work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, hurts just thinking on it,\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he was humming along on the freeway, another strange sensation seemed to be hitting him, making him groan again though he wasn't sure where it was coming from specifically this time. Though, as the sensation continued, he began to feel a tickling in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" he sighed, eyes widening a bit as he looked towards his hands on the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was this strange cracking feeling, as if his hands were being compressed in to something a little smaller. Slowly but surely, his hands seemed to be getting smaller, while his fingers themselves seemed to be getting longer by comparison. However, that wasn't the big thing as something else that caught his eye. His fingernails seemed to be growing, made very obvious given he had cut them the other day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't just a little bit either, they were growing well past his fingertips, into a style that was very well maintained, even a little glossy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had very little to actually say on it. What else could he say on something that seemed very supernatural? Frankly, he just wanted to get off the road before he panicked any more. Thankfully for him, his apartment was just around the corner, allowing him a chance to finally take a breather instead of worrying if his anxiety would make him crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he parked into his usual spot, not sparing a thought as he began to go up the stairs towards his space a few floors up. He wasn't sure if it was the adrenaline or something, but he somehow did it while in those heels.</span></div></div>",

What bothered him even more than the shoes however was the fact that they hadn\u2019t even bothered him. He had actually walked in them rather comfortably...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to pause and think. His mind was racing a million miles an hour. Was this magic? A curse? Was he dreaming or hallucinating? Why was he changing and why did nobody even seem to notice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David paced around his apartment in only his boxers he suddenly heard a strange ringing noise. It was the sound of a phone ringing but not his own...It was a more feminine ringing noise coming from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the sound David\u2019s eyes widened as he saw the same red purse from before sitting on his kitchen counter...The same purse that started this whole thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringing was coming from there as David looked inside and saw a pink smartphone inside ringing as he picked it up. The name on the phone ringing said Eric Marshall....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric Marshall was David\u2019s best friend. They had known each other since middle school. Why was he calling this phone? What relationship did he have with this Danielle woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid our of shear curiosity answered the phone as he heard on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey baby, sorry to bug you I\u2019m at work. I just wanted to let you know dinner reservations are for tomorrow at 7 at Sorintinos. I gotta go by, love you!\u201d He said before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was confused. That was definitely Eric\u2019s voice on the other end. He knew the restaurant, Sorintinos was a super fancy and expensive Italian restaurant that was usually far to expensive for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d David asked more confused than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did it as she was passionate about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this day in particular, she had made a stop for some gas on her way to her next session. Just one of many trips she had made on her trip. She didn't mind them though, as these stops often allowed her to see more people, and you never knew just what types of people you might be able to meet and help to change along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally she couldn't count how many people she had helped from little stops along the way, and perhaps this would be no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the store, she was searching along for a few things for the remainder of her trip. Simple ordinary stuff that anyone else would do of course. It wasn't long before she was about to check out what she had bought, particularly because the store wasn't getting much business at the moment, leaving her alone with the few employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy walked up to the counter, her eyes going to the clerk at the register who was slightly turned to her. Appeared to be a young man, probably in his 20's somewhere, with brown hair and brown eyes. Probably someone who was in college or just out of it if she had to guess. He appeared to be staring attentively at something, perhaps reading if she had to guess. That seemed curious. She smiled as she walked up to the counter, the sound of her steps alerting the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" he suddenly turned to see her coming up. \"Sorry about that? You found everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did thanks,\" Lucy smiled, looking at the guy's nametag. \"Sam is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Sam Farmer,\" the boy said, before getting a better look at the woman as he was checking the items. \"And uh....are you Lucy Wong? I happened to see you on TV once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am,\" Lucy smiled. \"It catch your interest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...interesting,\" Sam said a little unsure. \"Though, if I may be honest, it does feel really hard to get such a life. I feel like there are a lot of people who try hard but end up with little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you wouldn't be the first to say that,\" Lucy nodded. \"Getting on the right track in life can be hard. You just have to find it somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, she happened to glance down. Apparently whatever Sam had been reading wasn't fully hidden, and she could make out what looked like a Japanese manga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, is that your passion down there?\" she asked, making Sam jump a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that he had failed to fully hide it, he blushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I kind of like that stuff,\" he said. \"Always have. Just always looked interesting to me. Big fan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to know,\" Lucy smiled, paying for everything with her credit card. \"I'm curious, is that the sort of life you'd want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kind of sounded like a loaded question, not the one Sam had ever had anyone ask him before. Honestly, he tried to keep many of his manga/anime interests a secret from most other people as it felt a little embarrassing to talk about. Still, she had caught him red-handed, and on the one day he thought he wouldn't have a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I would,\" he said. \"Sounds more interesting than the one I have right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Lucy nodded, her smile still there. \"In that case, I might just have something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy kept a whole bunch of things in her bag, one for many types of situations. Plus, guys with interests such as these were more common than you'd think. She had come across many who liked the idea of an anime world.</span></div></div>",

Not even on the market yet. Read it and I\u2019m sure it will change your life.\u201d She said with a smile and small wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Sam would feel awkward taking something from a stranger but considering the celebrity Lucy Wong was he didn\u2019t feel weird about it. He took the book thanking her as paid for her gas and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam finished his shift a short time later as he went back to his apartment and decided to read the Manga before bed. It was rather short. Only an introduction to the main story so Sam figured it was worth a quick read. Sam sat down and over the next hour finished the book as he actually quite liked the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story was \u201cGuardians.\u201d It was about a young guy named Minato who was your typical Anime High schooler around 18. He was rather shy and kept to himself and lived alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lived in a fictional version of modern Tokyo that seemed normal except the city had a serious problem. Occasionally the city would come under attack from black shadow monsters known as Daemons. These monsters came in all shapes and sizes but all of them had shadowy black ink like bodies except for their glowing yellow eyes, and were bent on destroying everything they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nobody knows where Daemons come from as they disappear and vanish as quickly as they appear. It also seems like traditional weapons are useless again them. Bullets and modern weapons don\u2019t affect them at all. Humanity had no answer to these monsters who never even spoke of what they wanted or where they came from. All they cared about was destruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until the Guardians appeared. Strange women all young and beautiful. They seemed to wield some sort of magic based off the elements which was also conveniently color coordinated to their hair color in typical anime style. These Guardians used their magic and enhanced physical abilities to fight off the Daemons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever just like the Daemons nobody seemed to know anything about the Gaurdians except that they always fought together in pairs and that they were always young and beautiful females. Some people regard them as heroes while others believe they are connected to the Daemons themselves and don\u2019t trust them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story begins with Minato who on his way home one day is seeing the aftermath of a terrible Daemon battle where the Gaurdian involved is presumed dead. Minato sees something on the ground and realizes it\u2019s a golden ring with an deep blue jewel in the center that matches his very blue anime eyes and hair. He picks up the ring and just out of curiosity tries it on only to realize it won\u2019t come off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Minato is awoken early to a knocking at his door and sees a strange girl he has never seen before standing there. She is about his age and kinda cute. She had short faded red hair and a really skinny body with small breasts and not much of a figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next scene is a rather humorous one as the girl seeks really confused to see Minato there as she lets herself in his place confused as if she is looking for someone else. The whole time Minato is only wearing a towel and really embarrassed as he tried to push her out of her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally gets her to explain herself the girl explains that her named is Rosuko but most people just call her Rose. She says she was told her new partner was here but is confused because all she sees is a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato has no idea what she is talking about and tries to push her away only for Rose to see his ring as she holds up one she is wearing that\u2019s looks the same only with a fiery red jewel instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose explains she is a guardian and that she is very new to the profession. Her mentor and former partner was killed in a Daemon attack last night which means her ring was sent off to find a new host and for some reason it chose him, which is normally very odd because all guardians are supposed to be female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato doesn\u2019t really believe her at first as he tries to go to school but Rose seems determined to stick by his side in a cute and adorable yet also funny and kinda annoying way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn their way to school they are attacked however by a Daemon and Rose reveals she is telling the truth as she activates her ring and undergoes a very anime style transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body changes from a skinny timid girl to a sexy and voluptuous fire red bombshell. Her hair becomes fiery red and grows much longer as does her eyes and nails. She develops great curves and her breasts grow larger. Her outfit also changes to a skin tight fiery red one piece leotard with matching skin tight boots. She looks like a sexy superhero when she is done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Rose also has a very different personality. While before she was awkward and clumsy. Now she is hot tempered and overly confident. She also shows off her fiery powers that correspond with her new personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Rose tries to hold off the Daemon who seems bent in going after Minato but by herself it\u2019s too strong and right before the Daemon is about to crush Minato ulhis ring glows as he too undergoes a similar transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body becomes female with very large breasts and great curves as his deep blue hair grows longer than his waist. He becomes a total anime girl knock out as his outfit changes to tight blue sports bra and skin tight blue booty shorts. There was definitely a lot of fan service with this design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his transformation the new female Minato tries to defend herself as beams of ice shoot out of her hands. She has no idea how to control this power but it gives Rose the upper hand enough to team up and force the Daemon to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new female Minato is obviously freaked out by his new body as Rose tries to calm him down explaining once his changes he won\u2019t be able to change back until he falls asleep and wakes up the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prevent any confusion Rose refers to Minato as just Nina now as she tries to explain the situation a bit. Nina actually passes out from the shock of everything and that ends the first chapter setting up a whole new possible series of adventures for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam thought the book was actually pretty good but didn\u2019t think it was life changing as he yawned and went to bed not realizing how wrong he just was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens in the morning? </span></div></div>",

Honestly, as much as he might have wanted to give the manga a second look to see if he missed anything, he had more work to do in the morning. Yeah, pretty much that most days of the week. In all honesty, it did make him wonder about such an anime-style life. Would the constant craziness be an upgrade compared to this world? Or is it just thinking the grass is greener on the other side?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBah, he was too tired for this kind of thinking, and it was beginning to get really late. Putting the manga away, he got into bed and turned the light off. You know, it still lingered in his head how Lucy Wong would have such a thing on hand. Maybe she was a big fan? Oh, but she said it wasn't even on market. Or maybe she was just messing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as he finally was able to get to sleep, he failed to notice a slight glow coming from the desk where he left the manga. As the hours passed, it slowly got brighter and brighter, though not enough to wake him up, merely just making him stir a bit. However, that all changed once the clock in his room struck midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause right at that moment, the manga flashed open, engulfing the whole room in light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>The Next Day</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digital clock alarm sounded at about 7:00, causing the rooms inhabitant to groan as he turned it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....not nearly enough time...\" groaned the boy as he slowly got up, yawning and stretching the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooked like just another morning for Minato Takahashi. 18 years old, living on his own, and living out the final year of high school. Probably not the best arrangement but it could be worse. The solitary life style suited him more or less, and it wasn't like he had no acquaintances at all. He knew some people at school, despite being shy and mostly keeping to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat beside the point though, he couldn't remember what he was dreaming about last night, only that it was really, really weird. Like a completely out of body experience or something. It was bizarre to say the least. Well, guess there was no time in worrying about it. He had to get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypical to his routine, he took a shower before getting his uniform on, taking a brief look at his blue hair to make sure he at least didn't have a lot of bedhead. Last thing he needed was for attention to be drawn to him. After that, he began fixing some breakfast, all the while hearing the news on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like it was talking more about those Daemons, such as another attack during the later hours of yesterday. Suffice to say it was concerning when those things showed up, made going from place to place more dangerous for sure. Tokyo hadn't been the same for many years since they came. And those \"Guardians\" or whatever, they were just as much an enigma. He wasn't sure what to make of them, but he supposed it didn't matter too much. As long as they helped, it wasn't an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, he gathered all his things once he was good to go, taking a deep breath as he began to leave his apartment, going out into the bright Tokyo sun. The view from the 3rd floor gave a pretty picturesque view of Tokyo, a shot straight out of an anime with its bright colors. Not that that sort of thing made any difference to him. To him, this was just life in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he began to make his way down, start of another day. Suzumiya High was a decent walk after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minato was dressed in his black school uniform very typical for boys at his school. He saw girls passing him wearing their white blouses and black skirts. It was nearing quarterly exams so people were rushing to school to finish up final projects before break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato was a decent student. Not the top at all but no where near the bottom. He had no idea what he was going to do next year. He still had to figure it out on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he hurried to school he suddenly heard an all to familiar alarm sound as police whistles and sirens began to bellow. Minato and every Japanese person knew what this meant all too well....It signaled a Daemon attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the street a few block a strange black portal began to emerge from out of no where. Dark sparks of lightning and energy cracked and shot off the portal as a dark shadowy figure began to emerge from it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all Daemons this monster was pure black like it was made of shadows and darkness. Except for its eyes...Those were always glowing a bright yellow. Most Daemons also took on shapes that were at least familiar to things in the world. Sometimes they looked like birds, lizards, insects, sometimes even they took on human like shapes although those were most rare and most dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Daemon emerging from this portal seemed to look like a spider of sorts. Eight huge legs and nasty pincers and teeth with eight glowing yellow eyes. The spider was least the size of a city bus and it wasted no time in beginning to cause terror downtown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato had never been this close to Daemon encounter before. There were relatively uncommon so it wasn\u2019t expected to actually see one only a couple blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople were fleeing the deamon as they screamed in terror as the monster used it giant legs to smash cars and destroy whatever was in its way. The police and military were showing up and doing what they could but all bullets and traditional weapons could ever hope to do was slow it down. In reality all they really did was make it more angry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was suddenly a bright flash of light as a bright blue and a bright red light seemed to appear out of nowhere. Minato couldn\u2019t see exactly what it was but it seemed like the lights were coming from two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato could barely make out the action from so far away but  he did see flashes of light and as it looked like the women were using superhuman speed and strength to jump around and fight the spider as they shot what looked like beams of fire and ice from their hands to hurt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police finally got to his street as he directed everyone to flee. Since the daemon attack was so close they were postpone school for the day. It was one of the only positives of a daemon attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato turned around and began to rush back to his apartment the sounds of fighting and explosions getting louder and louder much to close for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few block down the road Minato was finally out of the danger zone. The fighting seemed to have stopped as emergency services were arriving to treat the wounded. There was no sign of the daemon or the guardians who arrived to stop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was close...thank goodness those guardians showed up.\u201d Minato thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much was known of the guardians. They seemed to be the only ones capable of fighting the Daemons. They were super powered people who were apparently all young women. Their origins were just as mysterious as the Daemons but it seemed like right now there were the only hope humanity had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato saw his apartment ahead of him as he rushed to get home. He was covered in dust and debris from the battle now so he wanted to get home and shower. As he was about to take the steps up to his place Minato saw a small glimmer in the corner of his eye. It looked sort of like a shiny blue light coming from the bushes near the stairs of his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato paused for a moment as he saw the glimmer again more clearly coming from the bushes as he decided to see what it was. Reaching closer Minato pulled out a small metal ring from the bushes as he examined it. The ring was beautiful. Golden with interesting designs engraved into the band. There was a also a very bright and shiny blue jewel in the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...this is nice. I wonder how much it\u2019s worth?\u201d He asked himself. Nobody in his neighborhood ever wore a ring this fancy looking so he was curious where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity Minato slipped the ring into his middle finger on his right hand and found that surprisingly it fit perfectly. It was almost like it was designed for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nice, it\u2019s a little feminine for my style though.\u201d He said to himself trying to take it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring however refused to budge...Minato tugged and pulled...nothing. He went inside and tried water, butter, oil, nothing worked. It was like the ring was now attached to him permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll deal with this later....\u201d He said in frustration as he still wanted to take a shower to get all the dust and debris off of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato took a nice hot shower as he jumped out feeling refreshed wrapping a towel around his waist. He was about to get dressed when all of a sudden there was a knock on his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s package I ordered online.\u201d Minato thought to himself as he went to answer the door Opening it  as he suddenly froze as his eyes went wide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of him wasn\u2019t a delivery person but a girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared about his age and was wearing a white blouse and black skirt showing she was a student at his school. She was wearing black leggings and dress shoes and she had large rounded glasses on. Her hair was a faded auburn color. Not quite red and not quite orange or yellow either. More like a red that had its color taken away. Her eyes were also a light auburn color to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was very skinny and rather short only 5\u20192 at most. Her figure wasn\u2019t much to speak of with smaller breasts and not much curves. She looked very shy by nature and had a cute kind of bookworm look to her as far a anime girls go. The only thing that really stood out was she was also wearing a very fancy looking golden ring but this one had a red gem in the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi...Umm...I\u2019m Rosuko...I\u2019m here to find my new partner. If she around here somewhere?\u201d Rosuko asked Minato who was trying to cover himself with his towel having no idea what this girl was talking about...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uh....W-What?\" Minato asked with a stupefied look. No doubt he looked really out of sorts given his current attire, or lack there of. Great, the one time a girl actually approaches him, it's when he's got nothing but a cloth on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, it was hard to tell if Rosuko had any idea as to Minato's apparent situation. Her face was already blushing, though it didn't seem related to his attire. Though, after a little bit of an awkward silence, one of Rosuko's eyes finally opened back up, looking up Minato a bit. And that was when her face definitely got red, steam beginning to come out of her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-AH! I'm so sorry!\" she panicked a bit, jumping in the air a bit. \"I-I didn't realize you were occupied!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's okay! I'm sorry!\" Minato cried right back, neither of the two obviously in a good situation. \"Uh, I-I'm not sure who you're looking for though....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's....It's a girl who should have a ring like this.....only blue,\" Rosuko got a little bit of her blush under control, showing off the ring she had on her own right hand. Actually, more like pointing so close to his face that it nearly hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a closer look, Minato's face paled a bit. Up close, it <i>really</i> looked like his own. In fact, the design was pretty much identical, the only difference being the ruby red gem instead of his more sapphire-like one. How...how could two rings like that be so identical? Not to mention, what made these rings so weird, like not even bothering to come off his hand? What in the world was going on today?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....you mean....this?\" Minato said in an unsure voice, slowly bringing up his own right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosuko's eyes blinked a bit, actually blinked multiple times as her eyes traveled to his hand. There were a few more seconds of awkward silence....until........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHH!\" she cried out, probably making the whole complex rumble. \"It's you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately started inspecting the ring a bit, pulling Minato around a ways all while she did that. It was a miracle that his towel was actually able to stay on the whole time, preventing even more embarrassment. Still, whatever this girl was on about, she was really flustered at this, constantly blabbering to herself as she looked the ring over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this!\" she cried out, eventually letting go and allowing Minato to fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww.....\" he groaned, slowly getting up. \"What's this all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...well....it's best that we talk inside,\" Rosuko sighed, uttering a little apology before turning and making herself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure....make yourself at home,\" Minato groaned a bit as he followed behind her, closing the door as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosuko paced about the decent apartment a little bit, still mumbling to herself as she went back and forth. It was clear she had something to say, but didn't know how exactly to say it. Honestly, now that you got a closer look at her, she looked more than a little dirty, kind of like how you were when coming back from the Daemon battle. Did she come from there too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...just give me a minute...\" Minato said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Rosuko said, grabbing a nearby cloth to wash her face a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato left to at least dress himself in something casual. Anything to avoid any more embarrassment given how this day was going so far. He made sure he was presentable enough before returning to where Rosuko stayed, still looking as antsy as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's this all about?\" Minato asked finally.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s obvious she feels super awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...Umm...I\u2019m a guardian...and I guess you are now one too.\u201d She said adjusting her glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...this ring is what makes you a guardian? How am I supposed to believe you?\u201d Minato asked obviously skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell....it\u2019s just...my partner...she was mentor. She didn\u2019t survive that last daemon attack. She has been training me for about a month now. I still can barely control it myself at this point. When a guardian dies their ring chooses a near host but I\u2019ve never seen it chose a boy before....All guardians are women.\u201d Rosuko explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato did realize that all Guardians were women and had been since they appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did it chose me? Am I supposed to be the first male guardian or something?\u201d Minato asked only entertaining this idea he hadn\u2019t actually accepted it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m....not sure. I dunno either but for some reason the Ice ring chose you. Right now there are six rings out there and each guardian works with a partner meaning there are three teams that each protect different areas from Daemons. This is the fire ring and we are team 1 also called fire and ice. Team two is earth and air, and team 3 is light and darkness. Each time watches over certain parts of city. This part of the city is ours to protect. Each of our rings give us guardians the strength and power we need to fight back the daemons.\u201d Rosuko explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer story made sense but still Minato had no reason to believe her. Honestly how could this shy girl be some secret awesome superhero?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...even if...I believed you what do you want me to do?\u201d Minato asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...Umm...I guess I am supposed to be your mentor now. I can teach you how to transform and use your powers to help protect the city from Daemons...\u201d Rosuko said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTransform? Like I get to become all super strong and get a sweet outfit?\u201d Minato said as he was picturing himself looking like a sweet superhero from all those movies he watched as a kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...Uhh...sorta...I dunno how the transformation will affect you it affects everyone differently. When we change our bodies and personality changes.\u201d Rosuko explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato still didn\u2019t really buy this yet. However he couldn\u2019t deny his curiosity....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...if you are telling the truth why don\u2019t you prove it? Transform now into your super guardian form.\u201d Minato said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease....I...I don\u2019t like changing. I get really hot tempered and brash...It\u2019s hard to control my emotions when I\u2019m like that.\u201d Rosuko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? You can\u2019t change just to prove it? How am I supposed to be your partner if you won\u2019t trust me?\u201d Minato said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine...please....don\u2019t....think bad of me.\u201d Rosuko said standing up and taking a deep breath as she held up her hand as the red gem on the ring began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this exact moment Minato realized that she may have been telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn true Anime style Rosuko suddenly underwent a marvelous transformation. Her hair suddenly turned fiery red as he grew longer and longer all the way down to her ankles as he flowed around her body. Her eyes also too became fiery red as did her finger nails which grew longer. Her body also changed getting taller and more shapely as grew more toned muscles on her legs and arms as her hips widened and even her butt grew more shapely. Her breasts expanded greatly becoming at least DDs. Overall her body looked like a fiery hot bombshell. Lastly her clothes also changed turning into a fiery red mini skirt and crop top along with matching red heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there Minato was stunned and at a loss for words as he stared at the firey bombshell girl in his apartment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHot damn that feels good! See I told you! Dummy I wasn\u2019t joking okay! Oh jeez I forget my clothes always change and since I\u2019m not fighting I don\u2019t have my battle suit I\u2019m stuck wearing this sexy and slutty clothes now are you happy? Wait...don\u2019t answer that you perv!\u201d Rosuko said as her personality was definitely different now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...I...Uhh...how?\u201d Minato said at a total loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I was a guardian dumbass! All guardians change like this. I\u2019m still new though so don\u2019t judge me okay! I\u2019m not an expert on all this stuff yet!\u201d Rosuko said in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm sorry I doubted you Rosuko...I just didn\u2019t know...\u201d Minato began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me Rose when I\u2019m like this. I\u2019m still me but I like that name in this form it helps me stand out more.\u201dRose said examining herself in a nearby mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn I really am hot aren\u2019t I? Also don\u2019t get any ideas I\u2019m just your partner okay?\u201d Rose said shooting him a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato held up his hand like a scout doing an honor pledge. He was a intimidated now seeing her true form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...what should we do next?\u201d Minato asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we need to get you to change...normally a daemon encounter does the trick but sense that might be awhile we need to come up with another idea....Let\u2019s see we need to replicate the stress of a daemon attack...\u201d Rose began to ponder as she suddenly got a wicked idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could toss you in the air....I may not look it but I\u2019m really strong in this form I could probably toss you a few hundred feet in the air. You should be able to use that stress to change and land back safely...\u201d Rose said standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait....you can be serious why don\u2019t you just tell me the trick and I will figure it out?\u201d Minato said backing up until he ran out of room...</span></div></div>",

How in the world did she grab him that fast?! Guess he really couldn't deny all this stuff about being a Guardian. Granted, it was more freaking him out than anything right now. Struggling didn't seem to be helping him at all when it came to getting out of Rose's grip as she was pulling him outside of the apartment and to the walkway outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, up we go!\" she said as she jumped up, not having any trouble doing so given Minato's apartment was on the top floor anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH!\" Minato cried from the short jump up to the roof of the place, landing rather hard on his butt. \"Hey, take it easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to be tougher than that when daemons come,\" Rose said, not letting go in the slightest. \"And, to be honest, I'd rather get a move on with this. We need to see what you got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't want to!\" Minato cried back. \"This is insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop whining,\" Rose snorted a bit before grabbing harder. \"Might wanna think fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with one swing, Minato was sent straight up into the air, crying the whole way up. He had no idea just how long he spent going up into the sky</span></div></div>",

This was the strangest sensation he had ever felt in his life, a sense of having so solid footing around him at all. It was strange and frightening all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, sadly he had little time to process it before his momentum was stopping, gravity beginning to work its magic and start to bring him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed again as he began to be pulled back down to Earth, and unfortunately at a faster pace than before as the roof of the building was rapidly approaching. Adding insult to injury was the fact that his constant movement was making him spin around, making seeing where the ground was even harder to see. Still, he could make a small red speck of what he assumed to be Rose, who was just sitting down on a pipe and swinging her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Seriously?! What the hell?!\"</i> he shouted in his head. <i>\"I'm gonna die!!!!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as those thoughts passed through his head though, it was like some sort of shock went down his spine, making him freeze a bit. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see a faint blue glow, making him bring his hand up. The blue ring was glowing, getting even brighter as it enveloped Minato in a bright and spectacular display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato's mind barely had any time to comprehend what was going on, only that it felt like a lot of energy was flowing through him. His whole body felt like it was changing into something lithe and nimble, while feeling full at the same time. His legs were becoming smooth and strong, not to mention with wide hips and a bigger butt. His torso was also becoming curved, with the sensation of two large mounds forming rapidly. His blue hair even shined as it grew out to his waist, still as vibrant as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in just a few seconds, Rose felt an impact from a few yards in front of her. Not that it was surprising to her at all of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Minato's body had moved on its own, making a rather graceful landing on the top of the roof. However, his appearance was nothing like it was before. It was that of a relatively tall beauty of a girl, his clothes from before resembling more of a sleeveless sky blue dress with a really short bottom, complemented by white sandals.</span></div></div>",

Wait...why does my voice sound different?\u201d Minato said hearing his softer high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato\u2019s eyes trailed down as his vision was suddenly blocked by something...or rather two somethings...Two very large breasts were sticking out from his chest blocking his view as Minato reached up with his new dainty hands that supported nice new longer nails as gave them a soft squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato suddenly gave a soft and innocent moan as a new sensation ran through his body as he ripped his hands away and looked back to Rose staring at him in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a girl! Why am I a girl?\u201d Minato said freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose tried to calm him...or was it her down now grabbing her by the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hey relax it totally makes sense! Remember guardians are all females remember? You are the first male one ever so it totally makes sense your guardian form is a female!\u201d Rose said using simply logic to reason this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about that I\u2019m still a girl!\u201d Minato said squealing as he pouted and almost fell over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine it\u2019s fine you can always change back. Just relax...stay calm....take a deep breath. Once you are calm enough you just think about changing yourself back.\u201d Rose said as she demonstrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose took a deep breath and calmed herself as her ring began to glow as her body was enveloped into a bright red light and within a few moments Rosuko was standing back in her original form just like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...you see? It\u2019s not hard at all.\u201d Rosuko said as her timid voice and personality was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato took a deep breath as he followed her instructions....He cleared mind....thought of his male body....envisioned himself turning back...aaaaaannndddd.....nothing....nothing at all....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh....Uhh...that\u2019s a bit odd.\u201d Rosuko said not sure why it wasn\u2019t working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several minutes Rosuko told Minato to try all sorts of calming exercises and techniques and yet no matter what nothing working...not even a flicker from the ring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you telling me I\u2019m stuck like this forever?\u201d Minato said with big tears welling up his big beautiful new female anime eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...I don\u2019t think so. All rings recharge their powers while you sleep so I assume you would change back then automatically. If I fall asleep as Rose I always wake up as Rosuko.\u201d Rosuko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that really doesn\u2019t help me now what am I supposed to do with a body like this?\u201d Minato said gesturing to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...not sure let\u2019s think of a plan.\u201d Rosuko said as they decided to go inside and figure something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMina....I mean...Wait...Mina....Nina...Nina! That\u2019s it! While you are a girl I\u2019ll call you Nina!\u201d Rosuko said as they sat together in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato...well...Nina...looked back at Rosuko and tried to feign happinesses still not believing he was stuck in this female body until he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I supposed to deal with this? If a Daemon attacks in the day time like today I\u2019m gonna be stuck as a girl all day!\u201d Nina said going all the problems with this in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was stomping all over her living room both angry and scared and not sure what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can help you....maybe....maybe I can show you how to be a girl when you have to be one and whenever I\u2019m Rose I will train you on how to be guardian?\u201d Rosuko asked shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t a bad idea but Nina had to think about it. Going to the bathroom she needed some privacy to think all through this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at her new reflection Nina couldn\u2019t believe how gorgeous and sexy she was now. Her boobs were huge...bigger than even Rose\u2019s who was at least a DD. Yet they were still rounded and perky. She was very tall with long and toned legs and great curves a nice bubble butt. Her waist length shiny blue hair cascaded down her back like a wave. Too terrified to look Nina gently pulled up her dress to see a pair of cute blue panties and noticed how flat it was and the absence of something very important to what she had as a guy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head she wouldn\u2019t be tempted so easily as she got out of the bathroom and decided....</span></div></div>",

She shouldn't have these heavy things on her, or be so flat on her groin. Becoming a girl was like something out of a weird fantasy, yet somehow it was real to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhhhhh!\" she groaned, keeping her hands away from exploring any more of how this body looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how in the world was this going to work? She still had high school to finish, and now fighting Daemons was going to be a part of this? It all just felt like too much to handle. Already this body just felt so bizarre and that was without getting into the whole superpowers thing. Still, guess she just had to handle it somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a thought came to mind, though she wasn't sure if it was a good idea or not. Still, might as well try. She finally left the bathroom, finding Rosuko still hanging around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Nina began. \"I suppose you teaching me about this stuff is best....though...would you be comfortable being my roommate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Nina was surprised she didn't stutter more on that, and Rosuko blushed heavily at that. Though, she didn't seem as surprised as Nina thought she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...actually not a bad idea,\" she said. \"I currently live on my own too, since my parents still live in Mie Prefecture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You're from the country?\" Nina asked, a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Being away from my parents for school was pretty hard at first,\" Rosuko said sadly. \"But I've gotten used to it. I visit whenever possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that seemed to be that at least.</span></div></div>",

It was like every guy and even girl she passed gave her a passing glance, a wink, even a couple whistles here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it like this all the time?\u201d Nina asked Rosuko as they sat on the subway together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...don\u2019t know...most guys don\u2019t look at me like that. I\u2019ve got out like once as Rose but it\u2019s different. When I\u2019m like that the attention and everything feels really good.\u201d She said looking down at her shoes trying not to be too awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...I...see.\u201d Nina said feeling a bit awkward herself. Obviously she still had much to learn about actually acting like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the rest of the evening setting up Rosuko\u2019s room and even ordered delivery as sat together eating and laughing by the end of the night. Mostly joking about how funny it was during Minato\u2019s change and all of Rosuko\u2019s awkwardness when they were moving. It was the first time Nina started to feel even the smallest bit comfortable with this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt night Nina was barely able to sleep trying to do everything in her power to ignore this strange and unfamiliar new body. She had to to really accept this body as her own yet. After a restless night she was finally able to get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the alarm went off in the morning there was a familiar looking hand turning it off as Minato recognized his male body once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up Minato saw his reflection in his phone as he checked himself letting out a long sigh as he was happy to be himself again. Yesterday had felt like such a weird fever dream almost like a fantasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato wasn\u2019t quite thinking clearly just happy to be himself again. Getting up he was just in his boxers as he went to use the bathroom as he opened the door and suddenly froze...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosuko was standing there in just her bra and panties as he was brushing her teeth...There was a sudden and awkward silence between the two of them as Minato clearly began to realize his mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat proceeded was a very typical anime seen as it looked like Rosuko was hurling everything in the bathroom as Minato squealing as she slammed the door in his face. Minato rubbed his head realizing he lived with a girl now so there was definitely gonna have to be a change how he acted here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the morning awkwardness both Minato and Rosuko got dressed in their school uniforms and got ready to head off to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoo...Umm...after school why don\u2019t we do some Guardian training? There is a special place my mentor showed me that\u2019s perfect for guardians to practice.\u201d Rosuko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sounds good. I still can\u2019t believe this is real. Knowing every time I need to stop a Daemon I\u2019m gonna have to become a girl.\u201d Minato replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was scary for me too. I wasn\u2019t ready for all the responsibility but my teacher showed me how this was a really special calling.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you lost her. I know what it\u2019s like to lose some one special. My parents both died when I was young. It was actually a Daemon attack. When they first started appearing about 10 years ago.\u201d Minato replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosuko looked sad for a moment but soon picked up and smiled and nodded. She obviously wasn\u2019t ready to share more on that subject yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato and Rosuko were crossing the street as Minato looked at his ring pondering things as looked back to Rosuko when all of a sudden his ring began to glow...There wasn\u2019t a daemon as he wasn\u2019t in danger but it was started to glow anyway..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...is it supposed to be....\u201d Minato was suddenly interrupted as his body began to glow as a familiar yet still overwhelming sensation overwhelmed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody else but Rosuko seemed to notice the transformation however as Minato suddenly changed back into Nina right there on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the change was done Nina found herself standing on street wearing a familiar looking female school uniform. It was a white button up blouse with a school crest. A black frilly skirt with black dress shoes with small heels. She was also wearing black leggings as well. Her blue hair was also tied up in a fancy ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina stood there confused and obviously upset as now that she had changed she couldn\u2019t go back until she asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d She cried out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...you could come to the girls side with me? I know the administrator. She is an ally to the guardians as made special arrangements for me when I was chosen. Maybe she can help you to?\u201d Rosuko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe academy they went to while technically co Ed was separated into two halves for males and females. They shared assembly\u2019s and some classes but most of the time boys and girls were separated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean be enrolled into the girls side of school?\u201d Nina said terrified not knowing how she was supposed to deal with that. </span></div></div>",

As if things just couldn't help going from bad to worse. At least no one else was calling him out on this transformation, but it still didn't really feel much better. Seriously, Nina still wasn't used to feeling nothing between her legs, and it felt even more so in this skirt and leggings. Not to mention the small heels on the dress shoes. Were those really necessary for a high school?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, after about a minute, Nina figured that she didn't have much of a choice. Suzumiya High wasn't going to wait forever for her to make a decision, so the quickest course of action was to just follow Rosuko's lead wherever that went. With a sigh and nod, Nina began to continue along the path to school with Rosuko right behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....at least the new route to school is nice,\" Rosuko said shyly with her hands together. \"As you might have guessed by the subway ride yesterday, my old apartment was further away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina actually did smile a bit at that in spite of herself. It was nice that transferring Rosuko's stuff went about as smoothly as one could expect given the short notice of it all. Then again, Nina wondered if she was used to that given how far away her parents lived. Actually, now that she thought about it, there was another matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I don't think we talked about it yet,\" Nina started. \"But what should we do money-wise? I;m on a stipend from the government given my family situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kind of like that, plus my parents sent me a little,\" Rosuko said. \"But, it's probably not going to be a whole lot. As Guardians, we might need more in the future. My mentor always tried to emphasize being prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that makes sense,\" Nina nodded. Guess it was a matter they could figure out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzumiya High was eventually coming into view, a rather normal looking place from the outside all things considered. Though you could clearly tell when students were beginning to break off to one side or the other. Heck, on muscle memory, Nina almost began heading towards the boy's side before Rosuko pulled her back, thankfully no one was the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rosuko!\" called one girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in homeroom,\" said another who gave Rosuko a little pat on the shoulder. Rosuko's face went a little red but she didn't seem embarrassed as she waved a little back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends?\" Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some people I know. I'm pretty well known as the wallflower around here,\" Rosuko smiled a little. \"But they're nice girls, so it's okay. Come on, I'll show you where the administrator is.\"</span></div></div>",

She has been helping us for several years now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Can she tell me why this ring chose me and how to control my transformation?\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...She isn\u2019t a guardian herself. Honestly I don\u2019t really know much about her. My mentor explained to me she is a guide. She will never tell us more than we need to know but is there to help us. She covers for me any time I had to leave school during a daemon attack. She will take care of your transfer here and deal with your old school records as Minato.\u201d Rosuko explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes the door to the office opened as a rather beautiful woman stepped out. She appeared in her mid 30s and had long dark purple hair that was tied up in a tight bun. She had small dark glasses covering her purple eyes. She was very curvy with nice large breasts and great hourglass figure. She wore a very tight dark business suit and skirt with black stockings on and nice black heels. She seemed to have a very strict look about herself in a tough but fair kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on...\u201d She said gesturing Nina and Rosuko inside the office as Rosuko closed the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit....\u201d She said looking over a stack of paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...The ice ring chose a boy huh?

Since you can\u2019t switch back at will I can\u2019t have you showing up here trying to be both Minato and Nina. I\u2019m assigning you to class 1B. Rosuko is next door in 2B. I can\u2019t have you in the same class because of a daemon attack having two girls slip out is too hard to explain.\u201d Miss Osaka said to Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nodded a bit terrified of what she would do if she spoke out of turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere are the rules...You are Nina Mikiyashi. I have your documents here to prove everything you need.\u201d Miss Osaka said handing them an envelope with an ID and other government documents in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRule one...Never tell anybody you are a guardian. Other than myself or Rosuko or other guardians obviously. Rule two...Never use your powers on innocent people. Since this is your guardian form you may be tempted to teach a bully a lesson here....don\u2019t do it...Lastly Rule 3....Never run from a fight. This means if there is a daemon attack you have to respond. It also means you never abandon or run from the fight. Failure to follow these rules will result in severe....SEVERE.... consequences...understand?\u201d She asked Nina with a death cold stare....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am!\u201d Nina said nodding in attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny questions? No....good...now get out of my office....\u201d Miss Osaka said going back to her stack of paperwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina\u2019s head was spinning she still has so many questions but obviously Miss Osaka wasn\u2019t going to be bothered with them right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry...She can be a bit intimidating. However she means well and always has our backs.\u201d Rosuko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I guess I\u2019m off to class....Maybe after school we look for some part time jobs?\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d Rosuko said as they waved to each other before heading to their respect classrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina took in a deep breath seeing her class before her as her eyes suddenly went wide....There was a schedule posted outside the door of classroom 1B. Today it seemed of all days the class was supposed to have swimming lessons later on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Minato he was always a really strong swimmer. However he has no idea how to handle himself in this water as the idea of wearing a skin tight swimsuit in front of his brand new class on her first day almost made her run out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t an option however as the door actually opened for Nina as a very kind looking woman was standing there. She was in her mid 30s with medium length brown hair. She wore a cute yellow blouse and long brown skirt. She had a nice figure but nothing too special but all accounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there..:You must be Nina. I\u2019m Mrs. Susiko. Would you like to come in and introduce yourself?\u201d She asked in a very calm and considerate voice. </span></div></div>",

Not to mention the rather quick meeting with Ms. Osaka. Nina was still surprised she processed everything so fast, giving her a \"new identity\" so to speak and sending her on her merry way. The fact that Mrs. Susiko was already aware of a \"new student\" just made her wonder about how deep this whole thing went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm...Nina Mikiyashi,\" she said, bowing a bit. \"N-Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, she felt like her heart was going to jump out of her chest and that someone was going to call her out on actually being a boy. Thankfully that paranoia was little more than that as she just got a rather typical but not unwelcome greeting from the all-girl classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Nina got a new seat and class began as it typically did on the boys side. Thankfully Nina didn't have to worry about suddenly being behind as those arrangements were apparently being handled as well. Go figure she supposed. The fact that the classes were mostly the same did help her to feel more comfortable with thinking about how the day would go at least. Granted, during the break, she did get the typical questions most people, girls especially, would ask of a newbie. Granted, it wasn't like Nina had to do anything special to fool them since they didn't really interact with her much as Minato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, Nina still had to contend with all the other odd things about being a girl. Feeling so flat down below was one thing, but the huge mounds on her chest was another thing. The E-cups she had clearly put her on the higher end compared to alot of the girls, and a couple curious girls even asked her what in the world she did to get so big right to her face, a bit of envy evident in both of their voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh I don't know, because I was a guy before?\"</i> she thought to herself in a rather deadpan tone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The looks and stares from the other girls was clearly not something Nina was ready for. It was obvious that she was clearly the most busty girl in her class and it seemed she was probably the tallest too. Being around 5\u20199 with solid E cups she was clearly in a league of her own. Most of the girls here were lucky to be 5\u20195 as most were lucky to even have B-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s like a model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s giant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre those even real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did she come from?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese whispers from others girls swirled around the classroom as it was obvious to Nina everyone was talking about her. She tried her best to ignore it and just blend in doing her best to just focus on the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang after what seemed an eternity. This signaled the start was gym or PE. However for the girls their gym today was at the shared pool which was in between the boys and girls side. As Minato he used to look forward to this as he was quite good water volleyball and diving. As Nina however she couldn\u2019t be more terrified having no idea how to act as a girl in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was sweating bullets as she followed her classmates to the locker rooms not ready for this at all. One could swear you could see the steam rising off her as she was totally uncomfortable right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the girls locker room her new classmates were undressing and chatting like nothing was wrong getting naked and laughing as they put their swimsuits on. The ladies swimsuit was a white one piece suit was was tight and hugged the girls in all the right places but didn\u2019t allow for any embarrassing slips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Nina-Chan...Are you gonna get changed?\u201d One of her new classmates said speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Taki. She had bright pink hair and was one of the smallest girls in class. Barely 5 feet tall and had basically no breasts at all and was super skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina stood there terrified surrounded by more naked girls in her life than Minato had ever seen. She was basically frozen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Nina! You are the new one right?\u201d A sudden tough sounding voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearing was the girls swim coach instructor Coach Usami. She looked almost more guy like than girl with a rather butch appearance with short black hair and really oversized muscles for a woman in her early 40s. She wore a tight tank top and jacket with cargo shorts and sandals as she had in a baseball cap and whistle with her along with a clipboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are new right do you have a suit yet?\u201d Coach Usami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina shook her head still embarrassed not sure how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Usami rolled her eyes taking Nina by the hand as they went into her office as she went rolled around for spares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if have one for your....well developed body.\u201d The coach said as Nina stared down at her huge mounds blocking her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere try this.\u201d The coach said tossing her a larger one piece swim suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way out Nina took a deep breath and began undressing as it felt like all eyes were on her. It felt like the whole class was watching as she struggled to squeeze into this skin tight swimsuit....Nina tried her best but it seemed her boobs were just too big.  She could feel the one piece struggling not to tear at her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this won\u2019t do...\u201d The coach said seeing Nina\u2019s obvious discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess there is no choice here. This is a specially made two piece. It\u2019s only available on special request but in your case I think it\u2019s allowed.\u201d The coach said reaching into her locker and pulled out a different suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one was a white two piece bikini with a special made top that was designed for a larger bust. Nina has no choice as she was forced to put it on as this one actually fit pretty well but as a side effect left her body almost totally exposed as she felt like she was posing for a magazine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls in her class couldn\u2019t stop staring as they looked jealous and envious of her obvious sexy body as Nina was bright red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright girls we are doing a co Ed exercise with boys class 1A. Your job is to pick a partner from the other class and practice relay laps together. You each do a lap in the pool holding the floating baton and pass it to them and wait for them to return it to you. I want NO FUNNY BUSINESS! No flirting, and no gossip, you understand?\u201d The coach said as the girls nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina\u2019s eyes went wide. How could this day get any worse? Her class as Minato was 1A. His best friend Riuchi Masako was in that class with him. He had short bright blonde hair and a rather punk style to him but was a really cool guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach gestured all the girls outside as Nina felt almost naked but tried playing it cool feeling her boobs bounce with almost every step...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out into the bright sun the girls began to head over and meet up with the boys class. Minato remembered doing this exercise as a guy. All the guys loved it as an excuse to see the girls in swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the guys and girls began to partner up as it was obvious the guys were all starting to stare at her. Most couldn\u2019t believe how hot she looked as many were getting embarrassed just looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sorry for the all the looks. These guys are real pervs. You wanna team up? I promise not be creep or nothing.\u201d A sudden familiar voice asked behind Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around Nina saw her best friend Riuchi standing there holding the Baton as he was inviting her to be his partner...</span></div></div>",

Either way there wasn\u2019t a clear path forward here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...Uhh...sure...\u201d Nina said blushing as Riuchi smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina went to one side of the pool while Riuchi went to the other. He held the baton on his hands as the coach suddenly blew her whisper as all the boys dove in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object of this relay was for the boys to swim as fast as they could to their female partners holding the baton which was heavy and slowed you down. You then passed the baton to your female partner who carried it the rest of the way. The team that did this the fastest won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiuchi was a strong swimmer and made it so as was taking the lead passing the baton to Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment Nina actually forgot about all this awkwardness. Her competitive drive and spirit started to kick in as she felt that fire inside like she did as Minato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the baton she began to swim as fast as she could as it began very clear that her new huge breasts were a problem here...They slowed her down and made it very clear how difficult it was to swim with them and this heavy metal baton she was holding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she refused to give up and unknown even to her, her secret guardian strength was starting to kick in as she powered through and finish first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the relay there was cheering And a bunch of awkward stares as nobody could believe a girl like Nina could win a swim race like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...You are really fast. We will have to team up next time!\u201d Riuchi said waving goodbye as the classes separated soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina\u2019s heart was pounding but she felt good. She was able to actually get through this without many problems. Heading back to the locker room the girls all changed back to their uniforms as lunch was coming up soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina hoped to share lunch time with Rosuko and catch up on how thing were going. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or at the very least, used enough to not freak out about it. Probably best to just not think about it in all honesty, lest she just feel even more awkward about it. If nothing else, it was good to finally be back in the school uniform which actually covered her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say though, she was exhausted after all of this, dealing with all the attention and whatnot. It'd be good to finally talk to Rosuko and actually have someone to vent to a little bit. And thankfully lunch was after this so she could finally relax a little bit. Granted, as she tried to change, she did have to field some questions from many of the other girls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Nina-chan?!\" Taki jumped up and down in front of her. \"You went so fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you show me how to do that?!\" piped up another girl,, Sayaka from what Nina remembered overhearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your secret?!\" said a brown-haired girl named Miyuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh....it-it's nothing!\" Nina cried out, rushing out before she had to say anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the bell soon rang for lunch, and that at least wasn't much different from the boy's side. Rosuko actually was already waving Nina over, much to her relief. They had a nice spot on the rooftop on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" Rosuko asked as they sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerve-wracking,\" Nina sighed. \"Honestly, trying to pose as a girl is hard enough. Even more so with...how bit I am everywhere. I think I'm taller than even some of the guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can agree with that,\" Rosuko said softly as she was unpacking her lunch. \"I think I'd do a terrible job blending in if I was Rose all day. We certainly hardly fit in as high school students in such forms.\"</span></div></div>",

Rosuko was waiting for her as they planned to walk home together and discuss getting part time jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...how was your first day?\u201d Rosuko asked as they began their walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStressful...I attract way too much attention in this body.\u201d Nina said with a long sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked for awhile just chatting as Rosuko reminded Nina of their financial situation. Unless they could both get some part time jobs it was going to be very difficult to cover their expenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kinda of jobs are you thinking? Fast food, delivery?\u201d Nina asked. As Minato the only job he had was at a restaurant clearing tables about a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure...something simple and low profile would be best. We don\u2019t wanna attract too much attention in the case of a daemon attack.\u201d Rosuko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina agreed as they continued their walk downtown before a sudden hefty sounding male voice called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there...You have to be one of the sexiest girls I\u2019ve ever seen. You looking for any work? We are always in the look out for girls like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice came from a very large and heavy set man guarding the entrance to some kind of club or cafe. Nina pauses for a moment and looked up to the sign and read it as it said \u201cKitty Kat Karaoke Klub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina paused as he remembered this place as Minato. It was a fancy karaoke bar where all the waitresses dress in skin tight mini dresses that resemble different kinds of wild cats. Tiger stripes, leopard prints, cheetah spots, etc. They serve drinks and act as hostesses for the patrons who drink and eat and sing karaoke to their hearts content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato always thought this place was really pervy but at least it was high class and not some kind of seedy strip club. They had rules and standards here at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...thanks...but no...it\u2019s Uh...not my style.\u201d Nina said waving off the bouncer as she tried to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure about that? You can chose your own hours and you wanna know what our girls make an hour?\u201d The bouncer said with a grin as he leaned in and whispered into Nina\u2019s ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina\u2019s eyes went wide as dollar signs appeared in her eyes like true cartoon anime fashion realizing she would never have to worry about money if she worked here. However would her morals allow her to work at such an obviously pervy place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...well...That\u2019s a lot...I do need a job but...well what about my friend and roommate here? We both need a job.\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosuko looked terrified as the very idea of working here scared here...However...The idea did thrill Rose as Rosuko was trying desperately not to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer took a look at Rosuko and began to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry girl. We go got the tall busty types like you. They attract more attention from the guests.\u201d He said in a truly jerky way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was about to write him off and keep moving when she looked back to Rosuko who was standing there fuming...Her cheeks red with anger and jealously as her pale auburn hair was beginning to turn fiery red....Her ring beginning to glow slightly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...Uhh...Rosuko...We should get moving.\u201d Nina said trying to calm her before lost control and blew their cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosuko only realized too late that her emotions were getting out of control as she looked down to her hands and saw her finger nails were bright red and growing longer as she let out a really loud Meep sound as ran around the corner to an abandoned alley way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh....sorry...she is shy.\u201d Nina said to the bouncer as she ran after Rosuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...no...no....not now!\u201d Rosuko said hiding in the alley way trying to stop her change into Rose. Her hair was getting longer and longer by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina found Rosuko hiding in the alley way embarrassed as it was obvious she didn\u2019t have fully control of her own powers either. When her jealously and anger flared up it was causing  Rose to come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosuko couldn\u2019t hold it back any longer as there was a sudden flash of red light in the alley as Rose stood up where Rosuko once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothing had changed to a skin tight red mini dress and heels. Her long fiery red hair was down to her ankles. Her tall and busty body very similar to Nina\u2019s as she stretched standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho does that Bastard think he is?\u201d Rose said all fired up as she grabbed Nina\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Nina asked scared she was going take her anger out on the bouncer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose took Nina back to the jerk bouncer as he looked her up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell damn girl! I didn\u2019t know you had friends like this? Your other friend run off? I guess my offer is too tempting to resist right? So you both looking for jobs?\u201d He said with chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose walked up close to the bouncer pretending to be all sweet and seductive until she suddenly grabbed him by the collar and lifted him up by one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy...yes...yes we are...we are both gonna be the most bad ass servers you have ever had in here! Got that?\u201d Rose said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes....yes ma\u2019am!\u201d The bouncer said terrified as Rose let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina stood there just in shock as she couldn\u2019t believe was Rose was getting them into. The bouncer soon brought them both inside the club as they went into the managers office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Nina and Rose met with the manger of the Karaoke Klub an older man named Mr. Takashi. He looked like the older kind of Yakuza gangster types you didn\u2019t ever wanna mess with in the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take him much to offer them both jobs. Nina was giving a snow leopard mini dress that was white with black leopard spots while Rose was given an African Tiger mini dress that was orange with black stripes. They each had matching heels too. They would show up and work starting tomorrow after school and begin their training as servers and hostesses at the club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina couldn\u2019t believe it...what did Rose get them into? While it was true they needed money and jobs this wasn\u2019t what she had in mind. Rose didn\u2019t seem to care at all, in fact she was excited at the opportunity and looked forward to showing herself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking home Nina looked over to Rose who just seemed pleased with herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you turn back?\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose only laughed. \u201cPlease...I can only turn back at will when the change is voluntary. When I forcefully change like this I\u2019m stuck this way until morning. Kinda like you.\u201d Rose said as they reached their apartment. </span></div></div>",

To have other people looking at me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'll probably get a lot of attention, what with your height and boobs and all,\" Rose actually snickered a bit at that, which only made Nina feel more embarrassed. \"Still, I don't think I'll lose. I'll make so much alone that we'll be set for a looooong time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're optimistic...\" Nina groaned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now there was school, a weird job, and Daemons to fight at some time as well. Talk about life going from unassuming to unbelievable right in the span of a single day. Still, guess she had no choice but to accept it for now, despite the fact that this would mean even more time spent as Nina than Minato. Hopefully she could balance all of this somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in any case, it was probably time to get some schoolwork done before dinner. As Minato, Nina was decently good at that so getting started wasn't hard. Rose found it a little difficult to get going though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said your grades were good?\" Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are, but that's a lot easier when I'm Rosuko,\" Rose sighed. \"I get so fired up when I'm like this. It's a good thing I have so many extra school uniforms with all the ones I've accidentally transformed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, it was time for some dinner. Nina didn't exactly keep a whole lot given only one person lived here until the other day, but she figured she'd have enough for tonight at least.</span></div></div>",

She was wearing just her panties and one her male shirts which fit her like a baggy over sized shirt now which made it a comfy sleep shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was trying to get some sleep ignoring the urges and temptations that came with this female body for now. She couldn\u2019t help but be curious but she decided it was best to ignore anything for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep was normally not something Nina struggled with but soon there came a large and angry sounding noise coming from Rose\u2019s room which made it very difficult...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrouchy Nina stood up and walked over to Rose\u2019s room as she heard cursing....lots of cursing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! God damn it stop it!\u201d Cursing like this kept going on as Nina slid open her door to politely....but firmly...ask her to keep it down....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose I\u2019m trying to....what the?\u201d Nina said frozen as her eyes went wide as the scene she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Minato helped set up Rosuko\u2019s room it was something out of a anime fairy tail. Her room was decorated with small sorts of happy girly things. Flowers, happy stuffed animals, and just about everything sweet you can imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina saw Rose\u2019s room which must have reacted to her changes as it looked like something out of a kinky sex anime now. Lusty red colors, sensual atmosphere, and all innocent decor replaced by rather risqu\u00e9 and sexual designs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose was standing there wearing Pajamas that were obviously made for Rosuko and were obviously too small for her. Staring at Nina they suddenly began to glow as the PJs turned into a very sexy black nightie that showed off her boobs and her bottoms where barely a g string at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina felt herself blush glad she was a female right now knowing if she was Minato this would be even more awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit not again....everything keeps changing.\u201d Rose said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...you okay Rose?\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m not okay! I can\u2019t solve my problem and my emotions keep causing everything of mine to keep changing!\u201d Rose said snapping at Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was a bit taken back at her anger. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem? Is it something I can fix?\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose suddenly burst out laughing. Almost so hard she began to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you can become Minato again right now I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She said laughing so hard she was snorting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was a bit oblivious to the joke as she stood there confused waiting for the punchline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m HORNY! God you have so much to learn about being a woman!\u201d Rose said bursting out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m horny and there isn\u2019t anything I can do about it! As Rosuko I have all this shyness and lent up sexual tension but as Rose it all comes out! My emotions cause my things to react to feelings which is why I can\u2019t get a decent sleeping outfit! I also can\u2019t take care of this myself! That only makes it worse! I need a guy to help me and currently the only guy I like right now is standing right in front of me with a pair of huge tits hanging from his chest!\u201d Rose said blurting out her feelings in a fiery rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina realized the frustration she was having as she also picked up on something....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...you like?\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose realized she may have said too much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...well...not you...Minato...it\u2019s complicated....Rosuko likes girls and has a crush on Nina. As Rose I only like guys and have a thing for Minato.\u201d She said banging her head against a wall in anger and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina wasn\u2019t sure how to take this. She didn\u2019t have any context yet for anything sexual outside of dealing with people looking at her. How she felt was still very much up in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...Listen Rose....I\u2019m flattered and all but maybe we should...\u201d Nina said as Rose held up her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust...go...I get it. Be warned though if I turn into Rose when you are Minato I will try to seduce you. You already gave me the yes I needed. She said with a seductive and kinda wicked grin as she shut her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was confused as to what she meant. It was true her mind drifted off fantasizing about herself as Minato and Rose for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit odd Nina looking down feeling a tightness in her shirt as her face suddenly blushed bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nipples had grown erect and were practically poking through her shirt without a bra on which Rose mentioned her crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first sexual feeling she had experienced as a girl as Nina was bright red with embarrassment. She went back off to bed wondering what the next day would bring. </span></div></div>",

The point that Rose was apparently already into \"him\" and that Rosuko was...well, into girls just made it even more awkward. How in the world was this happening over just a couple days of knowing each other? Did all this sexual stuff have something to do with being a Guardian?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, it was just making her head hurt, and it wasn't too long before sleep came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Next Day</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun eventually rose again, making Minato slowly get up. It took him a while to finally come to the realization that he was a guy again, with everything coming back as it was before. Guess Rosuko was right about that much at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to be me again at least...\" he groaned, smiling at how he could see a familiar face honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, any sense of happiness was likely going out the window soon.

Rosuko was obviously embarrassed as she can\u2019t really control herself when she is Rose. Her room and belongings had all returned to normal in the morning as did Minato but the memories remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting ready for school they headed off to catch the train when all of a sudden both of their rings started to blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh...daemon alert we have to go!\u201d Rosuko said taking Minato by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now?\u201d Minato said not seeing anything yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPortal is incoming any minute! Our rings give us just enough of a warning to prepare come on!\u201d Rosuko said taking Minato somewhere private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found an alley with no one in it as their rings began blinking faster before they were both enveloped in a bright lights as they changed back into their guardian forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however their outfits were battle ready. Nina was now in a tight blue sports bra like top with tight blue booty shorts and heeled boots and blue fingerless gloves. Rose was in a tight red on piece top with matching heeled boots and red gloves. Both of their hair was tied up and ready for combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they changed Rose looked at her ring as she tapped it as a map of the city suddenly appeared like a hologram in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa how did you do that?\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special feature of the rings, only works during a daemon attack. Tells us the location of the portal and the class of daemon expected to emerge.\u201d Rose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClass of Daemon?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...Daemons come in several classes. Class-C is the weakest. Usually about the size of small or medium sized car. They are more of a nuisance than a threat. However they still have to be stopped. Usually a single guardian is more than enough to stop one. Class- B is the most common. They are usually about the size of a city bus and can cause major damage if not stopped quickly. They usually require a pair of guardians to stop and is the reason we always work in teams. Class- A types are the serious major threats. They are usually the size of a small building and can threaten the entire city if left alone. If one of them appears we have to call for back up from the other guardian teams. We also must respond to any of their alarms if one appears in their district. It usually takes four or more guardians to stop a Class A. They are never to be engaged alone!\u201d Rose said in a stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all the types?\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...technically there are rumors of a Type-S. No one can be sure though as there is no official recorded events of one actually appearing. If that ever happens we would have to send out a massive alarm and get every guardian possible to try to stop it. Probably evacuate the city and everything.\u201d Rose said with a bit of fear in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked on her hologram map she saw an image of a portal emerging a few blocks away in the middle of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank goodness looks like this is just a class-C. A perfect introduction into your first battle!\u201d Rose said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? I haven\u2019t had any training yet?\u201d Nina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course...use your instincts...trust your feelings and you will be fine. I will stand by as your back up.\u201d Rose said giving Nina a pat on the back as they rushed off to face the daemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few blocks away a portal emerged in the middle of the street as people abandoned their cars and ran as police tried to escort people away from the scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina followed Rose who took her to the scene as they saw the Daemon emerge from the portal. Similar to others before it a black ink like figure emerged from the portal as it looked like a giant...frog?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was a bit confused as she saw the large black frog looking daemon. It was the size of a small car and It had pure white eyes and even white spots on its black oozy ink like body as it looked around rather harmless for about a minute. It just stood there looking around as if confused as Nina looked to Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose said nothing but waited for the daemon to make the first move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daemon suddenly let out a loud ribbit noise before opening its mouth as a suddenly a huge long tongue emerged from its mouth and grabbed a near by car and with a single pull it pulled the car into its mouth and began to devour the automobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is! Never be deceived! All daemons crave is destruction...some are just slower than others...go for it!\u201d Rose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina had no idea what to do...she honestly didn\u2019t even know how her powers worked yet...following Rose\u2019s advice Nina summoned her strength and charged at the daemon putting all her force into a huge punch As she charged at the daemon and......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fist hit the daemon but it was like punching jello....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daemon\u2019s body just jiggled around not showing any signs of damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh....sorry....?\u201d Nina said with a sarcastic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose just facepalmed as the daemon suddenly got angry narrowing its eyes as it\u2019s tongue shot out of its mouth and grabbed Nina hurling her away like a baseball as Nina went flying several hundred feet crashing into a nearby wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally this kind thing would have killed any normal human. Fortunately Nina was a guardian now. This definitely hurt but no more so than getting tackled in a contact sport. Brushing herself off Nina felt her anger rising as wanted to prove herself now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose stayed out of this fight. Standing by just incase of emergencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina decided to take it up a notch. Time to test her guardian strength. She saw a nearby vending machine as Nina grabbed it and began to lift it up over her head. The thing must have weighed around 600lbs as it felt surprisingly light to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey frog face! You hungry? Eat this!\u201d Nina called out throwing the vending machine with a ton of force at the daemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daemon just looked at vending machine confused as it suddenly leapt into the air dodging it with ease before landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose couldn\u2019t help but laugh as Nina got more frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhysical force isn\u2019t going to work on this daemon! Use your ice powers!\u201d Rose called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how!\u201d Nina called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel the power within you. Feel the ice imagine it coming from your hands. See it in your minds eye!\u201d Rose called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina tried to her best to imagine herself shooting beams of ice from her hands. She saw it...she felt it...she....she could do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confidence rising in her allowed Nina to jump back to the daemon as she opened her palms as icy swirls of energy began to circle her hands. Suddenly two beams of icy energy shot forth from her hands as Daemon was confused at this display and tried to dodge but was too slow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice beams were too fast hitting the frog daemon slowing him down as he loud out a howl of pain and agony as he was slowly frozen and encased in a block of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow shatter him! Finish him off with a mega punch!\u201d Rose called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina used her guardian strength to leap far into the air and used gravity to speed up her fall as slammed her fist into the ice block she made which shattered into a million pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog daemon was now dead...shattered into tons of pieces. However like all daemons was it was defeated it\u2019s body began to turn into a black liquid ooze that soon evaporated and disappeared forever....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was awesome! Good job!\u201d Rose said giving Nina a high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Maybe this whole guardian thing isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d Nina said proud of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did good. Come on, we never stick around after a fight. We gotta head back to school. When you get there head to the councilor. She will give you a note to excuse you for being late for the daemon attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the battle was over Rose was able to turn back to Rosuko but Nina was still stuck like this for now. Fortunately her battle outfit turned back into a school uniform on its own as she made her way to school. </span></div></div>",

Granted, given the Daemon attack, it wasn't something to get really all that upset about. Nina of course groaned that she would have to survive more of this as a girl. Just how long would she have to deal with this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in any case, both of them got their notes from the counselor, something that didn't make Nina feel much better given that stern look she always had. After that, Rosuko waved good bye and went off to her own class, while Nina reluctantly went to her own. Suffice to say, all eyes were on her all over again once she entered. She got a nice greeting from the teacher at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students on the other hand now got even more curious. Being late more often than not meant being near a Daemon attack which meant everyone wanted to know the details. This wasn't a problem while class was going on, but during the break period, a small crowd wanted to ask Nina what the Daemon was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big was it this time?!\" one asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it icky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that Guardians?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like that for a while until class mercifully started up again and Nina didn't have to field questions about it. Kind of made her envious of Rosuko, who explained at lunch that she didn't get harassed in such a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most people don't really say much to me unless they really have to. I kind of just blend in,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky,\" Nina groaned. \"I seriously wish I could at least look like a normal girl when not having to fight....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, there weren't co-ed classes today so at least she didn't have to worry about even more attention.

She remembered what Rose said the other night about her having a crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosuko\u2019s face began to turn bright red as she wanted to speak but could help whimper as you could practically see the steam coming from her ears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ring soon began to flash as Nina smiled as Rosuko let out a moan as her body began to transform turning her back into Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHot damn!\u201d Rose said smiling as she was wasting no time getting into her sexy tiger mini dress and heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...that quick...really?\u201d Nina said with an eye roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on...get dressed. We got pervy guys with cash out there. Let\u2019s show off the good and get paid!\u201d Rose said in an inspiring chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina couldn\u2019t believe she was actually doing this. She got changed stuffing herself into the skin tight snow leaopard mini dress. Her boobs barely fit and a mountain of cleavage was on display. The same was true for Rose but she actually liked it as she was examining herself in the mirror. The heels were difficult to balance on but if she could fight a daemon she could do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the two ladies walked out and began to their first shift together. </span></div></div>",

In fact she loved it. She had no problem bending over and showing her cleavage and sitting next to the Horny guys to take their order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was so embarrassed and shy about it. Her first couple of tries her customers couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her awkwardness. However it almost seemed to help her as her shyness was mistaken for cuteness and it was driving more customers to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the shift both Nina and Rose were exhausted. They both become the two most popular girls there. Rose for her fiery hot temper and sassy attitude and Nina for her sexy and adorable shyness. They both ended up making more money than they anticipated which would cover them for rent no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home both girls laid around tired from the long shift as they decided to call it a night early.

If this kept up, both of them would probably have a healthy amount of saved up money in no time at all. Heck, Rose was already wondering just what sorts of things they could do with the money they got. Nina was too tired to get into that though.

Guess he should be happy at the fact that it wasn't just the bodies that returned to normal, but even clothes and possessions too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, he waited a bit to come out, just to make sure Rosuko was all good.

Just...unpredictable hours. You can get called in at any time.\u201d He said obviously talking about his guardian job but in a way that seemed normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, you really missed out. On the girls side there is a new transfer student. Has to be the most beautiful and sexy girl I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Riuchi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato picked up on the comment realizing he must be talking about Nina as he tried to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? What she like?\u201d Minato asked trying to seem oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally nice but kinda awkward. You know how most hot girls are super aware they are hot? It\u2019s like this one just woke up one morning as a hot girl and has no idea what to do about it.\u201d Riuchi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea....\u201d Minato thought to himself forcing out a fake smile and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes the two friends began walking the mall together just chatting as Minato noticed something off about his ring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was flickering...not shining...not glowing...no signs of a daemon attack...it would flicker for a second then go back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid thing...\u201d Minato thought as long as there was no daemon around he was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Minato didn\u2019t realize yet was that every time the ring flickered something about him changed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was starting at his shoes as the flickers were causing them to look more like flip flops each time. </span></div></div>",

I didn't know you were into that merchandise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? O-Oh yeah....that...\" Minato said, his voice trailing off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, the Guardians were naturally popular among younger people for all they did. It was only natural that there would be some merchandise based on them despite not many people even knowing all that much about them. Rings based on them were actually a pretty popular commodity, mostly among girls but some guys were okay with it too. Minato had seen the toys up close though. Any close inspection would be able to tell the difference between the cheap plastic of the replicas and the real metal of the original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...kind of spur of the moment,\" Minato tried to come up with an excuse, and it wasn't far from the truth. \"They do a lot after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good point. I don't judge,\" Riuchi snickered a bit, being pretty cool with it. With that said though, something caught his attention. \"Ah, here we are. We should see what they got in stock now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere they ended up was a game store that the two came to on occasion whenever they walked around. Both of them loved a good game or two in downtime. Heck, Minato would probably be playing something right now if not for getting wrapped up in all this Guardian business. The store had decent business too, with quite a few people around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to look over here,\" said Riuchi. \"Meet you in a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Minato replied back. Riuchi had a section he always wanted to check out first. You could always depend on Riuchi to check out the RPG's first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Minato kind of wondered through the merchandise, looking at whatever might catch his fancy. Really felt like the first time in a while he could truly relax and just be normal. Funny how everything felt upside down after only a few days since becoming a Guardian. Well, at least he could set that aside for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he looked through the stuff, he couldn't see the ring occasionally still flickering. He felt a little something but shrugged it off as just an itch. He reached back to scratch his butt a bit, not realizing at all that the little flickers on the ring were slowly making it bigger each time, further emphasized by his pants beginning to show it off more.</span></div></div>",

When he sat down in his chair he did notice a bit more cushion than usual but ignored it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movie started Minato let his mind go and just watched the movie enjoying the rather simple story and action the movie offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Minato didn\u2019t realize was his lack of experience and control over his powers meant the ring was acting on instinct trying to match his body with the appropriate situation he was in. It was like a reflex action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring itself saw this situation as what one would consider to be a date. So the ring was trying to turn him female and match his clothes to that if something cute and sexy to match a nice date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the movie his shoes were continuing to change as they soon became nice heeled sandals as his feet were shrinking to match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants had also started to fuse together becoming more of a denim skirt that was also starting to recede up his legs revealing his changing legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until about half way through the movie that Minato finally looked down as his eyes widened.

Ugh how he would have loved to see that on anyone but himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, all the same, he needed to leave before Riuchi saw it. Thankfully the dark theater gave him a little cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...I need to use the bathroom,\" he spoke quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sure,\" Riuchi waved his hand without turning his eyes much. \"Just don't take too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wouldn't be the first time he needed to use the bathroom during a movie, so he thankfully didn't have to explain acting out of character or anything.

Well, whatever the case was, as long as he didn't have to explain anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he made his way out of the theater, sighing in relief. Still, he couldn't be fine for long, since he know could see the ring constantly flickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, cut that out!\" he groaned, trying to stay away from any large groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned as he could feel further changes, such as his butt continuing to grow underneath his skirt, making for an enviable figure. However, with each flicker, his top was now changing, losing much of the hoodie look it had before, becoming much tighter on his slimming body. The sleeves and upper portion were shrinking rapidly too, exposing his arms and collarbone completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, the flickering was really starting to annoy him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off!\" he cried out as he got to a corner of the mall, actually hitting his hand on the ring a couple times.</span></div></div>",

The ring actually began acting up worse than before as the flickers caused more changes to ripple through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis top continued to change. Loosing its sleeves entirely as well as shrinking a bit exposing his stomach and bellybutton. It was losing its color too becoming a pure white as it was soon clear that it was forming into a sexy crop top. Basically a tank top that somebody cut the bottom part off of to expose their stomach and bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...stop it! I need to get out of here...\u201d Minato said to himself frustrated even more now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato looked for an exit but the problem was the physical changes were causing him discomfort and he was going to draw attention to himself if he just left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed a place to hide, then he could just wait this out and leave as Nina and make up an excuse to Riuchi later on why he had to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato tried to think of a good hiding place but when a sudden wave of discomfort hit his stomach he let out a loud groan and just went for the first place he saw, the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was in his discomfort Minato didn\u2019t see he had actually gone into the women\u2019s restroom and his cell phone was laying outside on a bench in the lobby...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the restroom Minato was thankfully alone as he was able to see his lower half have completely feminized. His skirt was even shorter than before and he could swear it was still getting a bit shorter. He even heard a clicking noise as he walked and saw that on the bottom of his flip flops a small heel was forming. His underwear underwear his skirt had even turned into a pair of generic white panties but Minato was afraid things were still changing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato groaned as his hugged his sides again. He felt them popping as his hips were getting wider. His stomach was also getting flatter and smoother as his bellybutton was now visible thanks to the smaller shirt. He could also see his hair was quite longer at least to his shoulders now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was wrong with this change. Unlike before which was fast and simple. This time Minato could feel everything. He had never taken into account just how difficult this process really was or how different his and Nina\u2019s body really were.</span></div></div>",

For one thing, it was the fact that Minato still couldn't really figure out just what the heck this ring wanted with him. Randomly transforming him at the worst possible times, and now taking it even one step further and doing that but slower. The other thing being the full weight of the differences between his body and Nina's. It was like the transformation was making it plainly obvious how different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to adjust his feet a bit as the little heels continued to grow, making him stumble a bit. The fact that he had to deal with heels often now in his Nina form seemed to help with dealing with that. However, the shortness of the denim skirt was really getting to him. Really, it was still getting shorter, and he began to wonder if it was even covering his whole butt now. If it was, it wasn't by much. Then of course, this was this crop top with how much skin it exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...oh.....oooooohh......\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hit with a shortness of breath suddenly, as his nipples got sensitive rapidly and began to poke through his crop top. He knew exactly what was coming, and the fact it was coming in so slowly made it even more pronounced. He took one big breath, and it almost felt like a hiccup as two mounds began to push out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the ring was still flickering constantly, and in addition to his breasts, his hair was now tickling his shoulders and upper back, growing longer before it was suddenly pulled back into a ponytail like it had been often. Minato tried to keep relatively calm through out this, hoping no one else would see this. Perhaps he could just ride out the rest of the changes in here, and then leave easily as Nina. His breasts just had to grow and his face change. Those were the major ones at least. He would be convincing then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...just a little longer....\" he said as another flicker made him breathe deeply again, pushing his breasts out further. The top was clearly changed in a way to accommodate the large bust he would get in time.</span></div></div>",

The problem was as he tried to just power through this a couple of voices suddenly got closer, female voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato realized he had accidentally wandered into the girls room as he had no choice but to bail. While he definitely looked like a girl mostly right now the changes were still happening and he didn\u2019t want to raise suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to leave now heading out of the room not making any eye contact with the other ladies entering the room. Once he was outside he was looking around for an exit when he suddenly realized he had left his phone of a bench...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around frantically for a minute Minato spotted the phone of a bench as it was buzzing as it was clear Riuchi was calling him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face and voice had already mostly changed so he couldn\u2019t fake his male voice his only hope was to turn the phone off for now. Making he way over to the phone Minato suddenly paused as Riuchi was suddenly standing over the phone as he had wandered out into the lobby looking for Minato when he didn\u2019t return to his seat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...hi...I\u2019m sorry...I think this phone belong to my friend, have you seen him? Tall guy, blue hair like yours?\u201d Riuchi said as he picked up Minato\u2019s phone right before Minato could grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato didn\u2019t have a reaction....it was obvious he was enough of a girl to pass as one right now but he couldn\u2019t think of anything to say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...Umm...no. I just saw the phone ringing here when I came out of the restroom.\u201d Minato said barely making it a complete sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh....That\u2019s weird...maybe I should go look for him?\u201d Riuchi said looking around the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato realized something....That phone was probably going to change too very soon. He remembered his phone became a very girly pink model of itself when he was Nina before. If Riuchi saw that it would blow his cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...you look kinda familiar...do I know you?\u201d Riuchi asked a bit confused now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato panicked...not sure what to do at this moment. He needed a distraction and quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...uh...I dunno...Hey I need to return to my movie are you seeing this too?\u201d Minato said thinking the darkness of the theater was the best cover he had right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...uh...yeah. I guess I should too...Umm...I don\u2019t suppose you wanna sit by me? Sense my friend just took off it feels kinda awkward sitting alone.\u201d Riuchi said in a cheesy but kinda sweet way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato realized this for the cheesy date it was but she also saw an opportunity to get her phone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...sure.\u201d Minato said with a smile. Trying to act kinda flirty right now to distract him. Minato saw Riuchi put his phone into his front pants pocket as he went back inside the dark theater and resumed the movie back into his old seat right next to Riuchi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was the ring now saw this as the date bring official as the flickers started coming back as Minato grunted again feeling his changes return....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minato wasn't too surprised as more changes were kicking in, just trying to stay as calm as possible. Her face was completing up what was left, and she could feel her breasts beginning to push forward towards Nina's E-cups. Of course, with the small top, they were emphasized even more, though she supposed it was nothing she wasn't used to by now. Another bulge to her side let her know that her wallet was a purse again as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Nina more or less felt that she was completely changed again, feeling the changes die down. Though, Riuchi would probably notice her for sure now, even in the darkness of the theater. Still, she needed to get the phone back, which was probably transforming as she thought right now. She just needed any sort of break to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the movie seemed to be reaching the peak of its action moments, which were pretty cool to be honest. Riuchi really got into these scenes, leaning forward a little in anticipation. Nina knew full well that he'd be super distracted by this point, so she looked down to see her phone poking through his pocket. With the movie getting louder, it was enough to make her movements a little harder to hear. Honestly, Nina almost wished she could tap into what Guardian powers she had and maybe go a little faster, but she hardly had any grip on that at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly slithered her hand forward, grateful that the phone was peaking out a little, perhaps as a result of it shifting around thanks to the transformation. There was just enough for her to grab the top of it, slowly getting it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just a little more,\"</i> she groaned. Just a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the movie reached a point where the hero was escaping an explosion, and the sound effect from that surprised both Nina and Riuchi a bit, making them jerk a bit and accidentally bonk each other in the head thanks to how much Nina was leaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" both of them cried out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry about that...\" Riuchi groaned a little. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah....\" Nina groaned too, though when she looked down, she noticed she had the phone in her hands, making her a lot happier. Riuchi didn't seem to notice at all, thanks to that little event.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nina very quickly slid the phone into her purse. Her suspicions had been correct. He had changed into a bright pink phone and her name was now on it along with changes to everything else which would give away who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to just relax now, Nina decided to just sit and finish the movie with Riuchi as intended. Then afterwards politely excuse herself and head home. This would make things as least suspicious as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie finally ended and the theater emptied Nina slowly stood up and got up to leave the theater playing things as casual as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to head back to the restroom again. This time it would be natural and maybe if she was lucky Riuchi would just forget her and leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself in the mirror she sighed seeing herself back as Nina fully but even sexier than she was used to. Her hair was longer as her ponytail touched the tip of her very rounded butt. Her tiny top barely contained her huge and perky breasts. The ring had even given her make up as she was wearing a glossy red lipstick along with makeup and eye shadow. She even had golden hoop earrings in each ear. Her finger and toe nails were also painted a bright blue color to match her hair and eyes. Her heels were even higher and her plain panties were now a sexy lacy thong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of rest Nina left the ladies room and began head out of the theater when all of a sudden a familiar voice called out to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey wait!\u201d It was Riuchi trying to catch up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina let out a soft groan wondering how in the world she was gonna lose him without raising suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I\u2019m sorry you kinda took off rather quick there, I never caught your name....hey...wait a sec...we know each other don\u2019t we?\u201d Riuchi said now that the lighting made her clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina thought she was caught now...Riuchi was realizing something was wrong right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwim practice? We were laps partners a couple days ago right? You are that new girl right? Uhh...Nina right?\u201d Riuchi said piecing it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...yeah! I thought you looked familiar too, Uhh...Riuchi right?\u201d Nina said trying to play it off cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...what are the odds? Well, Uhh, thanks I guess for keeping me company for that movie. I guess I should head out....unless...I was gonna get some dinner with my friend but he took off, you wanna join me for dinner? We were gonna hit up this spicy ramen place around the block.\u201d Riuchi said trying his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina knew exactly what this was...It was obviously a date attempt from him. The problem was it put her in a horrible position. If she agreed she would have to continue this charade and make it up as she went along. If she declined she knew Riuchi would tell Minato and everyone else at school about it and Nina would be labeled as a prude at school...</span></div></div>",
