            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The nine-tailed fox, for sixteen, nearly seventeen years now, had been trapped inside the body of a boy. That boy was Naruto Uzumaki of the Hidden Leaf Village. Day after day, he had to remain in a seal, which binded his spirit to the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had been gaining strength, sure. The nine tails had to admit this. However, what did Naruto have to show for it? He may have been a little thicker than he was before, but Naruto's body still was not the body you'd expect to hold a god within. At least, that's how the nine tails viewed himself; as a god. The nine tails couldn't take it anymore. Though he was a bit leery of the idea as it crossed his mind, he would soon be lending Naruto even more of his strength, making Naruto truly a worthy vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had just finished a simple mission around the Leaf before he had the rest of the day to himself. He really disliked doing the small-time jobs. As always, he dreamed that he would get something bigger, more worthy of someone of his power! Still, like it or not, by Konoha's tradition, genin weren't allowed to take higher missions, nothing above a C Rank. Even though Naruto had power that rivaled that of even a jonin, heck, even <i>more</i> than a jonin, it was truly rare for him to be thrown a bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto let out a sigh as he walked down to Ichiraku Ramen for lunch. The smell and taste of the ramen bar always put his mind at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Old man!\" Naruto chimed in as he entered the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\" Teuchi, the ramen store owner, greeted, \"How are 'ya, boy?\" He asked, \"The usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it!\" Naruto said with a grin, sitting down at the stool. As he glanced around, no one else was there at the moment. \"Slow day?\" He then asked, making small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you just missed the lunch rush.\" Teuchi answered, serving Naruto up his bowl. \"We ended up making more than we expected! This one's on the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Cool!\" Naruto smiled, taking his chopsticks apart. \"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his gratitude, he started to dig in, eating to his heart's content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had a few more bowls, before heading on out. \"Thanks again! I'll be back again tomorrow!\" Naruto said as he left the store. He looked down at his stomach, which was bloated out just the smallest bit. \"Oogh... Man, I'm full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto made his way home to relax for a moment. After work and now with a full belly, it certainly made him tired out! As he arrived, he went over to his table to rest for a second. He sighed, rubbing his stomach, and without even meaning to, fell asleep in the chair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nine tails snickered to itself. The seal was still a little loose from previous encounters, so he was easily able to seep his power into the boy, causing what would be great changes within him... Naruto would soon have the body of a god, and all would know that it was this amazing child that held the even more amazing Nine Tailed Fox!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Only a few hours later, Naruto awoke with a surprise, his arms flailing as he awoke! In doing so, he fell backward, out of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What the hell!?\" Naruto shouted, looking down. He took note of his surroundings and immediately knew what was up. \"Oh... I must have fallen asleep...\" He mumbled to himself. He yawned once more, getting to his feet. \"I'm still kinda tired too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood his chair back up, yawning once more. \"Man, I'm tired...\" He said to himself. It was about evening when he returned home, and after his nap, it was nearly pitch black! Thankfully the full moon provided some light...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scratched his stomach which was no longer swollen and filled with ramen. Dragging all his limbs along, he made his way over to his bed and plopped down. Letting out one final yawn, he fell fast asleep, not even bothering to change his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse it!\" The Nine Tails grumbled to himself as he held still. \"I must be more careful... Lest I wake the boy again...\" With that, the beast closed it's eyes once more and continued to concentrate. Gently, he began to release a special energy into Naruto, which would slowly have it's way on the teen's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's sleep went undisturbed for the rest of the night. Before he knew it, he soon woke up from his peaceful slumber. He sat up, and rubbed his face, before looking around his room. As he did, a foul stench hit his nose. Naruto began to sniff around a little to find the source, only to see it was him! His clothes were dirty, and he still smelled a bit from working hard on his mission the previous day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stripped down until he was nude, tossing his clothes in a corner for now. Slowly he made his way to the shower, passing by a mirror as he did. He did a double take, before then moving to the reflective glass. \"Hey there sexy!\" He said with a confident grin, \"Looking good!\" He flexed a little, not noticing the small changes he had went through! His muscles were a little more dense, and he had grown at least a few inches in the night as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot spending too much time, Naruto made his way to the shower, wincing a bit at how hot the water was before his body ajusted.</span></div></div>",

He looked like he had grown a few inches overnight. \"All right!\" he said flexing his just grown bicep. \"See everyone be shocked at my new body!\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n   Afterwards, Naruto put on his clothes. He noticed that they were smaller and tighter, His pants were so short he could see half of his calf. \"Oh well,\" The nine tailed fox thought in his mind. \"I'll get some new clothes later\" Naruto was very chill with his new body, feeling stronger and more powerful than ever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto sighed in relief as the warm water flowed over his body, washing away the grime, dirt and sweat of the previous day and night. He was going to have to make sure to do his laundry later too. No way was he going to lie down in a bed of his own filth! ...Knowingly anyway. Grabbing a bar of soap, the blonde haired ninja began to scrub up his body, getting those areas that wouldn't be cleansed just by good old fashioned hot water. He was still only partly awake, the warm water soothing him and making it harder to wake up then if he had been in a cold shower, so he didn't even notice as something quite...odd happened while he was standing in the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water that had been cascading down over his entire body, soaking him completely, was now only reaching his head and torso area, his lower body becoming completely dry! Somehow, his body was quickly absorbing the water. Even though he was standing directly under the spray, his body was soon totally dry, the water disappearing within his body as soon as it came in contact. It took a little bit for Naruto to notice this. Eventually, he opened his eyes up and looked down at his body. \"Hey, what gives? Something up with the water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over his shoulder. No, the water was definitely still coming out. He frowned in confusion as he looked at his hands. Getting an idea, he turned around and cupped them under the shower head, intending to collect the water in his palms. Much to his surprise, he couldn't do it. Not even a little puddle was forming in his hand. He tired to put his hands on his hips, but his right arm smacked into the wall. \"Ouch! Hey, what gives? I used to be able to do that no problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened as he realized what had happened to him...and what was happening to him! Looking down, he saw his body slowly start to grow larger! His height was slowly increasing while his muscles all bulged and expanded, his shoulders broadening while his back flared out, his neck thickening to accommodate the new size of his torso, his chest bulging out in front of him, heavy, powerful orbs of muscle, his abs popping out row by row out of his once flat stomach. Down below, similar changes were occurring, his thighs thickening to the point that they were rubbing against each other, his calves popping out behind him while his feet grew longer and wider. Even his junk was undergoing a similar expansion, slowly stretching out longer and thicker, his balls swelling to match while his ass grew softer and more muscular, giving them a look that would make a person just want to reach out and smack it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the hell is going on here?!\" Naruto stuttered, confused but not unhappy about his strange transformation. His look of confusion was quickly replaced with a smile as he flexed his arms, watching as his biceps bulged out of his arm. \"Woah! I bet I punch a hole through solid brick with one hit!\" He was going to have to test that hypothesis later. He crossed his arms as he tried to think of what might be causing this. He suddenly took notice of the shower head as his arms brushing up against it, forcing the stream up into his face. Naruto took a step back, stumbling over his much larger feet, and slipping out of the shower, tearing down the curtain with him. \"Ouch...\" He muttered, rubbing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly got to his feet, the bathroom feeling a lot smaller now that he was so much larger. He looked at the doorway and noticed he was eye level with the top of the door frame. He had grown at least a foot or two taller, with muscles to match! He looked over his body eagerly...and noticed he had stopped growing. \"Aw man! What gives? I was just getting into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned and looked around, trying to think of what could have caused this...</span></div></div>",

His hand over his stomach, he looked down, just able to see his thick, burly pecs. He grinned, but it was soon wiped away as he felt the pangs of hunger once again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time to eat!\" He said with a grin. He made sure to turn the water off, and got a towel for his upper body, which was the only part wet! After this, he squeezed out his doorway without too much trouble, and made his way to the kitchen. Of course, he stopped to look at his new physique in the mirror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Nice and big!\" Naruto said, flexing his two biceps proudly. He set his hands on his waist and began to bounce his pecs as he admired himself in the mirror. \"Damn, any bigger and I'm gonna have to shop for a new wardrobe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final statement, Naruto then wandered away from the mirror and to his kitchen. Not even looking, he pulled a random ramen bowl from the box next to his fridge. Tossing it carelessly onto the table, he filled his water boiler and plugged it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Naruto was sitting at the table, a little bored already as he waited for the water to boil. He was idly rubbing his thick, soft pec in his hand, sighing a little as he did. It felt nice, and it was helping him get used to his new body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Naruto saw the water was ready, he stopped messing around and picked up the boiler. Clumsy as ever, he accidentally grabbed the hot part of the boiler, and released it in mid air! The contents spilled out, and onto his chest! Naruto had already flinched, bracing for impact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... But as he stood there, no pain came to him! He opened one eye. Indeed, he had spilled the water, but surverying his body, there was not a drop nor burn on him! Naruto touched his bare chest, all the way down to his thighs, shocked to see not a drop on him! What Naruto <i>didn't</i> see was that he had shot up another good four inches! His biceps bounced out a little more, adding to their impressive size, as well as every other muscle on his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really weird...\" Naruto said, investigating everything. \"I was sure I was gonna get hurt... Guess I'm not complaining though!\" He smiled. Getting up, he got his towel and started to clean up the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his usual ramen breakfast, and a little more growth thanks to the broth, Naruto put on a jumpsuit and started to head out. The top looked like a midriff, showing off the bottom row of his abs, while his once baggy pants now looked more like tight, orange capris. Naruto walked down the streets of Konoha, blooming with pride over his new body!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto ran through time, cutting a path through the crowded village easily thanks to his size. Those who recognized him watched him pass in shock. Just yesterday Naruto had come back from a mission, perfectly normal sized! Now he was at least a foot or so taller and his muscles were enormous! The ridiculously small clothes clinging to his body just helped accentuate his size. Naruto could feel all eyes on him and grinned, loving the attention. He was soaking it up as much as his body was water. \"Oh yeah!\" He thought to himself. \"Check out this hot body!\" He clenched his ass as he ran, his pants hugging it tight. He made more than just a few passerby blush!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this attention was great but Naruto was starting to feel uncomfortable in his clothes. They were just way too small! He was loving his new body but the tightness was starting to get under his skin. \"I need to get some new clothes pronto!\" He decided, turning into the nearest clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store was medium sized, most of the floor space being taken up by racks of various clothes with the check out counter crammed into one corner. The walls were covered with rolls of various fabrics in all colors. Most of the clothes that were sold here were also made here, seamstresses running both sewing machines and needle and thread (for the more delicate work) in the back of the store. As soon as Naruto stepped through the doorway, one of the employees caught sight of him. His jaw dropped. He had never seen a ninja so young with such a large body! The familiar face attached to it just made it all the more strange! Naruto looked around, a slightly confused expression on his face, before he made his way over to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey pops!\" He said loudly, his voice carrying throughout the store. \"I need some new clothes! These are way too small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indicated his shirt which was riding halfway up his torso, his usual jacket which was totally unable to be closed, and his pants which were barely able to reach halfway down his calves. The man looked Naruto up and down and said, \"I'm...not sure we have clothes that will be quite your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned and moved closer to the man, looking down at him with a slightly annoyed expression on his face. \"How long would it take to make me something new in this style?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gulped and said, \"A-About three days! And with the amount of fabric it would take, it would cost quite a bit of money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pulled out his frog purse and opened it up, looking through his cash and change. \"Hmm...Well, I DO need some new clothes right now...Okay! How about this? You start making me some new clothes for my new size and in the mean time I'll buy something around here to wear right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded and said, \"That's fine! Just let me take some measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto held still while the man pulled a tape measure out of his pocket, moving around Naruto's body, measuring his height, arm size and length, leg size and length, waist size and foot size for good measure since Naruto's rather large toes were currently hanging off the edge of his footwear, the tops of them bulging alarmingly. \"Alright, pick something out and then I'll help you at the register.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man scampered off, leaving Naruto to look around the racks for something suitable to wear. Nothing really looked like it would fit him, so he decided to improvise. He grabbed an orange vest and a pair of brown shorts, both of them meant for someone of Choji's proportions along with a pair of sandals that barely fit him. Moving into the changing rooms, Naruto managed to squeeze them on, the vest only coming halfway down his back while the shorts were just slightly too short for him. Naruto looked at himself in the mirror and bounced his pecs with a grin. \"No reason not to show off this awesome body of mine!\" He flexed his arms a bit to test how much give the sleeves had before heading for the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay pops! I'm going to wear this stuff out!\" He said, dumping some cash out onto the counter. \"I'll be back for the rest of the stuff in three days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for shopping...here...\" the man trailed off, Naruto already rushing out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I've still got the whole day ahead of me!\" Naruto said, a big smile plastered on his face. \"Time for training!\"</span></div></div>",

Naruto groaned a little. That quick thought instantly reminded him that he was still a genin. However, his bad mood didn't last as he looked over his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, biggest genin... No, biggest NINJA in the village!\" He said, giving his bicep a cocky flex. As Naruto walked on, he kept getting looks from everyone, which only inspired him to flex even harder! Everyone had to know who the manliest, buffest dude around was! Naruto showed off until the very end, until he was out those gates. He grinned to himself, breathing a little heavy. \"Heh... Damn I'm hot...\" He thought to himself, giving his groin a little grasp as he made his way to the water fall. All that attention really DID get him going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto reached the waters edge, he looked out at the crystal clear water. He let out a happy sigh, living in his memories for a moment. After a quick moment, he made his way to the waterfall, not yet stepping in the water. As he arrived at the side, he stuck a hand in, which was quickly absorbed into his body, shooting him up a few iches, and pumping his body thicker. Naruto just shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold!\" He shouted out. He took his vest and shorts off, leaving him in his tight boxers. After all, as far as he knew, he'd need something warm and dry to wear when this was all done. Naruto chuckled once he had saw how big his manhood had gotten! He gave it a little pat. \"Don't worry big guy, I'm pretty sure you'll get your chance to shine sooner than you think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto immediately hopped over, sitting under the waterfall. But he wasn't for long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the teen's already strong body hit the water, it started to absorb the liquid like a dry sponge! Naruto suddenly rocketed upward, his pecs shooting out from his chest! His biceps exploded from their softball size to basketball... Beachball... Wrecking ball... Soon they were the size of the Epcot Center! His abs were now packed with muscle, even pushing out obscenely from his waist giving him a muscle gut! His legs burst from the boxers, growing like two large trees! Only bigger! His foot became a massive wall that pressed away everything near it! His tight ass were like two boulders that destroyed everything! Naruto's height surpassed that of the hokage house, and then the mountains! He was practically as big as the Kyuubi himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this sudden change caused Naruto to fall over, which thankfully, also got him out of the water. He groaned as he now sat back up. He let out a moan of pain, \"What the heck was that!?\" He asked aloud, his voice booming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto looked around...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had all happened so fast! One second, Naruto had been sitting underneath the water fall, and the next, he was a massive mountain of a man, standing taller than any structure in the Leaf Village...sitting down! Naruto scratched his head, having slight trouble reaching it thanks to his enormous bicep, and looked around quizzically. There wasn't much to see. His enormous body was taking up nearly all of his line of sight. Looking down, he couldn't even begin to see passed his gigantic pecs! He could feel his toes digging into the soft grass, a few trees in the area toppled over thanks to his mighty feet, but actually seeing them was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked over his body, his thoughts drifted from trying to think about what might be causing this abnormal growth spurt, to admiring just how huge he was! He flexed his arms and was almost shocked to see how thick his biceps looked, the tops of them peaking above his his head, pumped full of pure strength. Bouncing his pecs, he smirked cockily as he heard them make a soft *thump!* noise as he worked the slabs of meat, his fingers passing through the crevice between them, his whole hand able to fit between them. He moaned as he lightly touched his nipples. They were erect and more sensitive than they had ever been before. It caused his mammoth cock to twitch, slowly engorging with blood as he kept touching himself. \"Aw yeah...so big...so strong! No one could ever match me now! I'm like a god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snickered as he thought about that. \"Yeah...I'm the new god of the Leaf Village! Who needs to be Hokage anyway? That little stick house couldn't even cover my foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea popped into his head as he thought about that. \"Maybe it's time I paid the Village a little visit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he turned his huge body around, looking over the few miles to the Leaf Village, which was totally unaware of his change. His beyond Herculean frame could no doubt be seen jutting up into the sky, but everyone within the village was too busy going about their daily lives to notice him! He was going to change THAT in a hurry! With a mighty step that shook the ground for miles, Naruto began to make his way to the village. Trees bent and cracked by the dozens under each of his feet, his shadow slowly casting the village into darkness the closer he got. In only a few short steps, the fox boy was looming over the village, his toenails just barely clearing the wall surrounding the village. Naruto crouched down and flicked the massive gates with his finger. The wood shattered like a bomb had gone off inside it, leaving the main entrance in and out of the village completely open. \"Heh...we don't need that anymore! I'm the only security this place needs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe easily stepped over the wall, his feet nearly taking out a few businesses as each mighty appendage filled an entire street plus more. Naruto snickered and leaned over so he could see the tiny people around him better. \"Wow! And I used to think this place was big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Naruto fixed his eyes on the Hokage Mansion and started walking over there. It was slow going since the titan was making sure not to harm anyone or anything. No matter how careful he was, though, his massive weight caused the ground to crack and warp which, in turn, knocked down a few stores and homes. Naruto didn't seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he arrived at the Hokage Mansion. Filling his powerful lungs, he called out, \"Hey! Granny Tsunade! I've got some new rules to lay down around here!\"</span></div></div>",

But after a moment, he noticed there was no answer. \"... Hey Grandma!\" He said, trying to be as insulting as possible. He squatted down peeking through the window. \"Huh... Granny?\" He peered around, his giant blue eye wandering across the room. \"Oh well.\" Naruto stood back up to his full height, stretching a little. \"Guess I'll just have to have a little bit of fun until she gets back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned to face the village. A grin spread across his face once more as he looked down on the people. He certainly had everyone's attention now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, village, listen up!\" Naruto said with his hands on his hips. His full, massive physique was on full display for everyone to see. \"From now on, <i>I</i> am god! Got it!?\" He decreed, bounching his full, powerful pecs as he did, making that thud sound that he so enjoyed, and make some villagers quake in fear. \"Anyone who disagrees...\" Naruto slammed in foot into the ground, making even more damage. Houses cracked, tons of pots shattered nearby. \"Can come tell me themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with that, no one dared to say a thing. Naruto had established his position as the God of Konoha, and no one could dare say otherwise. Despite this, however, there were some who FELT otherwise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... Your god is going to go take a nap, before he thinks of a way you can please him! So prepare yourselves!\" With that final order, Naruto began making his way out of the village, causing endless destruction in his massive wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto found a nice, clear setting for him to lie down in. Patting the ground down a little, he laid down and began to relax. Soon, his rule would begin, and it would be grand...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ninja of Konoha were in trouble. The very second Naruto's colossal body had appeared in the distance and eventually arrived in the midst of the village, everyone knew dark days were ahead. Naruto had proven through the years to be a trustworthy and powerful ally for the Village Hidden in the Leaves, but the villagers also knew him as a trouble maker, a trickster, and a bit clumsy to boot! He had demonstrated these qualities by nearly leveling an entire section of the village without even meaning to...and then damaging a whole city block worth of houses and businesses on purpose! Looking at his massive body, with muscles bulging out of every inch of his body, it was clear that Naruto had somehow managed to make himself exponentially more powerful than ever before! It was clear that the gigantic fox ninja had a very good reason to call himself a god and claim his rightful place as ruler of the village...but that didn't mean anyone had to like it! Those closest to Naruto, his friends and comrades, and teachers both new and old, all agreed that Naruto would be a worthy ruler, if not a bit over zealous. However, they made up only a small portion of the village. Countless others respected Naruto and knew him to be a good person, but didn't feel safe in his rule. It was these ninja that were banding together to DO something about this hostile take over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all of their efforts soon proved entirely fruitless. They started small, attempting to stab him with kunai to see if it would have any effect. They might as well have been trying to stab steel with all the good it did! The sharp blades merely ricocheted harmlessly off of Naruto's incredibly tough skin. Next, they tried bombs. They attached an entire row of them all over Naruto's chest before detonating them all at once! When the smoke cleared, Naruto merely scratched at the thick slabs of muscle in his sleep, not so much as a blemish visible on his godly body. Losing heart, they tried to feed him poison. Not enough to kill him, but weaken him to the point of incapacitation. Naruto gulped down gallons of the stuff, which only resulted in him belching up a cloud of noxious gas. This cleared the area of ninja and made it quite clear that they were not going to be able to harm Naruto. Fire, wind, water, none of the elements had any more success in touching him. It would no doubt take an equally massive ninja, on Naruto's level or above it to even be able to wound him. The village was just going to have to deal with their new ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, after napping for a few hours, stretched and sat up, his back crackling slightly. \"Man...I'm going to need to find a softer place to sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled himself up to his feet, stretching his limbs until he felt fully awake. With a cheeky grin, he made his way back to the village. He stepped back in front of the Hokage Mansion and called out in his booming voice. \"Alright you runts! The reign of Naruto Uzumaki the Great begins today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few people groaned and rolled their eyes at this statement, but none who were in view of the teen himself. They probably wouldn't have lived to see the first second of Naruto's reign had he noticed them. Naruto cracked his knuckles, the sound like thunder, echoing around the village. \"So! To kick off my new reign, I'm going to get rid of everything that reminds people of the previous eras!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few whispers broke out. Just what was he getting at? In answer, Naruto lifted up his enormous right foot, and brought it crashing down on the mansion, shattering it into thousands of pieces, the once proud structure now nothing more than a pile of rubble and splintered wood. \"Aw yeah! First one done, one more to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gleefully stepped on the remains of the mansion, grinding it into the dirt, before standing in front of the Hokage Mountain. He bounced his pecs and quickly put his hands together. \"Sorry dad...\" He muttered to one face in particular. \"But you had your time! It's all about me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, he pulled back his fist and slammed it as hard as he could into the center of the mountain. A terrible cracking sound filled the air as lines radiated out from Naruto's fist, covering the entire mountain. Naruto smirked and gently flicked the Second Hokage's representation, the entire mountain crumbling into dust and rubble. Naruto turned to face the village once more, his hands at his hips, his whole torso heaving with excitement. \"You all got that?! There's no such thing as a Hokage anymore! Now there's only Naruto Uzumaki, the God of Konoha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers all broke out in a nervous applause, shaken to the core at the demonstration of Naruto's strength. He hadn't even broken a sweat! In fact...he had done such terrifying acts of destruction without even applying any effort! Truly Naruto was a formidable force to be reckoned with! Things were definitely about to change in the Ninja World.</span></div></div>",

Naruto was not a fantastic leader, but under his rule, no enemy ninja could dare to hurt the village. Any who tried left one of two ways. Injured, and instructed to warn their village, or in a body bag. Or at least, what they could scoop into the body bag. When Naruto was done with them, they were little more than pancakes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord soon spread not only across the Land of Fire, but to other nations as well! The Land of Wind, Earth, Water, and Lightning, not to mention all the smaller nations as well! They immediately realized that with Naruto behind them, it could only be a matter of time before THEIR lands were also conquered, and forced to be enslaved to the gargantuan teen. What made it all the sweeter was that no one, not even Naruto himself, knew how the teen had got so big in the first place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were letters constantly sent to the various Kage of the land, making sure none of them ended up in possession of Konoha. The great minds of the land began to collaborate in secret, trying to think of a way to match this behemoth's power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, all the while, remained ignorant. He taxed his people, demanding foot massages, and incomprehenisble amounts of food to fuel his massive body. He only got what water was needed, which resulted in minimal growth, which went on unnoticed. The village, safe as it may be, was starting to go into poverty. Those who were once trusting and willing to serve Naruto were begining to falter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Great Nations had soon devised a plan. They had created a warrior pill that would give the user strength hopefully beyond that of Naruto. It's effects would be temporary, giving them only about three day's worth of power. Doing so ensured that another \"Naruto\" would not arise! They had to give this pill to someone who they could trust. Someone who was good with control...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Naruto was back at the village, stuffing his face. \"Keep it coming!\" He demanded, shoving handfulls into his mouth. His voice booomed over the village. Whatever he said, everyone immediately knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... This is perfect...\" The Kyuubi though, as it dwelled within Naruto. \"They all see who is god... Now they all see who is the superior lifeform! I shall take this boy and make him the most perfect being to ever exist!\" The demon fox laughed triumphantly, Naruto going on unaware. Everything, for Naruto, was uphill from here... Or so they thought...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Little did Naruto know, complacent as he was in his new place as ruler of the greatest (and most impoverished, ironically) nation in the world, the leaders of the other Great Nations had discreetly developed a pill that, in the best case scenario, would be able to give a single ninja the same power as Naruto, boosting them up to a height and weight sufficient to topple both Naruto and his enormous ego. They were lucky that most of the ninja in Konoha, including those who had supported Naruto in the beginning, were willing to turn against their god like \"protector\" and jumped at the chance to take him down. Several candidates were screened for their abilities and their relationship to Naruto. They didn't want anyone to have a change of heart when confronted with the idea of having to hurt Naruto in the process of capturing him so they immediately disqualified all those he was in contact with on a daily basis. However, they wanted to ensure that the candidate also was close enough to Naruto that he would trust them and that they would know his fighting style if it came down to a brawl. One by one, they had narrowed down possible candidates until they were left with one. They had sent a messenger ninja to deliver the pill and it arrived within a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji gripped the pill tightly in his hand as he ran to where Naruto was currently lounging, stuffing his face with enough food to feed several hundred people, a nervous tremor in his step, but a determined look on his face. His family had been suffering greatly from Naruto's food consumption. The Akimichi's all consumed great quantities of food in order to be able to use their Expansion Jutsu. With Naruto demanding such large portions for himself, many of the lesser members of the clan had gone without food, greatly weakening their family as a whole. The very idea that not only was his family going hungry, but many others in the village as well spurred him on to take down Naruto once and for all! He had been chosen not just for his relationship to Naruto but also thanks to his techniques. His body was already used to growing many times its size, not to mention fighting while giant. These were valuable assets for the coming mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was a few yards away from Naruto, his enormous foot blocking an entire street in front of him, Choji popped the pill in his mouth and crunched down on it, swallowing it after chewing it a few times. Almost immediately he felt an incredible amount of chakra get released into his body, filling him with untold amounts of power. His body quickly began to grow, not only taller, but more muscular, his biceps bulging and tearing apart his sleeves, not even his super stretchy Akimichi brand clothing standing a chance against his rapidly increasing body. Choji let out a primal growl as he shot up two feet, then five, then ten, then twenty, his clothes practically exploding off his body, leaving him as naked as Naruto. His hips began to crash into the buildings on either side of him, his chest swelling out in front of him, his belly still has thick and bulbous as ever, though it only made him look more powerful when combined with his rippling back, ripped chest and arms, and massively built legs. Choji grinned as he looked down at himself, smacking his enormous belly with glee. He was starting to enjoy this new size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the Great Nations that had developed the pill, Choji's body had broken down the chemicals in the pill that stimulated this enormous growth and was now swiftly developing more of them, effectively ensuring that Choji would not only grow to a massive size (and continue growing at a constant, if slow, rate) but never return back down to his normal height. The plan had already backfired spectacularly, but no one would know until after Choji defeated Naruto...if he could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the now gigantic Akimichi teen grinned as he looked down at Naruto's sleeping form. He had apparently passed out after gorging himself. This was an advantage Choji couldn't pass up! He quickly began making his way over to Naruto, the villagers watching with bated breath to see how this would all turn out.</span></div></div>",

It was a deep sapphire blue color and pretty much a perfect sphere. He tossed the pill into his mouth and swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Naruto said after a few minutes of nothing happening, \"I guess they don't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to take the bag with him anyway, stuffing it into one of his pockets before walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned around to go back to his walk, his stomach growled loudly. Naruto placed a hand on his stomach and decided to head back home for a bowl of ramen. He raced back home, locking the door, and quickly made himself a hearty dinner (if you can call eating ramen three times a day hearty). Minutes later and the bowl was empty. Naruto patted his now full stomach and leaped into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, and Naruto emerged from the bathroom in a veil of steam, a white towel draped around his waist. He walked over to the mirror and stared at his lithe and limb body in the mirror. He frowned a bit as he flexed his almost non-existent bicep. If anything, couldn't that pill have at least added a little bit of muscle? He stood there a few minutes more before he felt a tingling sensation flow throughout his entire body that quickly turned into a searing pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood there as he watched his body transform in the mirror as his body began to erupt with muscle. His pecs burst out from his chest as two slabs of marble emerged under his skin, creating twin shelves that stuck out from his once thin torso. His abs poked out from his stomach, one by one until eight solid balls of muscle stood out as the space between them grew deeper and deeper. His back surged outward, bringing his growing arms further and further away from each other. Naruto grimaced through the pain as he watched his arms expand to unimaginable sizes. His forearms thickened up and became as wide as two bowling pins. His bicep swelled with power, climbing to a massive peak that put his head to shame. Beneath them, his triceps were falling to the ground, making his arm look even bigger than before. Meanwhile, his shoulders were becoming obscene, rippling with untold power and strength. His lats spread like wings, pushing his arms up and into a 45 degree angle. ear his head, his neck was now thickening up as well as being swallowed up by the growing traps and muscles around it. Down below, his feet and legs were trying to keep pace, thickening and widening, swelling and bulging as they grew closer together. Naruto's towel was being strained to it's limits by not only his two legs, but a third that was quickly and happily dropping down, stopping just short of the hem of his towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed as he watched the transformation stop, leaving him a muscle-bound freak of a ninja. He could no longer see his sides in the mirror as he was now almost as wide as he was tall. He flexed his arms as watched in awe as his biceps soared past his head and above his clenched fists. He reveled in the power and strength and pondered what to do next. Would he take another pill? Or should he go out and show off his new musculature?</span></div></div>",

The Hokage had ordered many procedures in perpetration for the fight with Akatsuki.  Special teams had been assembled to respond to threats, and others to conduct research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe research group had not shown much progress, so the Hokage decided to \"motivate\" them when she punched out a table that contained everyone's lunch.

Things were behind schedule because the subject of their test, Hatake Kakashi, wasn't just late, he passed late 30 minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout then, one of the team decided to vent their frustration \"You would think a top Jounin could keep better time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind them they heard the voice of the ninja in question \"sorry, I was helping someone open pickle jar, then I realized there was a cat stuck in a tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that doesn't make any sense.\"  Kakashi just stared at him blankly, he never explained his reasons and he wasn't about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, can we just get on with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just run through what you have planned one more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, this is essentially the combination of two techniques, both of which I think you have seen before.  The first is a chakra draining technique, except in this case we will be reversing it and sending the chakra in to you.  In order for your body to be able to compensate for the added chakra, we have modified it to also transfer some of the body's base-strength and muscle tissue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't that be detrimental to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at this level, about 2%.  Our chakra levels will be back to normal, and we will be able to rebuild the muscle tissue over time, so on our part there will be no long term repercussions.  The second technique is the Hokage's strength technique, it will be applied before the transfer takes place. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which accomplishes what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the purpose of your body, the drained strength is just that, so by inflating it with the Hokage's super strength, the boost to you will be much greater then it otherwise would be.  Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, no.  But don't let that stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... well you heard him, everyone in to position and begin transfer technique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, one last thing.\"  Kakashi had the full attention of the research team as he leaned forward, and pulled up his headband to display the Sharingan eye.  \"Don't mess up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since the silver haired Jounin had arrived, the research team got a small glimpse of the ninja behind the fierce reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo members of the team were in place in front of Kakashi and two behind.  It was then someone should have realized a variable that no one had considered before: Kakashi's Sharingan .  It was active and memorizing the technique, this had been expected, and part of the reason Kakashi had been chosen.  But even though  he wasn't using it to perform a genjutsu, there was still something, distracting if not mezmerizing about seeing it up close.  To researchers, it was easy to get distracted by theories when you see something knew.  Which is why they missed the cut-off point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi was distracted by the actual procedure, and wouldn't know when they were supposed to stop anyways.  The other two members of the team tried to get them to stop, but they were too lost in thought, and light headed from already going too far.  So the unaffected pair did the only thing they could think of and went to grab the two that were continuing the procedure.  Which only caused there to be something resembling a complete electrical circuit, and now the strength of all four members was being drained in to Kakashi, who still was too caught up in what was happening to him to pay any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Kakashi, it was easy to get lost in what he was feeling.  At first there was just a twinge of pain as his body began to restructure itself, then the process of his muscles growing felt like the best workout of his life.  He could feel as the building muscle pushed his arms outward his defined biceps become bigger then what you would ever see on a ninja, but not so big they would impair his range of motion.  His body was taking a unique approach to maintaining it's efficient and increasing build.  He was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis original hight was 5 feet, 11 inches with an athletic build.  Within the first minute of the transfer he was up to 6'6\".  His body kept pushing outwards as his traditional dark blue outfit was stretched to it's limits trying to hold him.  At 6'8\" the sleeves of his shirt were only covering his biceps.  At 7' they began to tear.  at 7'6\" his pants were ripping along the seems.  At 8feet his pants resembles shorts and his vest was beginning to feel the pressure.  At  9 feet he sleeves were out of the way and his former pants were loosely held together cloth at mid thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stopped growing at 10ft, there wasn't much left of Kakashi's cloths.  As he became more aware of his surroundings he noticed two things: 1) the researchers all appeared to be passed out, and 2) his mask was gone.  Clearly with this situation being unacceptable, Kakashi took what was left of his shirt and made a make shift mask out of it.  Then he went to check on the researchers.  They were all breathing, and their bodies showed the side effects of the draining process.  Instead of an average to slim build there skin was very loose on their thin bodies.  Kakashi guessed that approximately 50% of their strength had been drained in to him.  They should survive, but unless the process was reversed, which would not be deemed too dangerous, Hatake Kakashi was stuck being at least twice the size of any other ninja in the village, and most of the known world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>On the bright side</i>, he thought to himself, <i>at least I should be strong enough to beat Akatsuki now.</i></span></div></div>",

Their recent movement were how Konaha was able to get any information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news about this is that Akatsuki would be divided so in a worst case scenario Kakashi would only have to fight against 2 at once (although with their ego, goading them in to 1 on 1 fights should be easy).  The bad news is this could make them harder to find.  Since the best he could do was chase rumors, Kakashi wouldn't even know who he would be up against until he got there.  With the thinning out of Akatsuki's ranks, that left the possibilities as: Itachi, Kisame, Pain, Konan, Zetsu, and Tobi(Madara).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck, or possibly bad luck, would have it, the first ones he had managed to track down were Itachi and Kisame.  Thanks to Kakashi's dogs, he had advanced notice and was able to stop before encountering them and come up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at 20ft, attacking them head on presented a significant risk.  On the other hand, he could use his modified version of the new jutsu to try and drain their strength in a sneak attack.  The downside of that is he could be discovered, allowing them to get the first attack in, or he could be successful and get even bigger which would make it harder to sneak around tracking the rest of Akatsuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither plan had the potential to work or fail about equally, so weighing the consequences Kakashi decided on the best course of action.</span></div></div>",

It had been bad enough after Orochimaru's attack, now they had to clean up after Pain's assault which had done far more damage.  Oh sure everyone was grateful for the lack of casualties, but no one was looking forward to all that construction work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially not Yamato, after his first display of using his jutsu to get a lot of work done with a few hand signs more and more people were looking to him as if he could magically rebuild the village.  It took effort, and chakra, and effort, and time, and effort!  No one was even giving him respect for his work, they just thought he would drop whatever he was doing to come help with their project.  Which goes a long way  towards explaining why he had snapped at the ANBU messenger that had woken him up from a well deserved nap.  It took a lot of Yamato's skills to sneak away just so he could get a small break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ANBU gave him a scroll, and a message from the new Hokage, Danzo.  The message was simple and to the point \"Test the jutsu on this scroll outside of the village.  I want it done in the next few hours.\"  When Yamato had looked up to question the ANBU, the figure was already gone leaving him alone with the scroll.  Even if Yamato didn't like it, Danzo was the hokage and he was obligated to listen.  The keyword was listen, not trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato quickly made his way to find someone he did trust, Hatake Kakashi.  He opened the scroll for them to inspect the jutsu, hoping they could figure out what Danzo wanted.  After a brief analysis Kakashi said \"well, there are some parts that look familiar, almost likes it's a combination of techniques.  What the final result would be I can't say, but it looks like the basic effort is to boost your chakra many times over.   I would guess Danzo wants to use your jutsu to rebuild the village quickly in an effort to make himself look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato frowned, he couldn't pass this up if it meant helping the village, even if that meant making Danzo look good.    \"I guess there really isn't any choice.  Here, take the scroll in case anything goes wrong, and you might want to put some distance between us as well.\"  Kakashi nodded while receiving the scroll, then jumped off to what he decided was a safe distance.  Lifting his headband to expose his SHARAGIN eye, Kakashi analyzed the jutsu while Yamato performed the hand signs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finished forming the signs to release the justu Yamato felt a jolt go through his body.  He was stiff right after and wondering if this was going to kill him.  It was followed by a wave of pain that he was sure would kill him, then all of the sudden it relaxed.  He watched the ground move further away as he stood upright, except he was already upright and it was still moving!  Yamato was too stunned to even say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was growing bigger!  He watched his boots push away loose dirt as they pushed outwards.  He watched as trees around him were starting to look a lot less big then they used to.  Then he felt something different, a pressure all around his body.  He looked at his arms and to his further shock, his muscles were growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato watched as his biceps swelled up with power.  His sleeves went from being loose, to bunching up around the peaking muscle, to skin tight, to ripping away.  He moved his arm in disbelief, they were at least 2-3 times larger then they used to be.  That was just in proportion to his body, by now just one of his biceps might be as big as a normal person's head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the same pressure on his legs, the process repeating itself.  Large and powerful legs quickly broke free.  His pants were torn to tight fitting shorts, Yamato nearly sighed in relief when his legs were free.  Now he was feeling a tightness on his chest, and by now it was no surprise what was happening.  His chest was moving outwards as it filled with more and more power.  Likewise his back was toning and filling up with muscle.  Tears started forming everywhere in the black fabric, offering brief glimpses at the still expanding muscles beneath.  His growing muscles eventually overwhelmed the shirt leaving his sculpted upper body on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato looked himself over in disbelief.  By the time he finished growing he was at least 100 feet tall, and his muscles swelled with power like never before.  He flexed and touched every muscle as if to try and see if this had really happened to him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing tall above the village the only thing Yamato could think of was \"well, that was unexpected.\"  He looked around, locating Kakashi moving towards him with a great deal of hesitation.  Yamato certainly could understand that, he would probably be hesitant too.  For now he took the time to analyze the changes that had occurred to him.  Physically speaking he never felt better.  While the remains of his clothing were less then desired, he couldn't help but note he looked pretty good without a shirt on now.  Otherwise, Yamato was feeling relatively normal, maybe a little more refreshed, like he had tapped in to a new reservoir of chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Kakashi had arrived at his feet, Yamato was amazed.  The man he respected so much was not even 4 inches tall to him in comparison. Yamato carefully knelt down so that he would be able to hear Kakashi, who backed up at first when Yamato moved.  Then Kakashi came closer, \"how do you feel?\" Even though he was so small Yamato thought he heard a bit of concern in the other man's voice when he asked that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato paused to consider his answer then said, \"To tell the truth I've never felt better.  Before I was exhausted, now I feel like I recently woke up from a nap.\" His muscles unconscionably twitched from time to time, which was just serving to show them off all the more.  \"It doesn't even feel like I used any chakra, if anything it seems like I have more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new information in mind, Kakshi reconsidered the jutsu.  It appeared to somehow draw on outside chakra in order give an sustain the user's new size.  If it was up to just their internal supply any ninja would quickly burn through it and shrink back down.  Since Yamato wasn't feeling any weaker though, either the amounts were minuscule, or it was drawn in from nature itself similar to Naruto's Sage energy.  Which would effectively mean there would be no way to shrink down a giant.  \"Why don't you do a simple test, like reforming a segment of the wall to see the difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato nodded then stood back up.  He walked to the edge of the village and looked to his left, and then his right.  Everything looked so small to him now, that if he made something in proportion to his size it would completely overshadow the village.  With that in mind he plotted the new structure he had in mind, performed his hand signs and then struck the ground.  The frame for the new wall burst quickly from the ground, in no time reaching the height of the former walls.  To an onlooker it seemed like the walls were spreading outwards continuing all the way until they had circled the village.  In no time at all Yamato had done at least half the work of restoring the village wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up again to survey his work, and then survey himself.  While his earlier efforts had taken quite a strain on his body he felt like he hadn't done anything more complicated then forming the chakra to stand on water.  In other words, he felt pretty good.  Kakashi had moved to stand on top of the new wall, making it a little easier on Yamato who could now sit down next to it and speak to his friend.</span></div></div>",

The hospitals needed a few more herbs, although some of these plants Kiba never even heard of before! Like Agig Root, or Nagit Leaves... Such strange names... Kiba never expected such things to exist! They almost sounded as if they were something out of a child's fairy tale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba was walking, he didn't even see as he and another crashed into each other, forcing Kiba to drop the bag, its contents spilling onto the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, you dumb dog!\" Naruto barked, rubbing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Why don't YOU watch it!\" Kiba snapped right back. He immediately began to gather up the plants, dusting them off. Naruto then stood up, and dusted himself off. He snickered as he looked down at Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, they still got you running errands, dog boy?\" Naruto asked with a cocky smirk. Kiba just glared back up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one to talk! You're still a genin!\" Kiba said, feeling sure that his comment would be enough to win the argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Does just any genin get to take on a B rank mission?\" Naruto replied back. Kiba could almost feel this air to Naruto, some kind of swagger, if you will, that reeked of superiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell you did! What are you doing!?\" Kiba shouted back, finally getting to his feet with everything picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pulled an official paper, signed by Tsunade herself, stating that Naruto was going to be protecting a young member of the land's royal family. \"Sh-Shit...\" Kiba mumbled almost quietly, but Naruto was able to hear. It brought such a grin to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! Who's a stupid genin now?\" Naruto laughed, walking off triumphantly. Kiba was steamed. There was nothing else he could say! He let out a big breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... Wait... He'll get his...\" Kiba thought to himself. He continued on his way, up to the Leaf's Hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba entered, he looked around, trying to find where the herbs would be delivered. \"Oh! You!\" A doctor waved from behind the desk. \"You have the fresh medicine, yes? Please, follow me!\" He said, walking out from behind his position, and guiding Kiba off to another wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived, Kiba took note of how the doctors started to look less medical and more research. \"Hey...\" Kiba said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? What is it?\" The doctor asked, looking back at Kiba as he led him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to use these for anyway? I've never even heard of half of these things...\" Kiba then asked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... You'll see.\" The man replied, a sneaky smile on his face. As they entered the next door, they saw what appeared to almost be some kind of lab. \"Here we are... Research and development. Where we're always trying to find cures to diseases!\" The doctor announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was looking all around. There were strange machines he had never seen before, and various people mixing chemicals of colors one would only see in their dreams!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What are these for then?\" Kiba asked, holding up the back. The docor then took it, smiling at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are going to help us solve the problem of muscle loss!\" He said, \"Some disease, and even some ninjutsu can cause the deterioration of muscle! With these, we should be able to counter it, and help muscles grow back, and grow stronger than ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...?\" Kiba tilted his head. He hadn't really heard of such a thing, but then again, he was no medical expert either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your help, boy!\" The doctor said, \"I'll let you see yourself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba turned, and began to walk away, heading out to report back to Tsunade.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The doctor was really excited...a bit <i>too</i> excited in Kiba's opinion. There was enthusiastic and then there was just plain WEIRD. Kiba half expected to see some guy wearing swirly eyed glasses with wild hair cackling about some experiment while lightning flashed in the background. He stopped walking towards the exit and blinked. \"Man, I've got to stop watching those late night monster movies...\" He muttered to himself, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to reach the door, something on the corner of a table caught his eye. He turned and saw a strange glass vial filled with green liquid set carefully in a rack. Strangely, despite the rack having spots for at least nine other vials, it was the only one there. Curious, Kiba walked over to it and, after making sure no one was paying attention, grabbed it. He turned it over in his fingers, examining it. It was sealed shut with not only a sturdy looking cork but also a fair amount of wax, holding the cork firmly in place. A piece of masking tape been wrapped around the small glass tube, hastily written black letters scribbled on it proclaiming: EX. 001. It didn't really look any more special than any of the other vials full of colored liquid scattered around the lab, so why was this particular one singled out? Kiba shrugged and was about to put it back when he remembered what the doctor had said. They were developing a chemical that could...uh...reverse muscle...something...deter...deterioration! That was it! In other words, they were making something that made muscles grow! Kiba grinned as he closed his fist around the vial. There was a <i>very</i> good chance that this was that same chemical! Kiba was not a scrawny weakling by any stretch of the imagination. His body was as toned and fit as any other ninja around, more so in fact when compared to several of his ninja brethren! But how could he let an opportunity like this pass? Why just settle for athletic when he could be more? Kiba could just imagine the stupid look on Naruto's face when he came back form his mission to find Kiba totally jacked, his pecs barely contained by his net under shirt, his biceps bigger than melons, his abs so rock hard that Naruto would hurt his hand just trying to punch it, his legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked down and noticed that he was starting to sport a pretty sizable tent in his pants. The possibilities of having that kind of power was really turning him on...That pretty much settled it. He pocketed the vial and quickly left, hoping that no one would notice the vial was missing until it was already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog ninja was eager to get back home and try out this chemical, but he had a duty to perform yet. He had to report to Tsunade that he had completed his mission. He quickly ran towards the Hokage's Mansion, hoping to get this whole thing over with as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba made his way to the Mansion, a young intern doctor who was just getting started today, was desperately searching for the vial that Kiba had stolen. He had a frantic look on his face as he tried to find where he had placed it. He had made sure to put it someplace where it wouldn't get lost but the rack he had left it in was now empty! \"Oh man...\" He thought miserably to himself. \"If I don't find that sample I'm going to be in big trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy! Where is the vial?\" The head doctor called out. He made a habit of never remember anyone's name. If you were lucky, you got a nickname. Otherwise you were just \"Boy!\" or \"Girl!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't find it sir!\" The intern admitted. \"It seems to be missing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missing?! Egads boy! Do you understand how important that vial is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect sir, this is my first day! If it was that important why was I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence you ignorant twit!\" The doctor shouted, smacking the boy across the face. \"Just find the vial!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, you promised you would stop doing that to the interns...\" A female doctor said, quietly admonishing the head doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! I'm surrounded by insubordination and incompetence!\" The doctor shouted, stamping his foot. \"This is the culmination of my life's work and you all act as though it was a baking soda and vinegar volcano! That vial was the first and currently <i>only</i> dose of my muscle restoring chemical! We haven't even performed any tests on it yet! If we don't find it then all of this will be for nothing!\" He grabbed a lead pipe and started smashing things indiscriminately. \"Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, please calm down! Remember your blood pressure!\" The female doctor shouted, chasing after him with a needle. \"Someone hold him down! I have a sedative!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, Kiba groaned as he exited the Hokage Mansion. Tsunade had forced him to fill out a bunch of paper work relating to the roots and leaves he had gathered, so that the Nara Clan (the roots and leaves had been gathered on their property) would know what and how much was taken. But he was finally free and that was what mattered! He swiftly started running towards his house, the vial safely stored inside his pocket. He was about halfway to his home when he stopped to land on the roof of a store. He was starting to have some second thoughts...going to his house (where his whole family would be) might not be the best plan, especially if he was going to be taking some weird chemical. It would probably be best to go somewhere else...but where?</span></div></div>",

He's a guy... And at least he has a bunch of books on medicine, he's gotta know something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kiba pocketed the vial, and hopped down, making his way to Shikamaru's house. He passed countless people, paying them no mind as he kept thinking to himself. The anxiety was starting to build, making Kiba's heart race ever so slightly. He did his best to refrain from thinking too much, lest he suffer an embarassing public boner. He managed to keep everything down to a little snicker and a sneaky grin, which no one else noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba arrived at Shikamaru's large house, looking up at the large door before him. Summoning up a little strength, he knocked hard to make sure he was heard. After a moment, he could hear the footsteps, and the door began to open. A lone eye peeked out from the cracked opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Oh, it's you.\" A familiar voice said. The door closed again, and a latch was undone, before it opened fully. Kiba saw his friend Shikamaru standing before him, in casual clothes compared to his usual work attire. A deep green t-shirt, along with a pair of baggy cargo pants. \"What's up? We already got your report, you know.\" Shikamaru told Kiba, seeing if that's what this was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know.\" Kiba said, letting himself in. Shikamaru just rolled his eyes, but allowed it to pass. \"Hey, I was about to try this... New liquid warrior pill thing.\" Kiba said, making it up as he went along, \"And I was wondering if you could watch me. You know, in case something goes wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru let out a quiet groan. \"Today was supposed to be my day off...\" He replied to Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, who took another quick glance at Shikamaru and his attire then realized and believed it to be true. \"Uhm... Right...\" He said slowly. \"Are you sure? It won't take long...\" Kiba asked, pressing the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed, rubbing his shoulder a little. \"Fine, I guess...\" Shikamaru said in a resigned tone. It's not like this was going to take up his entire day, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru led Kiba to one of the Nara Testing Rooms where new medicines were tested to see if they created their desired effects. Shikamaru pointed to a door that would lead into an all-white room, where he could take the chemical. Shikamaru stood behind the one-way mirror, as he watched his friend and ally walk into the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru pressed a button on the wall. \"Alright, Kiba. Go ahead.\" Kiba nodded, and took the vial out of his pocket. The wax proved to be a bit of a task, but as soon as Kiba broke out his sharp nails, he was slowly able to chip it away. This was taking a while, and Shikamaru was already starting to get bored. He figured it might be a while, so, without telling Kiba, he left to quickly get something to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kiba bit off the cork, and spat it out on the ground. He took a deep breath before the smell of the liquid hit his nose. It smelled nearly identical to the plants he had gathered! Taking one last gulp, Kiba then quickly downed about half of the juice, which fizzled all the way down his throat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba smacked his lips and wrinkled his nose as the chemical fizzled all the way down his throat and into his stomach. The very second the strange concoction pooled in his stomach, Kiba felt his whole body begin to tingle, as though he was filled from head to toe with fizz. He twitched as he felt this sensation coursing through his body, making him feel completely numb. Just as he was about to fall to his knees, the fizzing sensation disappeared, replaced with a very different feeling. A strange warmth was now coursing through his body, making the dog ninja sweat, his breathing increasing as he began to heat up, sweat beading on his forehead. He pulled on his collar to relieve some of the heat when he caught something strange out of the corner of his eye. His arm...looked like it was growing! Kiba's attention immediately snapped to his right arm, his eyes widening as he saw his forearm slowly thickening, a huge bulge traveling slowly up his arm. The sight of such a strange lump made Kiba's heart pound in horror before he realized that, whatever it was, it was causing his body to grow! The bulge traveled from his now thick forearm up into his bicep, the muscle suddenly bursting through his sleeve, covered in veins, at least the size of a softball! Kiba whooped in happiness as he saw this, the bulge now moving up into his shoulder which likewise bulged outward, decimating what was left of his right sleeve. Kiba flexed his arm, the bicep bulging even bigger, the veins mostly subsiding except for a single one running over his split peak. Kiba could swear the muscle was still steadily growing, even as the bulge move down into his right pec, the muscle exploding out of his shirt, his nipple hard from the experience and the sudden exposure to the cold air. \"This is unreal!\" Kiba shouted, his left pec popping out to match his right. Before Kiba could begin to explore his now massive chest, the muscles jutting out powerfully in front of him, the bulge started picking up speed, splitting into two smaller bulges, one moving into his left shoulder, down his left arm, and disappearing at his wrist, causing his left arm to explode out of his sleeve, mirroring the right. The other bulge passed by Kiba's neck, thickening it before passing down into his back, causing it to flare out, completely annihilating any material that was left of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, now feeling a bit top heavy, fell forward onto his hands, kneeling in an ape like posture as the bulge split at his waist once more, this time into three bulges, one of which made a short trip into his crotch, expanding his dick until the button on his pants burst, the zipper wilting under the pressure shortly thereafter, his balls swelling to keep up the pace with his dick. The other two bulges moved down his legs, his thighs suddenly bursting through his pants, rubbing together as his calves exploded out next, shredding his pants entirely, leaving him in nothing more than a tight pair of briefs, the waistband cutting into his skin, the front side bulging out obscenely while the back rode up slightly, showing off his muscular ass. Lastly, with all the bulges now gone, Kiba's hands, feet, and head slowly grew to match the proportions of his body, leaving him with a perfectly symmetrical body. Slowly, Kiba got to hiss feet again...and hit his head on the seven foot ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an amazed expression on his face, Kiba looked over his body, flexing his arm again. While he had been distracted with the other parts of his growing body, his softball sized biceps had pumped up to far greater sizes, his whole body pulsating with thick, powerful slabs of muscle, his once flat stomach bulging out in a tight six pack. \"Oh man...wait until Naruto gets a load of me now! He's going to piss his pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was still admiring his body when Shikamaru arrived back in the viewing room, glancing casually into the experiment room to see how Kiba was doing. He spat out the soda he had been drinking, staring in total shock at the behemoth that Kiba had begun. Slamming his hand down on the button he shouted, \"Kiba! What the hell happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba put his hands on his hips and bounced his pecs cockily, grinning at the window where Shikamaru's surprised face could be seen. \"Just testing that new medicine like I said I would!\" He said arrogantly, slowly striding over to the window. His every step caused the floor to vibrate, not used to supporting such a colossal weight. Kiba bent down when he reached the window, smirking at Shikamaru who instinctively backed away. \"Hey! Get in here and take some measurements! I want to know exactly how huge I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru gulped, wondering if it would be wise to defy Kiba. The lazy ninja certainly didn't want to go anywhere near the tower of muscle that Kiba had become but staying away seemed equally hazardous. What should he do?</span></div></div>",

Shaking just a bit, he pushed the button again. \"Y-Yeah... Just let me go get a tape measure...\" Shikamaru agreed. Again, he just wanted this to be over with... Obeying Kiba's orders was probably the best way to get what he wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru continued to think on this, as Kiba looked at himself in the mirror. \"Damn, I look good!\" He grinned, flexing his biceps, \"I know I was hot before, but now...\" He chuckled to himself, switching up his poses so he could admire every inch of his hot body. From his swollen pecs to his tight ass, he was loving every inch of it! In the midst of his routine, he heard Shikamaru come in. \"Hey there, scrawny!\" Kiba mocked, flexing his back nice and wide, letting Shikamaru have an idea of just how massive he had become. Shikamaru just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's just do this already...\" He said, stretching out the tape measure. Kiba chose to ignore him, the thought of forcing Shikamaru to submit to him not crossing his mind at the moment. He wrapped the measure around Kiba's arm, not knowing that Kiba hadn't flexed yet. Just as he got it tight, Kiba flexed, snapping the tiny ribbon in half. Kiba let out a triumphant laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Guess I'm just too much man to be measured!\" Kiba said with a cocky grin. He stood at his full hight above Shikamaru, flexing his two biceps proudly for the tiny male. Shikamaru just groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get another one...\" He said to Kiba, anticipating the giant dog man's orders. It didn't take long for Shikamaru to return, but it didn't stop Kiba from admiring himself in the mirror once again. As soon as he noticed Shikamaru had returned, he began to flex again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru slid the measure around his bicep, not as tight this time, and took the number to memory. Muscle to bulging muscle, Shikamaru measured the size of each and every one, Kiba grinning and showing off the corresponding muscle as soon as he knew how massive it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finally finished, Shikamaru had rolled up the tape measure, sighing a little. Kiba was proud and happy, and had went back to admiring himself in the mirror for the time being. As Shikamaru glanced over, it was painfully obvious how superior Kiba was to him now. Heck, not just him, but nearly every ninja in the village! Then what caught Shikamaru's eye was something that could even the odds. He spotted the vial, though spilled, on a counter not too far off from where Kiba had drank it. Shikamaru's eyes widened a bit. This could be his only chance to make things even between the two! With his level mind, at least he could keep the wild Kiba under control...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru took one last glance at Kiba, before looking at the mess on the counter. Swallowing his pride, he quickly bent over it, and slurped up the mess. The counters were always kept clean and sterile, so there were no worries of bacteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru let it glide down his throat with a smooth gulp. He let out a rough sigh as it made it's way down. Soon enough, Shikamaru then felt a similar burning in his stomach, that made him hold onto the counter to keep himself from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bulge formed in Shikamaru's back, and began to snake about, pumping his traps larger, his  back flaring out with new size, causing the shoulders of his shirt to tear. It traveled down and around, filling out and defining his abs, tightening them to a fit, firm six-pack. It traveneled up further, branching off at his pecs as each one swelled up simultaneously, pushing out at his shirt, before becoming a real strain. It caused his shirt to lift up, making the once comfortable t-shirt a tight midriff. His biceps started to tear at the hem of the sleeves as they widened and became thick with mass. His forarms filled out shortly after, completing his entire upper body, just as it had with Kiba. His hips thrust forward a bit as there was a bulge running down his pants, which not only made his legs become thick tree trunks, but also made his manhood lengthen and thicken to unreal proportions! His calves swelled up, rounding out to two perfect balls of muscle, as the remained energy did as it did with Kiba; fill out the rest of the body, making it all proportionate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru was left a mess, his baggy pants now a tight pair of shirts. As he stood, he came just short of the ceiling, so he must have been shorter than Kiba. He was left breathless, physically and figuratively, as he looked over his new, burly physique. Never had he even dreamed that he could attain such power! And judging by how tight his pants felt, he was really enjoying it too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba glanced in the corner of the mirror, where he couldn't believe his eyes. He whipped around, and looked at Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You're huge!\" Kiba proclaimed, making his way over to Shikamaru. This time, Shikamaru couldn't really feel the floor rumble as much. He looked up at his friend with an worn down smile, \"Yup! I guess I am!\" He replied to Kiba. At least now the dog man couldn't enslave him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just grinned. \"I dunno though, you still look kinda thin!\" He flexed his pecs in Shikamaru's face, who was still bent down a little. Shikamaru didn't reply quite yet. Kiba then took note of this. \"Hey, are you okay?\" He asked, his hand on the male's shoulder. Kiba had totally forgotten that his body was more adept to change than Shikamaru's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, or how to help his friend, Kiba did the first thing that came to mind! He massaged Shikamaru's...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shikamaru groaned slightly, wincing as he stood there, slightly bent over. His body felt strong, heavy, and more deliberate since his growth, but it also left him feeling sore and stretched. Kiba had experience changing his body. Solider pills, transformation jutsus, and other techniques made his body adept at change. Shikamaru, on the other hand, focused solely on manipulating enemies via his shadow. While his body was flexible, it wasn't used to the sheer mass that was now packed onto it. Kiba could tell his friend was in pain and quickly pressed his large hands against the thick globes that made up Shikamaru's chest, his fingers gently pressing down on five separate points on each muscle. Shikamaru looked up at Kiba's face in surprise. \"W-What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax!\" Kiba said, calmly but forcefully. Putting his slightly larger body to good use, Kiba forced Shikamaru to a sitting position. He then knelt down in front of the genius ninja, his hands gently caressing the powerful muscles, moving slowly over their expanse. Shikamaru's expression tightened, his teeth gritting as little explosions of pain erupted all over his chest. Kiba, his own face a mask of concentration, moved deliberately, pressing and kneading and massaging over every inch of the pale chest. Soon, Shikamaru's pained expression turned to one of relaxation, the pain slowly ebbing away from that part of his body. \"Oh man...I had no idea you were so good at this Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned and kept working. \"Yeah, my family learns how to do this early on, when we learn our transformation techniques. The first couple of times I took a soldier pill and transformed, my body was a wreck! Massaging is about all the medical knowledge I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru smiled slightly and said, \"Well, that's all I need right now. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\" Kiba said, his fingers lightly passing over Shikamaru's nipples. The slightly smaller male gasped and bit his lower lip, shocked at how sensitive his nipples seemed to have gotten after his growth. Kiba didn't notice this reaction and simply moved on to Shikamaru's shoulders. He was slightly disappointed that Kiba had stopped touching his chest and was now forcing him to turn around so he could massage his shoulders. His complaints soon disappeared as his tight body slowly relaxed thanks to Kiba's ministrations. Over his shoulders and down his arms, knocking his biceps until they relaxed, massaging even his hands before moving down his back. Kiba made a few simple chopping motions over Shikamaru's backside, groping around the thighs, being careful not to get too close to Shikamaru's groin, though the lazy ninja still felt small jolts of pleasure at his touch. Soon, Kiba had finished, Shikamaru now sprawled out flat on his front, Kiba's hands gently massaging his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Kiba said, grinning at Shikamaru as he set his foot down. \"Done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru moved to a sitting position, his limbs and joints cracking as he moved, everything in his body settling down. He no longer felt any pain, just a sense of weight and power that a meaty body like his would entail. He sighed and rested his head on one hand, staring lazily at Kiba. \"Thanks again. So now what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba put his arms behind his head and stared up at the ceiling, trying to come up with an idea. \"Your place is pretty big right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru raised his eyebrow at such an odd question. \"Yeah,  it's pretty big....why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to go home. At least not right away! Not looking like this.\" Kiba said, indicating his massive, nearly naked body. \"Too many questions I don't feel like answering right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point. So you want to stay here, is that it? And you think that if my house is big enough you won't run into anyone and have to answer any questions?\" Shikamaru said, closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Exactly! So can I stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru shrugged and said, \"Sure. I don't have a problem with it. There's a chance that chemical might have some other side effects on us so we should stay close until we know for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right...\" Kiba said, sighing. Shikamaru was a nice guy but he could be a wet blanket at times. Hopefully this experience would help loosen him up a bit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a low growling sound filled the air. Shikamaru's eye opened again, staring accusingly at Kiba who gently rubbed his abs. \"Heh...guess I'm hungry.\" The dog ninja said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed and said, \"Man, feeding you is going to be such a drag. Come on, let's go the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens got to their feet and barely managed to squeeze out the door. Kiba, who left after Shikamaru, wasn't as careful and ended up ripping out half the door frame. Shikamaru just rolled his eyes and said, \"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit of a tight squeeze moving down the hallways thanks to their broad shoulders constantly scraping against the walls on either side of them. Luckily the kitchen wasn't too far away and they were soon crammed inside of it. Kiba sat uncomfortably in the corner, not trusting a chair to support his weight, his arm resting on the counter while Shikamaru knelt down in front of the open fridge, his bulge nearly knocking a shelf down as he started grabbing food at random. After about ten minutes of searching and maneuvering, Shikamaru had managed to pull out a decent amount of food for Kiba to eat. He gratefully began to devour everything in front of him with gusto, a slightly disgusted Shikamaru looking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kiba ate...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shikamaru looked over at the doorway, trying to find a better way to get through with ease. Kiba soon finished his little meal, patting his stomach. \"That wasn't so bad... For an appetizer...\" He said, beginning to make his way over to the fridge. Just as his hand was within inches of grabbing the handle, he winced. That warm feeling returned once more! Kiba couldn't see the bulge as it traveled, but he could sure see the results!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was shocked as he looked down and saw his body starting to expand outward, his body swelling beyond it's former size! Kiba's body began to slowly bulge out; larger, wider. The feeling of his muscles growing, filling them with pure size felt amazing. The growth went up to his shoulders, his bones cracking and stretching, his already powerful shoulders bursting forth, his back flaring out. His pecs, bulging out like they were being filled with pure meat, the remaining tatters of his former jacket and fishnet shirt falling to pieces..Kiba's look of disbelief and surprise slowly changed to one of pleasure. He took a deep breath, his chest inflating more and more with each passing second. His biceps bulged up and out, without exerting any force to flex them at all, each muscle slowly filling up.He flexed,his massive physique on display. Kiba had no idea what was happening, but he wouldn't complain! He laughed as his massive, burly torso was now on display. His legs were starting to enhance as well, his thighs exploding in size. His calves started welling up, going from softballs to bowling balls! The shredded shorts slowly gripped his waist, tightening around his groin before bursting open, unable to hold back Kiba's bulging body. His toes quickly popped and cracked out furtherm the tops of his feet unable to even be seen past the dog beast's pecs. Soon, Kiba was sitting on the kitchen floor, stark naked, his manhood not being left out of the growth in the slightest. It bulged out in front of him, shaft, head, and balls, all of it for anyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba felt proud, grinning once more as he looked over himself. He looked at Shikamaru and smirked. Now he was the bigger one once more! He could re-assert his dominance over the male!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru looked over, feeling someone's eyes staring at his as he tried to work. He was shocked to see a much larger Kiba in his kitchen! His jaw literally dropped. \"K-Kiba! What are you doing!?\" He demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just bounced his massive pecs, smiling at the smaller male. \"You know... Just hanging out!\" He said in a cocky tone. Then, he started to move tword Shikamaru... But before he could do anything, Shikamaru started to grow as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru's arms twitched and flexed, his already impressive bicep filling with even more size and power, rising up like a loaf of bread! The other arm followed, as his shoulders broadening to accommodate them, the straps of the fishnet shirt continuing to pop and burst from his obscenely huge body. Shikamaru was unaware at first, as the bulge on him now made it's way to his chest. It was growing even more impressively than his biceps! The two mounds of muscle bulged outwards, swelling against the tiny strings, his body slowly dotting with sweat. He then looked down as he felt his fishnet shirt burst from his body. A low tearing sound filled the air as the last of the shirt finally burst from him! The strings had finally snapped, the material fluttering downward. Shikamaru leaned forward to look beyond his bulging pecs and a small smile stuck to his face as he barely saw his cut, six pack abs growing deeper and more defined. His short, former pants were following his fishnet, as his thighs bulged and swelled, thickening  until they were tightly bound around his pillar like legs, his calves bulking up, his feet thickening and widening to support his now heavier body. As his muscles continued growing, his height also started increasing. Shikamaru was shocked as he nearly surged up a foot taller. Shikamaru soon, as his friend, was nude, unable to hide himself, although God knows he tried!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! What just happened!?\" Shikamaru said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... You think it was that stuff we drank?\" Kiba asked, a bit annoyed that his chance to assert his dominance was denied. Shikamaru rubbed his shoulder as his thoughts were already starting to rush. It was getting late, and there was no telling how much bigger they might get... It might be wisest to leave the house, and get help in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably get going... We can find help in the morning.\" Shikamaru replied. As he said this, a new dilemma crossed his mind. They were too big to exit the room! Just as he was about to propose a new idea, Kiba had already broke down the wall! \"Kiba!!!\" Shikamaru shouted as soon as he heard the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You said we had to get going... It's not like we're going to fit in one of your beds... We should find a place to camp...\" Kiba said, passively trying to defend his case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Shikamaru agreed. \"Just take a left. We'll head into the forest for tonight, we'll be safe there.\" Shikamaru commanded, following Kiba out the gaping hole.</span></div></div>",

The forest that surrounded the Nara house was well known in the Hidden Leaf Village. It contained many of the plants, roots, leaves, and herbs that were used to make medicine as well as the famous Nara deer, whose antlers were a key ingredient in a powerful medicine. The two boy's didn't need to worry about wildlife of any kind disturbing them at their size. Once they were deep enough inside that they couldn't see the house or hear any hubbub from the village, they stopped, Shikamaru sitting down with a heavy sigh. \"Well this is turning out to be more trouble than it's worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba snorted and flexed his biceps. \"Speak for yourself! I think this is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru opened one eye and stared at Kiba, looking him up and down. \"Yeah? You like walking around totally naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned and flexed his ass, the muscles tightening provocatively in front of Shikamaru. \"You like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lazy ninja blushed slightly, looking away. \"Yeah right...Don't flatter yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled and put his hands on his hips, looking around. \"It's gonna get cold once night falls. I'm going to go look for some wood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that...\" Shikamaru replied, already slipping into a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just shook his head and started hunting around. It took a few hours to not only find wood, but also enough food to keep them both satisfied until the morning. When Kiba returned with not only an armful of wood but with a makeshift sling over his back containing two full grown deer and a multitude of berries, Shikamaru was rather shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?! You can't just kill any of the deer in here!\" Shikamaru admonished Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? We need food don't we?\" Kiba said, dropping the carcasses to the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but the deer here are special! We make medicine out of their antlers! By killing off two of them you've deprived the village of probably...at least ten orders of medicine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes and said, \"Would you lighten up? Would you rather starve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru opened his mouth to retort when a low growling sound emanated from his belly. He rubbed it, giving it a disdainful look. \"Oh fine...\" He irritably picked up a series of leaves and a makeshift needle and went back to his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What the hell are you doing?\" Kiba asked. He had fully expected Shikamaru to have been asleep still when he came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm putting the finishing touches on something...\" He replied, holding up a kind of sarong. \"There! Now put that on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man! Are you serious?\" Kiba complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am! You can't just walk around naked! If we're going to find help then you need to be clothed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! I'll put it on tomorrow when we go looking for help or whatever...\" Kiba said, using his massive hands to dig a fire pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were silent as Shikamaru set to sewing another sarong for himself while Kiba built a fire and started roasting the deer. He had made sure to snap the antlers off with his powerful hands so that they could be used for medicine. Soon enough, Shikamaru had finished his sewing and Kiba had finished cooking the meat. He passed a deer over to Shikamaru before tearing into his own. Kiba ate like a wild beast, his teeth ripping apart the deer, barely chewing before he swallowed the chunks of meat, juice splattering over his naked body. Shikamaru watched him for a moment in disgust before eating his own food. The berries provided a nice contrast to the seared flesh. In a matter of moments all that was left were bones and a few stray berries. Kiba leaned back, arms behind his head, with a satisfied sigh. Shikamaru did the same, gently rubbing his slightly distended abs. \"Man...that was more than I thought it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba belched and chuckled, grinning over at Shikamaru. \"You sure got over your objections pretty fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru turned his back towards Kiba and the fire, groaning a little. \"Shut up. I'm not in the mood to talk. I'm going to bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon was high in the sky by this time, the fire slowly dying down to crackling embers. Kiba shrugged and tossed another log onto the fire. \"Suit yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't quite tired yet. He looked up at the stars, his eyes tracing a few constellations he knew. Suddenly, he heard Shikamaru start to snore slightly. He looked over at him and saw that the lazy ninja had rolled over onto his back in his sleep, his powerful chest rising and falling with his every breath, his hand draped casually over his deep cut six pack. Kiba blinked a little. He had never really looked at Shikamaru before. Seeing his friend's massive body made him realize...that even though they were nearly the same size, Kiba was still bigger! Awesome! He chuckled to himself as he ran his hands up and down his huge body, squeezing his juicy pecs before moving down a little lower...all this touching had started making him feel a little...frisky! He glanced over at Shikamaru again. He was pretty deeply asleep. Focusing his attention back on his own body, he slowly gripped his shaft and started stroking.</span></div></div>",

The events of the day, his suddenly huge body, the way everything broke and crumbled under his fingers, the power he now commanded, it all swirled together in his mind, arousing him swiftly, his cock hard in seconds! He moaned lightly as he kept stroking, his other hand caressing his body, squeezing his thick pecs before cupping and massaging his balls. His hand moved faster and faster, pleasure coursing through his body, his hips bucking in time with the strokes, pre already shooting out and lightly splattering on his abs. His mind was cloudy with pleasure, the crackling fire and deep snoring of his friend disappearing, replaced with his harsh panting breath and occasional moaning. He was starting to get close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba, what the hell are you doing?\" Shikamaru's stern voice suddenly rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement cut through Kiba's mind like a knife, wilting his erection almost instantly. Getting caught while he was masturbating brought back painful memories of his sister or one of his parents walking in on him while he was trying to have a private moment. He quickly sat up and turned away from Shikamaru. \"Back off! I'm not doing anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right...I saw you.\" Shikamaru said, sitting up himself. \"Look, if you want to do that, it's fine, I don't care. But I'd appreciate it if you would go off somewhere else and do it. I wanted you to wear the loin cloth for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes and said, \"You are such a prude, you know that Shikamaru? I've masturbated in front of other guys before and they never seemed to care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" Shikamaru said flatly, not expecting Kiba to admit something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You got a problem with that? It's called a circle jerk!\" Kiba hotly remarked. \"Me and Naruto would go back to back sometimes and do it together! He had some pretty great tips sometimes too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru groaned and said, \"I could have gone my whole life without hearing about Naruto and yours sexual habits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lighten up!\" Kiba insisted. \"It's normal for young guys to experiment! In fact...\" Kiba got a mischievous grin on his face. \"We're the only two guys in the Leaf Village with bodies like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba bounced his pecs, turning back to face Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...so?\" Shikamaru asked, his heart pumping slightly faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So WE should experiment a little!\" Kiba said, getting on his hands and knees and slowly making his way over to Shikamaru. \"Come on...I know you're thinking about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru blushed and covered himself, looking away from Kiba. \"Yeah right! There's no way I'd be thinking something like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled softly, getting up close behind the lazy ninja. He wrapped his beefy arms around Shikamaru's thick chest and gently nibbled his ear lobe. \"Oh yeah? There's no thoughts about trying anything at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru shivered slightly, his blush growing darker, his body loosening slightly. \"N-No...Nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba squeezed Shikamaru's pecs, his thumbs rubbing over the slightly smaller male's tender nipples. \"Liar! Your body is saying something completely different!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru moaned a little. Kiba's hands were as good at arousing as they were at massaging! Shikamaru was finding it harder and harder to resist! Not to mention Kiba's hand was slowly making its way down, down, passed his rock hard abs, down even lower to his impressive bulge...Kiba's fingers lightly touched it and a soft whistle escaped his lips. \"Damn! You're pretty big! I never would have thought a guy like you would be packing something like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru shifted uncomfortably and elbowed Kiba in the stomach slightly. \"Like I care what you think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled again, biting Shikamaru's neck sensually, his tongue lapping at the slightly sweaty skin. \"Yeah, yeah, keep talking tough guy.\" Kiba whispered seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru trembled slightly in Kiba's arms...this was getting to be too much!</span></div></div>",

Shikamaru was just short of being fully erect, and Kiba's constant rubbing didn't seem to help! Kiba grinned, letting out a deep groan, while still keeping his face confident. Shikamaru was the one who was starting to falter, though he'd never verbally admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rubbed harder, an open palm pressing Shikamaru's shaft against his abs. The young man's balls felt swollen, begging for release, as a faint moan escaped Shikamaru's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're liking this, aren't you?\" Kiba said with a cocky smile. He grabbed Shikamaru's thick shaft in his hand. If it wasn't for that growth potion, Shikamaru just might have been the bigger man! Kiba started to pump his shaft. grinning all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru was hot. Beyond hot. His huge pecs push and shook with Kiba's, his breath quickly speeding up. Sweat was already starting to bead on the young male's body, as the behemoth that was Kiba kept jerking him. Shikamaru wanted to scream. He wanted to let out long moans of pleasure over how fantastic it all felt. Yet, some sense of pride within him wouldn't allow him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, still holding out, eh deer boy?\" Kiba mocked. \"Guess it's time I experiment with something else!\" Kiba then stuck two fingers in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru looked at him with both shock and surprise. Though he was a genius, there was no blood getting to his head, let alone his brain. Those two fingers slipped from Kiba's mouth, sopping with warm saliva, and carefully worked down... Past Shikamaru's huge pecs, where he could no longer see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Shikamaru felt a poke at his rear! Two pokes! They pushed not just at him... But in him! Shikamaru was at least able to realized he was getting fingered! And it felt sooooo goooood... A tear emerged from one of his eyes as he felt overwhelmed by both pain and pleasure. Slowly, ever so slowly, Kiba started to stretch Shikamaru's hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are you doing down there!?\" Shikamaru demanded to know, looking down at Kiba. As Shikamaru had finally opened his mouth, he accidentally let out a long, tortured moan. All that pent up lust had got to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned. That was all he needed to push further! \"You'll see... It's gonna feel great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru laid and watched as Kiba got up a little, and backed up. Before he could catch wind of what was about to happen, Kiba's long, thick manhood was jabbed into him, gushing some precum, which only made the penetration easier. Further, Kiba dove, until he was in balls deep. He then pulled back, and started to thrust, which only made both boys let out lustful groans of pleasure. Kiba didn't stop stroking Shikamaru, nor did he stop humping Shikamaru at any point. The two kept moving in perfect unison, having the time of their lives!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both boys were panting, sweat pouring off their bodies, the scent of sweat and musk filling the clearing as they continued to fuck. Kiba was grunting like an animal, pounding Shikamaru's tight ass as hard as he could. Shikamaru, meanwhile, was biting his lower lip in an attempt not to cry out in ecstasy over the powerfully pleasurable feelings ripping through his body, feelings he had never dreamed existed before! The two were locked in a passionate act, both of their minds focused solely on getting off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was immediately killed, for the second time, by a rustling the bushes. Instantly both teen's turned their heads in that direction. Kiba let out a roar of frustration and swiftly pulled out, causing Shikamaru to wince with pain. Before the slightly smaller male could even get to his feet, Kiba had ran over to the rustling bushes, yanked a figure out from within them, and slammed him up against a tree, his massive fist clenched around the spy's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you little piece of shit!\" Kiba growled through clenched teeth. \"You'd better have a DAMN good reason for spying on us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man choked and gasped, picking ineffectually at Kiba's thick fingers. Shikamaru, limping a bit thanks to the pain in his rear, roughly shoved Kiba aside, causing the dog ninja to drop his prisoner out of surprise. \"You're going to kill him if you keep that up!\" He snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba let out a dangerous sounding growl while the man they had caught coughed violently on the ground, too weak to move. Shikamaru bent down and stared the man in the eye. \"Listen up! Who are you and what were you doing spying on us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked up at Shikamaru, fear evident in his eyes. He was a scrawny man, about in his twenties, with short brown hair. He gulped nervously and said, \"I'm sorry but...It was all on the Doctor's orders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, who had been glowering and trying to keep his temper under control after being denied release TWICE, whipped around and crouched down next to Shikamaru after hearing the man's words. \"What Doctor? Who are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's eyes widened as he was suddenly surrounded by two massive teens. \"P-Please don't hurt me! I'm just an intern! The Doctor is the one you want! He sent me and told me to find you and report your position back to him! He's very angry that you took the results of his experiment! And he keeps slapping me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba snickered and said, \"Yeah right! Like anything you nerds do can hurt us! We're huge! Your little experiment was a pretty great success to me! Just run back to your lab and be glad we don't break every bone in your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru rolled his eyes as the man quivered in fear. \"We're not going to hurt you.\" He insisted, shoving Kiba again. \"What do you know about this experiment anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a lot. The vial he stole was the first successful result of the experiment! It was meant to rebuild atrophied or dead muscle and bone tissue, effectively regrowing them! We didn't really expect that the person who drank it would grow quite like you two though! There's something...off in the Doctor's notes I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba bounced his pecs cockily and said, \"Nah, I think this counts as a huge success!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man groaned and shook his head. \"That's the problem! We have no idea how this is going to turn out! You could end up growing even more! That experiment was highly unstable! I should really be taking notes on the results here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a notebook and started writing before Shikamaru snatched it out of his hands. \"Sorry, but you never saw us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he smacked the man lightly in the head, knocking him out. Kiba got to his feet and shrugged. \"Looks like someone's out to get us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Shikamaru agreed. \"We should probably move to a new location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah..\" Kiba said, stamping out the fire. \"But did you hear what he said? We might get even bigger! How awesome is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru groaned and muttered, \"Just sounds like more trouble...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, both teens headed out to a new location, leaving the unconscious intern scientist behind under a tree.</span></div></div>",

Crawling backwards at first, he soon got up and ran off deeper into the woods. Kiba just looked up, a bit offended and angry. \"Sheesh... Prude...\" Kiba folded his arms, sitting crosslegged now. \"Whatever...\" He shrugged his shoulders. He started to rub his thick bicep, and slowly worked down his body, turning him on once more. With Shikamaru gone, at least now he could finish in peace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru, gasping for air as he ran, still a bit sweaty. Once he was convinced he was far enough from Kiba, he sat down, back against a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what the hell was wrong with him!?\" Shikamaru thought to himself. \"Doesn't anyone get that no means no!?\" Shikamaru sighed, running his hand down his chest as he tried to regain both his breath and his composure. He looked around the forest, trying to figure out where he was. He had explored here all the time when he was younger, looking for the best places to take a nap. In a mere matter of seconds, he was easily able to identify his surroundings. At least now, he was able to relax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a good half hour or so, he decided it was best to go and meet up with Kiba. Or at least return to where it was warmer. Taking a deep breath, he got to his feet, and made his way back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he arrived at camp, to his dismay, he saw Kiba was still awake. The dog boy just gave him a disgusted look, too childish to be understanding, and laid down, making sure his back was to Shikamaru. Shikamaru let out a soft sigh, which he was leery about doing. He knew how short tempered Kiba was. Thankfully, there was no issue, and Shikamaru was able to lay down as well. The two didn't say a word as the other drifted off into sleep. Could this be the thing that drove a stake between them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys slept soundly through the night without disturbance. Neither stirred until the sun began to rise over the mountains.</span></div></div>",

Shortly after, he booked it to the forest as fast as could, finally stopping when he thought he was far enough from the village to try his little stolen experiment. Reaching into his jacket pocket, he pulled out the little serum, holding it up to the light to see it tinged a greenish hue from the emerald fluid within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up, he used a clawed nail to cut the wax seal open, taking a small whiff. Apparently green meant lime scented he thought, as he wrinkled his nose. Just the thought of what this serum could mean had his tent back, even harder than ever, the sheer thought of the muscle it could give him exciting him even more than ever! He leaned his head back, eager to down the whole thing in one fell swoop. He poured the vial down, but only got about three-quarters of the way before the taste hit him, and oh god, it was awful!! He gagged, doing his best to swallow everything, although he nearly threw it all up. He reflexively tightened his grip at the same time, accidentally breaking the vial at the same time, spilling all of the remaining stuff on his crotch at the same time. \"Aw, damn it!\" Kiba shouted, his hand somehow unscathed from the shattered vial, but who knows how much more muscle he could have gained. \"I better not have lost too much from that...\" He muttered, looking down at his soaked tent. To the onlooker, it might look like he had just a pretty big splooge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's attention was quickly distracted by a rustling in the bushes, making him freeze. He thought he was far enough away! \"Woo-hoo!\" His eye twitched as he realized who it was found him. Of all people, it had to be Naruto! He burst out of the foliage, apparently trying to expend some energy. \"Hehe, you'll never find me~\" He cheered, having just pulled off another prank on some random lab, stealing some random research stuff, they'd never know what hit them! Seeing that scientist freak was priceless! He paused as soon as he saw Kiba... alone... in the forest... with a tent... and a deep, dark stain on his pants. \"HEEE! What are you doing here! And here too!\" His eye twitched, before he smirked. \"Hehe, trying to think of my greatness~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Kiba shouted, holding his fist up as he charged at Naruto, who's eyes widened in surprise. Before Naruto knew it, he was flat on his back, Kiba's bigger body pinning him on the ground, his tent also kind of visibly rubbing against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy! Get off of me! Get that off of me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was about to say more, but he felt some kind of heat seizing his body, feeling his body almost starting to shift uncontrollably, an extra heat centering in his crotch too. \"Heh, I thought you liked the thought of it being after you.\" He grunted, feeling the heat increase, even as the space in his pants started getting tighter. Naruto grunted as he felt the weight on his chest increasing. What was going on, and... was that tent getting bigger? He needed to get out of here!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He bent his head down as Naruto tried to struggle out from under him, wondering what secret stash he's been dabbing in, before Kiba looked up with a smirk, \"Heh, you're in for quite a surprise, Naruto! Consider this revenge for farting in my face!\" He said with a fanged grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted as he felt his leather clothes getting tighter and tighter, his clawed fingers digging into the ground. He didn't have time to worry about the claws as he felt the heat in his bulge, the long, thick tube traveling down, supported by two smaller ones as his zipper gave up the ghost, a long, thick tube flopping out as long and wide as his forearm flopping out, making Naruto grunt as it whacked him in his chest, leaving a long, trail of pre sliding across his jacket, moving up from his stomach, up to his chest, and still up, Kiba unintentionally straddling Naruto as he thrusted forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto bit back a moan as he felt his considerably large cock threaten to burst out of his own pants, \"Hell no! Get off of me!\" Naruto yelled once more, trying to move his head back as far as he could, even as the head of Kiba's cock started to bump him in the cheek, smearing pre against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This must've been the work of the vial I spilled on it, so if that formula did that to my little buddy...' Kiba thought, as he felt his back surge out, ripping the back of his tight leather jacket apart, even as it spread down into his arms, the giant, beefy muscle ripping his jacket apart as the veins traveled down, bringing a surge of muscle at the same time. Within seconds, Kiba had the muscular arms of a bodybuilder, and they were still growing! The muscular growth traveled down from his back around, rows of abs popping into, side by side, row by row, until his pecs burst out, Naruto shielding his eyes from the ripping fabric, a nice treasure trail leading down to Kiba's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery quickly, like clockwork, Kiba's feet shot out, doubling in size as they cracked, getting bigger and bigger, clawed toes wiggling as his legs grew, muscles fighting for competition as they slowly forced him up. All the while, his clothes had completely given up the ghost, Kiba's bones stretching with a crack as he had nearly doubled in size in that brief span of time, his boxers ripping from behind to let his muscled ass bounce out, and with a snap, his waistband gave up, letting him sit completely nude as Naruto tried to writhe out. \"How the hell! No way you should be so big dog boy!\" He yelled in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked down as he patted the tip of his giant cock. \"Heh, not that it matters, but some EX.001 thing helped out! I stole it from some crackpot scientist, and I have to say...\" He flexed his arm, letting his arm stick out as he took in a bit of the musk he was giving off, flexing as a bicep as big as Naruto's torso inflated even larger, Naruto struggling to get out from under a cock nearly as big as him. \"It was totally worth it, 'Believe it.'\" Kiba mocked as he adjusted himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his chance, as Kiba shifted slightly up, Naruto used the brief amount of space to shoot out, and form a familiar shaped cross sign with his hands. \"Kage bunshin no jutsu!\" And two Naruto's poofed into existence, a legendary blue sphere poofing into existence as one clone shaped chakra around the others hand, \"RASENGAN!\" He shouted, as he slammed it into Kiba's cock before he could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NARUTOOOOOHHHHHHHH!\" Kiba moaned, the swirling jutsu doing little more than acting as a chakra vibrator against his cock, but it was enough to give Naruto the room he needed to book it! The clones were short-lived though as Kiba reflexively swung his cock towards them, whacking them away as they departed with a brief, \"We don't get paid enough for this.\" And they vanished in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NARUTO! WHERE ARE YOU!\" Kiba shouted as he stood up, cock and muscle throbbing as he swatted rows of trees, body still growing as he tried to find Naruto, who was ducked behind a tree further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'EX.001... Where have I heard that before... crackpot scientist... it couldn't be!' Naruto thought, there was no way he was that lucky. That vial he stole to taunt that one scientist, could it be...? He thought, licking his lips as he reached into his jacket to pull out a vial with a wax seal, and turned it around to see...?</span></div></div>",

It had been another hard day at work for him as his clones do everthing from menial tasks like helping old ladies, grabbing cats out of trees, etc., to clones with more chakra doing interviews and meeting Sasuke Uchhis in secret, all while the original does paper work in his office. It had been his fifth day in a row doing it for more than sixteen hours and he finally got a chance for sleep, having only worked thirteen on this day. His dreams filled with hanging out and platiny with Boruto, and hanging out with his friends while their kids play. He drooled a little at imagining a decent meal even in ramen form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slumbered in peace, the door to his office slowly cracked open as Shikamaru entered. He made sure to be as silent as possible as he entered, making sure the door creaked as little as possible as he opened it just enough to enter. The goateed assistant of the Hokage looked at Naruto as he quietly walked over and felt guilty. <i>I've been keeping him here far too much. Even Hinata is getting on my case about it.</i>  he thought as he arrived next to his sleeping late. Lookng at his desk he saw that all files were finished and neatly organised. <i>He must have fallen asleep immediately afterwards. Well I have a means to help him.</i> Shikamaru pulled out two small vials from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe research teams had called Shikamaru away from Naruto earlier in the day to showcase an invention to be approved of later. They knew Naruto would be harder on such inventions meant to help the average ninja, believing hard work more important over even practical matters.. What they had showcased had been an experimental chakra booster meant to help the body become tougher and produce more chakra. He had been shown a single test subject who was a member of the team. His chakra was small in amount when he tried a small drop. Over the next five hours Shikamaru watched as his chakra recharged much faster and the subjects reserves grew several sizes in amounts. It was clear their experiment was a success, and having Sai go through their files in secret while they showed off he had learned there weren't any long term side effects as long as one took the recommended small doses or rubbed into the skin in large amounts. With his fears eased Sikamaru had asked them to give two samples for later, which they happily did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Shikamaru or the researchers the test subject found his clothes were more snug than before, but passed it off as nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nOpening the first vial, Shikamaru planned to pour a small amount on Narutos face to rub in. <i>Here goes</i> as he carefully reached his arm forward. Only for Naruto to reach out in his sleep and grab it from his hands. \"Wait!\" he said in shocked as he tried to reach for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto held the vial in his sleep and moved it toward his mouth, his eyes slightly open. \"Thanks for the drink Konohamaru.\"  drinking it in a single gulp. \"Tastes aweful though. At least Shikamaru knows some good drinks.\" he dropped the vial and had his face land right on the desk, his arms fallen to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit\" Shikamaru said aloud. Looking at the remaining vial he mentally kicked himself. <i>\"I turned this into a big mess. Well I shouldn't let Naruto deal with this disaster alone</i>.\" he thought as he opened the vial and drank it all. \"He's right. Tastes like crap.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour or so later Naruto awoke, the master of a shinobi awaking, much as he had in his younger days, with his face planted on his desk, and pressed into a small pool of his own drool complements of his yawning mouth.  With a groan Naruto sat up, his false hand lifting to wipe at the corner of his mouth as he blinks sleep out of his assure eyes.  What they fell upon, however, surprised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkimamaru?\u201d he mumbled pushing up from his desk and walking round it to see the pineapple haired man resting in one of his office chairs, his hands cupped to his chest along with what looked like an empty vial.  Shaking his head the blond hokage felt a small smile touching his whiskered checks as he eyed the sleeping man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe and I\u2019m the one who needs a break... Hehe Temari\u2019s going to have his head\u2026.wait?\u201d mumbled Naruto glancing and as his heart fell, seeing the time on the clock above his desk.  A quarter past midnight, he was late\u2026again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning a clone to take Shikimaru back to his estate, and a very angry blond wife, Naruto left the office in a flash of light appearing without a sound in his own kitchen.  \u201cI\u2019m home..\u201d she whispered looking round and spotting a lovely blue haired woman laying asleep on the living room sitting chair, her pale eyes closed to the world as her generous chest rose and fell with each breath.  Letting his shoulder sage a bit at having kept his wife waiting to this point, Naruto slipped round the alcove and into the living room proper gently pulling the sleeping Hinata up into his arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if sensing the touch of him the woman let out a soft little sigh of contentment snuggling her face against his chest and mumbling in her sleep.  \u201cNaruto-kun..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late Hime,\u201d smiled Naruto planting a kiss on the sleeping woman\u2019s brow as he carried her back upstairs, stopping to peak in on his sleeping son and daughter as he did, before crawling into his bed with Hinata, gently rolling round to hug her against his now bare chest, as he let the exhaustion of the night take him again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why as the hours ticked on no one in the Uzumaki house saw the transformation taking hold of the blond hero.  Shifting in his sleep, one arm still resting under his sleeping wife, Naruto rolled onto his back his warriors chest steadily picking up speed as it rose and feel. Each rippling muscle seeming to tighten as the blonde\u2019s lips parted in a deeper need for air as below his body began to break into a sudden sweat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning in his sleep Naruto\u2019s face began to shift, a deep flush working its way up his checks as his mind began to drink in a sudden rush of pleasure unknown to him.  And as he sank into that feeling his body began to grow.  His thin shaped arms suddenly beginning to ripple and swell, the muscles honed through battle and training first tensing then releasing as if letting go they expanded pushing a few inch\u2019s thicker, a few inch\u2019s longer as his legs pushed down towards the end of the bed, sheets rising as his calf\u2019s formed into heavier pillars, his thighs clenching only to release and expand inch after inch of fresh muscle seeming to simply push into being as raw defined lines began to form over ever inch of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst him the sleeping Hinata was sent gently sliding down as the arm under her expanded, pumping bigger and pulling her closer to him, till she was pressed against his chest, her face rising higher as the pecks her cheek rested against swelled larger, thick slabs of muscle building and building below her, as  the man continued to grow, packing on pounds of raw strength with each passing inch.  Soon Naruto was nearly a foot taller, and even still his body continued to expand inching steadily larger as the bed let out a groan of protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan only matched by the man\u2019s pants, as below a gurgling groan like the ocean rose from the steadily expanding bulge trapped in the blonde\u2019s pants.  Moaning in his pleasure driven state the hokage\u2019s hand reached down even as his powerful legs arched and kicked throwing the covers back to show the tight straining image of his pants.  The orange cloth searched to the breaking point round a pair of orbs now the size of ripe oranges and still growing, as his hand yanked at the pants pulling them back as something the size of a todlers baseball bat fell with a meaty slap against his newly risen six pack.  Exposed at last, Naruto\u2019s cock throbbed eagerly stretching half way up his chest with seemingly no signs of stopping the tip rubbing greedily against his own massive pecks as he let out a fresh groan in his sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growing Hokage\u2019s hips bucking a bit as his heavy package swayed balls laying heavy against his thigh\u2019s sloshing as they rolled against the muscled divots in them, seeming to stop their growth around the size of softballs.  The plump orbs resting at last as the massive length they belong to settled against the blonde\u2019s bare heaving chest, nearly a full eighteen inch\u2019s long and nearly as thick around as a bottle of coke.  <br>\r\nWith a final groan Naruto\u2019s breathing seemed to steady returning slowly to a restful sleep leaving the foot taller and muscle bloud hokage lying in bed, covered in sweat that made his body seem to glow in the moonlight, as he slept on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning as the sun rose, and fell across the slumbering couple a pair of pale lavender tented eyes fluttered open, to see something large sitting just in front of her face.  With her vision still a bit blurry from sleep Hinata reached out a hand gently grasping the something, feeling its warm throb under her fingers as she felt something warm dribbling down her fingertips.  Blinking harder Hinata sat slowly up looking down to see her husband\u2019s sleeping face\u2026right before she saw where her hand was\u2026currently grasping her lovers improved new member.  Faced with that fact, and the fact that her husband of some years had apparently not only grown a foot in height since she last saw him, and gained nearly the same in his manhood, and that face she was currently holding said manhood in her hand, feeling as it began to stiffen with its own morning routine\u2026well the Hyuuga did a very Hinata thing as her face went beat read\u2026and with a little puff of steam she promptly fainted atop her husband with a soft thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u2026mmm Hinata what\u2019s up I\u2026.\u201d began the blond only to stop eyes widening at the scene before him as he looked down over himself, is fainted wife and his own cock as it rose gently lifting his wife\u2019s hand with it, before his eyes\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was not waking up pleasantly though, as he adjusted his color, sweat dotting his brow as he adjusted his collar. \"Ugh, why is it so hot, and what time is it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up regretfully, wishing he could get back to sleep. He was dreaming of Hinata's boobs after all. He got up, slightly stumbling due to the heat and exhaustion, heading to the bathroom, even as he noticed how tight his clothes were feeling. He should probably work out more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, I know these fit me this morning...\" Naruto muttered, finally reaching the bathroom, even as his clothes became so unbearable. In frustration, he unbuttoned his tunic-like shirt, leaving him bare-chested, but as he looked in the mirror, he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ripped! He was fit before, but now, Naruto gasped as he looked at himself, his whole form looking like a blonde Adonis. From that desired v-taper, to his abs, and his bulging pecs, all the way down to those thick arms, he was built. Slowly and almost reverently, he flexed, watching the veiny globe expand further, and then as he relaxed it, he swore it was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck...\" He muttered, just as the heat surged through him again, \"Ugh!\" He grunted, as he gripped the porcelain sink tighter. Looking in the mirror, he was speechless as he saw his muscles pulse and surge bigger, even as the porcelain cracked under his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's grunts shifted to moans however as the heat began concentrating elsewhere as well, moving downwards. Before his own eyes, he watched as his bulge began to surge, expanding violently enough that he thrust forward with each growth. Before his eyes he watched as it burst the button on his famous orange pants, and forced his own zipper down, leaving him with significantly more with what he had this morning (which he wasn't ashamed to admit was already a lot). But still, what's going on!</span></div></div>",

He was still thinking of how what he did was a foolish mistake, but he couldn't let Naruto be blamed for his own mistake. <i> Even with his now good reputation it'd be bad if he got blamed for this disaster.</i> The Hokages aide went to the lab to overlook the files for the Chakra Boosters to ensure he hadn't caused a massive disaster. He made sure to run as fast as possible to get there, letting guards see him briefly before he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clothes seemed to be getting tighter as he ran. His feet felt constricted in his shoes ad his black pants getting tighter. Even his normally loose jacket felt tight. <i>Probably just my imagination.</i> Shikamaru thought as he shrugged it all off. In ten minutes he arrived at the lab. Shikamaru grabbed the door knob with his right and used his his chakra to strengthen his hand. With a small bit of force he had pulled the door knob right off the door to his complete surprise. <i> I didn't use that much chakra when I went to open the door.</i> he stared at his right hand and thought it looked odd. A vein was showing pumping blood to his arm, and it looked as if his arm was...thicker? He flexed his arm for a sec, seeing a large 18 inch bicep rise. His use of chakra had unknowingly strengthened his body. He was impressed by it and wanted to see if it was like this for the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta focus\" he shrugged that thought off as he walked over to the file cabinets containing the files based on the chakra booster. He quickly went through the files and found the one he needed, pulling it out. Turning on a nearby light at the nearest desk, he began to grow through it as he sat at a desk. He went through as he felt uncomfortable in his clothes, desperately wanting to get this done to go back and help Naruto. The heat that permeated his body seemed to be getting intense with his clothes as he grows. Nothing too important until he came across the dangers of overexposure. \"Causes a massive increase in muscles and a large increase in penile growth\" looking down at his body he could clearly see the signs they spoke of. His normally loose jacket was tight with the rest, his pecs were much larger beneath his outfit,  and he moved one hand to touch his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt six hard abs packed together, making way for a presumed set of eight. His thighs were thick and threatening for release from their confinement, riding up his calf to release the massive and thick thighs beneath. He focused his attention on the bulge between his legs, which was getting onbscencely large. Seeing it made Shikamaru blush. He had already examined his bicep, he payed little attention to it as his biceps grow to twenty two inches, tears forming in the jacket. \"This is getting embarassing, but I can't get out of them just yet. i need to go back and see Naruto.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, he realized he was taller by easily five inches. \"There clearly is more to this substance than the lab guys knew. I'll have to chew them out later for not testing it more before showing me.\" Shikamaru left the room and ran as fast as possible to return to the Hokages office to talk to the Nanadaime, choosing to not worry about the damage he had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru quickly ran at even greater speed than before, choosing to ignore anyone who saw him ran towards the Hokages office. Unknown to him, Konohamaru had seen the growing aide leave. \"I wonder what happened to him?\" looking into the lab Konohamaru's gaze led him to the desk where the file on Chakra Enhancers was at. \"This is that experiment I heard about earlier.\" the young man sat down to read it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shikamaru was running as fast as he could to the Hokage's office, silently thankful that it was night, so there weren't too many people out. Less explaining to do, and explaining was always a drag. He was very well pleased though with the effects. His enhanced body had made the travel much quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Shikamaru did notice was the use of his chakra made the transfomation accelerate. What was a developing 8 pack, he felt, was now a full one. His biceps now nearly two feet across. His own vision was starting to be strained as his pecs started to protrude, blocking some of his lower range. And most of all, his already obscene bulge was... well, more obscene. He could hear his boxers starting to rip from underneath, and well... he really hoped Naruto was still asleep as he reached his door. He opened it, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was staring straight at him, a look that was reserved formerly for Akatsuki, Madara, and members of Kagura's family etched on his face. Shikamaru gulped as he realized that he nearly staring Naruto in the face. Naruto was already the tallest of them, nearly six foot, and since Shikamaru's growth, he assumed Naruto had grown somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Hi... Naruto.\" Shikamaru started, taking in the Hokage's new appearance.  His tunic was open, revealing just how muscled Naruto's new frame was. His arms were straining his sleeves to the max, just like his own pecs were. The one difference Shikamaru noted was in the size of their bulge. It seemed much more out of proportion to Naruto than Shikamaru's did. His boxers definitely had a lot of fox meat in them, although it was a little more than half the size of a basketball at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain. Now.\" Naruto ordered. And Shikamaru didn't waste time in explaining everything. For once, he was motivated. \"So you gave me, an experimental drug, that we didn't know anything about...\" Naruto muttered, eyes shadowed by his hair. Shikamaru nodded heartily, and nervously. \"YOU IDIOT!\" He barked, chakra flaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... you shouldn't have done that...\" Shikamaru muttered, as Naruto just as quickly doubled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" He grunted, just he gripped his desk. With awe, Shikamaru watched, with a just a hint of cringing as his boss and one of his closest friends inched up, the sound of bones crunching as they expanded forcefully. His muscles ripped his tunic apart, leaving his torso completely bare, revealing his awesome pectorals, and impressively defined 8-pack. That wasn't all either, as his legs ripped most of the legs of his pants apart, leaving him in something more akin to shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't all though, as in proper fashion, his bulge surged again, expanding dramatically, much to Shikamaru's blushing. It was definitely bigger than a basketball now... much bigger. 'There must be a limit to how much a muscle can expand at a time... Naruto has an excess of chakra, and since that area has much more potential for expansion...' Shikamaru theorized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted, an occasional spasm hitting him down there, as he let his now massive endowment rest on his desk, rips appearing dramatically across his boxers now to reveal the beast within. He had to have been close to 7 feet tall now, and built like a Greek god. (not that they would have known what that meant).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily a person would be quite pleased at such a scenario, but Naruto really didn't have the patience for this right now. \"Fix. This. Now.\" He growled, even as his bulge and muscles surged again, bringing him up another 2 or 3 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru very quickly decided to comply.</span></div></div>",

His grip began breaking it with the gentlest of touches that a 7-foot 4 inch behemoth could achieve with a body that grows from exertion. Large, powerful veins pumping to his body. This movement only made things worse as his body continued to grow.  sweat poured down his face as he felt his body surged forth little by little. His massive bulge spreading across the desk as its container began to finally reach its limit. Naruto had a stern look on his face as his blue eyes looked at Shikamaru in disappointment for what he did, anger for not for not consulting him first, and a mix of lust for his larger body making him feel good. Naruto let out a moan of pleasure. It felt good, <i>real good</i>. Shikamaru himself was watching and started to feel hot himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this could not continue lest he outgrow the office, Naruto ordered Shikamaru \" Get over here right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn command Shikamaru walked over to the desk, standing just in front of it. \"How can I help Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your hand.\" Shikamaru followed Narutos second command and put his hand forward. Naruto moved his hand to grab Shikamaru's. Shikamaru knew exactly what Naruto was planning when the chakra flowing through the blonde was now entering him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" Shikamaru tried to hold back a moan as his body began to grow faster. He was quickly reaching Narutos height as he inched upwards. His bulge was grwing bigger and was getting closer to Narutos own with each inch added to his height. His tight clothes wouldn't last much longer, and knowing this Shikamaru grabbed his shirt with his free hand and easily tore it with a single pull. The tattered jacket fell to the ground as Shikamaru release the torn cloth in his hand, now tearing his pants to let his massive thighs and powerful calfs free. <i>Much better</i> Shikamaru thought as he looked towards Naruto. It was clear Naruto was still growing despite the transfer of chakra, but it had slowed down considerably as he transported most of it to Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now 7'7 Naruto was being reached by the 7'2 Shikamaru. Naruto had no desire to stop it until he had transferred enough chakra to keep himself from outgrowing the office. \"This is how we'll handle this until we find a solution to solve this.\" Naruto made clear as he decided to deal with his own tight clothes, using his free hand to destroy his tunic and pants like Shikamaru had done. Orange and white cloth falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Shikamaru replied as his pecs pushed forward as a thick shelf of dense pec muscle. His free hand wanting to touch and caress his burning hot body. Or maybe caress Naruto's own massive pecs. The two had ignored their shoes, as their chakra enthused body had long destroyed and exposed their massive feet. Yet they had felt nothing in the process despite being the most restrictive of clothing as their entire body had been biologically strengthened and toughened starting with the feet first, which would eventually spread to the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon their bulges were touching as they had both passed 7'8, causing a simultaneous moan of pleasure to come from Naruto and Shikamaru as the contents on Narutos desk were pushed onto the floor. \"It's such a drag how good this feel Naruto.\" Shikamaru spoke with lust. His body trembling as he felt like he had a massive pump from working out. Their body producing empowered blood cells capable of sustsining such a state for their entire bodies. Sweat poured from the two as they looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't crave this or we might never find a way back.\" Naruto told him. He was enjoyifng this but it was just too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir collective growth eventually petered out with the dissipating orange chakra aura when the two reached nearly 8 feet in height. Shikamaru was slightly shorter than Naruto. It was negligible in the grand scheme of things, but they could tell the difference due to examining each otheir with their enhanced eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. If I got any bigger this room wouldn't hope to contain just one of us.\" Naruto sighed with relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean. This really was a drag I put us through\" with those words the two fell. Moved away from the desk and sat down in the empty area in front of it. Their massives body spread out due to how much muscle mass and growth their dicks had gained with their height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what we should do Shikamaru. There's no way for either of us to go deal with this in our current states.\" Naruto sighed, finally letting go of his anger about the incident. \"Thanks for trying to help me Shikamaru. Even though this was the result.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to help a friend. That's all.\" Shikamaru spoke with honesty \"Sai knows about the stuff and the scientists behind it are supposed to stop by today. I'm going to have a word about how the results of too much of this stuff was grossly understated\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two started laughing at their predicament to deal with their stress and burning desire.</span></div></div>",

He had hoped Boruto had more respect for him than that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully though, this plan of his would work. Getting up from his position, he admittedly hoped it went alright. He sought out one of the scientists requesting access for them on behalf of the Hokage. Admittedly he nearly lost his composure when they explained that Shikamaru had already taken two. Quickly writing it off as the Hokage liking them, the aide quickly let him in, while Konohamaru quickly analyzed the password they input, and left him to his own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru looked at some of the vials they had, and quickly grabbed one. He sat down at a table inside, and began to read on it again. As he began to to lift the vial to his lips again, the door suddenly opened startling him as he dropped it on his crotch, the contents completely soaking the front of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir? Just checking in.\" The aide began, to which Konohamaru quickly waved them off, trying to dry his pants, although it seemed to have mostly soaked in. He cursed, although he slyly admitted he was glad to be gifted; the Sarutobi clan was known for a few things.  Looking around for anyone else, he went to grab another one, which he swiftly drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe perked up instantly, whatever chemical the vial contained really seemed to be a bit of a perkup for sure! He definitely hoped for sure this thing worked with the desired results. He was excited as he shunshin'd home, unaware of the consequences of what he had just done. Even if he thought his pants were tighter than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, three instances of chaos were unleashed in the village... Konohamaru, and Shikamaru and Naruto who were still stuck in the office, growing, horny, and frustrated....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto and Shikamaru's laughter eventually faded after a few minutes while Konohamaru took the same Chakra Enhancers at the lab. As their laughter finally died down they began to realize the intense desire filling every part of their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this is is turning me on\" Naruto says aloud, embarassed but not ashamed of his burgeoning lust. He moved a hand to touch his barely contained bulge. \"Hinata won't be able to handle me in this state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\" Shikamaru agreed with both sentiments \"Though Temari would definitely try. After she kills me first.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remained silent for just a second, eyeing each other. Naruto observing the massive biceps Shikamaru has, easily surpassing his head in size without flexing, and wanted to feel the massive muscular ass Shikamaru's  gotten from the growth. His growth combined with his need to release overwhelming his rational thoughts. Shikamaru noticed some of Narutos own body he wished to touch, observing Narutos thick shelf-like pecs and built neck. He started to blush as he thought of kissing that neck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarutos own desire making him act rashly, making him release chakra and cause another jolt of fast growth \"Damn! I'm growing again.\" He spoke roughly with intense lust, his need to deal with it growing. His body slowly inching across the ground as he felt his boxers start tearing. \"I hope this can end soon\". As he looked at Shikamaru, he made an inviting hand gesture to let Shikamaru know it was time to help him deal with chakra overflow. Though not his sole goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get over there\" Shikamaru said as he stood up. He hadn't noticed it before, but standing to his full height made it clear just how big he was at eight feet. Only a few feet more and him and Naruto would be touching the ceiling. He walked over to Naruto in a few steps, reaching down for Narutos inviting hand to accept the chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Naruto used his inhuman strength to grab Shikamaru's hand and take his aide by surprise, pulling Shikamaru down on him as his massive arm muscles casually flexed. \"Naruto what are you-mmm!\" Shikamaru was cut off by a moan as Naruto brought Shikamaru's face to his own. The two shared a primal kiss, the side effects influencing them with every inch gained. Growing, thick bodies pressed together. The two muscular behemoths continued to kiss as Naruto put his other hand on the back of Shikamaru's shredded lats, slowly moving it up to the traps as it headed for Shikamaru's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakra was transferring from Naruto to Shikamaru as Naruto and Shikamaru started to caress each others powerful body during their makeout, Shikamarus hands moving across biceps to obliques to tree trunk thighs. Narutos hand released Shikamarus own as it moved to his his ass. Naruto slowly moved closer to the ground to lay down as they grew. 8'1, 8'2, 8'3, 8'4... each inch of growth making them spread across the floor of his office, Narutos desk being pushed aside by their thickening legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually their lips part as they reached 8'6, orange chakra still passing between the two. Realizing what he did as he gazed at Shikamaru, Naruto turned red from embarassment as the euphoria briefly passed \"I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I felt it overcoming me too.\" Shikamaru said as he lay atop Naruto. That's when they heard a RIIIPPP as their final bit of cloth tearing, freeing their collossal dicks, both hard as they pressed against each other. The two knowing there was no way to leave now. The two weren't sure if they should continue or not as the desire started to return. They both knew one thing regardless of what comes next: <i>My wife is going to kill me.</i></span></div></div>",

He'd had two wonderful passionate nights with his wonderful wife (well, a lot more than that if he was honest. A LOT more), which had netted him two precious children, but never before had he lost control like this. Hinata was going to kill him, but that didn't matter right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't care as he leaned forward and embraced Shikamaru again, kissing him and embracing the passion, as he flipped himself on top, gradually thrusting his hips in time with Shikamaru's as he moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, their growth continued, their bodies expanding as they continued their passionate feels, Naruto slowly reaching down to feel Shikamaru's ass, while he groped Naruto's pecs. Both slowly expanding with them, not to mention the great rods between them which were slowly starting to leak as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both got into it more, they gradually forced themselves up. Still a few feet away at least from the ceiling, but they were at least 10 feet tall now. Shikamaru a few inches shorter due to Naruto losing control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, the need for breath came up as Naruto finally fell back, the ground shaking as his own rump shook the floor. He looked down as he looked at his giant rod. The thought  of growth was just too much for him, and he lost control of his chakra, as he shot up violently. The surges were no longer slow, but he grunted as he shot up easily two feet in the matter of a few seconds. The grunts turned to moans just as quickly as his front \"tail\" grew to match; what came to his abs soon came to far more than that. \"Ungh...\" He stammered, \"Shikamaru, I need a hand!\" He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru had his own growth, but he was nowhere near where Naruto was, but he could tell that his growth was accelerating. He could barely keep his hands off his own manhood, Within seconds though, Naruto was leaning back, his head easily where it was when he was standing, but now he was sitting, struggling with his easily increasing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, he couldn't take it anymore, leaping at the giant behemoth to wrap his hands around it, only to find that with he could barely fit around, well, if his own member wasn't in the way,  He began doing everything he could to pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant, Shika-gah!\" Naruto gasped. He was getting too close. If he lost it, there's no telling how much control of his chakra he would lose. That could spell disaster, but it just felt so good...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shikamaru's chakra infused hands preventing friction on Narutos massive dick was the last straw. \"I'm cumming!\" The bottled chakra that was seeping from the lid finallly set free as the lid popped off, Naruto's cock releasing a massive geyser of cum that shot right through the ceiling of his office like a bullet. The force of the white substance shooting into the sky and splattering across the roof for several minutes. Shikamaru moved back in awe as he stared at it go, moving with such impressive force. Narutos head was hidden from view as Naruto smiled in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru was impressed and brought his hands to his own massive cock, stroking it aggressively to receive sweet release. Alas, it was not to be all his efforts were for naught. What a drag. Why won't it work? I need to get this over with myself. Dealing with a giant dick of my own is not a life goal of mine. Maybe I need Naruto to help me. Shikamaru hoped Naruto would call for him, because he needs a favor of his own. All the while Narutos cock still spilled forth cum, which was drioping into the office from what doesn't get outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it just kept going Naruto knew that a big growth spurt was inevitable, yet he barely tried to stop the incoming rush. I really want to stop, but it feels so good. Remembering Shikamaru, Naruto weakly called for him to help. \"Shikamaru. It's time.\" A moan of pleasure started to come out of him to tell Shikamaru he can't dawdle. Looking down as he prepared to walk, he saw just how big and thick Narutos thighs now were and how much he had grown in height. It took him longer than expected as he walked around his legs. Once he reached the massive hand, big enough that if he used both hands he could hold Shikamaru, Shikamaru briefly touched the bomb before talking to Naruto \"I'm here Naruto. Ready to grow when ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his as he turned his head to see Shikamaru. \"Finally. I've been holding back and I want to be free.\" he moved his thick hands to wrap them around Shikamaru. Shikamarus cock still hard but no release despite Narutos touch while Narutos cock still gushing cum as he brought him to his face. Naruto began to feel it wane and with it come a surge of growth, readying himself to share as much as possible with Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru spoke up, however, to ask his own request. \"Can you suck my dick Naruto? I need it just as bad and I did help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked \"Yes, but just so you know I wasn't telling you to jack me off, but to take all this wonderful growth to keep me from getting too huge.\" Having gotten that off his chest, Naruto brought Shikamaru to his lips, opening them to place the mighty rod in his mouth. Well from Shikamaru and a normal sized persons perspective. Naruto was so big that it was tiny in comparison. As he did Narutos cock began to slow down, the white cream falling upon the lower half of his body as it eventually ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Shikamaru let out a moan. Narutos tongue playing with him as chakra started to pour into him from Naruto. Narutos own body was not growing, and it seemed clear he forced nearly every ounce of chakra possible into Shikamaru, who was growing at a quick pace. Narutos tongue teased the growing rod in his mouth as much as possible as he laid down, releasing Shikamaru from his grip as the growth made him srart to pick up the pace, Shikamaru repositioning his body as he grew to get more powerful. Shikamaru was too happy to concentrate otherwise and simply yelled out a primal roar as he cummed into Narutos mouth. The powerful substance moving rapidly while Naruto enjoyed its taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tastes sweet and salty</i>. Naruto was amused as he saw a look of satisfaction on Shikamaru's face, his body now pressing against the roof as they lay down and ready to break through to let Konoha see its glorious leadership in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two did not notice the pale white Sai enter the room, seeing the situation unfold. \"Best let them finish before I ask whats going on.\" And well, who wants to get covered in white goop?</span></div></div>",

But still... \"Man, this is such a drag...\" He muttered, as he uttered his most famous line. He looked down to realize just how mind bogglingly big they'd gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized his dick, laying soft against his legs was larger than the average person, which meant... goodness, just how big was he... That wasn't anything compared to Naruto, who was starting to get exhausted. Even after his chakra pumping, he was still pretty small compared to Naruto. He couldn't estimate how much, due to how tired he was, but he figured he had to be somewhere close to half his size to two-thirds of it. Not to mention his dick... well...  Shikamaru knew both he and it were both big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he realized he was still sliding along the floor... still growing... and a grunt made him realize something, Naruto wasn't done either. A quick look at him showed his buddy shrouded in a reddish haze...  \"Kurama...\" Naruto muttered. He was going to have to have a word with that fox later. He knew he was up to some tricks. A decade or so of peace had given one bored fox...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two finished, or should I come back later...\" A voice interrupted them, as they both realized Sai was in the room. \"Is this payback for me always calling you dickless when we were teens...\" He quipped, managing a decent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again... what a pain...\" Shikamaru groaned, as he drifted off to sleep. At least he'd consume less chakra that way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto suppressed a chuckle, even as he tried to surpress his own chakra flow. He grunted, even as he felt his size increase again. Sai definitely couldn't call him dickless now, although he felt Kurama was trying to enhance his balls too. He didn't know what for. He'd already made a mess already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to the lab, and get them here. NOW.\" Naruto ordered. It was only a matter of time before he had to explain this, and he really wasn't looking forward to explaining to Hinata why he had sex, even orally, with another guy. He was already getting hard again too. Laying flat as he was, it would definitely be showing with how big he was. He might be Hokage, but even laws applied to him for indecency. In hindsight, maybe inventing a sexy jutsu might not have been the brightest idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----x------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you understand why Hokage-sama is very eager to try to undo this.\" Sai explained, walking down as he led the very same scientists who created the formula down the Hokage tower to their growing leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, but why did he ask for another dose if this was such a problem?\" One of them asked. \"He sent Konohamaru to us to retrieve a couple more doses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai raised an eye. Shortly before he left, he asked Naruto to explain everything that had happened so far. He hadn't mentioned that... He'll have to ask later as soon as they get this solved. \"But the question is, can you cure it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we could sir, but we weren't prepared for these effects at all!\" The same scientist anwered, \"This was meant to be a simple chakra enhancer. None of these effects were expected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can't do anything?\" Sai countered. Naruto was not going to be happy about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would take a lot more research for us to develop a counter serum. But, there is one man who could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Absolutely not!\" Sai shouted, rather uncharacteristically. He knew who they were speaking of, and that's really not an option. At least, not with what he's done before. He'd end up making these things worse... He sighed as he opened to door to Naruto's office. But both he and the scientists were caught off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was in there, trying to scrunch together as much as he could, attempting to delay his exploding out of his office. Slightly complicated by the fact his massive manhood was easily close to bursting. He'd passed some to Shikamaru, but he couldn't grow him while he was asleep. It didn't feel right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what took you so long...\"</span></div></div>",

Naruto sighed in relief as Sai ushered in the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist entered the room and glimpsed what had happened, unfazed by the gargantuan sizes and more by who was attached to them. Many have seen the Akimichi grow huge afterall. \"On behalf of our research team we apologize for what the chakra enhancers did to you lord Hokage.\" The scientist bowed to Naruto as he pulled out a scroll and placed it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shikamaru admitted it was his mistake that caused this, so I have no intention of blaming any of you. Though I want to know how you assumed your research was done comsidering the adverse effects drinking a dose all at once would have been allowed for it to be distributed.\" Naruto asked as he continued to scrunch, feeling his body become uncomfortable as he forced his new muscles into a position they weren't made for. The files and desk were pushed against the wall, easily missed from their desires and euphoria distracting them from their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tested it on numerous test subjects, but even our tests never showed these results. Especially in the *ahem* nether regions.\" The scientist opened the scroll to reveal a transportation jutsu inscribed onto the center. \"Our subjects when exposed to the same amount grew at most six inches and did not gain such a large amount of mass or penile growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why was it different for me and Shikamaru?\" Naruto asked as he glimpsed down and saw the sleeping Nara ninja renewed vigor giving him a erection. Naruto looked away and at the scientist and Sai again even as he instinctly began to move a finger towards it. Nanadaime began to stroke it with one of his giant fingers, sliding it back and forth gently as a smile crossed the sleeping ninjas face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe it was due in part to genetics, the Tailed Beast, and the larger quantity of chakra you and Shikamaru have compared to our test subjects. Factors that only gave lesser boosts to our volunteered scientist teammates and ninja test subjects.\" The scientist answered earnestly as he went through the teleportation techniques for the location they sought to transport Naruto and Shikamaru too. \"Ah here it is.\" He muttered too low for them to hear upon finding Teleport Jutsu number 14.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no matter how much I ingested/absorbed via my skin I'd get ridiculously big? Hehehe\" Naruto forced a chuckle as he realized things would get embarrassing no matter what. Just not as badly initially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing their discussion was over, Sai decided it was time to ask what he now knew certain was a lie by Konohamaru \"Did you order Konohamaru to get any Chakra Enhancers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't. Neither did Shikamaru since he opened up to to his mistake.\" Naruto told Sai as his free hand moved to pick up Shikamaru, finding despite his size how easy it was due to their enhanced inhuman strength. He lay softly onto himself, gently playing with Shikamaru's cock still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai raised an eyebrow as he realized that something must have happened between the two, but decided it was less important at the moment as he looked to the scientist. \"All right. We know for sure Konohamaru deceived Naruto and we'll get him later as he has likely used those enhancers. Have you finished the preparations to get Naruto and Shikamaru outside the village in a remote lab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have. Lord Hokage please hold on to Shikamaru Nara as I prepare to get you somewhere isolated and safe.\" Naruto held Shikamaru tight as the scientist activated the jutsu. In a flash Naruto Uzumaki and Shikamaru were transported in a flash, their hulking immerse forms dissipating and freeing the shrinking space of the room. With his job done for now the scientist excused himself to work on a cure or limiter, hopefully producing one. Though not before giving Shikamaru the teleportation scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around now that Narutos bulk was gone, Shikamaru noticed the white substance that on the floor and through the hole Naruto likely made. \"Looks like I need to clean this up.\" He brought out his scroll and his pen to draw several slug super beast drawings, giving them their purpose: The slugs will absorb the white substance in the Hokages office and in the hole and roof. Immediately the slugs began to work, trailing across the white splooge and leaving it spotless, moving up the wall as they head for the hole. One remained on the floor to absorb whatever falls before they are done. <i>While they do that I shall go after Konohamaru.</i> Sai thought as he left the messy but now clean office headed for Konohamaru's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====At the target destination====<br>\r\nNaruto and Shikamaru appeared in a puff of smoke in a large and expansive lab area. Naruto closed his eyes as he let his body have room to move again, spreading his legs and raising his head straight. Naruto opened his eyes to look around. He saw it was partly built into a cave, likely to keep it from being visible to spies. \"Haven't been to one of these lab testing areas before. Reminds me of Orochimaru lairs. I'll have to ask them who decided that later.\" Looking down at the sleeping Shikamaru , he decided to stop teasing his cock and placed him down gently with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ill pay him back properly when he wakes up. Right now I need to deal with a certain fox.</i> And with that Naruto went into his subconscious. There was Kurama, but considerably different. His body was laying down upon the dark void, Kurama's body as massive and buff as Naruto's but even greater in dimensions due to the Tailed Beasts already huge size. His form large enough to hold Narutos own giant form on the palm of his hand. He could see a massive pillar that rivaled the fox demons titantic thighs reaching into the sky. A penis! Something the Kyubi didn't have. Yet now he did. Naruto jumped forth with his new strength to get a look at Kyuubi face to face to vet him to stop seeping chakra. All it took was one jump and he had gone hundreds of feet into the air, catching a glimpse of Kuramas face. That's when he saw why the fox was making trouble for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gbrashdisf\" An orange furred snout flushed red, hiccups coming from the demon whose clawed hands were digging into the black void, and the fox seeming to spreak gibberish as his rod oozed forth pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's drunk! The enhancers made Kurama drunk!\"</span></div></div>",

He wondered just how long it would be before the effects would start to kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started daydreaming about showing up, large enough to tower over anyone, and muscles that would put anyone from Kumo to shame. \"Oh sensei! You're so awesome! I'm not worthy!\" He imagined Boruto shouting, stars in his eyes and idolizing his sensei. He chuckled at the thought, maybe Naruto would even make him Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of all of this, the first vial's effects were already starting to show. Slowly but surely, the crotch of his pants started to bulge out, packed tight with the expanding meat within. Before long, it was starting to push his legs apart as it began to sag over his chair. With a resounding rip, his pants ripped all the way down to show his strained boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?!\" He gasped, caught unaware of what was happening until the rip caught his attention. \"What the hell?!\" He shouted, completely unsure of what was going on. He had a bulge the size of a basketball, but that shouldn't be happening! He flipped frantically through the folder trying to find any information he could, but he still couldn't find anything. \"Crap crap crap!\" He shouted. It this because he spilled it on his crotch? His thoughts were quickly interrupted as blood began to flow into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly headed to his bedroom. If at least he was gonna make a mess, at least in his private sanctuary. He moaned as he gripped the handle, as his tent reached failure point. With an oof, he grunted as his boxers failed, and his member slapped him in the chest, balls hanging down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down, he couldn't believe what was hanging out of his crotch. Coming out to right between his chest, it was thick, and hot. He gently grasped his giant member, and lost it. Oh god, it was so sensitive! He silently arched, his toes curling as he continued stroking, leaking pre heavily. He couldn't register anything as his member extended further, tantalizing inching across his shirt until it made contact with his chin. His leaned down, gently licking his tip, even as the pleasure drove him absolutely insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chakra flared, even as he continued licking and slurping. his moans and grunts grew deeper and louder, as the second vial finally kicked in. With cracks, his feet expanded, ripping off his shoes, while his own muscles began to grow. Pants legs tore at the seams, while bursting pecs forced his shirt apart.. Each breath sent him larger and larger, but all he knew was his own cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--present time---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai marched over to Konohamaru's house, ready to question him for just what exactly he was planning on, as per Naruto's orders. If he resisted, well, he could at least put his old ROOT training for something. Then go draw with Inojin. He hadn't done that in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Naruto was busy trying to reason with Kurama. He hadn't expected this effect, but it would explain why the fox wasn't listening to him, especially when he was drunker than Ero-Sennin in one of his passionate nights with a random fling. \"Kurama! Listen to me!\" He yelled, trying to get the fox's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OGSHLEJTE...\" the fox muttered, incoherent beyond belief. Even as Naruto shouted, he gradually moved his paw towards his new pole, stretching far into the sky. Massive tongue lolling out, he began stroking, eager for more of that pleasure, and as he did, even more chakra leaked out, surging even bigger in the seemingly infinite mindscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" Naruto tsked, jumping back as fast as possible to avoid the incoming way. If that hits him... they'd be looking at a very bad situation...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sai had arrived at Konohamaru's apartment. All things seemed peaceful on the outside, but if it was anything like the Hokages office the inside likely told a different story. <i>Best if I snoop around outside first</i>. In a flash Sai had jumped over the wall of Konohamarus part of the apartment, landing next to the kitchen to snoop in to the window. The art wielding ninja peered inside. It was a tad messy due to being a bachelors apartment, but nothing crazy like what had happened to Naruto. \"So far so good.\" The only thing he couldn't see was the small hallway that lead to Konohamarus bedroom, the door was opened. With that as his next destination he moved towards Konohamarus bedroom window to see if the Sandaimes grandson was at rest. It would be sunrise soon and busybodies might seem him if he did not work fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw in the piercing dark left him a bit weirded out as he neared. Deep, rthymic moans emanated from the room the closer he got until he peaked inside.  A giant form filled the room to its brink. Thick mountainous pillars for legs being the most visible part for Sai on the floor. The rest of Konohamaru was obscured by the gigantic cock that blocked off Konohamarus torso and head. Sai believed he could see fingers touching the top, but it was just dark enough outside that he couldn't see much. All furniture was clearly smashed, pushed into the walls by legs that seem to be pushing on the wall with little force. Yet the walls were visibly cracked as pieces of furniture pierced the wall. Konohamarus mementos and clothes were faring better at least, with some landing onto the growing, thick legs, acting like a table when his body had collided into the furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Sai could not see was Konohamaru tasting the sweet pre from his cock. The massive heads tip pressed against his growing face. His massive arms had smashed into the walls as he gently caressed his mighty penis. The colossal biceps not yet breaking through the entire wall, only smashing the sides of the walls in his bedroom with his elbows. The brown haired ninja head had entered the hallway, but the door had blocked it from Sais sight. <i>It feels so good. More. I want more!</i> Despite his mental protests within his consciousness, Konohamaru was not feeling release even as his body very slowly inched across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai had turned away from the sight and was now preparing the Transportation Jutsu outside to teleport Konohamaru over to the to the same experiment testing lab as Naruto and Shikamaru. The pale white man had found and readied the 14th one in the scroll in preparation for the teleportation. He could hear a low creaking sound from the walls, revealing that the spiky haired mans growth was still continuing. <i>Better hurry</i>. Acitvating the jutsu, Sai watched as Konohamaru disappeared still suckling his colossal, needy dong without a clue to what was happening. The things on his legs falling to the ground as he vanished, broken furniture that wasn't stuck into the wall collapsing to the earth near the walls without his bulk to hold it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now that that's over with best to see if he used those two vials.\"  Sai released his brush and scroll to make several rodent Super Beast Imitating Drawings. The tiny mice went to work and ran off to the front door, squeezing themselves in through the small gap below. The paint mice climbed the doorknob toopen it. They swiftly turned the lock using their small legs as Sai walked to the door. Once he heard the click of the lock turn Sai grabbed the knob and turned it, entering the house to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Naruto's Mindscape=====<br>\r\nAs he landed Naruto ran with the full might of his massive pillar legs to avoid the wave. His titanic wood bouncy up and down as he moved with inhuman speed that would suggest a thinner frame than the massive bulk Naruto had transformed into. The ground shaked beneath his weight as he crossed nearly three thousand feet in a few minutes. The wave closing in as his behemoth cock blocked his view as he ran.<i> I wish this damn cock was smaller.</i> At will his subconscious granted this desire and slowly shrunk it to a normal size. Well not technically true as it had instead shrunk it to 15 inches. A more manageable size regardless. \" That's right this is my subconscious! All I have to do is think of it and it will be done!\" With that, Naruto stopped running. He turned around to look at the wave and with a thought created a barrier to protect himself. The wave passed and left the Nanadaime unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde let out a sigh of relief, then turned.his steely blue gaze back towards the Colossal Kurama. Even from this distance he could see his full size, so massive and powerful the nine-tailed fox have become even compared to the Shinju he originated from. That is when he saw something bizarre. Kuramas body began to make rumbling cracking sounds. Using his enhanced vision, Naruto could see his digitigrade fox legs were shifting. The bones and mountainous sinew of the Nine Tails shifted as his leg transformed into plantigrades like a human. \"It seems he's becoming more humanoid? This must be a sort of hybrid form for Kurama.\" Seeing that, Naruto figured this might be the end of his shifting.  The muscles, cock, and legs were reshaped or made. Kurama still in a lustful daze as he gripped his cock. Seeing this for the disaster it could be, Naruto thought up a barrier to permanently encase him as he prepared to control the drunken beast, blitzing off back to where it started...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====In the Test Lab/Storage Area====<br>\r\nKonohamaru had been transported right next to Shikamaru and Naruto with a puff of smoke. The brown haired man had landed within inches of Narutos feet. He had no idea what was going on as his thick arms went up and down his might cock affectionately as he fed from it. Yet he was still frustrated, and loving, the attention his cock needed as he drank from it. Even without a way to erupt, the volcanic pillar was still pouring forth white gooey material to feed honorable grandsons desire. <i>Give it all to me let me show Naruto what I'm capable of and put his son in his place. Let me rival Naruto in size and show him where things Hinata never could</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis deep moaning started to agitate the snoozing Shikamaru, who had been enjoying his slumber next to the meditating Naruto, began to waken as the noise annoyed him. Streching one arm as his eyes slowly opened, the large aide spoke. \"*Yawn* Who wakes a guy up from a nice slumber?\" His answer lay before him as he saw a brown haired rival in size and mass. <i>{His penis is Naruto tier in size though/i}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a drag. I figured it'd only be me and Naruto who'd undergo this disaster due to my bumbling. Can't believe someome else got dragged into this.\"</i></span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sai walked through Konohamaru's wrecked room, trying to see what he could find. The problem was, well, the room was wrecked. His eye twitched, noticeable on his usually stoic face. He felt around in the dark, feeling around, and eventually found the light switch, and silently praying, flipped it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small smirk, he blinked as the light's come up, his eyes slightly cringing as he got used to the new brightness. With the new light though came just a realization of just how much damage Konohamaru had caused in his growth. Sai looked around, somewhat impressed with how much damage that he had caused. It was fortunate he sent Konohamaru away when he did. A lot of the support beams had been badly damaged, and the house would have collapsed shortly, debris mixed with the musky smell of Konohamaru's pre. Certainly would have made damage control a lot harder. As it stands, the only people who knew about this, were him, the three giants, and the scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly walked about, eyes scanning about for anything. Using his feet, he shuffled debris on the ground about, scotching it around to see if there was anything underneath, moving shattered dishes, furniture, and old pictures of Konohamaru with Naruto, Bolt, his other pupils. It certainly brought back fond memories, seeing how young Naruto was in that picture. Sai actually smiled, remembering how interesting those times were, when he first saw how loyal Naruto was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis musing was interrupted by the chittering of his ink mice, as they circled about something. They were skittering about something near the dinner table, and walking over, Sai found a folder, and near it an empty vial. 'So he did get into the vials...' Sai thought, finding the necessary proof he needed. He was going to have to send a note to Inojin if he wanted to draw afterwards, because he needed a way to relax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Naruto's Mindscape====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted, getting knocked back for the umpteenth time as he tried to get Kurama to come to his senses. It was hard because he couldn't get to close, or else he'd get saturated in his chakra, which... would be quite bad. He needed to end this fast. The fastest way to do it which probably be to get Kurama to cum or to knock it into him, but he needed to do it with the least amount of contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how... if he only was a... similar... size... \"Wow, I'm stupid.\" He chided himself. This was his mindscape after all. Why not have some fun after all. With a great flash, Naruto's body glowed, and within the light, one could almost see his form growing, as nine tails shout out from behind. When it cleared, Naruto's form was replaced with a giant golden fox, digitigrade like Kurama's new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, and admired himself. He had at least kept his endowment proportional, same with his muscles. It reminded him the first time he took Kurama on, but they were on equal footing now. He charged over to Kurama, the dreamscape of his mind shuddering with each stomp. Kurama didn't even know what happened as he was hit with a full force ram. The fox flew head over heels, landing away from Naruto as he made a thud, his giant endowment falling as gracefully as a tower, as it arced and boomed on the ground. Naruto marched forward to secure him, his own pole, leading the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shook his head, somewhat dazed, trying to get a hold of his bearings, even as he involuntarily thrusted forwards, still growing even while he was dazed. \"Wh-wha?\" He stammered out, not entirely sure where he was. He remembered Naruto drank something, and after that, things kind of got blurry. 'Just what's going on, he thought?' Realizing just how different he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusedly, he moved to get up, unaware of Naruto running up behind him. \"Whoa!\" He shouted, as he overcorrected, almost falling backwards, unfamiliar with his new anthropomorphic form, as he ended up falling forwards, right as Naruto reached him... accidentally causing Naruto's cock to impale him... right in his hole. Both Naruto and Kyuubi went cartoonishly wide-eyed, as they realized just what happened. \"EEEEEEEHHHH!\" Naruto shouted, a bit of a combination of shock and pleasure, while Kurama flared his chakra at the same time, unleashing a substantial amount of it into the closest thing to him... which was currently Naruto, and his... cock, inside of Kurama... \"Oh crap.\" He muttered, already feeling his body starting to shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====in the Lab====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru silently tried to go back to sleep, irgnoring Konohamaru's self love as best as he could. It was quite difficult, since he was slurping as possibly hard as he could. The serum also seemed to have made it nearly impossible to achieve release by yourself, meaning he was gonna be here a while. Any other thoughts he had were interrupted quite suddenly by \"AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru went wide-eyed as Naruto suddenly shot up yet again, shooting up at least five feet in a matter of seconds. Shikamaru watched in awe as he seemed to bulk up even more, his biceps literal boulders of strength, Naruto seeming to develop even a 10 pack if he wasn't hallucinating, while his neck muscles started to bulge out more as well. The real coup de grace was the see his pecs push out even more, practically making the perfect resting place for his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of his cock.. he could only watch in awe as it continued to shoot up, already past his head at this point, while his own came to about his chest. With a gurgle, he heard as Naruto's balls began to expand, gurgling with the vast amount of Uzumaki seed within, just waiting to be released, as it leaked out of his flaring tip.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Rrrrahhh!\" A primal growl of mixed feelings emerged from Kurama as Golden Kyuubi Narutos divine rod slowly began to thrust into him, Naruto creating lube with a thought. \"<i>Ill make this as enjoyable as I can Kurama so I can end it</i>!\" Naruto had yet to speak in his current form, adjusting to his new form of a giant golden fox with blue eyes, rivaling Kurama in everything save for dick sizes due to shrinking his to a manageable level. Kurama was likewise consciously experiencing the new sensations of his more humanoid form overwhelming him once again as the transfigured nerves, powerful sinew, plantigrade structured legs, and his own human-based genitalia had been so overwhelming. Yet none had made him feel like this upon awakening from his stupor. Their bodies growing from Kuramas release of cHakra, making both grow a dozen feet every couple of minutes. Their collective mass spreading undisturbed within the empty void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nine tails lay on top of Naruto, his massive cock stuffed between their hulking bodies and stretching beyond. He knew what the gold fox laying beneath him did something he had seen Naruto and his other hosts do before. \"So...this...is...sex!\" He was panting in both enjoyment and pain, as while the brute beeath hims penis was smaller in size, it was still incredibly tight due to its impressive girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto moved his arms to place them on Kuramas back, a near futile effort due to how big their arms had become. \"Make space for me to feel you!\" Naruto said in a deep voice, a mix of Kuramas and his own. Kyuubi moved his arms to give more space for the gold fox stud to satsify him. His arms were spread as far as he could as he placed them upon the ground, though with the trouble of readjusting his position every few minutes as their bodies grew. Narutos hands moved upwards across the orange fur to feel his shredded obliques as he slwoly arrived upon his back, caressing the powerful teres and trapezoids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no one else able to get inside Naruto without aid, along with the coloration of this beast, the feel of his chakra, and the inflection of his voice, Kyuubi realized exactly who this primal gold hulk of a fox was. \"Ahhh...Naruto...I need you....to...fuck....harder!\" The titanic fox beast reveling in Naruto filling him, never knowing he could desire such a primitive urge as to breed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't until you get your chakra under control.\" Naruto grunted as he thrusted, wanting him to get it all under conntrol. His more composed state made handling this simpler than expected. Yet it means nothing if he can't get Kurama to stop spreading his chakra and making him grow in reality. \"Try and see if you can shrink your dick to a manageable size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate, Kurama try to speak his best as he struggled with the euphoric bliss of sex. \"I'll...try\" Kurama was unsure <b>how</b> to do it, but if it helped his current situation he'd try anything. As a being of pure chakra, controlling his own should be easy. Yet these enhancers have fundamentally altered him. Kurama had to focus with all his mental abilities to control his overflowing chakra as Naruto continued to thrust within him. He stiffled his moans as Narutos hands began to sensually travel up and down his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.\" With that relaxing feeling to aid him, Kurama began to feel his control over his chakra reignite. Slowly the wave chakra began to recede within him, its influence on Naruto slowly stopping as the unused chakra exited him and returned to Kurama. Slowly his rod, nearly twice his size, began to shrink in size as Kurama began to influence his form. He didn't have complete control, as his body retained the human aspects it had gained, but now his body was at a more manageable size as his cock shrank just enough to lay between his and Naruto's pecs. The space freed from its girth allowing his upper half to move closer to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first fime orange furred fox could now glimpse the face of fox Naruto. There were a few differences, like Naruto's eyes did not reside at the bottom of his ears, his snout was smoother in comparison to Kurama's more feral and rough one, and the whiskers Kurama himself lacked. \"Well looks like you've gotten it under control\" Naruto brought his snout to Kurama's, sharing a kiss. With it Naruto focused his charkra into his own cock and thrust one more time into Kuramas ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep howl roared forth as the kiss broke, cum gushing forth from their collective dicks. The white gooey substance shot forth as it filled Kuramas anus and went like a rocket between the space between their pecs. The white substance that collided with their forms mixing in with the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several minutes it continue to spurt, neither one wanting it to last forever in the mindscape. Their limited control allowing them to restrict the amount they produce. Feeling some on their faces, both began to lick the others snout to clean it up.  Tongues licking the other and playfully kissing during it. <i>Sweet</i> Both thought in satisfaction as they finished cleaning each others face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that that's taken care of, I want to figure out to help you have control Kurama.\"  He pulled out of Kurama, allowing the fox to stand now that the grand pillar that took him by surprise had been released. It was difficult, as he wasn't used to his paws being connected to human legs, but it was easier to deal with now. He could finally take in the sight of golden Kyuubi Naruto and his own improved body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama cockily flexed an arm, watching a bicep rise higher than his head, and moved down to feel his twelve pack abs. All of it pleasing to the tailed beast. Even the still hard cock that nestled intochis thicke pecs. He returnedchis gaze to Narutos equally impressive physique. \"You look...nice.\" He brought a hand down to help Naruto up, showing interest he never had in Naruto before the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his hand, Naruto stood up as Kurama pulled. He let out a chuckle as he looked Kurama eye to eye at their full height. Something he knew was only possible by playing in his mind. \"You aren't so bad yourself.\" Naruto was far more reckless in endeavors ever since this began the night before, the burgeoning natural lust letting him act on desire over pure logical thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First let's figure out how big we've grown.\" With that though the Leaf Village appeared to their, both turning to glimpse at the tiny village that could be crushed under several steps of their paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tiny. Well I can leave you to practice controlling your size while I see the damage outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama moved his snout to Narutos ear and whispered \"Of course Naruto. As long as you promise to return so I can enjoy myself\" He grabbed Narutos left ass, squeezing the firm bubble butt to declare his desire to fuck Naruto in the future. His newly formed primal urges need to sated afterall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. But I gotta see how Shikamaru is doing\"</span></div></div>",

He wasn't gonna let such a golden opportunity slip away from him. As Naruto turned, his back facing away from Kurama, he silently slipped forward, an impressive achievement for his size, wrapping his arms around Naruto's thick torso. \"Oy, what are you doing -ttebayo?\" Naruto shouted, his famous verbal tic popping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing~\" Kurama mewled, moving his hand down as he grabbed hold of Naruto's towering cock. Naruto hissed at Kurama's touch, his padded fingers providing excellent traction on his manhood. \"Just want to test a little something~\" He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy, Kurama, now isn't the ti- AGH!\" Naruto moaned, as his fox companion moved his hand down, the sensation sending shivers down his spine and tails. His head lulled back, eyes rolled over as his old friend stroked him off, something he never would have thought would happen in a million years. Naruto could feel the chakra from Kurama flowing into him from the contact. \"Kurama... we need... to stop!\" He stammed out. If they continued, there's no idea what could happen. Kurama had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to go further, great idea!\" Kurama grinned. This is what Naruto gets for not letting him out to play more. Wrapping his tails around Naruto, he caught him completely off guard, spinning him around rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now wha- GAH!\" Naruto was wide-eyed, looking down, as Kurama wrapped his mouth around Naruto's endowment next. He was really putting him through the loops this time. He fell down, completely crushing the imaginary Konoha under his butt. Kurama moved his tongue around, tasting Naruto's leaking pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just let yourself go Naruto. When's the last time you've ever had fun. What happened to the fun loving genin I used to be sealed in.\"</i> Kurama thought-spoke to Naruto, his mouth filled  with his cock currently, as he began moving his mouth back and forth, face fucking himself with his jinchuriki's cock. 'That village was too small. Let's have some more fun.' Kurama created a larger village for them, Naruto's back pressing against the newly resized Hokage cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could feel himself inching up, paws slowly dragging trenches in the ground. He gasped, his breath slowly steaming up. \"Ku-kurama, stop,\" he moaned, feeling his stomach beginning to tighten up, as pressure built in his balls. Kurama just replied with a smirk, cum leaking out the side, as he picked up his pace, the slurping echoing throughout the imaginary village, both of them slowly growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Naruto shouted, seed flowing out of his cock profusely into Kurama's waiting maw, as he drunk greedily, his stomach starting to bulge slightly. Naruto collapsed back, chest panting as he was exhausted, cum leaking out of his softening cock. Kurama grinned, knowing the exact way to push Naruto's buttons. \"I guess better luck next time, shorty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes shot open, right eye twitching heavily. Screw hokage duties. He spent 16 years having to listen to that, and he wasn't about to start that again now. \"Better luck-ttebayo?! I'll show you!\" He shot forward, grabbing Kurama by the face, and locking him in a passionate kiss, moaning at the taste of his own seed in his mouth. They fell backwards, crushing a pretty large portion of the new village underneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down, and grabbed their large cocks, his hand large enough to grip both of them, as they came to their giant pecs. Naruto grinned as he made out with Kurama, thrusting his hips forward, grinding his cock against Kurama's and his own abs. Naruto dove up for air for a brief second, whispering an idea in Kurama's ear. Kurama grinned as well, and both grinned as their cocks thrust forward, elongating until they came to head level, as they licked both each other and their cock heads, enjoying the sensations and taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely their chakra went out of control as well, as they began to fill up the rest of the village, buildings collapsing under their expanding girth and muscle, as the two comrades made out with each, uncaring about consequences anymore.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two Foxes had been indulging themselves within Narutos subconscious, Shikamaru was looking on as Narutos body grew outside. His body spreading forth in growth. Shikamaru could tell something seems to have gone wrong with Narutos perceived slumber as more chakra than ever covered the Hokages form. The head of the ditting Nanadaime rising to the ceiling of the large facility. His right foot nearing the self-pleasuring Konohamaru before the mighty foot began to press into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can only end badly.\" Shikamaru thought in annoyance as Konohamarus slurping got louder. He saw the foot began to unknowingly move itself upon Konohamaru's large cock which only intesified the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, a stifling moan came forth from KonoHamaru as his dong set off like a geyser, a murrmured \"Yepf!\" spilling from Konohamaru's full mouth as white goo splattered around his face and to the ground. So much his mouth couldn't contain it all. He didn't know what let him finally get release besides the pressure of something that felt good on top, but he didn't mind at all. His ignorance of Narutos chakra flowing into his body via the hokages foot as his seed getting a massive dose to help speed up the process. His body growing larger by the second and almost on the verge of surpassing Narutos massive foot in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru was concerned about this situation. Naruto was clearly out of it and lacking control, and he honestly wasn't sure how sturdy their bodies are that anything he tries will likely be a flea bite at best to the blonde fox whiskered titan. \"But I need to do something to end this-that's it!\" <i>Narutos chakra is going wild but he isn't controlling it. Looks like I've gotta do all the work in this case</i>. He knew what to do as he jumped onto the massive, thick pillar that was Narutos left thigh. Narutos body spreading across the ground as his torso rises higher and higher. Jumping again, he landed right between the rising cock and Narutos ten pack. Focusing his own chakra and kickstarting his growth again by proxy, Shikamaru focused it into his fist with the  goal of punching Narutos penis. He knew it had a small chance of working, but if contact is required to get off he hoped brute force would discomfort Naruto to bring him to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe readied his punch as he sent it colliding with the dick. \"If this doesn't work I'll try Shadow Imitation next\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====At Konohamaru's Apartment=====<br>\r\nHaving found one empty vial, Sai and his art formed animals had yet to find the other vials Komoha.aru was said to have taken. Drawers, cabinets, trash, broken rubble, etc. Were all thoroughly searched without a single drop of the the last two located. Only one had its contents empty on the table. \"Looks like I'll have to spread the search out and find it. Worse yet I might need to expand my search to people\".<i> Sorry Inojin. Looks like I won't be able to draw later afterall. </i>Sai reluctantly thought despite not informing his son of his plans yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got down and pulled out a scroll. With brush out Sai began drawing a large number of mice and birds. It took over thirty minutes but he made a set of one hundred each. He invoked the Super Beast Art technique once again, his ink formed drawings taking shape to hunt down the two remaining vials. The mice spread out across the ground as the birds took flight to search from above.It had only been a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out of ink so its best I get more and create more animals to help\". Sai thoight as he decided to leave the ruined apartment. The pale white ninja heading for the Hokages office as the closest source of ink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what became of those two vials? Perhaps Konohamaru, having tasted two, got cocky and left them in a spot near a certain dog ninjas home?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Sai was busy looking for more ink, he was unaware that the vials were close to being found. Konohamaru was smart enough to know that he couldn't just take the vials back, that would cause for serious punishment, and maybe even a court martial. Just because he was the Hokage's favorite shinobi besides his wife didn't mean he could get away with everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he hid them in a small spot off near one of the central parks. Plain enough that everyone goes too, but not anyone's first guess to look for valuable resources. That is... for a regular person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the park, he never would have accounted for the old dog digging in the ground. Why? Well, he's a dog, that's what dogs do. They like to dig holes. Well, that, and he was curious why one of the head human's associates. Digging in the ground, he was confused when he came across two glass vials. Picking them up in his mouth, Akamaru ran (slowly) back to his master, drooling heavily from the mouth. He never noticed as one of the vials plopped down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Konohamaru's apartment, a draft blew through his house through the shattered windows, stirring up loose papers and dust. One blew the folder open, papers flying from inside. Noticeably one flew on the ground, a key section highlighted in red. KEEP VIALS CHILLED AT ALL TIMES. SERUM MAY BECOME INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE AND PRODUCE UNDESIRED AND UNEXPECTED EFFECTS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously two vials were out in the open, one in the warm mouth of an older dog, and one out on the open. And according to the latest Konoha News Update, the heat wave was expected to continue throughout the week...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Kiba's House====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba ran his hand through his newly cut hair, Tamaki having recently gotten him to cut it. He did think it was nice, it nearly resembled his old haircut, the spiky strands sticking out. The only problem... Tamaki had some kind of cat issue to tend to, meaning  he was left alone... with a serious case of blue balls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted, gently massaging the growing tent in his pants, even as he heard Akamaru walk in. \"Hey buddy! Eh, what's that?\" He saw Akamaru plop over to the table and drop some vial from his mouth. He picked it up, not bothered by the dog slobber at all. He saw Akamaru look about, confused for a little bit, but then he shrugged, staring at Kiba. \"Uh... thanks? What am I supposed to do with this?\" Akamaru just huffed, and plopped over to his bed. Deciding whatever, he unscrewed the cap, taking a small sip, but didn't detect anything wrong with it. And downed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HACK! Ugh, that's the last time I trust something Akamaru gives me...\" Kiba muttered, although he still had a problem in his pants. He only seemed to feel it get tighter. Looking over at Akamaru, who was gently snoring, he got up, and headed over to his room, gradually undressing at the same time. By the time he got to his bedroom, he was just left in his tight boxer-briefs. Heading over to his magic box of \"toys\" too, he opened it up and dug through till he found what he needed, pulling out an open cock sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he couldn't have Tamaki, this would do as well. He licked his lips as he pulled his boxers down, his 10 inch cock flopping out, swolled red and weeping pre. He plopped down, stroking with his one hand as he lined up with the hole, gritting his teeth as he slid inch after inch inside, moaning as the material clenched, his arm tensed as he prepared to move it up, the other hand teasing his aching balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Naruto's Office====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai rummaged through Naruto's office, trying to figure out where Naruto hid his spare ink. His original one had been destroyed when his junk expanded on top of his desk. Now Sai was going through various drawers to see if there was anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis searching was interrupted though, at a certain knocking at the door. He pondered whether or not he should answer it, but if they should come in and see the mess, it could cause a panic. Better if he should explain it, perhaps a jutsu test gone wrong. He could play his way out of it for most shinobi after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over, he slowly opened the door, and admittedly, for all his Root training, he'd never panicked more at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened in here. Where's Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before him was his companion in gloom, and Naruto's closest confidante, apparently back from his information gathering. It was Sasuke Uchiha, red Mangekyou Sharingan shining in his visible eye...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eight minutes in and Kiba was frustrated. No matter how much he played with his balls and stroked himself with his cock sleeve, it only felt like pre was continuing to leak forth. \"U-usually I'd have cum at least once!\" Kiba grunted with his eyes shut as he continued to stroke and fondle, unaware of the changes happening to the rest of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tiny little left fang began to sharpen and grow as its right tooth became another fang His chest pushing forward into a perfect shelf, his abs shifting from a six to an eight hard as stone, thighs growing with muscle as his calves grew, a perfect teardrop forming. His feet began to expand, the muscle dense as his toenails became sharp. His arms, which oddly enough had yet to change, started experiencing their own growth as deltoids started to grow, nails sharpening on his hands like claws as his biceps and triceps exploded with power. His neck decided it wanted to be the last to grow, veins pumping blood as they began nourishing the massive neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this made Kiba feel good...but still not anywhere close to climaxing. \"Damn! Why won't I cum? Is there a problem?\" He thought as he opened hia eyes to see his body in perfect shape! \"Man I didn't know not cumming had an effect on my body like this. I should do this more often!\" The dog ninja clearly didn't see anything wrong with this, though the fact he hadn't grown in height or had a massive dick didn't help. Was it the cock sleeve or maybe the effects of heat on the Enhancer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba immediately got the answer as he slid the Cock sleeve off. With a rush his cock suddenlt <i>expanded</i> to hilarious proportions in length and girth as it quickly rammed into the roof *SMASH* and broke right through it as it kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's balls didn't waste a second to grow with the cock, soon expanding into massive orbs that were the size of Kiba's beefy body. Upon seeing the sight of both his comically huge parts Kiba only felt one thing: \"I wonder if I can finally beat off!\" He was so desperate for release he didn't care how unnatural it was. \"Though I could shame Naruto with a dick this size.\" He wanted to be hokage in the past as well afterall. Feeling his massive cock and loving caressing it, he still wasn't orgasming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still nothing. What to do?\" Looking past his mountainous cock he could barely see Akamaru. That is when he got an idea. Performing the signs he called out \"Human Beast Clone jutsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru. Who was resting in peace was quickly replaced with an equally massive and hung version of Kiba. The dog confused by his strange new appearance, felt a beast of a cock press into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that contact Kiba roared \"Yes!\" As a geyser erupted over both him, Kiba clone Akamaru, and the entirety of his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow his body will reach the size of his divine rod.</span></div></div>",

What's this?\" The person said as they held it up to their face, his bright yellow eyes narrowing slightly as he looked over it, his light blue hair blown slightly in the wind. Turning it slightly,  he noticed the label and found it jogged a slight memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... Father mentioned this once...\" Mitsuki muttered, remembering that Orochimaru once mentioned a top secret project that Konoha had been working on, a kind of chakra booster. By itself, it would have been little more than a liquid soldier pill, so when they weren't looking, Orochimaru had snuck in and had a bit of fun, messing with the formula here and there, turning it from a chakra booster into a kind of human enhancement. He might have been reformed, but he still had his experimenting edge. He was never noticed of course, as a Sannin level shinobi, he was able to sneak in and out easily, and they were none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he thought of his teammate, Boruto, who obviously had parent issues, enough to even cheat during the chunin exam to try to impress him. Looking at the vial, he might know a good idea, Mitsuki grinning as he pocketed it, heading quickly towards his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, he'd arrived, at Boruto's house, knocking on the door. \"Hm, I wonder if anyone's home...\" He muttered, waiting for anyone to answer, at least until someone did, the smaller but similar face of Hiwamari answering the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" She asked, her innocent face poking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yo Hiwamari, is Boruto here?\" He asked, smiling his trademark smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's in his room. Mom's out shopping, and Daddy's been out all day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I come in?\" And she nodded, letting him in before running off somewhere in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome bit of searching later, he'd finally found Boruto's room, knocking on the door, hearing a familiar drawl, \"Who is it?\" before he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo!\" He smiled as he waved at Boruto, who looked up somewhat disinterestedly from his game system, his room slightly messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing here?\" Boruto asked, not really expecting company. His father hadn't been home unsurprisingly, and his mom was out shopping so he was just a little bit bored, sitting here in a plain shirt and his usual pair of pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Konohamaru-sensei has a mission for us, so he sent me over.\" Mitsuki lied smoothly, his hand reaching into his pocket, while Boruto's eyes lightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you say so in the first place!\" Boruto jumped up, running over to grab his jacket, and exposing his back to his teammate. Just as soon as his back was supposed, Mitsuki acted, his arms shooting and wrapping around Boruto much to his surprise. \"Oy, what are you doing!\" He yelled, trying to turn back, at least until one hand reached up and grabbed his nose, and the other popped the lid off the vial, and shove in Boruto's mouth, Boruto struggling as the weird-tasting liquid flowed in, which he was forced to swallow, either that or choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki eventually let go, as Boruto rushed to the nearby bathroom, trying to cough up anything, but he'd already swallowed it all. \"What was that!\" He yelled, feeling a heat overtake him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you'll like it!\" Mitsuki grinned, as Boruto hunched over, feeling his pants bulge as he gritted his teeth, looking in the mirror a strange feeling in his mouth as he felt his left canine extend somewhat, doubling in size before his other followed suit, looking like he had a pair of fangs as he felt the heat growing stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what did you do to me!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His skin began to flush red from the intensity as it felt like every part of his body was throbbing. \"Ah~\" Boruto moaned as he felt his pants continue to tighten. Mitsuki moved over and was lovingly caressing his skin gently as it continue, which helped calm the blondes nerves as it was really intense. Boruto was trying to move over to lay in his bed, feeling his pants and shirt grow tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need help Boruto-kun?\" Mitsuki asked as he started feeling muscle slowly appear on Boruto's beat red skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes. It f-feels g-good and b-bad~\" Boruto moaned as he bared his new fangs. His blue eyes shining as hos flushdd red face lookdd at Mitsuki in a mixture of angry, annoyed, and kinda happy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away then.\" Mitsuki smiled as he extended his arms to wrap both hands around Boruto, helping to guide him over to the his friends bed. Mitsuki could feel Boruto's body widening and filling out over so slowly as the light muscle of his arms filled out. Together the two moved back to the bed where Boruto moved to now lay down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he now lay down and tried to deal with his burning body that felt really good he looksd at Mitsuki. \"N-now tell me w-what.that w-was~\" His arms started to fill out more as the small definition soon gave way to vusibld biceps and triceps, deltoids growing as Boruto got wider in his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki moved his hands to continue massaging Boruto's form before speaking. \"An experiment of Konoha they are testing. I saw some outside and figured you'd want to try it.\" He smiled as he gave a very neutral tone in his voice, hiding his own desire to see Boruto grow. Boruto's pants tightened as his thighs thickened, giving him less space combined with that visible bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well t-thanks M-Mitsuki. H-help me u-undress! T-ight~\" Boruto's moans of pleasure and stuttering were quite a sight for Mitsuki to drink in as he happily pulled down Boruto's pants but leaving his boxers, noticing how they were threatening to tear due to the thick muscle filling it up. Light blue haired boy moved to remove Boruto's shirt, feeling the begginning of a four pack as he briefly touched Boruto's abs. Even seeing his pecs starting to appear with their own definition as they pushed forward. Since it was a plain shirt Mitsuki merely used a sharps ninja tool and cut it so not to disrupt Boruto's enjoyment. Who did indeed not care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks Mitsuki.\" Boruto happily cried as his hands dug into the bed, feeling a realy strong desire overcome him. \"C-can you help me with s-something else?\" Boruto's bug blues looked desperately at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything Boruto-kun\" Mitsuki asked as he moved close. Then with a swift grab Borutoplaced a hand in Mitsuki's hair and gripped it as he moved up and went in for a kiss. Hot, burning, beautiful. Those desires crossed Boruto's mind as he kissed Mitsuki, who soon was replying with his tongue. The two began to make out as Mitsuki wrapped his arms around Boruto's body. Feeling up every part of his thickening frame. Not noticing Boruto's head had risen by three inches since it started. The two lost in happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when Borutos body decides to reallym kick his growth in it will mean a new home for them Uzumakis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===Meanwhile===<br>\r\nAnd that is the last of it.\" Sai reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe Shikamaru would do something so careless.\" Sasuke said stoically.

Who knows what would happen if the village knew about three of some of its mightiest ninja were now giants who could crush a person with a flex of a bicep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's why right now I'm looking for more ink to make actual clones to coordinate easier. My beasts can't psychically communicate with me like my ink clones can.\" Sai said as he finally found the ink he needed. Began making clones of himself and more Beasts to help scavenge Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help too and go check on the three. Maybe things have improved with them and we can reprimand Konohamaru for being even more reckless.\" Sasuke said as he left to go use the summoning jutsu foe said lab.</span></div></div>",

It was hard though, considering even perched on Naruto's crotch, his head couldn't even reach Naruto's bulging pecs, even with his body slightly hunched from his posture. All in all, Shikamaru estimated his body was closing in somewhere on 25 feet, due to using his chakra again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to him, his view was currently filled with other issues, namely the large, somewhat curved upward cock in front of him, nearly three times as big as himself, throbbing, veins just as large as his forearm all over it, large enough to reach significantly past Naruto's head. He gritted his teeth as he looked around seeing Konohamaru who was smaller than himself, but was rapidly catching up due to the chakra flooding his system from the Kyuubi-enhanced Naruto, not to mention the Naruto-level endowment he was currently wielding as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Shikamaru could do to give the massive cock another whack, hoping something, anything would catch the larger shinobi's attention, grunting as he began running through handsigns, fueling his growth even more. \"What a pain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Naruto's Mindscape====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within Naruto's mind, Kurama and Naruto, currently a blonde Kyuubi were going at it, their muscled, furred bodies crushing replicas of the village underneath them, Kurama smirking slightly as his muscled butt squashed the Academy under it, as he continued making out with Naruto, their massive cocks lodged between them, although he wasn't prepared for Naruto to grab him, and force him up against the cliff face, eye level with the blonde fox's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I need more than that!\" Naruto purred, as before Kyuubi could protest, he sheathed his massive cock in the fox, the massive biju going wide-eyed as Naruto proceeded to face-fuck him as hard as he could, his furry balls whacking Kurama's chin with a wet smack as Naruto used his ears as a griphold, even Kurama gagging slightly as he felt his throat bulging with the meat inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Kurama had to be impressed at his Jinchuriki's boldness, feeling the load of pre slowly filling his stomach. He wasn't going to let this be boring though, as one large hand gripped around Naruto's thigh, the other gripping around his own cock, throbbing between Naruto's legs, while his tails slowly lifted around the two, wrapping around his cock, teasing his balls, even as they continued wrapping around the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto moaned at the tightness that could rival his wife's, but he was unprepared for a sudden intrusion in his ass, sighing as Kurama used several of his tails to tease Naruto's hole. At that point, even Naruto couldn't handle it anymore, his chakra flaring fiercely, as his muscles bulged even more, height even larger, cock even longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smirked as he felt the effect of his mischief, using his own chakra as well, copying Naruto's own growth as well, his butt carving a groove into the ground as it slowly expanded. But he found a problem though, as his growth wasn't keeping up with Naruto's! 'What's going on! Impossible!' He thought, as his eye looked up, only to see why. His red aura of chakra was slowly being absorbed by Naruto! And that meant a big problem, as he gagged, feeling Naruto's cock grow far too big for even him, his jaw popping as he quickly let Naruto flop out. Coughing, \"Always a bother...\" He smirked, as he looked up at the growing form, Naruto moaning uncontrollably as he worked out to stroke off his growing cock. \"But ever so fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Real World====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Shikamaru turned as he heard Naruto moan fiercely, his cock full on leaking pre like a faucet, chakra flowing freely off of him now as his body began growing at an incredibly rapid pace. He didn't have much time to respond as well, feeling the chakra flood him as well, his growth accelerating, and hearing Konohamaru's moans, he could tell the same was happening as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finally regained consciousness at this point, his eyes blinking as he finally realized just what was going on, going wide-eyed. \"Damn it, Kurama!\" He yelled as he reached out to grab his throbbing cock, but that turned out to be a mistake, as the slightest touch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gh, CUMMING!\" He grunted, feeling his head bump against the tall ceiling, even as his cock rubbed against the ceiling, digging a small grove in the ceiling as well, shooting burst after burst of cum, soaking everything in its path, himself, Shikamaru, Konohamaru, the floor, the whole place and its contents soaked in a white, sticky mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough!\" He heard Shikamaru yelling, the man currently doubled his former size, his own cock hanging down to his shins, somehow having managed to keep it soft this whole time as he looked up to his 20 story high boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I was preoccupied?\" He muttered, not wanting to explain just what he and Kurama were doing, as he looked down, his eyes widening as he noticed Konohamaru nearby, nearly as large as Shikamaru, but trying everything to stroke off a cock more than twice his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding!\" Shikamaru yelled, this had turned into a complete nightmare... \"You're larger than some skyscrapers almost. Not to mention that...\" He said, gesturing to Naruto's cock, nearly as large as the blonde kage, complete with a pair of wrecking ball sized balls, \"is just as lethal as a biju sphere! You have no idea how much this is going to take to fix everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then you better start trying to figure out how.\" Shikamaru and Naruto both turned, Konohamaru grunting as he finally acheived his long desired released, adding his own spray to Naruto's, unaware as the someone stepped through the cum-lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Shikamaru gulped, as Sasuke sloshed through the mess, eye nearly glowing in the dark as he looked around the mess until he decided to shut it down the slight chakra-trace in the entire place giving a slight eyestrain to him. \"Uh, hi Sasuke.\" Naruto stuttered, sweating slightly despite how small his friend was compared to him, his coal-black eye boring a hole into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Naruto's House====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki grunted as Boruto easily picked him up, grabbing him by his thighs as his back slammed against the wall, their foreheads touching briefly before getting back to their war of the tongues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh, this... this feels amazing!\" Boruto grunted as he felt his body growing larger, his body growing under Mitsuki's hold as the blue-haired shinobi, feeling the biceps growing under his own grip, a single vein throbbing under his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the pecs slowly starting to push forward even more, his hands and feet were starting to become clawed as well, even as his thighs began ripping the legs of his blue boxers, the back drawn tight around a muscled, pinchable, rounded ass. If Mitsuki could see it, he'd be getting quite a nosebleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, that wasn't the only part he would've been concerned about, with his position against the wall, he could feel something bulging underneath him as well, something large, and soft, and still growing, the button on his boxers straining to stay intact. Boruto could feel his member throbbing to, but he was still too preoccupied, using his new canines to nibble on Mitsuki's lip slightly. A low gurgle of cum could be heard as well, Boruto's balls throbbing as well, slowly gurgling as they slowly were filled with formula-laced cum, a special gift of the heated formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Boruto's body had shot up another half foot, only a couple inches short of his dad's former height, muscles bulging all over his body like a swimmer, a nice 6-pack, delts, lats, the whole works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki smiled as he felt Boruto nibbling at his lips, \"Mmm, my turn Boruto-kun.\" He laughed as he leaned over, and dug his fangs into Boruto's shoulder, Boruto grunting slightly as he let Mitsuki continue his perverse game. He leaned back, a bit of blood dripping from his lips as he licked them, a habit reminiscent of Anko, \"I love how you taste, Boruto-kun, I wonder how the rest fares up.\" He smirked, as one hand reached down to massage the large bulge underneath, Boruto only giving his own grin back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Naruto awakened and Boruto and Mitsuki continued to have fun, the ink beasts were still frantically searching the village. Rodents checking every nook and cranny they could find, birds flying from above to observe any changes down below, while snakes and dogs try to sniff out Konohamaru's scent. Alas it would take them a bit of time to catch sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud. *Boom* that could be heard around Inazuka household as two massive cocks erupted, painting the house white with splooge. The cracking and groaning of bone and muscle as Kiba's body responded to the act by rising upwards to the sky as he hugged his cock affectionately. \"Finally got the release I wanted!\" The dog nin mused with eyes shut, seed falling down upon his body without a care even as it became easier to hug the throbbing pillar as his body grew. Soon Kiba's head was breaching the building in equal measure as his wide frame rose up, more of the house being torn apart as it collapsed by thickening muscle as Kiba's body quickly sought to reach the size of the monster cock. The brown haired ninja spread his arms more around it as he rose nearly to its size. Now Kiba was a proud 40 ft. high as he tenderly showed affection to his 50 ft. dong. The head nestled aboved him as his massive 15 ft. balls started to churn again. His Chakra Enhancer altered cum was soon absorbed into his skin, to bring more growth in his future. \"I can't wait to show off to the rest.\" Kiba's deeper voice resonating through the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed Akamaru was unable to look on as remained the same size as Kiba was before, the old hound confused as he had no idea what was going on before or after the two erupted. The humongous cock blocking his view. Akamaru when transformed only felt an awkward need to scratch an itch that ended as soon as it began. Now covered in the same falling white stuff as his owner. \"Grrrr?\" The Human Beast Clone made the noise in Kiba's voice, trying to get Kiba's attention as the liquid dissolved and caused something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a *poof* of smoke Akamaru was returned to being a dog. The white furred dog sighed in relief, though felt oddly younger. The enhancer laced seed had made him ten years younger. Kiba on the other hand dozed off, entering his own lustful dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====During Kiba's growth====<br>\r\nOne imitation eagle caught sight of the eruption at Kiba's home. Two massive geysers covering the house in splooge as it painted the home white. A target being located, he eagle eyed the area. It was quiet and no one peeped out their windows or homes to see what kind of mess was going on. It saw no one had yet to notice the disaster and with that concern of its master alleviated it turned around and headed for the Hokages' office to inform him. It flapped its wings with fury as it sought to contact Sai as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai was outside the office, having exited after Sasuke went to the lab. His scroll on the ground as he prepped his brush &amp; ink to begin making a number of clones. The Teleport Jutsu no. 14 safely tucked away for transporting a potential subject to the labs should it be a worse case scenario. Luckily the eagle descended downwards to him before he started. Flying in circles, Sai realized he found something. \"Since he doesn't have a vial then it means someone must have digested one.\" Quickly he set to work painting a large lion-dog (Komainu) to ride.  He activated the Super Beast Imitating Drawing. The drawing emerged as it came to life and stood nearly as large as Sai, who jumped onto it's back. The eagle above stopped circling as he flew towards its target location high above Sai. The lion-dog chasing after with heavy steps as it moved at speeds greater than its creator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they reached Kiba Inazuka's home, the bird circling above as the lion-dog slowed once they got close enough to see Kiba from afar. A massive throbbing cock standing proud from where they were. <i>\"So it was Kiba that snatched it. Perhaps Konohamaru gave it to him on purpose?\"</i> Sai pushed those thoughts aside as they moved closer, seeing Kiba's massive body behind his even bigger mountainous dick. \"If they continue to grow so obscenely huge there'll never be able to live in the village\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got within range of the residence Sai noticed Akamaru was pointing his head up in wonder, likely questioning what happend to his partner. Getting off, Sai opened the gate to enter the homes yard to glimpse the huge ninja as close as possible. Noticing cum staining the area he made sure to evade every drop. The pale white ninja got a glimpse of powerful veins pumping blood across Kiba's mountainous muscles. Kibas huge hands moving up and down the larger dong as deep moans  emanated from Kiba's head, which has lay hidden behind his colossal third leg. Massive toes digging into the earth with each wiggle. The ground even seems to be compressing under his weight. Jumping onto the top of a nearby cum covered tree, he finally saw Kiba's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba! Can you hear me?\" No response from the giant, who seemed to be in a dream even as he moaned.<br>\r\n\"Kiba!\" Yelling louder, nothing came from above except more deep moans of pleasure, the dog nin dreaming about dominating Naruto and taking his place as the worlds biggest Hokage.<br>\r\n\"Should I make a large bird to help communicate with him? No that will take too long. Best send him to the lab\" He jumped down beneath its white goop covered branches and prepared the jutsu, the scroll out as he swiftly arrived at it. Activating the jursu, Kiba's body puffed away, grabbing Akamaru's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja dog looked around to see Sai. \"Woof woof!\" his fur looked oddly youthful to Sai considering how old he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Akamaru. I sent him somewhere he can get help.\" Sai .pved his hand to pet the whote firred dgs head, who approved of his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Why don't you help me Akamaru? I'm looking for the stuff that changed Kiba and I could definitely use the help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof woof!\" Akamaru agreed. The large dog wanted to know why Kiba changed. He was as smart as other Ninja dogs even if he couldn't speak in human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I don't think the vial survived Kibas growth so I'll send my imitation beast to grab photos of what we are looking for.\" He moved outside the destroyed residence with Akamaru to see his creation. \"Go to the Hokage's office and get me a photo of the item I seek.\"  With that the lion-dog was off. Turning back to the ruined residence covered in cum, he checked his ink to make sure he had enough. He did, and looking up he gave a quick sign to the eagle to continue the search, which stopped its circling to continue its duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have enough to clean up this mess thankfully. You relax until its we get a lead Akamaru.\" The dog nodded before relaxing on clean grass. \"Hopefully the vial is in this mess.\" Sai got to work making more Imitation Beast slugs to clean up the mess and hopefully find an intact vial for Akamaru to sniff out.</span></div></div>",

Mitsuki was impressed when he saw Boruto\u2019s body after they stood up. Judging how he came just below Boruto\u2019s chest, he estimated that Boruto was a foot taller than his dad. (Naruto\u2019s originality 5\u201911) In nothing but his tight boxers, Mitsuki could see how much Boruto\u2019s muscles had grown. He resembles a heavyweight bodybuilder with broad shoulders and huge pecs. His arms and legs looked like they could crush someone in them. Mitsuki then blushed at the idea of being held by Boruto\u2019s huge arms.<br>\r\n\u201cMitsuki...\u201d Mitsuki snapped out of it and looked at Boruto\u2019s face. \u201cI feel great! I need to try this body out!\u201d Mitsuki was all for it. But then remembered a problem.<br>\r\n\u201cWait a sec. Look at your body.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I know!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Boruto looked down and blushed as he remembered that he was in nothing but tight boxers. \u201cWait here.\u201d Mitsuki left Boruto\u2019s room and came back with larger clothes.<br>\r\n\u201cThese are my dad\u2019s\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell you certainly can\u2019t fit into your own.\u201d He put on the black pants with no problem, a little snug. Same with the white shirt. It highlighted Boruto\u2019s new frame. And the orange jacket pronounced it more so. Mitsuki thought Naruto\u2019s tight clothes on Boruto looked amazing.<br>\r\n\u201cBrother?\u201d Himawari opened the door. \u201cDaddy?\u201d She looked confused.<br>\r\n\u201cBoruto and I were going to go train and he went on ahead. The shadow clone of your dad came to get something he forgot.\u201d Mitsuki said with his excuse.<br>\r\n\u201cOh okay. So that\u2019s what those weird noises were.\u201d Boruto and Mitsuki blushed. Himawari then left.<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s go before your mother comes home.\u201d Boruto then ducked to leave his room, and again for the front door.<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t everyone mistake me for my dad?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad. Besides, most will think you\u2019re his shadow clone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they only knew how big Naruto was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then traveled as soon as they could to the training grounds. By the time they got there, Boruto had nearly outgrown his clothes. His calves, forearms, and navel are exposed as he had grown a whole foot.</span></div></div>",

It was one thing to be naked around men, naked in front of women, and a married one at that. To make matters worse, her presence reminded him of what he and Naruto had done in the heat of their growth.

Kurama hated humans for trying to imprison and enslave him for there own gains, wile at the same time Naruto had had suffered loneliness and scorn for being the Nine Tails Jinchuriki.

All the alien, demon, monster, etc. problems had been taken care of and Goku was taking a well deserved break. It gave him time to reflect on the situation of the Earth. It seemed that everytime an alien threat was neutralized another, more powerful, threat rose to match it. He had already reached his limit several times, pushing past it to impossible levels of power, and yet he was at the end of his rope. Whatever came next, if anything came next, it would be too much for him to take care of. He knew that Gohan would be able to keep fighting for awhile, but for how long? How long would his power last with the life style he's chosen? One of books and studying rather than protection and fighting? No, it was up to Goku to keep the Earth safe. It always had been. There had to be a way to get stronger. Maybe Korin would know of a way. He was knowledgable of the Senzu Beans, magic beans that gave a person back his energy. Maybe there was something he could use to get stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving decided, he jumped up, put his fingers to his forehead, and concentrated on finding Korin's ki signature. It didn't take long and he was soon standing in Korin's Tower. Korin himself was just coming up from the downstairs area of the tower when he spotted Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Goku.\" He said, walking over to the saiyan. \"What brings you here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a way to get stronger.\" Goku said, getting right to the point. \"There's no telling when another hidden threat could arise and this time I might not be able to defend the Earth against it. Is there anything you can give me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....\" Korin said, tapping his walking stick thoughtfully. \"I have been developing a new kind of Senzu Bean. It's supposed to increase energy and raise your strength. But they're still in the experimental stage and could be dangerous. Are you sure you want to risk it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Goku said enthusiastically. \"I don't care what the side affects are. I need to get stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Korin said. \"I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku waited patiently while Korin walked back downstairs. He was only gone for a few minutes before he came walking back up with a bag in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are six beans in here. That's the best I can do for now. Don't take too many at once and report back to me any side affects you may be experiencing or if they're not working correctly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it! Thanks Korin!\" Goku waved before jumping from the tower and flying back towards his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Goku to get home. He opened the bag and pulled out one of the beans. It was red instead of the usual greenish color of the Senzu Beans and it was slightly bigger. He tossed one in his mouth and chewed it up. It tasted the same as any other Senzu Bean. He swallowed it and waited for something to happen.</span></div></div>",

The tingling was quickly replaced with a burning feeling causing Goku to start to sweat slightly. In seconds he started feeling heavier. Looking into the mirror he saw his body was swelling again! He flexed his arm and watched as it peaked to its full monstrous size and then continued rising! His chest stretched wider along with his shoulders as his back muscles flared out. His legs thickened pushing them apart, the floor actually starting to creak under his increasing weight. Goku put his arms behind his head and crunched his abs making them jumped out as his six pack increased to an eight pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Goku flexed the different areas of his body, he was slowly rising out of the mirror's view. Soon the only thing visible in the glass of the mirror was his huge abs near the top and his impressive package in the middle with a portion of his mammoth thighs at the bottom. His growth came to a stop when Goku's head was pressed tight against the ceiling. He laughed as he looked himself over, the power flowing through him greater than ever.Goku felt like he could take on anyone or anything. Moving his arms and legs around, bending down, Goku realized his movements were not inhibited at all. His muscles were massive but the red senzu bean must've done something to allow his body to move freely. Goku grinned as he stretched to his full height his head cracking against the ceiling. Looking up Goku pressed his palms against the ceiling. He applied a slight pressure and a huge chunk of the ceiling broke off lifting into the attic. Tossing the piece aside in the attic Goku stood up as straight as he could and found that everything from his eyes up were in the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to fix the ceilings in this place.\" Goku said to himself looking around. \"We're going to have to get the ceilings raised a few feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku bent down and walked to the door of his room. He tried to bend down and fit through the doorway but he was just too wide. He turned to the side and tried again but his pecs still got caught in the doorway. Finally, he just grabbed each side of the door frame and pushed ripping it open wider, cracks running along the walls. Goku laughed and said, \"Maybe we just have to have the whole house rebuilt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku squeezed out of his room and made his way down the little hallway. As he reached the living room his stomach started growling fiercely. He changed course and quickly made his way to the kitchen. He ripped the door off the fridge and started grabbing things out of it at random Everything that didn't need to be prepared he ate up leaving him with a bunch of frozen food and things that needed to be added to other food like sour cream, eggs, and lemon juice. His stomach roared in protest demanding more food. Goku sighed and kept looking through the cupboards pulling off doors in his haste to find more food.</span></div></div>",

Goku was really getting turned on by his new size, and how puny everything looked in comparison. His dick was now fully hard and massive, and he was fighting images in his head of impaling his young teen son on his huge dick and pulverizing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you're here, why don't you help your giant dad feel good?\" Goku growled, putting his huge hand on the back of Gohan's little head, which easily fit in his palm, and forcing the boy's face against his slimy veiny shaft. Gohan reaches up and puts both his small hands on Goku's massive shaft and strokes it best he can as his giant father starts forcing his little boy against his dick, spraying pre-cum in even bigger volleys over his boy's shoulder and occasionally over his head and hitting the ceiling or adjacent wall like a water canon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku flexes his biceps as he towers over Gohan, he needs to get off...</span></div></div>",

Emerging from the ruined kitchen Goku could stand comfortably now in the open, he again grabbed Gohan in one fist and held him against his pulsing shaft, using the boy's small body to stimulate his huge cock for a second, he dropped to his knees and held the kid face-down in front of him, positioning his huge body over the boy, mounting the small body. At first glance it would appear he was prepping for some push-ups, but another look would reveal his little son pinned beneath the huge muscle giant, the man's cock more than half the size of his son's body, was now poised over his little butt, the shaft covering his back, and the head just passing over the boy's head. Goku gripped the teen's jeans with one hand and tore them easily from the kid, along with his boxers. His huge dick was now pouring out precum like a fountain, covering Gohan completely, and forming a puddle beneath the boy of muddy cock slime in the grass. The entire time Gohan had been whimpering, squirming, shouting, trembling, and occasionally screaming or squealing, as his huge father wordlessly hulked out of their house, and carried him to the yard and held him down under his dick. The boy was now babbling urgently, begging his father to let him up, fearing he knew what his father was about to do to him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Goku confirmed the boy's fears, ignoring his desperate pleas, powerfully thrusting his monstrous cock brutally into his teen boy victim with a fraction of his muscle's full power. He tore into the boy, pounding away at the small ass, his huge dick traveling deep into the young kid's body, visible in his back as Goku forced it deeper and deeper, thrusting as if he were fucking a loose pussy. Goku ground his dick deeper into Gohan's body and humped hard with the boy impaled on his dick. Unable to get his dick to fuck further into Gohan's now stiff and unmoving little body, Goku ground his dick; with Gohan's stuffed body wrapped around half of it, into the pre-cum soaked ground beneath him. Stimulating his shaft in the tightness of Gohan, as if the boy were nothing but a sex-toy wrapped on his dick. He reached down gripping the boy's body and used him to jack off. Effectively crushing the boy against his shaft as he did so, when he finally felt his balls churning to cum he squeezed with all his might. He felt gallons of jizz traveling up his shaft, ready to blast away, he shot off, spraying the whole area in his thick jizz, realizing nothing remained of his little fuck toy but a pulp resembling lube on his massive shaft. He felt his dick throbbing hard again, even as he continued to paint the yard, trees, and some of the lake with his gallons of cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hungry for more, his sweat covered muscles bulged as he flexed for himself, he was pumped, horny, and huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed more...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He picked up the bag the beans were in and swallowed it whole. At first there was nothing but then the burning sensation came. Goku shot upwards, expanding in size. His muscles thickened as he was growing. Goku reached about 200ft tall. He was sitting on the ruins of his house. Well, one ass cheek was crushing what was left. His dick was pouring out precum, making the lake rise. Goku sat there, feeling his new body, loving how big he was and what he could do.<br>\r\nIn the distance, Goten was returning from school and he brought Trunks home with him so they could play. They saw a large figure rise up from nothing.<br>\r\n\"What was that.\" questioned Trunks.<br>\r\n\"Let's go find out.\"<br>\r\nGoten and Trunks flew over to the figure and as they got closer and closer they came to realise that it was Goku.

Up and down he rubbed, bruising the young boy. Goku's precum showered the little sex toy non stop.<br>\r\n\"DAD WHAT ARE YOU DOING!\" yelled goten.<br>\r\nGoku did not respond. He continued to use Trunks until nothing was left. He rubbed Trunks so hard into his member that he mushed him into nothing, leaving nothing but a red stain on his impressive cock.<br>\r\n\"MORE MORE. I NEED MORE!\"<br>\r\nGoku then stared down at Goten or was more scared than he had ever been. Goku grabbed Goten and brought him to his face. He opened his mouth and threw Goten inside. He sloshed his son around, playing with him using his huge tongue. After a while he spat Goten out and lowered in towards his cock.<br>\r\n\"No d d dad.\" a crippled gohan begged.<br>\r\nGoku ignored is son's pleas and brought Goten to his slit. He stuffed goten legs inside of him.<br>\r\n\"THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING!\"<br>\r\nHe then inserted the rest of Goten inside of him. Goten was pulled down his father member. He was being coted by the precum that was stuck to the walls. He could smell the old piss and cum, as well as the new. He was being dragged down, Goku enjoying the feeling of having someone travel down his dick. Goten landed in a pool of his father's cum. It coated him instantly and started to eat away at him. Goten clothes were burned off, leaving him nude in his father's balls. The cum started to slosh around, making huge waves of cum that crashed into Goten. Goku was fondling his balls, getting pleasure from having his son in his sack.<br>\r\n\"Time to get you out of there.\" said Goku.<br>\r\nGoku started to stroke his member. The veins becoming more visible with each pump. The cum in his balls was rising, readying for it's release. Goku released everywhere, firing globs of cum in every direction, painting the landscape. In one of those globs was the broken body of Goten, coated in his father's seed. Goku was panting and sweating profusely. His sweat making the lake rise more, flooding the land near him. After Goku got his energy pack he looked for the cum glob with Goten in it. He eventully found the his broken son, stained from his jackoff.<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy that Goten.\"<br>\r\nGoten's response was just a gurgle noise. Goku lowered his hand and picked up Goten.<br>\r\n\"You look so delicious Goten and I am so hungry. Guess your going down the hatch.\"<br>\r\nThe last thing Goten saw was the giant mouth of his father opening widely. It was lined with Goku's huge teeth and strings of saliva connection from the roof to the tongue. Goku plopped Goten inside and swallowed him whole. A visible lump could be seen travelling down Goku's neck and disappearing into his muscular chest. Goten landed in his Goku's stomach and fell unconscious. This was Goten's last moments before being digested by his giant father.<br>\r\n\"That was so good. I can't wait to do that again. I should go to the city and have some fun with the people. It's not like they can stop me.\" Goku said to himself. Goku walked of in the direction of West City to continue his fun. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or perhaps he was simply in love with the idea of huge muscles and wanted it for himself. Whatever the reason for this sudden desire he wanted to act on it. Now.

The entire house shook as this happened. Luckily Goten was away at Trunks' house so they wouldn't have to worry about dealing with him right now. Eventually he would come home and find his brother and dad bigger than he remembered them but he would adapt to it fairly quickly. Hopefully he wouldn't want to get in on the giant action as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two Saiyans waited for Gohan's growth to kick in Goku leaned back against the counter, his feet sticking out in front of him. Gohan could smell a faint aroma wafting from the toes. It wasn't anything terrible since Goku was kept in generally good condition thanks to Chi-Chi's constant nagging. He had just taken a bath yesterday and his feet had been airing out for awhile so the smell wasn't intense. But there was definitely a smell. Gohan leaned over and smelled his dad's foot, taking in the smell. He felt himself get hard. He rearranged himself aimlessly wondering why this was turning him on. Goku noticed his son's predicament and playfully pushed him over with his foot. Gohan yelped slightly as he hit the floor than grinned up at his dad. He leaned forward and started tickling Goku's feet. Goku started laughing and kicked out, nearly knocking Gohan back. Luckily Gohan dodged the kicks and kept tickling until Goku was completely on the floor, laughing, his massive chest rising up and down. Gohan finally relented and started rubbing his dad's feet as the giant Saiyan caught his breath. Goku laid still, enjoying the sensation of his son's small, yet warm and gentle, hands glide over his soles, rubbing more forcefully at the heel, and rubbing each toe individually. Gohan leaned forward and licked playfully at the toes, watching in delight as they curled and Goku giggled again. Feeling his pants grow more and more tight Gohan took the big toe in his mouth and slowly sucked it before moving onto the next toe and the one after that. When all the toes had been sucked, his tongue went slowly down the foot until reaching the rough heel. Goku moaned as the slimy pink muscle bathed his foot in saliva. Gohan knew he couldn't take much more of this foreplay, enhanced by the knowledge that he would start growing any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Gohan do next?</span></div></div>",

He says he will eventually but I'm starting to think he's lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku grabbed his son in a hug and said, \"Don't worry son.

He'd probably wouldn't fit in the drum like he used to but if all else failed he could always bathe in the lake. With both boys out of the house Goku was alone with only the smell of his own cum to keep him company. He loved being big. He had set out with a desire to get stronger and the beans he had had done far more for him. And there were still so many left! There was so much he could do with them! He knew Gohan and Goten would both join him if he wanted, but was that what he wanted? While he did like being big there might not be a way to reverse this. Then again, did he want to reverse it? All these confusing double thoughts ran through Goku's head as he tried to decide what to do. Gohan was going to grow sooner or later and he would feel the same feelings Goku was feeling right now. Would he be able to control them? He had already ran to eat one of the beans without even thinking about the consequences. When he grew would he just push his father out of the way to grow more? Goku started getting a little paranoid with these thoughts running through his head and decided to hide the bag of beans. He squeezed into his room, managed because of the cum covering his body, and grabbed the bag from where Gohan had left it. Looking around he remembered Chi-Chi had a secret compartment under the floor where she kept her most personal and prized possessions. He opened this trap door and dropped the beans inside. Now he would be able to distribute them without worry. Goku stared at the red beans, glinting in the light. He bit his lower lip and glanced at the door. What would he do now?</span></div></div>",

The three boys all sat in a pile, content that their work was over. Goten yawned and Gohan noticed that the sun had set while they were cleaning.

He left the house and flew towards the city to the grocery store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched the ground right outside the city, hoping no one had seen him, and walked a couple minutes. He stepped inside the store and walked around. He knew this was going to be hard because whatever he got for himself and Goten, he would have to get alot more to feed his gigantic father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn't fair! These thoughts coursed through him and he glared at Goten. Then Goten ran up to him and picked him up, holding him close to his thick chest and he shouted happily, \"Look Gohan! I grew too! You're not mad are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Gohan saw Goten's sad expression at the fact that he might be mad all his anger dissipated. How could he be mad at his sweet little brother? It wasn't Goten's fault Gohan hadn't grown too. It was just one of those little quirks of nature that couldn't be helped. Being mad wouldn't do anything except make Goten feel bad. So Gohan smiled and said, \"No way Goten! I think it's awesome having a big little brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten cheered happily and set Gohan down. \"Thanks Gohan! I'll be the best big little brother I can be to my little big brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan laughed and started unpacking the groceries he had bought. He had bought enough food expecting Goku to be huge but now that Goten was equally enormous there might not be enough food here. When everything was unpacked and put away Gohan turned to his giant family and said, \"So what have you two been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and dad played the same game you guys did before!\" Goten said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan looked at his father in shock but Goku waved his hands and said, \"No, no, no!

It was a little rough but this was probably Goten's first time doing something like this and Gohan couldn't complain. Spikes of pleasure radiated out from his dick into his lower stomach before shooting up through his body down to the soles of his feet. He started breathing heavier and started thrusting into Goten's hand. Goten felt him squirming around and said, \"Are you alright Gohan? I'm I doing okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan nodded his head furiously, the pleasure too great for him to speak. Within minutes cum was gushing out over Goten's hand and dribbling on the floor.

It started perking up as Gohan teased it with a finger, running it along the head and shaft. Gohan lapped at the balls making his sure his dad's dick was good and hard. When it was he promptly ignored it and moved up higher. He straddled his dad's waist and started licking at the abs, running his tongue into the grooves and grinding his ass against Goku's throbbing member. Goku moaned in approval, urging Gohan to continue. Gohan grabbed onto Goku's shoulders and lifted himself up, licking the furrow between Goku's huge pecs. He nibbled on each nipple, standing them erect. He teased them with his fingers for a bit making Goku gasp slightly before stopping the gasping with his mouth. Gohan's tongue darted out and forced itself between Goku's lips, tasting the inside of the much larger Saiyan's hot mouth. While Goku was weak Gohan shoved forward, breaking the chair they were on and sending Goku on his back. Goku broke their kiss with a shocked expulsion of air onto Gohan's face. Gohan could feel his father's precum leaking down the shaft and pooling on his butt and legs. Turning around he grabbed the head and started rubbing, the pre getting all over his hands and chest now as well. Goku sat up and forced his dick against Gohan's body, the purple mushroom head slapping Gohan repeatedly in the face. Gohan's tongue popped out and started licking all around the taught flesh of the head, his fingers seeking the slit and digging into it. Goku yelped in pure pleasure as he felt his son's nimble fingers reach inside him, tickling the urethra. Gohan's feet massaged Goku's balls and he could feel the cum building up inside. He was so close, so close. Gohan suddenly jumped up and took as much of his father's head into his mouth as he could, sucking and licking, precum spattering down over both sweaty, heaving bodies. With a house rattling shout Goku exploded into Gohan's mouth, the cum spurting all over both of them even as Gohan did his best to drink it. When Goku finally finished spewing cum like a fire hose both men were covered in the sticky white gold. Goku fell backwards, panting, as Gohan flopped down on top of him. He turned around and slid himself up to his father's face, kissing him on the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that good enough?\" he asked, his breath tickling his father's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku only managed to nod weakly in response.</span></div></div>",

Before Gohan could question Goku on what he was doing Goku took his son's cock in his large hand. Gohan gasped as he felt his father's muscular paw slowly slide up and down his shaft. Goku smiled down at his son and said, \"You worked so hard I have to return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan gasped as Goku's large thumb stroked his head, heat flaring up at the attention. Gohan's breathing grew more and more heavy as his father continued to massage his dick with his hand. Suddenly he felt himself being lifted up and turned around. Goku opened his mouth and took his son completely in his mouth. To Gohan it felt like his cock was suddenly encased in a warm, moist cave. Goku's huge tongue lapped over he relatively tiny manhood, covering it completely and making Gohan shout out in pure lust. His hands dug into his father's hair and he came violently in his mouth. Goku easily swallowed all of it and Gohan lay limp in his arms. Goku tucked his son in one arm and Gohan happily laid against his father's muscles. He was so relaxed, so tired. Goku stroked his son's hair and whispered, \"We should get cleaned up son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan nodded sleepily and stood up, slipping in some of his father's cum that was still wet on the floor. This woke Gohan up slightly more and he muttered, \"We have to clean up in here too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku stood up slowly and replied, \"Bath first though.\"</span></div></div>",

This was the first time he stood straight up since he grew and he was in awe of how everything was so small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked over to the bathing drum, but realized Goku wouldn't be able to fit. So they walked over to the nearby lake and jumped in. Goku wanted to jump in first, that way there wouldn't be a chance he would hit Gohan. Gohan gasped when his huge father jumped in. It was the biggest splash he had ever seen, with water going everywhere. Gohan jumped in next, but knew his splash wouldn't be anywhere near his fathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the rest of the time play7ing and having fun. Gohan felt like a kid when he climbed onto his dads back and put his arms around the giants neck. They even washed each other for a while, though it took Gohan longer to wash his dad's huge body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were finished and made their way back inside.

Goku's cum was splattered over everything inside. There was no surface in the kitchen that was free of cum. Goku sighed and said, \"We should probably clean this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Gohan who grabbed his dad's shoulders and forced him to the ground. Before Goku could say anything Gohan's soft lips locked with his own. Once more Goku felt his son's tongue invade his mouth, probing the large insides. Gohan broke the kiss and whispered, \"As long as it's dirty we might as well make the most of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that statement Gohan turned and started massaging his father's dick. Deciding to try something new Goku grabbed his son's legs and lifted him off his body. Standing up Goku brought Gohan's genitals to his mouth and started licking them. Gohan was hanging in such a way that he could still easily reach his father's super cock and could keep ministering it. Both men were panting within minutes as they 69ed each other furiously. Gohan came first exploding his small amount of seed into his father's cavernous maw. When he was done cumming he stuck his tongue deep into Goku's slit and started licking for all he was worth. Goku screamed and came violently covering himself and Gohan all over again in cum, the kitchen getting a second coating. Gohan lapped up as much cum as he could reveling in the taste. He turned to kiss Goku again but felt him stick something in his mouth. He swallowed reflexively and asked, \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your reward.\" Goku said with a smile. \"Remember? If you did a good job you'd get a bean. Well you did a lot more than just a \"good\" job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan hugged his dad lovingly and said, \"Thank you!\"</span></div></div>",

He whispered in his dad's ear, \"Want to go further?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku felt his heart beat faster as he thought about it. He had never thought this situation would ever arise but looking into Gohan's eyes he could tell that he wanted it. This kind of thing would be frowned upon twice if looked at from a human's perspective. But then he wasn't human. And his son was only half human. From all the stories he'd heard from Vegeta about his home planet there weren't many sexual taboos. If a Saiyan needed sexual release anyone would do. There were no familial relationships when it came to sex of any description. Vegeta wouldn't go into details, even though the ever curious Goku had asked, but Goku had spent enough time among other people in relationships to know what kind of things went on in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought sharply out of his thoughts as Gohan bit his lower lip, pulling it out slightly. Goku moved in and kissed his son, turning him over on his stomach. And there it was. Gohan's ass. His dick was hard as granite and he only wanted one thing and that was to plunge his meat into that sweet, tight hole. Before he did anything rash he asked Gohan, \"Have you ever done this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan shook his head and said, \"Be gentle but don't be afraid. You're really strong but so am I. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku nodded and licked two of his fingers. He stuck them between Gohan's butt cheeks and slowly inserted them up to his first knuckle, then his second knuckle, until the fingers were totally immersed. Gohan sucked in air and bit his lips, not wanting to say anything. It wasn't as bad as he thought it would be, but then, only two fingers were in him. Goku pulled the fingers in and out a few times before pulling them all the way out. He licked a third finger and inserted all three back into Gohan's glory hole. Gohan stoically took these fingers, his hole stretching out more. Finally, after plunging the hole several times with his fingers, he positioned himself over his son and said, \"I'll go in slow but tell me if I'm hurting you too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan nodded vigorously, clearly impatient for some action. Goku nodded, steeling himself for his first sexual encounter with Gohan. He pressed the hot tip of his cock against Gohan's hole and inserted it in. Gohan moaned loudly, feeling his father's massive dick filling him completely. He twisted his head and saw that Goku's cock was only a quarter of the way in. His own dick was painfully hard as he felt his father pull out slightly and push further in. God, it was so hard! It felt like he was being split in half! But it was only halfway in! He could feel tears stinging his eyes it hurt so bad. But he wanted this so badly he didn't care. Goku pulled out a little again and pushed all the way in, the slick skin on his groin pressing against Gohan's butt. Gohan squirmed and moaned as Goku pulled out almost all the way and pushed in again. He repeated this motion several times Gohan thrashing and moaning like never before. Goku started leaking precum which made the job a lot easier. Soon Gohan's hips were working in concert with Goku's, both men grunting and sweating, and thrusting. As Goku felt his balls fill with cum he reached around and started jerking Gohan off. Gohan's mind was clouded completely by all the pleasure, slightly tinged with pain, that was coursing through his body. He had never felt so hot and so alive. When he felt Goku explode in his anus his own dick exploded showering the floor in even more cum. Goku collapsed on top of Gohan, panting with exertion. Gohan felt his entire body relax, Goku's dick still rammed inside him. Goku slowly pulled out and laid down next to his son. Gohan, exhausted, rolled over and kissed Goku's chest, snuggling close to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad...\"</span></div></div>",

Goku laughed at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sirry to burst your bubble son, but your bed would be too small for you now. You'd crush it the second you sat on it\". Gohan blushed, wondering how he could not have thought about that before. So instead, he laid back down , next to his father. Goku put an arm around his sons shoulders and pulled him close. Looking outside, Gohan realized the sun had almost set, so going to sleep now seemed like the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Goku heard his son start to drift off to sleep, so he closed his eyes to let himself drift off.

Gohan gently lifted the floorboard and grabbed a bean from the bag. He quickly shoved the bean in his mouth and swallowed. Gohan then crawled back to the kitchen to see Goku still asleep.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course he couldn't get out. Before he ate the second bean, he barely could pass through a door, he had to crawl... seconds after eating it, he had added over a foot to his height and his muscles had thickened considerably. That small difference was enough to impede him to escape, he could only put his head, one arm and a part of his torso out beyond the doorframe (his both shoulders were now too broad to fit in the doorframe, no matter in which position).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately stopped trying to pass, got all his extremities back to the bedroom and sat on the floor, feeling another growth spurt coming. Gohan was such a good kid and didn't want to broke the doorframe or any other part of the house with his expansion, but he was running out of options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announced growth happened, and his muscles were the main protagonist of it... all his muscles thickened at once, and forced to his shoulders to move away from each other to get more space to grow even more. Gohan's build was becoming more and more similar to Broly's, while his bones elongated slowly, inching his legs further, bumping against the furniture, while his back was pressing against the wall, covering a bigger area of it as his transformation progressed. Even sitting, his head was almost touching the ceiling... the destruction of his house was imminent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan managed to maintain his composure. He believed he could stop the growth concentrating... and indeed, as he remained calm, the growth seemed to slow down... but then he noticed his new erected cock, doubling the size it got after the first bean... It could almost reach his pecs, and it was so fat... so hard and warm...  pulsating... Gohan salivated... he felt so horny... he couldn't help grab it with his big hand... and then another surge of growth overloaded his whole body. His head bumped the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe violently masturbated, first with one hand, but then it twitched in a growth spasm and become too thick for his grasp, he added another hand... and when it elongated enough, he only had to bent his back a little to do himself a blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku waked up, but it wasn't the noises what awakened him, it was the incredible amount of Ki his son emitted.<br>\r\nHe was his son, almost two times bigger than him and incredible muscular, completely out of your wits and possessed by the lust. And as his body grew, his power and energy increased too at an alarming rate. He was in his base form, not super saiyan or mystic, but he was multiples times stronger than a SSJ3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was clearly dangerous. Goku could see in his son's face sexual pleasure, but also an increasing pain. His body couldn't assimilate so much energy. Instinctively, he was trying to burn the excess of energy by masturbating, but he couldn't do it fast enough to archive the orgasm. It was up to him to save his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped to his son lap and hugged his cock. It was longer than his torso. He rubbed his whole body against it, but there wasn't enough friction to bring him closer to the climax. He was like a third hand clumsily stroking his giant cock...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He needs something more erotic... more intimate... anal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed the giant cock (becoming bigger every second) and sit in the pink head, partially covered with his taned foreskin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The head is almost as big as my ass... but I won't quit! My son's life depends of his!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the border of his glans and pulled, forcing the enormous cock to enter inside his anus. A saiyan anus is way stronger and flexible than a human one, and Goku's one has improved those qualities after eating a growing bean... but even after that, it hardly could put it up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad... mmgh!... stop... you could... mmmhhh... die...\" Gohan warned him as the whole head of the penis got inside his ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis son's moaning indicated him it was working, and encouraged Goku to go further. He used his flying powers to push his body down. and bang!, half of the giant dick fit inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku cried, and his hair turned longer and golden... he became Super Saiyan 3 so his body could survive to the impalement.  Goku stopped moving, still alive, but exhausted. his abdomen was bloated due the giant cock inside him. Suddenly, his son hand grabbed his body pretty tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't answer Goku. Gohan was barely conscious, and his saiyan instincts had taken control over his body. And for a Saiyan, the first priority is survive and the second is the pleasure, so he had to reach the climax no matter what... or who... is destroyed in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis son's grasp become tight and start moving Goku's body up and down, like a sexual toy. 3/4 parts of his cock got inside his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHH!\" Goku screamed \"Gohan!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting worse. His body was growing again and, with it, his cock elongated and thickened inside the warrior. Gohan's feet pressed against the opposite wall, the ceiling cracked because of the preassure of his head. His muscles blew up again in another spasm, making Broly look scrawny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAH!!\" Both saiyan shouted out, one of pleasure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, the orgasm. His cock released cum like a hose, inflating Goku's belly even more just seconds before he was thrown upwards by the pressure of the liquid... the cum overflowed the room for a few seconds, until the walls and ceiling collapsed by a last growth spurt in his legs and torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan waked up surrounded by debris. He had destroyed that section of the house.<br>\r\nHe started to panic when he didn't see his father, but he finally founded almost a kilometer away (the force of the cumshot had thrown him really far)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, son...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku stood up and noticed how small he was now compared to his son. He was as tall as his crotch, making him two times bigger. If Goku was near 9 feet tall (270cm), his son seemed to have reached 18' (540cm).</span></div></div>",

On Earth there are certain things that are considered 'wrong'. On Planet Vegeta those kinds of things don't matter. So we, as Saiyans, aren't constricted by the moral laws of humans.

Goten flew there and knocked on the door to the company building. Trunks answered the door surprised to see Goten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Goten, what's up?\" Trunks asked his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your dad home Trunks? My dad wants him to come over today.\" Goten said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks raised an eyebrow and said, \"Really? What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten shrugged and said, \"He just told me to get him to come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks stepped aside and let Goten in. \"Alright Goten but good luck. He's training right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks took Goten to the Gravity Room and Goten looked through the window. Vegeta was inside, shirtless, training. Trunks pushed a button outside the room and Vegeta turned to look at the door. He walked over and opened it scowling at Goten. \"What is it Trunks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks pointed to Goten and said, \"Goten wants you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta turned from his son to goten and said, \"Well? What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta was sweating from his workout and Goten couldn't help but notice his toned body. Goten had always thought Vegeta looked more muscular than his dad, probably due to the fact that they were pretty much equal in musculature but Vegeta was shorter making the same amount of muscle crammed into a smaller frame. Vegeta's scowl deepened as Goten stared. \"Stop staring at me and tell me what you want now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten jumped and said, \"Oh right. My dad wants you to come to our house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta snorted and said, \"And why would I want to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku had told Goten that Vegeta would be stubborn. If Vegeta refused to come or asked for a reason why he should come Goten was to say the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad wants to spar with you to see how much you've improved. He says you weren't much of a challenge last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta's face reddened as he heard this statement from Goten, spoken so calmly. He slammed the door to the Gravity Room closed and snapped at Trunks, \"Tell your mother I'm going to Kakarot's. I'll be there for a few hours at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks nodded and whispered to Goten, \"Are you trying to make my dad mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten whispered back, \"My dad told me to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta turned around and said, \"Stop whispering! It's irritating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks and Goten were silent as Vegeta stormed upstairs getting dressed. He wore one of his basic outfits and stepped outside. Goten quickly followed him and both flew back to Mt. Paouzu where Goku and Gohan were waiting. Vegeta pounded on the door and shouted, \"Kakarot get out here! You want a fight you'll get a fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku's voice drifted out from the house, \"I think you should come in here first Vegeta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta growled and muttered, \"I don't have time for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

He reflexively swallowed it whole not even bothering to chew. He coughed a little as it slowly went down his throat and into his stomach. When he was finished coughing he looked up into Goku's face and said, \"Kakarot...how did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku explained about his need to get stronger and how he was given the red beans and how they changed him into what he was now. He then told Vegeta that he had fed him one of the very same beans he had eaten and that he would grow like him. Vegeta's expression of shock slowly changed to one of satisfaction. He had come to terms with Goku being the stronger of the pair but he had never stopped training in the hopes of tipping the scales in his favor once again. Seeing his rival so much larger and obviously even stronger than before Vegeta had felt a hopeless despair growing in his chest. That despair was now firmly destroyed thanks to the fact that he would now grow as big as his rival. They would be on equal terms for height finally. Vegeta had never had a problem with his height since he had been more than strong enough to make up for it, but he would be lying if he said he had never thought about what it would be like to be taller. He loved to impose his presence on people in any way possible and being a muscle giant would be a big help in doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku saw Vegeta's expressions and did a pretty good job of deciding what they meant. He smiled down at Vegeta and said, \"When you grow you and me are going to have some fun together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta laughed shortly at that statement and said, \"When I grow I'm going to dominate you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku grinned wider at that and said, \"Looks like we've got a new rivalry going on Vegeta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta shook his head and said, \"No, it's the same rivalry. It's just on different terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten, who had been standing by watching this exchange said, \"Am I going to get to grow too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku ruffled his son's hair and said, \"When you're older Goten. For now you need to live as normal a life as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten pouted slightly at that but quickly recovered and said, \"I'm going to go play with Gohan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Goten disappeared back into the house Vegeta suddenly felt a surge of energy flow through him. He looked into Goku's eyes and said, \"I think it's starting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku sat back and watched as his rival began to grow. Just how big does Vegeta grow?</span></div></div>",

He looked up in surprise at Vegeta before Vegeta pointed to his crotch and said, \"Suck it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku grinned up at the dominating Vegeta and crawled closer until he was between Vegeta's legs. He lapped playfully at the limp head, slowly coaxing it to full erection. It was quite impressive, standing even longer and wider than Goku's. Just because Vegeta was short didn't mean he wasn't packing. Goku was glad for it as he breathed hotly on the organ. Vegeta shivered slightly before grabbing the back of Goku's head and forcing him closer. Goku felt the dick push into his mouth, forcing its way to the back of his throat. Goku quickly loosened his throat to prevent himself from gagging and started sucking the dick. Vegeta moaned as he felt Goku's hot mouth working his organ. Goku felt saliva pooling in his mouth, the liquid sloshing over Vegeta's dick until it was slimy with it. Pre cum was soon adding to the liquid in Goku's mouth and he quickly swallowed around the cock before it started dribbling out of his mouth. He wrapped his tongue around Vegeta's penis, licking it from every possible angle. Vegeta felt like he was getting closer and closer to climax, his hips bucking slightly into Goku's mouth without him being aware of it. It wasn't long before Vegeta came violently into Goku's mouth. Goku tried to swallow it all but the sheer volume of it made it difficult. Eventually some of it splashed onto the ground. When he was finished climaxing Goku licked all the come from the dick and licked his lips. Vegeta sat down and leaned against the house, the wall groaning from all the weight suddenly put on it. Goku was about to make his way back inside for a drink of water when he felt Vegeta's hand on his shoulder. Goku looked and saw Vegeta smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done with you yet my peasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Vegeta have Goku do next?</span></div></div>",

With his tongue, Vegeta forced Goku's mouth open and enjoyed himself exploring the large and humid cavity, which welcomed him hungrily. It wasn't an undying declaration of love, he didn't care enough for stupid human delusion, it was a prelude to what was about to come; He wanted to use each and every one of Goku's holes to satisfy himself, and hell, he was going to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta suddenly pulled away from the kiss and pushed Goku's head down to the floor violently, wetting his already-dirty, spiky hair in the half-dried puddle of cum from his previous orgasm \"Now I want to fuck your brains out, Kakarot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku didn't say a word, he just grinned at his mate from his position and shoved his fingers into his mouth, fully drenching them in saliva and quickly driving them into his very own hole. Despite having never used the \"back door\" he could fit two of his engorged fingers up to the knuckles rather easily and began to moan in pleasure while fingering himself. Vegeta, who was growing impatient every second, simply said \"Take it like a man, Kakarot!\" and forced two of his own fingers into the small cavity withouth the proper preparation, ramming them as deep and fast as he could in one push. In pain, Goku tried to pull away, but the other giant held him on place; Despite being mostly the same size, Vegeta was definitely stronger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds, and fingers, later, Vegeta decided it was time to plunge into the virgin bumhole, so holding Goku's hips firmly and without a warning, he quickly inserted his gigantic glans into the muscular butt. He would have liked to see his cock go all the way into Goku's ass from the very first strike, but no avail. He was just to huge and hi mate's anus was still too small to fit it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Goku whined, feeling his tight hole opening up forcibly with every push from Vegeta's powerful hips, but of course, the \"prince\" couldn't care less and instead kept trying to forcefully fit all of of his massive member in. It didn't really help that, while Goku and his son had big headed, slender dicks, Vegeta's was actually more pointy and thickened as it reached the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minutes later, Vegetas penis was already half the way up Goku's ass, but it wasn't enough for him, he wanted to feel his huge balls slamming against that bubble ass and his member scrambling up \"Kakarot's \" insides, so he kept pushing. Goku wasn't complaining anymore, he was just moaning soundly, feeling the gigantic shaft taring up his tiny, no longer virgin hole. he was in pain, no doubt about it, but he was also enjoying being impaled in Vegeta's enormous shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Why won't it fit in?!\" Vegeta yelled frustratedly while pounding harder, but he just couldn't fit any more of his cock inside Goku \"What an useless ass you have!\". Goku just kept groaning loudly and pushing himself into the penis; He really was trying to get it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill pushing, Vegeta noticed the bag of seeds thrown on the floor and reached out to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what you used to turn me into this\" The prince said to himself while an evil smirk formed on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I can't fit my hole dick inside you then...\"</span></div></div>",

I can only bring back people who hadn't been resurrected.\" Shenron could read the young lad's heart and his deepest desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of Goku's son turned into a pout of sadness, but he contained his feelings and continued talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I didn't come for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year had passed since his death. Although during that time Gohan was able to come to terms with it, a big part of him still missed him everyday... but also a smaller part resented him for wanting to stay in the Other World instead of with his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why did you call me for, summoner?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm the new defender of the Earth, but I'm not up to the task. I thought after Cell the world would be in peace, but a few months later an alien named Bojack appeared and almost killed me. I'm afraid new enemies will keep coming, each one stronger than the previous one. And I'm not my father, I don't know how to train well alone, I feel like I can't advance... and my mother wants me to study all the day. I can't tell her no, but that way I'll never get stronger and won't be able to match the next monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenron paid attention to every word of Gohan, intrigued about the wish he was going to ask to solve the dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So please, remove every bad guy like Cell or Frieza in the universe.\"<br>\r\n\"I cannot.\"<br>\r\n\"Why??\"<br>\r\n\"One of my limitations is being unable to grant damaging or hard-altering wishes which affect beings stronger than my creator, with some exceptions. I can't kill them, making them weaker nor turning them into good people... Although maybe I could, if they were already dead, but that wouldn't be useful to protect your world.\"<br>\r\n\"But... but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock made Gohan speechless. His plan was ruined.<br>\r\nThe silence was absolute during eternal seconds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... Then I want to become stronger than any of them! I want to be the stronger being in the universe!!\"<br>\r\n\"T-That's...\" The great dragon stuttered for a moment \"I fear I can grant that either. I could not make such a radical change on you. You're greatly stronger than my maker. Even if you weren't, the amount of power you want if so enormous that's beyond my capacity to give, and would put you in the same untouchable category.\"<br>\r\n\"SO WHAT CAN YOU DO!? TELL ME, WHAT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid exploded, turning into a SSJ2 with the anger... and seconds after the screams of fury became a weak ply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...help me...\" He muttered on his knees, back to his base state, almost sobering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenron looked at the depressed boy with something that looked like compassion and pity and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could grant you a smaller, more progressive, wish.\"<br>\r\n\"What? What wish?\"<br>\r\n\"You might ask for <i>enhancements </i>in your saiyan nature. You're one of the most powerful races in the universe, one that can break their own limits with training and sometimes just with rage. I could increase that feature in your metabolism so you would become stronger each day with the minimal effort of living.\"<br>\r\n\"That... would be perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes of the deity shone, and the wish was granted. He didn't feel different, but that was expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for your second wish...?\"<br>\r\n\"Second wish?\" Gohan didn't have much time to think about the other 2 wishes. \"The namekians and other people had stated that I have a great inner power, a potential strength that I could unlock with time or their help... maybe you could make that potential grow like the first wish?\"<br>\r\n\"Done.\" The dragon said, and wondered about the implications of making his potential grows as well as his external strength. That would means he'll never stop getting stronger, without a real limit to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as my third wish, I want to never grow weaker in any circunstance, even if I spend months eating snacks without moving a finger.\" He wasn't planning on doing that, but was afraid that the scholar life his mother wanted for him could damage his power.\"There's only one direction I want to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third wish was granted. Later the kid flew to his house. His mother was still sleeping and hadn't noticed his absence. He went to be and fell asleep with a smile, knowing that when he woke up a little stronger than he was then.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vegeta was not overly sensitive about his height.  After all, having enough power in his little finger blow up a planet was more then enough to make up for it.  What he did hate was anything, absolutely anything, in which Goku aka Kakarot had over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChalk it up to Vegeta's hyper competitiveness, or just to him being a guy.  It really doesn't matter since the net result is the same.  He wanted to be the best, the strongest, and ok maybe even sometimes in the corner of his mind he wanted to be the tallest.  On the other hand gathering the dragon balls to wish for power seemed, too petty, beneath him.  He was determined to become the strongest through hard work, by training on a level Goku couldn't imagine.  Hours upon hours a day were spent in 200 times earth's gravity trying to achieve just  a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally all this did not go completely unnoticed.  Trunks spent more time in training with his father, and then another ally in his quest developed: Bulma.  Setting aside the other reasons she had to help him there was a motive he didn't expect, science.  She used computer mapping to track his training and development, then would use that data to find ways to make his training even more effective.  Then to top it all of, she was able to develop a senzu-bean extract to add in with advanced protein shakes to make them roughly 1,000 times more effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was going well: Vegeta was getting stronger, Bulma was happy with her scientific achievement, and nothing seemed like it could go wrong. (cue dramatic music).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo understand what happened next involves knowing one other key factor.  Bulma always kept on of the dragon balls around.  It was a handy security measure that made sure no one could collect them all (other then the good guys).  She kept it next to the radar in her lab, until one day for unknown reasons, the nuclear core (think battery-sized) started leaking.  This went unnoticed because it was all absorbed by the dragon ball.  That became relevant on the day a power-up from Vegeta went particularly wild, broke the barrier of the gravity chamber, blew up half the lab, and knocked the dragon ball in the protein powder.  There was an unexpected reaction on the molecular level, the results of which would soon be felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his training session ruined for today, Vegeta went over to the machine Bulma had made to create his protein shakes, the one which had the now contaminated powder in it.  Not knowing this of course, Vegeta drank it without a thought and then went outside to try and find Bulma to the gravity chamber fixed.  He felt a little light headed, but that was something he would never admit to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, the feeling became too much for Vegeta to brush off.  He stopped while trying to figure out what was happening.  Something was different, almost like it felt when drawing up energy to power up to Super Sayan.  The next thing he noticed was that his clothing felt odd, tighter then usual.  Looking at his arms, Vegeta saw them bulge up as if he was flexing, but all the while he had stayed perfectly still.  His biceps swelled an inch larger as he watched, then another, then another, until in the matter of just a few seconds they filled out five inches larger.  Likewise his chest swelled out until it matched the proportions of his arms.  Vegeta even felt the power of his legs growing as the muscles became more defined then ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen seconds after it started, Vegeta's transformation was complete.  His body had swelled with muscle like he never expected to put on.  Tearing his gaze away from his own body wasn't easy to do, but when Vegeta did, everything looked different.  It took a few moments to realize why, he was taller, by at least 6 inches.  He stood in shock at the realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta suddenly found himself taller, stronger, and better then ever.  His clothing was strained to hold his enhanced body in, and did little to hide the strong physic that was now his body.  The only thing Vegeta could do in a situation like this was try to figure out what caused it...</span></div></div>",

''Bulma asked me here for an experiment and I'm honestly worried what kind of torment she'll put me through.'' He thought in worry. He knew very well declining her tends to make Bulma mad, and Vegeta would begrudgingly do whatever his wife says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the entrance Krillin was greeted by Dr. Briefs outside with his wife. \"Oh hello Krillin! You here for Bulmas latest experiment?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin nodded. \"Y-yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's in her lab. Best get to her before she gets mad.\" The old scientist replied as he sat down and started to eat with Panchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering their home Krillin quickly reached the lab in question, where Bulma had parts all over the place, a massive mechanical chamber, and a silly looking gun at the table. She was at the table herself, overlooking notes on a blueprint for the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here Bulma.\" The short fighter spoke first, hoping it would soften her fury for being late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, instead of the usual frustrated blue haired scientist was instead a smiling Bulma. \"Ah! My first test subject is here!\" She said with joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I was hoping to learn what it was you said was so important for me to get over and test. I was trying to do something at the time.\" Krillin responded. Though he couldn't admit he was trying to impress 18 only for it to fail spectacularly due to her call. 18 just gave him a smirk before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to enter this chamber behind me and test it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I made sure to work any kinks out first.\" Bulma replied honestly, but that worried Krillin all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any dangerous side affects? Will it turn me into anything weird?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. Im testing this invention on one of my friends afterall! Just get in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing she was strarting to get frustrated, he stopped asking questions. Looking at it, Krillin could tell it was nearly as high as the roof. The door to it was open, which showed the sterile and empty chamber within. Krillin hestitatingly entered the chamber, the door quickly shutting behind him as it lights began to turn on the outside of the invention. Looking at the outside, Bulma messed with the knob to set it on a taller sized man. With that a whirring began as the machine buzzed to life, a rthymic wave began to slowly push onto Krillin inside the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he heard cracking. *CRACK* His bones broke as they started to repair themselves, his arms began to lengthen as they stretched downwards. His legs lengthened as his torso began to stretch upwards. \"W-what's happening? I'm getting taller?\" he thought in surprise as his body stretched upwards. His height rose higher from his original size as he quickly reached 6 feet and grew just a tad higher to 6'4. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are my muscles shrinking?\" Indeed, the muscle he worked to keep was soon replaced by slender arms and limbs as they vanished. \"Should have known Bulma would have lied about there not being side affects.\" He sighed in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the machine began to slow down as the lights began to fade to black. With a *DING* the door popped open and Krillin was let outside where he now towered over Bulma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the first half of my invention works as intended. A way to make people taller!\" Bulma said with triumph as Krillin looked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes away all my hard earned muscle though.\" Krillin sighed. He really should have just stayed and try another way to make up to 18. He figured out pretty easily she chose him cause he was the shortest warrior amongst the lot once he started to get taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry! The gun I made was meant to remedy that part of the experiment.\" She said enthused as she brought it up. It had a sleek appearance and looked more appropriate for shooting lasers than restoring muscle. \"And with this we'll increase your muscle mass back to normal on your improved body!\" <i>Then I can test this out on subject no.2 and 3:Gohan and Goku</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin let her shoot him as he felt energy pulsate across his form...</span></div></div>",

The blie haired scientists had called him to test an experiment to help him keep up with his father and Piccolo, as his soft heart meant he didm't dedicate his life to it. As he walked to the entrance Gohan saw Bulma's parents happily eating together outside. \"Hey Mr. And Mrs. Briefs!\" Gohan waved to them before heading for the door as they waved back, only to fail to see before him as he collided face first with a thick living wall, knocking him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh sorry Gohan! Didn't see you there!\" Krillins enlarged face on a massive body looked down, having to adjust his eyesight to lok over his new beefy pecs, the stretchable armor worn by Vegeta covering his new frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-krillin?! What happened to you?\" Gohan said in surprise as he scanned him up and down. \"You look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Krillin cockily flexed a bicep, 27 inches of beef rising \"Bulmas new invention did this and I honestly feel strong enough to take on anyone!\" His ki was definitely higher than before. Gohan even felt it rivaled Piccolo's and was still rising. Looking down the bald man smiled as he realized what was going on. \"Figured she would try it on someone else though. Knew she wouldn't just do it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. She called me for an experiment to help me get my strength up.\" Gohan said as saw how the blue material stretched over every part of Krillins body, moving over to let Krillin move by and heexited the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well It definitely will! I'm going to go show off to and have a friendly spar with Goku.\" Krillin beamed. He was so excited to see Goku's reaction. He was starting to take flight to head to the Son household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't get cocky. You know my dad will get stronger as you fight.\" Gohan advised as Krillin started to speed up, hearing \"I won't!\" as Krillin sped up as white aura of ki surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan was happy his friend liked the changes. He'd known Krillin since he was a kid and fought with his dads friend all the way to Namek. The warrior who shaved his head had spent his life unable to keep up with Goku. Putting his thoughts aside Gohan headed for Bulma's lab. There the blue haired scientist was prepping the gun for use again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Bulma. Here as test subject number 2 for your invention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up, holding the ray meant for increasing muscle mass and ki. \"Hi Gohan. By your statement you've seen Krillins new appearance?\" His nod confirming it before she continued. \"Was hoping to keep it a secret before more people found out. Oh well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma began to activate the gun in her hand \"I'm only trying this one on you. You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Seeing how much Krillin's ki increased I'm ready to try this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Bulma turned the beam on him.</span></div></div>",

He was screaming as loud as he could, with his body covered with a saiyan aura, as the muscle growth ray kept bombarding him with more enlarging energies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a beat, all his muscles doubled its girth, ripping his clothes in a dozen of places. Another spasm, and they were doubled again, tearing them to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gohan, move!\" Bulma begged to the boy, but he couldn't. His muscles were paralized by the ray, keeping them flexed while it enlarged them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was similar to a hypermuscular SUPER SAIYAN THIRD GRADE, although Bulma could notice he was much, much stronger, and it was becoming even more powerful with every second<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wave of ki energy pushed the scientist back, who was fighting the air turbulences to reach the device to shut it down. The machine staggered, but it wasn't enough to make it fall. However, the trembling diverted the course of the grow beam, hitting Gohan's genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah AhAaAaaH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his screams became less painful and more pleasant. His penis became hard, growing bigger, surpassing the 15cm (6\") mark... 20cm mark (8\")... 25cm mark (10\"), in a neverending, evergrowing erection. And with each centimeter it gained in length, it grew several more in girth, becoming impossibly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was reaching the dimensions of a big bottle of wine the blast waves moved the device and the direction of the bean a third time, concentrating his power in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn spasm, and his pecs became more and more similar to Broly's... like the rest of his body.<br>\r\nHe was packing so much muscle his bones he couldn't move or breath... and eventually the increasing pressure of the growing muscles broke his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aAAAAAAAAAAAA\" Goku's son's voice was again filled with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma had suspected the ray might have a greater effect on saiyans than humans due the physical superiority of those aliens, but she had never expected so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the breaking of his bones was actually benign, making use of the breaks to lengthen them, making room for the muscle mass, reducing its pressure... until his ever-growing muscles filled again all the available room and broke his bones again, repeating the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was rising slowly but constantly, whereas his shoulders and girth were growing much faster...<br>\r\nAnd the amount of ki inside his body was increasing so incredibly fast, exponentially, he feared he was going to blow up. The skies reacted to his colossal Ki getting darker and releasing lighting bolts around the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind didn't let her getting close to the device, so she tried a different solution: turning off the <br>\r\nfuses (they were in another room) so the machine wouldn't receive more power. It worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she returned, he found Gohan laying on the floor. He looked huge, but Bulma didn't know how much until he got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis spiky hair was brushing the ceiling, meaning he was over 210cm (7 feet) tall now.<br>\r\nHe wasn't as tall as Broly (although he wasn't far from him), but he had the same muscular build, with gigantic pecs, biceps bigger than his head, thick muscular neck and legs... and, of course, those incredible shoulders... His shoulders were three times thicker than when he came in and probably could only pass through the door sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gohan...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma feared the extreme transformation would have affected his mind, but fortunately that was proved false. The mixed race warrior looked at her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Bulma... I can feel it now... I'm strong, so strong I feel I can match Vegetto's might. This is exactly what I wanted\"<br>\r\n\"Please, don't tell your mother I had something to do with your transformation...\" Bulma knew Chichi's temper and knew she would take experimenting with his son the wrong way...<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, she probably will think it's just a late growth spurt due to my grandfather's inherited genes.\" Chichi's father was really tall and stocky too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said goodbye to his friend and flew out to the sky, creating another blast wave that finished breaking the last remaining glasses in the windows of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this kid would learn how to control his power before he breaks everything in his home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma had to decide what to do next. He wished to test his machine one more time with Goku, but after the disastrous results with Gohan she wasn't so sure anymore.<br>\r\nAlso, she couldn't claim the ray's energy couldn't cause side effects or further growth later...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sea was shining a miraculous blue, the color of which couldn't be found anywhere outside the Grand Line. The Going Merry was currently slicing that blue aside as it traveled toward the next island indicated by the Log Pose. Nami was situated at the front of the boat looking out into the ocean, the map uncurled in her hand. Her finger was tracing a path along the islands trying to figure where the Log Pose was directing them. Down in the hold of the ship Sanji was preparing lunch for the crew while up in the crow's nest Usopp was keeping a lookout for enemy ships and the island itself when it chose to reveal itself. Zoro was sleeping in the shade while Luffy was leaning over the edge of the ship staring into the water. Everything was pretty quiet all things considered. Of course things never stay quiet for long on the Going Merry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SO BORED!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami turned around with a frown on her face and said, \"So do something to make yourself useful! Why don't you go and fish or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy pushed himself off the railing and landed on his back. \"Nah, I did that this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami sighed and said, \"Well...why don't you just be patient until we make it to the next island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy just stared at Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you looking at me like that? It's not like I have a bunch of activities planned for you if you get bored or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Usopp called out from the crow's nest, \"Land ho! I can see the next island!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy ran over to Nami and jumped out onto the figurehead of the Going Merry, scanning the horizon with a big grin on his face. Nami pulled out a telescope and managed to spot the island which was slightly to the right of the figurehead, Luffy's body slightly covering it. She looked at the Log Pose and found that it was pointing directly at the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! We should be there in fifteen minutes at most!\" Nami said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose fifteen minutes passed quickly as Luffy ran around excitedly with Usopp wondering what kind of adventures or treasures could be found on the island. Zoro woke up when they were five minutes from the island and Sanji came up a few minutes after that to tell everyone lunch was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time!\" Nami shouted grabbing Sanji by the collar and pulling him towards the edge of the ship. \"We've got to search that island up ahead for treasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know there's even treasure around here?\" Sanji asked, shaking himself from Nami's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned and pulled out a map. \"Surprise! I have a map! I bought it at the last island we visited and it just so happens that the Log Pose was pointing toward the island where the treasure is! Now come on! You and me are going to look for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji instantly followed Nami, hearts in his eyes and grand ideas of romance in his head. Nami, perhaps sensing this, collected Usopp to help as well. This left Zoro and Luffy to explore the island themselves. Luffy quickly charged ahead and jumped off the ship onto dry land. Zoro followed and both took stock of the island. It was standard fare, covered in a large forest as far as they could see. Hurrying into the trees Luffy and Zoro moved from clearing to clearing looking for anyone or anything on the island. Luffy was quickly becoming disappointed as there didn't appear to be anything special on the island. When they entered another clearing and there was nothing but a pool of water and a small grove of fruit trees he collapsed next to the pool and moaned, \"This place is so boring! It's just trees, trees, trees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro sighed and sat down next to his cabin. \"Well what were you expecting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy shrugged and said, \"I don't know. Some kind of monster or really great treasure or some weird guy. Anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it doesn't look like anything like that lives here. It's just an ordinary boring island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro laid down on his back and put his arms behind his head relaxing once again. Luffy splashed the pool slightly and looked down into the water. The water was surprisingly clear. He could see right down into the water. He dipped his hands in and pulled out a handful, slurping it up. It tasted surprisingly sweet, almost like a fruit drink rather than water. It left a strange buzz in Luffy's mouth not unlike an alcoholic beverage. He was about to drink more when his stomach started growling loudly. Walking over to the trees Luffy picked a few of the fruits and ate one. The fruit was extremely tender the flesh practically exploding juice in his mouth. He gobbled up fruit after fruit his stomach filling far more quickly than it ever did before. Sighing in contentment Luffy laid down next to the pool and drank more of the water. He drank and drank until his stomach was a sloshing ball. He turned over onto his back and sighed, rubbing his swollen tummy. In a matter of seconds he was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slept the fruit and water worked into his system, the power they contained filling every corner of his being. His stomach quickly shrank back down to normal as the water was absorbed into Luffy's body. Within seconds Luffy's body started changing drastically. His muscles pulsed and slowly started growing. His swollen stomach had burst open his vest earlier showing a full view of his pecs swelling outward while his abs deepened and rose like bread in an oven. His arms followed suit bulging upward as his shoulders broadened and his back tapered out. His triceps equaled his biceps while his forearms strengthened, his hands growing larger and stronger. His feet quickly broke the straps on his sandals as they thickened and lengthened until they could support the massive upper body that was being created. His thighs grew wider, pressing up against each other as his calves bulged outward straining his shorts to the point of destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy continued to sleep on as the changes finished, his body growing taller until he would have stood a foot above even Zoro. This put him dangerously close to the pool. Almost one half of his body was hanging off the edge, his body inches from the magic water.</span></div></div>",

When Tessai wasn't busy bringing in the new shipments or rearranging the store room, he would sit and chat with Urahara or go outside and break up a fight between Jinta and Ururu. Although, most of their fights were mostly one sided beatings Ururu being so meek. Jinta was getting fed up with his job. He was sick of spending all day everyday outside of the shop sweeping with only the gloomy Ururu to keep him company. All she did was nag at him when he wasn't always focused on the sweeping. She was boring to try and talk to because she was always worried about getting caught or getting in trouble. Finally, Jinta had had enough. He threw down his broom and went inside the shop Ururu watching him from a distance. Jinta was fully intent upon his mission of telling Urahara off when he noticed the store was empty. Whenever Urahara was out alone it was usually because he was with a customer in the back. Tessai was gone too. Jinta assumed this meant he was out back getting the rest of the days shipment. Fuming at his inability to release his anger over the manager, he stomped his way into the stock room to look at the new shipments. It was more of the usual stuff. A lot of it was for maintaining a gigai or soul candy or things like that. But there was one box that was different from the others. Jinta opened and found a bunch of bottles inside. Each one was filled with a green liquid. There was no identifying marks on any of them. Jinta checked the box and saw there was only one word on the box. Supplement. Jinta scratched his head, wondering what these things were used for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he got an evil idea! He grabbed a bunch of the bottles and stuffed them deep into his pockets. Once his pockets were full of bottles he resealed the box and went into his room. He pulled out one of the bottles and opened it. It smelled strongly of rubbing alchohol. Jinta tasted a little of it and found that it didn't taste like alchohol. He had snuck a little from time to time from Urahara, and this stuff didn't taste like it at all. In fact, it tasted like mint. Jinta shrugged and chugged the bottle down. He pulled out a few more and downed those as well. He put the rest in a box he hid under a pile of clothes in his closet. That would show that lazy Urahara! Jinta wondered if he'd get away with it. Usually Urahara or Tessai could easily see through his pranks. He shrugged again and decided it wasn't worth the trouble to worry about.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hitsugaya sighed in annoyance as he waited in one of the sterile rooms of the 12th Division of the Soul Reapers. His eye twitched as he thought about all the paper work he had building up, and he knew that his lieutenant with her giant fun-bags was behind it somehow. For some reason, Nemu, the 12th Division lieutenant had contacted him to tell him that it was necessary he get some kind of vaccination for a hollow related disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re spirits, how can we even get sick\u2026\u201d he muttered, as thoughts of his fellow white-haired captain, Ukitake came to mind. Normally he wouldn\u2019t even be concerned, but a rather amusing fun fact was that he absolutely despised needles. For all his centuries, he had the child-like fear of needles and it annoyed him immensely. Notwithstanding the fact his ice attacks could also involve needles. He swore he heard Hyorinmaru laughing at him. \u201cWe could be dealing with Aizen\u2019s recent coup, or my paperwork, but no, need a stupid needle!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis musing was interrupted as the stoic lieutenant of Mayuri walked in, carrying a needle and vial with her. His heart skipped a beat, but he did his best to keep his face neutral. \u201cHello, Captain Hitsugaya, we\u2019re here to give you your Soul Pox vaccine, since our records show that you never received it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul Pox? I\u2019ve never heard of that one.\u201d Hitsugaya countered, eyebrow raised out of suspicion. He\u2019d been captain for a while, but even he had never heard of that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost people usually have their vaccinations as in infant, so they rarely do, but due to your late coming to the Gotei 13 due to living in Rukongai,  you\u2019d never received it. So if you could kindly roll up your sleeve. This should be fast.\u201d Nemu replied as she inserted the needle into the vial, and withdrew the serum within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind flashbacked to a strange request from her supervisor in the Shinigami Women\u2019s Association, and coincidentally Hitsugaya\u2019s Lieutenant, Rangiku. She\u2019d had a very strange dream, something about Soul Society in ruins, return of Quincy\u2019s, and an adult Hitsugaya. One who was sexy enough that Rangiku just couldn\u2019t wait to see it, so she put in a special request to Nemu in exchange for a favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after some searching, Nemu found an old experiment from Mayuri\u2019s files. Serum XH-19, which offered some promised growth and maturity. After finding the proper serum, she immediately put the call to Hitsugaya. However, she failed to read that Mayuri abandoned the serum due to its instability and unable to produce consistent results, not limited to hypertrophy of the skeletal, muscular, and reproductive structures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplying a tourniquet to Hitsugaya\u2019s arm and sterilizing it, she tapped the syringe to get the air bubbles out of it. She saw Hitsugaya tensed up, so she asked Hitsugaya how paperwork was going. \u201cAGh, I wish that I could catch up. Every time I think I\u2019m getting close, Rangiku always finds some way to make me get behind!\u201d He ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd done!\u201d Nemu said, as she wiped it down and applied a bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wha-? It\u2019s done!\u201d Hitsugaya looked on confusedly, he didn\u2019t feel anything at all. Nemu smiled, rare on her face, since most people usually had that reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease refrain from strenuous activity, and have a good day Captain Hitsugaya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Seireitei====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking on, Hitsugaya was still fairly annoyed with his lieutenant, and as he was heading to back to the barracks, and thinking of his paperwork, decided to simply screw it. Heading towards the Senkaimon, he quickly had the Kido Corps apply his seal, and left towards the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured he might as well tour Karakuri town, and went exploring since it was familiar, finding some curious and weird things, along with some shops with \u201ctoys\u201d he figured Rangiku needed. He\u2019d better note that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he explored though, he quickly found himself very uncomfortable, adjusting his clothes every now and then, since a weird heat had seized him suddenly. He wiped his brow of sweat, which he found very unusual, since he rarely got hot. He was usually cold as a matter of fact. \u201cDid that shot have something to do with this\u2026\u201d He muttered, as it was starting to get disorienting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting more and more sluggish, and it was harder and harder to remember where he was. He couldn\u2019t stay out though, he\u2019d be a target for hollows, which meant\u2026 only one person he could rely on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding-dong!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo wiped his eyes of sleep, wondering who the hell was ringing the doorbell so early in the morning. \u201cWhat the hell, it\u2019s 8 in the morning!\u201d He was not a morning person. Opening the door, his eyes widened as he saw it was Hitsugaya! \u201cOy, what are you doing here!\u201d He quickly reacted when he saw his face was flushed, and it wasn\u2019t from alcohol. \u201cOy oy!\u201d He shouted as Hitsugaya collapsed, \u201cKarin, get dad, now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====1 hour later====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya grunted as he found himself laying in some bed, probably Ichigo\u2019s, and slowly but surely got up. He had a splitting headache, and everything was disoriented. A myriad of colors was assaulting his eyes, making everything absolutely hard to register. His body feeling a little strange, he gradually made out the door and headed towards it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hitsugaya stumbled just a little bit, for some reason a little bit unsure of his balance. It felt like everything was off. Where was he? He didn't even remember how he got in this... bedroom? The light beamed through the window, somewhat blinding him as he held up his hand against his eyes, trying to shade his view. Reaching back, he made sure he had his Zanpakuto with him. He wouldn't know what to do if he lost it. His clothes felt constricting around him too, he needed to figure this stuff out. He walked towards the door, reaching down to get the handle, only for it to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReacting quickly, he jumped back, gripping his sword in his right hand, while he lowered his center of gravity, bending down, and landing on one knee, while his other leg was perched to spring him forward, while supporting himself on his other hand, his torso bent to lower the amount of himself exposed to whoever was coming in. \"Who's there?\" He ordered, almost surprised at the amount of authority he seemed to have, only to be surprised at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy oy! Chill dude! It's just me!\" Ichigo shouted, waving his hands in front of his body, trying to placate Hitsugaya. He really should have expected this, any time he brings a Shinigami home, he always ended up getting attacked... He looked closely at Hitsugya, but something seemed off as he walked up towards him, but he couldn't quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry Kurosaki...\" Hitsugaya muttered, releasing his sword and getting back up, and looked Kurosaki straight in the eyes. He blinked. Ichigo blinked. They both blinked. And they reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!\" They both shouted at the same time as they freaked out. Both of them easily unnerved, Ichigo by the whole situation, and Hitsugaya considering he just shot up more than a foot in the span he was unconscious, since he had to look up to Ichigo (physically!!) just this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were just shorted than me this morning!\" Ichigo shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was!\" Hitsugaya shouted back, but any further yelling was interrupted at a rip that reached his ears. \"Wha-?\" He muttered, turning himself around, getting a bearing of himself, looking at every possible corner, finally seeing in a nearby mirror that it was the back of his haori and kimono that had ripped, showing his back through the torn fabric. He paused to get the full view, seeing that his clothes hadn't fared too well. His hakama pants had fared the best, but they came only to his shins now, while his feet had ripped his sandals apart. His broadened chest had forced his jacket open, revealing his firm and toned chest, a pretty decent 6--pack forming, together with a decent pair of pecs. It had gotten pulled out his belt wrapping, which was barely holding on due to his waist thickening as well. The coup de grace was his face, which seemed to have gotten an age up as well, maybe just the same age as Ichigo, if not slightly younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo just stared as well, somewhat getting a full picture of Hitsugaya's changes, somewhat blushing as he realized he had a nearly half-naked young adult in his room. Quickly wanting to fix that, \"I think we should take you to see my dad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya couldn't agree more, although it was mainly to figure this situation, somewhat blissfully unaware of Ichigo's reason. \"Yeah, I think that's a good idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Main Clinic Room===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya's right eye twitched, somewhat vexed by this whole situation, while Ichigo was blushing even more at the whole situation. As soon as he walked in, he was greeted by the face of none other than his former captain, Isshin Shiba, who apparently was none other than Ichigo's dad. Isshin pounced with joy on Hitsugaya, seeing him awake and getting him in an arm lock while he ruffled his hair furiously, shouting, \"OH, you're so grown up now! I remember when you first joined, and how diligent you were in your paperwork! I'm so proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for his sanity, he was interrupted by Ichigo kicking him off, a giant tic mark on his forehead. \"OY! WHY DOES HE GET THE PRAISE! I JUST GET THE ATTACKS! OOF!\" He didn't get to finish as Isshin kicked him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've known him longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no excuse damn it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsshin ended the conversation as he cleared his throat, looking at Hitsugaya. \"Now, considering you were just the size of a kid this morning, we should probably get all of you checked out. Meaning...\" Hitsugaya didn't like the starry look in Isshin eyes as he rubbed his hands together. He remembered that look from his old 10th division days. That look meant trouble. And it did. \"STRIP!\" Within seconds, Hitsugaya was left in just a really right pair of boxers, a pair that was meant for someone much smaller than him... in more ways then one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo turned away, blushing as he saw more of Hitsugaya then he would have preferred. \"I'm... gonna see if Karin needs any more help.\" He said, walking off as fast as he could. Hitsugaya silently begging him to take him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya never imagined he'd be stuck in an extremely tight pair of blue boxers (they were a gift from Hiwamari! So sue him!) in front of his old captain. Unfortunately, it also seemed like he had stuffed a baseball in them, much to hi embarrassment as his captain examined him. After a lot of tests, reflex testing, and various other tests, Isshin admitted that he wasn't any closer to figuring this out. \"Unfortunately, I'll have to get Urahara's help on this. I don't have any kind of equipment to do anything like blood tests or the like, even less so for someone made of Reishi. Until then, what you want to do is up to you.\" He said, crossing his arms as he shut his eyes in deep thought, while Hitsugaya bent down to grab his clothes, gripping the nearby table as he felt like a brief heat seize, breaking through his usual cold. Everything seemed just a little bit smaller as he surged just a tiny bit, in height, muscle, and even bulge, okay, that one was a little more than a bit! He blushed as Isshin turned around, \"What, did I miss something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... no...\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, after years of hoping, he'd finally become a teen, and rather than a lot of joy and fun like he thought he'd be having, he was stuck with his former captain who was trying to figure out why it happened. Admittedly, he didn't expect to be a captain either so, it kind of balances out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsshin had given him some clothing to wear, some old hand-me-downs Ichigo had lying around, since he wasn't exactly certain if Ichigo would be willing to loan him some clothes, but problem was they were a little tight, and Hitsugaya really didn't like tight clothing, as he adjusted the t-shirt, somewhat embarrassed by how much it showed off, just the barest hint of his stomach showing, even as he adjusted his pants. Now he would have been very happy if those could have been looser. It was somewhat uncomfortable at the thought he was weating Ichigo's older boxers, and the fact those were a little tight filled him with equal parts smugness and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more annoying part was the fact that Isshin only had room in Ichigo's room which led to the current situation, them looking at each other awkwardly, considering Ichigo had seen Hitsugaya nearly naked, and Hitsugaya was wearing Ichigo's old clothes which were a bit too small. The whole situation was simply put, awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo really didn't expect any of this, considering he was expecting only to be doing training. It was enough that he had managed to learn his dad was a Shinigami, only if by luck since he stayed in his body for once when Grand Fisher tracked him down. He had training to do to fight the Arrancar, and they're wasting their time with this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I wanted to be doing this. I was having a routine day before all of this happened.\" Hitsugaya countered, reading Ichigo's expressions. Honestly, the kid was like an open book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that! I hate it when you Shinigami do that...\" He muttered, tic mark on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya sighed as he moved to get up. His muscle rippling under the fabric. \"Tch, every Shinigami is trained at how to read basic posture. Perhaps if you actually bothered to learn some stuff about how to be one.\" Which at that point was enough for Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you-!\" He shouted, as he ran up to Hitsugaya and grabbed him, lifted him up, and threw him across the room, Hitsugaya wide-eyed with surprise, Ichigo somewhat surprising him with his strength, but he supposed having to live under Isshin... With a rip, he accidentally tore Hitsugaya's shirt off, leaving the teen bare-chested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurosaki! That's the way you want to play is it?\" Hitsugaya shouted, standing up, almost resembling another white-haired ice user famous for stripping as he charged back, using the patented Isshin flying kick on him, sending him hurtling back. While he tried to recover, Hitsugaya marched up and grabbed him by his shirt, \"Only fair I return the favor!\" And with a tug, he ripped Ichigo's shirt off, leaving both of the two half-naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL MY TURN THEN SHORT-STOP!\" Ichigo yelled as he grappled against Hitsugaya, both of their muscles tensing, veins somewhat protruding as they tried to come on top. Hitsugaya had centuries of experience fighting, but Ichigo had more experience both in size and from hand-to-hand brawling. It didn't hurt that despite being roughly the same height, Ichigo was more muscled and defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but sweaty bodies colliding for a long duration of time, until eventually, neither one was able to come out on top, both of them collapsed near one another, out of energy. \"Should we... *wheezes* consider it... *coughs* a draw?\" Ichigo gasped out, sweat running down his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about what to do, Hitsugaya figured there was one possible solution he had, based on his experience with Ichigo's clothes. \"Ha.... one final challenge...\" He wheezed out, somewhat unused to this level of physical exertion. His eyes seemed to shine with some mischief. \"Whoever's bigger, wins.\" He said as he stood up, hooking his thumbs in his jeans, somewhat surprised at his own boldness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked at Hitsugaya's face, somewhat understanding what he was talking about. He had a secret weapon of his own after all. He figured he might as well use it. He wouldn't usually do this, but he was too caught up in the competition now as he stood up, using one of the nearby rags to wipe his face down. \"You're on!\"</span></div></div>",

He was actually feeling pretty confident in himself, if his growth spurt would be anything to go by. \"I'm the older one here, it's only fitting I go first.\" He was fairly certain he was gonna make Ichigo eat his words. He gripped his pants and pulled them down, somewhat glad  to be free of the tight pair, leaving him only in his tight boxers. He was already starting to tent them, and with a smirk, he pulled them down, enjoying the feeling as he flopped against his chest, his hard, throbbing cock pulsing in the cold air. He gripped it with one hand as he grabbed a nearby ruler from Ichigo's desk, holding it up to himself. \"10 inches, beat that.\" He was acting so out of character it was surprising to him. He was acting, well, like a horny teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't like Ichigo's smirk as he pulled down his own pants, leaving him in a tight pair of underwear, but Hitsugaya thought they looked weird. They looked a lot sturdier than his. He smirked at Hitsugaya. \"When Rukia gave me those Shinigami powers...\" He pulled them down, leaving him completely bare, an orange treasure mimicking the white one on Hitsugaya, \"It came with an added bonus.\" Hitsugaya blinked, somewhat thrown off at its size, since it wasn't as big as he expected, until Ichigo gave it a nice, long stroke, moaning just a little bit. \"There's a reason those are old boxers.\" He walked over, stroking all the while as he walked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya felt the sweat dropping down his brow as Ichigo walked closer and closer, he grew bigger and bigger, and didn't even seem to stop. By the time he was by him, he was fully hard... and he was bigger. Even just by looking, he could tell, but Ichigo held it up to his cock, and he was longer, and thicker. Just to add insult to injury, he grabbed the ruler, and held it up to his cock. He was off the edge. \"12.5 inches.\" At this point, he couldn't resist as his hand gripped around both of them, Hitsugaya barely able to comprehend what was going. Ichigo usually went for women, but he wasn't afraid to go for the occasional attractive guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya moaned as Ichigo gradually forced him towards the bed, Ichigo's pumps feeling so good on Hitsugaya, for all his years of experience and fighting hollows, he'd never felt anything like this. Ichigo knew the final touch, as he leaned in and kissed Hitsugaya on the lips, the teenaged captain going wide-eyed as it was enough of a distraction to force him down on the bed, the springs squeaking as his muscled body crashed down on it. Ichigo was more muscled and more experienced at using it, and when it came to a fight, experience was everything. But he wasn't gonna let Ichigo dominate, as he leaned back into the kiss, giving Ichigo his own two strokes on their cock, both of them leaking pre all over their muscled, naked bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo glowered down, looking at Hitsugaya, who was at least not willing to give in. Coating his hand in pre, he reached down to rub against Hitsugaya's ass, pressing one in for pre. Hitsugaya moaned at the foreign stimulation, blushing as he clawed against Ichigo's back, only stroking faster as Ichigo added another finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, Ichigo kneeled up, his cock pulsing with need as he lined up. \"Ugh, I'm so going to get you back for this.\" Hitsugaya grunted as Ichigo lined up, pushing his head against Hitsugaya's hole, and sheathed himself in one stroke, Hitsugaya moaned heavily as his arms wrapped against Ichigo's back. Soul King, he was as thick as his old arm! He could feel his abs somewhat bulging as Ichigo pulled back out, thrusting balls deep on the second one, the bed squeaking as he lifted Hitsugaya a bit to thrust down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up his pace, Hitsugaya did everything he could to get Ichigo to cum, teasing his balls, his nipples everything, Leaning back into a kiss, as Ichigo thrust faster and faster, until he reached his climax, Hitsugaya cumming at the same time Ichigo painted his insides with his own seed, as Ichigo collapsed, both of them realizing that nighttime was approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear by all of Soul Society, if you tell Matsumoto of this..\" Hitsugaya threatened, the temperature dropping somewhat as Ichigo looked amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you don't tell Orihime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" And with that, both of them fell asleep, Ichigo still sheathed inside Hitsugaya as they started snoring, their muscled bodies providing a contrast source of heat and cold.</span></div></div>",

It was Nemu.<br>\r\nHer lack of presence and her natural quietness allowed her to go through a house full of skillful shinigami undetected until her destination, Ichigo's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing another injection with her, a reinforcement dose of the Serum XH-19 for Toushirou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Mayuri's files, the serum should have taken effect almost immediately after applying it, but the captain didn't showed any significant change until he left Seireitei and out of Nemu's sight. Everything pointed out the experiment had being a failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after years working for Mayuri, Nemu had developed a moral code which the first rule was \"Don't accept failures and keep working until you get the perfect results which please your master\". So she was going to give the serum a second try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had traced his test subject to that room. When she opened that door, she observed it was too dark to distinguish anything. She could perceive Toushirou's presence and someone else's, but she wasn't sure where they were. A intruder can't turn the lights on, so she advanced carefully until she located the boys. Then she realized both figures were as big as the average male teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat discovery pleased her. The serum had worked, although she had expected greater effects (she had injected him the same amount of serum that turned a scrawny man called Jidanbou into the giant guardian of Seretei). He didn't look like a child anymore, but he was still far from the image Rangiku had described to her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The most sexy, handsome man on all Seretei. Incredible tall, fit and <b>manly</b> where it counts\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that the results weren't the expected and wouldn't have satisfied Mayuri, if that were his experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered she still had another syringe and got ready to inject him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If a dose the serum can only grew him that little, a second dose would make him as big and Kenpachi and stop there. That should be enough for Rangiku.' But then the shinigami vacillated 'But the serum is unstable, and if he hadn't stop growing, another dose could make him a real giant...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought again about Rangiku's request 'She asked me to make his incredible tall, fit, manly-where-it-counts, sexy... even if he becomes a giant, he would not only have all those qualities, he would be tallest, fittest, manliest and sexiest shinigami in the world. Rangiku couldn't be more pleased, and it would be the perfect result and conclusion for this experiment.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was made up. She was going to inject it to Toushirou... but it was so dark she wasn't sure which one of the pair was him.</span></div></div>",

One of my friends is much taller and buffer than you and I still have the biggest \u2018Zanpakuto\u2019 in the town...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens lower their eyes and checked their long pendulum. Hitsugaya\u2019s was clearly hanging lower than the night before, it was roughly the length of Ichigo\u2019s\u2026 and Ichigo hadn\u2019t forgotten Hitsugaya was more \u201cgrower\u201d than him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens ignored their own duties (breakfast, classroom, killing hollows) and instead started to jerk their voluminous soft cocks, the white haired teen with thrill and the orange haired boy with concern, until they grew to their maximum dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026? It can\u2019t be...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u2026\u201d The usually cold shinigami couldn\u2019t help himself to smirk with an air of superiority. \u201cLet me measure it\u2026 14 inches! (35cm) That\u2019s an inch and a half bigger than you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTch!\u201d Ichigo flicked the tongue, annoyed.<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s compare the diameter...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares! Fine, you won, now I have to get ready for class...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo walked to his wardrobe to get some clothes, but Hitsugaya stopped him by hugging his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, Toushirou??\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGetting my prize.\u201d He said before he kissed the back of his head.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat prize are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor the contest. Yesterday you won, and you did whatever you wanted with me\u2026 today it\u2019s my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 that competition was a one time thing... This doesn\u2019t count\u2026 this\u2026 *sigh* ok, fine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026really? Are you okay with this?\u201d The captain couldn\u2019t believe Ichigo was willing to do it.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, jeez, how many times do I have to tell you? But be fast. I have school in 30 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think I prefer you to pleasure me with your mouth. That way it\u2019s up to you if it ends fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo knelt down and looked at the giant penis before him. The monster was almost as long as two heads\u2026 It was breathtaking, and he didn\u2019t even start the blowjob. But he couldn\u2019t quit, not after benefiting of the same treatment the night before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes, opened his mouth full, bit the bullet and put the immense dick inside. Then he faced foreseeable hardships, like only a third of the cock fit in there or that it was so thick his tongue almost couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Thank goodness we\u2019re having oral sex instead of anal.\u2019 He thought while taking the cock out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo gained time playing with it outside his mouth, licking it, jerking it and kissing it, while he planned the best way to make that boy cum. It\u2019s not like Hitsugaya was going to protest, he was enjoying it to the point he moaned a little a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet! My family could hear you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIchigo, Toushirou, wake up, sleepyheads! The breakfast is getting cold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys felt a shiver when they heard the voice of Isshin just outside the room.<br>\r\nIchigo knew his father could enter in any moment to awake him with a surprise attack\u2026 and then we would see what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWwait, dad...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting dressed, Isshin.\u201d the young captain said with a much calmer tone \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighed with relieve before he said \u201cLet\u2019s postpone this...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Let\u2019s finish it now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUgg\u2026 okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo put again the giant cock inside his mouth and pushed it until it hit the bottom of his mouth. He bobbed faster and faster, and while he was doing it, also inclined his head from one side to another to increase the friction. He ignored the pain in his jaw and kept moving it, he knew he had to give it all to end this in less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuckkkk...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya was enjoying it\u2026 but he wanted more\u2026<br>\r\nHe grabbed Ichigo's head by surprise and forced it to swallow a few more inches of his penis, invading part of his cock, and quickening the pace of the blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrfg!\u201d He protested with his whole mouth filled with cock.<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026 ahhh\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice shinigami was getting close\u2026 and then he felt again that weird warm in his penis and the rest of his body\u2026 his cock surprised Ichigo, expanding an extra 1-2 inches in every direction, forcing his jaw to become fully open to let that monster enter\u2026 and moments after, it released a giant load of cum directly inside his throat. The poor student almost choked with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCough\u2026 Cough\u2026 bastard\u2026 don\u2019t ever try to put your hands on me again...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya felt some guilt for being so rash, but his pride didn\u2019t let him say sorry to Ichigo. But the offense was quickly forgotten as they changed their clothes and went to the kitchen, without any of them noticing the head of the captain was now a few inches higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, they were welcomed fondly by Isshin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere he is, my boy!\u201d He shouted as he saw him. He ran to Hitsugaya and he tried to lift him and hold him in the air, like when he used to do when he was his subordinate, but the kid was now a few centimeters and kilos bigger than him, probably pushing the 6\u20194\u201d (190cm) tall, and Isshin failed to raise him more than 5 centimeters from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m your son, not him!\u201d Ichigo protested as the signs of affection continued.<br>\r\n\u201cI thought after my growth spurt, you would realize I\u2019m not a kid, I\u2019m 200 years old shinigami warrior!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor me, you\u2019ll always be the smallest shinigami of my squadron...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sigh*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they sat, Hitsugaya started to gobble up the food on the table, he was pretty surprised how hungry he was. It was like that bigger body required bigger amounts of food\u2026 or it was gathering as many nutrients as it could to grow further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo felt unusually hungry too, and that made them fight again for some foodstuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, that croissant was meant for me!\u201d Ichigo complained angrily.<br>\r\n\u201cBut you have already eaten two.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve eaten all the donuts!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I needed them, I\u2019m a growing boy, after all...\u201d Hitsugaya commented, proudly of his new size \u201cAnd bigger than you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA boy growing dumber, you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou keep complaining about food, but you have already had a breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the blushing teen, none of his family understood that reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoron!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBrat.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were arguing every second louder, Isshin and his daughters kept watching them stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re like big childish kids...\u201d Karin added, a little amused by their show. \u201cJust like \u2018their\u2019 father\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(And those \u201cbig kids\u201d were going to become much bigger over the next days)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry...\u201d Yuzu moaned after his brother and their guest finished a breakfast for 5 persons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Isshin lent Toushirou some of his clothes because Ichigo\u2019s old spare clothes were tighter and shorter than the night before. The captain told him he was going to return to Seiretei so he could get proper shinigami clothing and finish some pending paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 are you going to come back later? We could ask Urahara about your strange growth spurt and\u2026 I had bought too much curry for diner\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 will think about it...\u201d He said unconvincingly before disappearing with a shunpo.</span></div></div>",

After becoming a shinigami, his hard-ons were impossible to hide, so Ichigo had to hide in a dark alley until it calmed down... but that morning he felt strangely horny and didn't wanted to go down (it actually became even harder, Ichigo could sweat it seemed a little bigger too).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Hitsugaya... prickteaser...\" He muttered angrily, hid behind a dumpster, while he took down his pants a little, letting his huge cock rise in the air freely \"I made you feel better, and you left without returning the favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found an excuse to explain his bad mood: Hitsugaya was a jerk. But was that all...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo started to wank it up fast, he wanted to end that as fast as he could, but once he started he started losing it.

Mmmmm! You're an asshole... asshole... Mmmmah! your ass... that perfect, muscular ass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of his sexy butt crossed his mind, and then his warm cock twitched and ejaculated... and it wasn't a normal ejaculation, it was like a eruption of cum, painting part of the wall with white jizz.</span></div></div>",

An achievement that should be impossible for any normal human body (and Ichigo was still in his human body) but he didn't realized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter apologizing to his teacher, he proceeded to his seat. Keigo, who seated near him, noticed the long shape printed on his trousers and blushing, looked the other way.

Ichigo's hand slid over them, verifying how hard they were (like 6 small hills of pure stone).  Looking up again, he examined his shoulders, they seemed broader too, the deltoids were more prominent. Maybe his neck was slightly thicker and longer, but the gains were so small he couldn't be sure. It was clear the tightness he felt in the upper part of his shirt was only due to his growing pecs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face remained the same, for his relief. He liked his face the way it was: handsome, youthful but not too much, a little menacing when he was angry and sexy when he wasn't. But the other changes were welcomed. The mirror couldn't show all his reflection, the top of his head was cut out, so he must be taller as well. Probably taller than his father, maybe as tall as Toushirou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to find out why this is happening to me... but I have to admit I like what I see\" The boy soliloquized while me flexed his biceps, which swelled to almost the double of his original volume.

He would have yelled if he hadn't lost his voice. And somehow, he didn't stop holding his cock...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt grew almost 5cm (2\") in an spasm, and then another came, and the sweating boy witnessed how it grew 'only' 3cm (1.1\") but this time added several centimeters to its diameter. The cock was red, hardest, very warm, filled with veins, like an inflammation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother spurt happened, and this time the build up pressure and energy didn't affect much the cock... instead, they spread their growing effects all across his body, making his muscles grow thicker  in spasm, and the force of the spasm caused his bones to crack and elongate more centimeters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo couldn't bear it anymore... and when the last cum spurt arrived, when he began to feel this pleasant and painful growth again, his hands slipped from his swelled cock, releasing all his load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a powerful garden hose, but releasing cum instead of water, with enough force the toilet door open, releasing such amount of jizz that half of the floor, the sinks in front of his WC, the ceiling became white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitzuhiro would have become a snowman, if it were not because he had just left the restroom when Ichigo lost it. That meant Ichigo had some privacy again, and spent the next minutes KO in his seat. And other 5 minutes to clean his mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally cleaned all (he had to spent almost all the toilet paper and flush the WC multiple times), his almost soft penis twitched a little, sending a small load to the floor he had just finished cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a dick.\" He said to his own penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward he returned to class and apologized to his teacher for his lateness (\"I didn't feel well, I went to the nurse\" he lied) </span></div></div>",

Everything got blurry for a moment... and when it stopped a second after, he was in front of Urahara's shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?? Did I shunpo IN MY HUMAN BODY!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't actually planning to see Urahara. He was panicking and just run to a place to hide, and somehow he ended up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although it comes in handy... he's the most indicate to fix whatever is happening to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo went into without ringing the bell, got inside the toilet and didn't come out until 10 minutes later, and when he got out the four walls were painted in white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. That felt so goood...\" He signed with relieve, still in the clouds, and went through the wrong door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father, Toushirou and Urahara were sitting there, taking before Ichigo's entrance, and stared silently and wide-eyed to the orange-head teenager, specially his father, who also had his mouth wide-open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I can explain... well, maybe not... Something weird happened this morning and got a little taller...\"<br>\r\n\"And longer.\" The shopkeeper said with a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo didn't understand what that meant until he looked down and saw he had forgotten to zip his flier and his long flaccid cock, which didn't get enough space inside his pants, slipped out through the flier and hanged outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHITSHITSHIT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo fled to another room so he could reallocate his junk. Meanwhile Urahara approached to Isshin, who remained frozen to the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way to alter the memories of a strong Shinigami like you... but I have a prototype of a memory eraser so powerful that can blurry a captain's memories of the last minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, use it on me. There are things a father isn't supposed to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...like the giant, cum dripping penis of his own son (also it hurt his pride to verify it was 2 times bigger than his own manhood).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Urahara cleaned Isshin's most recent memories and the embarrassed Ichigo dared to come back (the sight of his now taller son surprised Isshin again, although not as much as before) the shinigami shopkeeper proceeded to do some checks on his body and made a provisional diagnostic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you're experimenting the same transformation than Hitsugaya.\"<br>\r\n\"And what is it??\"<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\"<br>\r\n\"But it could be dangerous for my boy? And for Ichigo?\" The shimigami dad asked worried.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I told you to stop treating Toushirou like he was your son!\" Ichigo protested, the white haired shinigami just stayed silent.<br>\r\n\"Mmm... I don't think so. It seems like a benign transformation. Your spiritual energy is growing incredibly fast, increasing all your powers to unseen levels. A side effect of this transformation is that it affects to both your physical and spiritual forms, strengthening them... and expanding them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya finally said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it happened to me, I thought it could be a case of shinigami unstable growth rate... lack or excess of growth. But could it affect Ichigo in his human form?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, he's a unique case of his own. The unstable growth syndrome may be the best explanation, but it's extremely unusual to see growth spurts so fast in height and spiritual energy, even between those affected. I can't dismiss another cause, like a unknown growth agent, but it got into your bodies it was already assimilated and didn't left no trace behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your fault. You infected me with your illness\" Ichigo, angry, pointed to an indifferent Toushirou.<br>\r\n\"...and how do you think I transmit it to you?\"<br>\r\n\"That's a good point. Ichigo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh... Ahh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo couldn't tell then they had sex. The pale kid enjoyed his show of anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...air-driven? Like the flue?\" That was the only way out Ichigo could think.<br>\r\n\"No, I can assure you this is not caused by a bacteria or virus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep investigating this... but for the moment I can't do anything to help you. You'll have to endure this growth until I find something or it finished by its own.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how my classmates are going to react when they see me tomorrow at 192cm (6'5) tall... or maybe taller!\"<br>\r\n\"If you like, I can activate a memories altering device to make them think you're always being that tall...\"<br>\r\n\"That would be nice, thanks.\"<br>\r\n\"I have a last advise for you... you know the soul society have strict rules against exposing the real world to too much spiritual energy...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's why we the captains have to limit our power before coming here.\"<br>\r\n\"Your power is increasing faster than your bodies. If you let it loose, you could affect the humans around and the soul society would detect it and try to caught you. Try to avoid releasing your spiritual bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and his father returned to their home... and Toushirou went with them. He explained them he was ordered to investigate some strange hollow activity so he had to stay in the human world a little longer. He asked if Isshin's offer was still available, and he answered gladly it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pissed off Ichigo, who was unfriendly with him during all the dinner, still blaming him for his last growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once they finished eating and went to Ichigo's room to sleep... once his door shut, they started to kiss passionately. They took their tight clothes off and caressed and kissed their nipples and the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bakud\u014d #102: Room silencer\" Toushirou said before continuing fucking his roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sex became more and more intense, bumping their bodies with the walls, knocking down furniture... but no one else in the house noticed it thanks to that kido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo penetrated T\u014dshir\u014d's ass and afterward let him fuck him from behind, then they did 69, masturbated each other's cock, and repeated, and they continued for hours until they satiated their enhanced libido and burned all their energy... and Ichigo fell sleep in Toshiro's arms, unconscious too, covered by cum and sweat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the defeat of the Quincy, and the threat of the Hollows diminishing with Sosuke Aizen's plot ending, the Soul Society had achieved a small era of peace. However, with no other enemies to worry about, aside from basic Soul Reaper duties, Mayuri Kurotsuchi, Captain of the 12th Division, believed that Soul Society will soon become soft if there's no type of stimulation to occur for the Soul Reapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin his lab, located within the Shinigami Research Institute, he was working on a new experiment. Quincies were of no interest to the man, seeing as he was able to eventually overwhelm the likes of Pernida Parnkgjas with intelligence, he returned to his studies on Hollows. Hollow are, were, and will continue to be, Soul Society's biggest threat. He does not doubt that the Hollows will gain tract again and become a superpower once more. From the time of Aizen, a certain Espada's report made its way to Mayuri, one that interested him the most between the others. This Espada in question was Aaroniero Arruruerie, one who was able to achieve the level of an Espada because of the Hollow's consumption capabilities. So, why not try to replicate such a phenomenon with an experimental Hollow, but give out differing effects? This particular Hollow would get stronger the more it consumed, at least that was the initial idea, but what if it didn't need to consume things whole? Instead, it would just feed off of Reishi and then give it out  as it saw fit? This would surely allow it to create its own army within Soul Society, thus easing this peaceful-like state, while also keeping it in a controlled setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured that he would need an appropriate test subject to test such a creature upon, so he thought of Kensei Muguruma, Captain of the 9th Division. If he had sent it out towards someone to the likes of Kenpachi, the experiment would not gain enough power to achieve Mayuri's goals, so he settled for someone weaker. However, he was also aware that Kensei would not let his Division slack off, so it was a happy medium that fulfilled Mayuri's wants. Mayuri did, however, need to make it replicate itself so that it could become its own army within Soul Society, an infinite-like replication system so that the Hollow would virtually never run out. All that he would need to do is keep the original with him if any of the clones got out of hand, tying their life force to the main one. It was a simple solution to an issue that may happen down the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother issue, however, was the matter of what powers it would possess. Since this Hollow was in a basic form, it was virtually incapable of doing anything by itself, so Mayuri was able to freely manipulate its anatomy and capabilities however he saw fit. He shrugged. A test is a test, after all. So, he chose a particular formula he had invented to stimulate the muscles of beings when applied to them, allowing for them to gain strength from it infecting their body. Of course, said substance was harmless, but it was quite potent in nature. He did want to make everything interesting in the end. Next was the matter of the creature itself. He had recalled the liquid abilities he had given himself, in case he needed to escape, so he applied that concept to the Hollow itself, thus allowing it to have a malleable structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending days on this experiment, Mayuri was prepared to send off a clone to Soul Society, so he had taken a visit to the 9th Division's headquarters, releasing the cloned Hollow nearby before he entered the barracks. He greeted Kensei and spoke to him about things that were of no real interest to the Captain, to which he tried to shrug Mayuri off, but he was persistent. This lasted a while until Mayuri felt that the Hollow had successfully infiltrated the barracks and went back to the 12th Division.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long day of training and the like, Kensei released his division from their duties for the night, heading to his own room. He disrobed himself completely bare, preferring to slumber without any cold as it makes him hot during the night, his hot and sweaty body available to the world as he decided it would be best to shower when he woke up tomorrow. He yawned and finally passed out onto his bed. Nearby, the liquid-like Hollow seeped into the walls of Kensei's room, looking at the sleeping man before him. It slowly contorted as it replicated itself, just like Mayuri had planned, where now even the copy of the cloned Hollow was looking at Kensei. The cloned Hollow had left Kensei's room, where the copy stayed, eyeing Kensei some more, deciding on what its next act should be. There were plenty of entrances to infiltrate within the Captain, especially since he made it so simple. The copy decided to...</span></div></div>",

As he made his way toward the park he started to fell his chest growing tighter with each step he took. \"*huff* *huff* I know I'm not athletic but I'm not that bad that I can't walk a few blocks\", he thought. But the tightness continued to grow and his breathing became a bit more labored as he got closer and closer. Before he made his way over he decided to stop for a bit and rest at a restroom at a nearby convenience store. He looked in the mirror and noticed the redness in his face, the sweat, and lastly the slight height change. \"Wha.....huh? When did I get taller?\" he took a double take at the mirror just to make sure he wasn't dreaming. It was small but he definitely looked a little taller than before. Now that he mentioned it his clothes seemed to fit a little tighter than when he left. His jacket clung a little more revealing a faint outline of sinewy muscles beginning to form. His shirt rode a little higher, revealing a smooth belly and faintly growing pecs pushing at the collar. His shoes felt tighter, more like he was packing into them. But the most noticeable part was how his pants (usually a tight fit but now even more so) clung tighter and tighter to his legs and thighs, but most importantly toward the tightening outline of his cock, which slowly grew and swelled as the material constricted around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but blush, as he wasn't used to having so much of himself out in the open, well not like this. \"Uhhhhh......maybe that light wasn't just may imagination after all\".</span></div></div>",

He sighed loudly as he turned off the TV, finding nothing good to be on. \u201cIt\u2019s always so boring when Seto\u2019s not home,\u201d he complained to the empty mansion. \u201cI wish something would happen to do while we was away.\u201d Just as the words left his lips, a knock can from the door. He gave permission to enter, and the door swung open, revealing one of the butlers. \u201cExcuse me Master Mokuba,\u201d the butler said politely, \u201cbut the mail has arrived and I wondered if you would care to browse through it in Master Seto\u2019s absence.\u201d Mokuba took the mail, thanked the butler, and sat back on the couch and rifled through the letters. \u201cBill\u2026.bill,\u201d Mokuba rattled off to no one in particular as he placed each letter on the table, \u201cJunk\u2026catalogue\u2026balloon\u2026bill\u2026bill\u2026balloon?\u201d He looked at the pile of letters and found a small, black balloon packaged in with the other letters.

He shrugged and decided to try it; plucking a hair off the top of his head, placing it into the balloon, and giving it a few hard puffs of air.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tied up the mouthpiece to stop the balloon from losing air, before turning his attention to his body. He didn\u2019t any different, his body looked normal. He waited for a minute, yet nothing happened. \u201cHmmm, properly just a dud\u201d Mokuba said with doubt, \u201ccheap waste\u201d. Just before he was about to drop the subject, without warning; he felt a weird, tingling sensation going throughout his body, attaching his attention. \u201cWhat the?\u201d said a confused Mokuba, his heart rate slowly started to beat faster and louder as both his chest and body twitched with each beat. Mokuba never felt like before, then again how could he. He felt something growing inside him, and continued doing so. Mokuba had a feeling this was an effect caused by the balloon. His chest rose and contracted with every thump of his heart, up and down, up and down, again and again. Suddenly, he felt a great surging reaction erupting, which surprised Mokuba as he began to observe what was about to transpire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me!?\u201d Mokuba gasped as he watched his body suddenly starting to physically transform before his eyes. It looked completely odd; but Mokuba seemed as appeared to be expanding or more likely, inflating like a balloon. That\u2019s impossible! How can anyone go through with such a thing like this, it could only happen in a cartoon Mokuba thought. Regardless, it is actually happening right before Mokuba\u2019s eyes. All he could do was to watch in shock as his body billowed outward and upward. However, there seemed something odd about this that caught Mokuba\u2019s attention. Instead of pumping up into a huge, round ball of mass like that in common cartoons; instead parts of Mokuba\u2019s body swelled. To his complete surprise, Mokuba was growing in masses of brawn; his body is being inflated with muscles. He couldn\u2019t believe it, normally he would expect the option to happen to him, but instead it wasn\u2019t. With each second, each of Mokuba\u2019s limbs was swelling in well defined physique; they bulked and bulged in unison of his thumping heartbeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMokuba observed helplessly as his naturally flat chest slowly, but tremendously began to puff up, a loud, leathery stretching sound emitted as his chest distended into twelve shelves of semi-bloated pectoral muscles while they are supported by his back, minimally flaring out. They widen and heighten before the feeling went upwards. \u201cHuh?\u201d said the shaggy haired boy as turned his attention around and nearby his neck. Both of his shoulders twitched, they slightly ros\u00e9 and broadened for a brief second. The pressure was now surging into his lower body, his legs convulsed with the gaining energy. First, his thighs started to thickened, his dark blue pants started to strain with the widening going on, trying to get use to mass that Mokuba was going as the boy struggle to keep balance with the ballooning brawn. It for awhile before the minor expansion stopped, allowing his calves to be next for the growth to take place. They bulged before they slowly started pumping up, growing into tennis ball sized physique. With both legs pumped, finally both Mokuba\u2019s arms became the next part of his body to feel the balloon\u2019s magical effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Mokuba\u2019s averaged sized arms began to greatly expand; he freaked out when he shifted his notice and saw his left arm growing, his forearm thicking and his bicep inflated in pure size, rising, widening and billowing before his right arm undergo the same treatment. Seconds later, they were fully developed like the other muscles. Soon after his arms were developed, all of his muscles continued swelling after each one of them became the efficient size; Mokuba watched helplessly and minor alarm Mokuba wondered when he was going to stop pumping up, he felt scarred without his brother. He closed his eyes in fear, with no comprehension of the size he was billowing. Suddenly, just when Mokuba thought he was going to get any bigger, the tingling feeling slowly started to subside, along with the miraculous effects. Mokuba sighed in calm relief, knowing that it was going to stop. As his heartbeat slowed down, his physical transformation finally came to peaceful halt. The twelve year old\u2019s eyes were wide in surprise as examined his newly gained buffed body, luckily his battle-city clothes managed not to rip apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d said a confused Mokuba while he flexed a bicep from his left arm to see how big it had gotten got after being blown up. \u201cHow in the world I suddenly got this big?\u201d He asked to himself before while he examined his legs. He remembered the package, picking it off the nearby table before reading it. \u201cManufactured by partnering Balloon companies, Air-abs allows anyone the chance to experience themselves as a superhero or a bodybuilder! The effects of the balloon allow the consumer\u2019s body to grow instant Muscles while performing the inflation.\u201d <br>\r\nMokuba couldn\u2019t believe what he was reading, this seems too ridiculous, \u201cBuff-a-loon allows anyone the chance to experience themselves as a superhero or a bodybuilder!\u201d he read to himself. \u201cHow can that be possible?\u201d said a confused Mokuba as he gazed at his minimally pumped body. He never thought anything like this could happen to him or anyone. Mokuba thought long about this while he observed his transformed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this is possible, then that means I can gain these muscles in just a matter of seconds\u201d Mokuba thought, \u201cI guess that\u2019s why this thing has such a weird name\u201d said Mokuba as he observed the black balloon that was being held in his right hand, figuring out that this balloon is able to increase the muscle mass by the size of the balloon. Mokuba felt kind of glad that there was a way to get stronger quicker, in appearance at least. He did hate being picked on by the older kids back when he and his older brother were at the orphanage. Even though he felt stronger than what he was before, Mokuba suddenly thought that something didn\u2019t add quite right. He may have bulked up, but what he is now wasn\u2019t clearly enough. Mokuba did look enough to be a professional swimmer, but not a pro bodybuilder. Mokuba felt if he wanted to get stronger and look more powerful, he would need to get bigger. Mokuba wanted to be larger and more taller than he is now. Mokuba figured he would need to be like that if he was going to be stronger in his point of view. Another physical transformation is needed for this; Mokuba knew just what was needed for that. He wondered if he wanted to undergo another expansion to a much larger and pumped up form, thinking about taking the chance. Mokuba looked at the balloon, as a small cute smile formed on his face. \u201cWhy not.\u201d He then said, \u201cThere\u2019s always someway to get back to normal.\u201d Mokuba had decided that another go was on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMokuba was ready for the transformation\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mokuba opened his mouth and inhaled as much air he could gather, wasting no time and no single second. He brought the balloon mouthpiece into the balloon and blew right inside. The balloon reacted, slowly then quickly began to expand again, wider and bigger in size. The twelve year old felt the inflated feeling inside him growing by every second, forcing his body to undergo another inflation, which he knew his stature body was going to be greater and even more larger than the first. His body convulsed with the increasing air matter within him, his skin felt tight, and kept getting tighter with the inflating mass inside. The shaggy haired boy became engulfed by sounds emitted by his burgeoning figure; hissing and like lead plastic squeaking, stretching, tightening, ripping. Mokuba couldn\u2019t really hear other than that as it ringed in both his ears. It felt strange, but Mokuba knew this was the sign that his body was responding to the balloon\u2019s miraculous effects once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept blowing air into the balloon though, too busy to check on his body. Whilst he do that, oblivious to his that not only his body was changing; he started growing; literally in height. With each breath, Mokuba grew from 4\u201911, to 4\u201912, then to a surprising 5\u20191, and continued to grow even further and taller. His body required a necessary height expansion in order to maintain the mounting muscles that had yet to appear. His arms lengthen, his legs extend, and his body still continued to reach higher. Like before, as long the balloon inflates, his body will do just the same. Grow, pause, breathe, grow, pause, breathe; there was a rhythm to his inflation. Again and again, he continued the same process. As he continued, his shadow even displayed the incredible growth taking place; Mokuba continued to rise, growing higher than he was before, but still Mokuba continued to blow more air into the latex orb; it kept on getting bigger as it looked overly inflated. Finally, Mokuba tied up the balloon\u2019s mouthpiece and placed the balloon on the couch before beginning to observe his brand new form; a small cheerful smile appeared on his face, knowing that something is about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his muscles started to bloom again; the first noticeable change began with his pectorals. His striped shirt began to strain, stretching against the brawn that was more than outlining through his shirt. His devolving pectoral muscles swelled wider and outwards, both sides struggled against each other like two huge, inflating beach balls being pushed together. They continued to bulge and swell forcing his shirt to stretch wider and wider. His back flared out in unison with his expanding, god like chest. Next were his forearms, Mokuba turned his sights on them as they grew into great proportions. They rounded, they widen and they filled out; growing with the sheer mass the advertisement mentioned. His forearms suddenly stopped getting bigger as they started. His forearms had to make way for another part of his arms which are going under a great deal of growing: his biceps. They convulsed and twitched with the upcoming surge building within them, the strange feeling continued to mount until it couldn\u2019t be contained anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis biceps started to expand yet again, slowly but surely, they mounted upwards in size and width. The growth rate started to increase, Mokuba\u2019s biceps rounded and grown into the size of tennis balls, then baseballs, then softballs, and beyond. Blooming, rising, inflating, pumping up, blowing up, they looked as if they were two individual, round balloons stuffed underneath his sleeves, blowing up massively against the light and sky blue fabric, they stretched with the rising bulk that a child couldn\u2019t possibly have. \u201cWhoa!\u201d gasped Mokuba when his right shoulder bulged tremendously before the left shoulder started to follow; the sudden development caught him by complete surprise. Both his shoulders struggled, fighting against the pressure that tried to prevent them from going through the same treatment, in which lost the conflict. They started to rise upwards, like two peeking mountains, quaking with each of the inflating energy being put into them. They grew, they widen and they broadened; his skin felt taut with the mass elongating with the bulk and air overflowing inside his body as the pressure that forced his shoulders to buff up surged into his pecs, forcing them to expand them slightly larger than before, the mounting air pressure then flowed to his abdomen</span></div></div>",

Mokuba\u2019s pants stretched with the billowing legs, his thighs expanded slowly, and his calves began to distend incredibility with each breath. His skin pressured the dark blue fabric to stretch, while his legs took on the look of a trained sportsman. His thighs widen massively in frontal view, they pushed outwards in side view. Mokuba felt his pants getting tighter and tighter, but they were getting use to the mass he was gaining. Twenty seconds after his legs started to grow, they finally builded into a pure shape, the form that many others desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on his face, Mokuba continued warching as his body bloomed with the defined physic mounting. Every one of his brawny muscles still gained more and more mass and size, infact his body was still growing. Mokuba decided to close his eyes until his body stopped growing. He waited patiently as he grew taller and higher. Suddenly, the hissing, squeaking, stretching, tightening, ripping started to slowly subside, which with follow by an innocent, cute sigh of exhaustion filling the air. Mokuba slowly opened his eyes, wondering what he looked like. When he did, a small smile appeared on his face. He looked TREMENDOUS, his body had grown to an amazing shape, and no twelve year old has ever looked like this. Mokuba had grown to an astonishing 5\u20197 in height, but it was easily overshadowed by the incredible change. Mokuba didn\u2019t feel like a normal twelve year old child, but he felt like a powerful young bodybuilder. Even though he looked older, his face remained the same as before, young and no growth development to his chin. His body was rich with glorious brawn, each more defined and larger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis battle city clothes manage to stay intact and not even tear, but they seemed to hold on with a bit of trouble. Mokuba\u2019s stripped shirt and vest strained against the swollen chest and shoulders, but still kept his vest in place as long they where along side with his balloon like biceps, they look massive. He took a deep sigh of shallow excitement, inhaling much air into his body; forcing his chest to greatly expand and inflate his swollen mass elongating against his battle city clothing; not before he exhaled the air that caused his chest to resume back what it was after the inflation. The black haired, muscle bloated child took his attention over his chest and to his legs, examining his muscular thighs and calves pressing hard against his dark blue pants, they strained from the expansion. A cute chuckle came out of Mokuba\u2019s mouth as he flexed his bloated right bicep; it bulged with the sheer force, engorging into big proportions. The young boy turned his attention to his left bicep and flexed it to join his right one. His skin tightened with the bulking, emitting a rubber stretching-like sound. Mokuba quickly noticed his body was taller as well. \u201cThis is\u2026 kinda cool\u201d he then said, \u201cI\u2019m like Goku from Dragonball Z!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMokuba felt happier since his body bulked up into a combo of innocence and brawn, becoming the glorious figure he stood as. This felt like some sort of a good dream, only that it is all too real. Another good thing is that somehow his battle city clothing managed to remain intact, even against his bulging muscles. In his buff, Mokuba looked almost enough to pop like an over inflated balloon or a beach ball. However, he didn\u2019t feel like he was going to pop or burst at all, despite his appearance. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d said Mokuba in a wondering tone, \u201cwhat should I do now that I\u2019m huge beyond belief\u201d.</span></div></div>",

Then he thought of something. \"Why not imitate any of the Dragonball Z characters!\" thought Mokuba before a cheerful smile appeared, \"With a body like this, It'll be like I'm a part of the story.\" He then said with joy billowing within his inflated buffness. He then headed to the TV set and started looking through the Video/DVD cupboard in search for a DVD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMokuba then grabbed out one of his Dragonball Z DVD's, Vol. 53 Cell Games: Earth's Last Hope Volume 53. He easily remembered this mostly had when Gohan was at Super Saiyan level Two, owning Cell throughout the first part of their first. Mokuba couldn't wait to try out his new muscles with this; the excitement was getting to him. Mokuba begin playing the DVD, choosing Episode 172: Cell's Mighty Break Down from the DVD menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be so awesome,\" Mokuba exclaimed as he fast forwarded the episode to his favourite fight scene: Gohan's emotional explosion. He pressed play and stood there, mimicking Gohan in every way. Punches, kicked, dodges, he mimicked them all. His bigger and buffer body easily allowed him to keep up with the diverse movements his favourite character executed on screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later and Mokuba was panting, out of breath, and dripping with sweat. His shirt and vest lay on the couch next to him, allowing his full and muscular torso to be on full display. He rested for a few minutes before pulling his shirt and vest back over his body, having a few problems as the shirt was definitely too small for him, but managed to fit on afterwards. He smiled as he flexed his body once again, enjoying the strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at the clock and gasped at the time. Seto was going to be home in a few minutes! He didn't want his brother to see his little brother as a muscle bound freak. He found the buff-a-loon and quickly untied the end, letting all the air escape from the opening. At the same time, he could feel his muscle bound body swiftly shrinking back to its original form. He sighed when he felt his inflated sensation going away. He knew he'll remember this for a long time, his body finally returned to normal size and his clothes remained in perfect condition. \"I tell Seto about the Buff-a-Loon sometime, I'm sure he'll understand\" thought Mokuba, after all; they are family. He held up the balloon and examined it a bit before smiling and shoving it into his pocket just as Seto Kaiba opened the door to the room. Mokuba ran and hugged his brother, now having the knowledge that he would never have a boring day again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Night had fallen over the village and the members of Inuyasha's group were all in different areas doing different things. Shippo was inside drawing with Kirara while Kaede made medicine from the many herbs that had been collected over the course of the day. Kagome had gone back to her own time for a brief stay to restock up on some much needed items such as to replenish her first aid kit and grab some more food. Inuyasha was waiting for her to help carry the stuff back since she always seemed to be lugging around that gigantic yellow back pack of hers and it was starting to put a strain on her. Pretty soon it wouldn't be a lie when her Grandpa told her classmates and teachers that she had a bad back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sango was busy chasing Miroku through the woods, brandishing her boomerang and ready to clobber him over the head with it. A traveling group had passed through the village and Miroku had spent the short time they were there courting the young women in his perverted way. Sango had been dangerously calm and silent the entire time they were there, but as soon as their caravan was out of sight, she leapt up, grabbed her weapon, and began chasing Miroku threatening him violently all the while. This chase had gone on for at least an hour. Finally, Miroku was too tired to run anymore. Thinking fast, he threw down a few sutras and concentrated on them. Instantly he was cloaked from Sango's sight. He hoped she would pass by quickly and not linger because he couldn't hold the barrier up for long. Luckily, she did indeed spend very little time in his area once she ascertained that he wasn't nearby. When the sounds of her passing disappeared into the distance, Miroku relaxed and the barrier disappeared. He picked up the sutras and placed them inside his robe before heading back toward the village. He had barely taken ten steps before he noticed a hot spring to his left. He had never noticed it before but then he had never been in this part of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that chase, a short time in there would feel wonderful.\" He said to himself, walking to the edge of the pool. He stripped off all his clothes except for, of course, the sleeve covering his wind tunnel and got in. The water was very warm and relaxing. His thoughts drifted from Sango towards more unhappy thoughts. Thoughts of Naraku and their mission to destroy him and take back the Sacred Jewel. But it always seemed that no matter what the situation, he was unable to help in the fight against Naraku. His one weapon of great power, the Wind Tunnel, was constantly being blocked due to the Saimyosho and his spiritual power was nothing in comparison to Kagome's abilities being Kikyo's reincarnation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I could become stronger...\" He said quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this, the pool was suddenly illuminated from within by a deep white glow. The blinding light rose from the pool and took the shape of a beautiful woman, cloaked in a robe with long white hair and pure blue eyes. Her ears were pointed and her teeth were sharp. She was obviously a demon of some sort. Before Miroku could react the demon spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be not afraid kind monk. I have shown myself to you because of your pure desires and wishes. You wish to become stronger in an effort to rid the world of the treacherous Naraku. I shall grant you that request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Miroku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a demon called Bettya. I speak my name freely as I have long since been dead. My power lives on in this pool, waiting for one to invoke it. My powers in life were great and many demons and humans sought me for my power. To avoid losing my power to evil, I sacrificed myself into this pool where my spirit became bound. If you were of evil intent, these waters would melt your flesh and bones and your soul would become trapped at the bottom of this pool. But enough of this talk. Drink from this pool and you shall have your wish. The more you drink, the greater the strength you shall recieve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if someone of evil intent drinks from the pool when I am gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not! For any of evil intent who drink this water shall be dissolved from the inside out. Those of pure intent will find the pool to be nothing more than a hot spring. You may draw water from this pool and take it away with you to use at a later time, but be warned. Any who drink from the water once it has been drawn from the pool shall recieve its power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the demon's spirit flashed bright white light once again and began to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My duty has been accomplished. My power is now safe. Use it wisely monk and may you accomplish your goals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was gone. Miroku looked at the water thoughtfully. It was just what he wished, but was it safe? The demon may have sounded sincere but they were often treacherous. But then if it was poison, Kagome's modern medicine would be sure to treat him. So he carefully took a sip of the water. He felt the warm water flow into his body. He looked at himself. He didn't feel any stronger. Suddenly, his body erupted in a wave of warmth. He nearly swooned from the sudden increase in temperature and he pulled himself out of the pool. Once he was clear of the water, his temperature lowered, but he was still quite warm. He looked at himself again and was shocked by what he saw. His muscles were all slowly swelling larger. His biceps rising from his lean arms, his shoulders widening, his chest swelling. He looked down at his legs and saw them growing in much the same way, his calves hardening, his feet growing slightly larger. He felt his stomach and was surprised by the six pack that had popped up. His back widened to accomadate the sudden weight in the front and the growth stopped. From that little sip his muscles had grown quite a bit. He wasn't huge like a body builder, but he was noticeably larger and felt stronger, all of his muscles defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back to the pool and wondered what he should do next. He could drink more and become even stronger or he could take some water out of the pool for later and risk it getting stolen...</span></div></div>",

His chest pushed outward becoming a centerpiece of his torso, yet in perfect balance to the rest of his muscles.  His smooth abdomen was shifting and clear outlines started becoming visible until a chiseled six pack was on display.  His back was also pushing out from his body to balance his increasing muscular stature.  Miroku's legs were also on the move, becoming sturdy pillars of muscle to support the tower of muscle he was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Miroku's height was changing as well.  Already 7 feet was a memory and his body was climbing to 8 feet.  The shifting perspective was making everything look smaller.  Now he eyed Sango who was staring at him, her face betraying a reaction of complete shock over what was happening and yet her eyes never averted.  Miroku rose to 9 feet tall and now her body which was dwindling to his perspective only reached eye level with the lower part of his abs.  His growth finally began slowing but before it ceased he attained a full 10 feet in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSango looked at the towering man before her, and never had she felt so small, even when fighting some of the largest demons.

His calves pumped up while his feet slid across the soft slightly damp grass and his thighs inflated larger forcing his legs apart. His viewpoint slowly rose higher as he grew taller as well. Luckily whatever was making him grow was also increasing the size of his gauntlet and rosary beads so his Wind Tunnel wouldn't be randomly unleashed. He stopped growing when the plastic bottle could be held between two fingers, about ten feet tall. All of that power from a single sip! It made Miroku's mind boggle. He looked apprehensively at the bottle in his hand. Now that he had taken the water from the pool anyone or anything could drink it and gain the power he was getting. If his friends got some it wouldn't be so terrible but if a random demon found it or if Naraku was able to get his hands on it the world could be in very great danger. Than again, he could share some with Inuyasha and Shippo too and they would be even stronger as a team. He didn't think Kagome or Sango would want this kind of power. Both were long distance fighters. This kind of size and muscle would only hinder them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inuyasha might be stubborn about accepting outside help but Shippo would gladly accept more power.\" Miroku said to himself. \"But I have to be extremely careful how much I give or take myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiroku looked into the pool. One sip was enough to turn him into a ten foot muscle giant .How many thousands of sips were in the pool? The world wouldn't be able to handle him if he drank too much of the water. He pushed the thoughts from his head. This bottle was good enough to start with. He slipped the small bottle under his gauntlet making sure not to get it too close to the concealed Wind Tunnel and marked the pool. He wanted to make sure he remembered where it was. When he was sure he wouldn't forget this pool he turned and started walking back toward the village.</span></div></div>",

The problem was his feet were too small to make any noticeable stomp. He silently cursed his small stature, as it\u2019d been more of an annoyance than a boon. He almost wanted to cry, but he wouldn\u2019t. He was bigger than that. Well, mentally anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d been training hard, so hard to pass the Fox Examination to rank up in the fox demon hierarchy. But when he\u2019d finally reached the headquarters, Kurama, the chief fox demon refused to let him take it. The reason? He was too small!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAGH! IT\u2019S SO UNFAIR! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE TO TREAT ME SO SMALL!\u201d He shouted. Ever since Naraku\u2019s defeat, everyone had moved on with their lives. Miroku and Sango had settled down, even Inuyasha and Kagome too. Heck, even Kohaku was becoming a proficient demon hunter, since Sango had her three kids to look after, working together with Miroku and Inuyasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still stuck. He hadn\u2019t grown up too much, so everyone really treated really the same. Everyone had moved on, but he\u2019d been stuck with the same treatment. All because he couldn\u2019t be bigger!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d He shouted, shutting his eyes in a blind rage, kicking a rock out of frustration. *ping * THWACK! \u201cOUCH!\u201d Shippo cried, because the rock had ricocheted off one of the trees, whacking him directly off balance, leaving him with a welt. \u201cWh-whoa!\u201d He cried, knocked off balance from the impact, crying as he fell backwards, directly down the gentle slope nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOW OW OW OW OW OW!\u201d He cried, rolling down the hill, until he finally came to a stop. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201d He whined, slowly getting up before collapsing to his knees as his foot gave out. \u201cOuch\u2026\u201d Shippo muttered, gripping his chest before feeling a warm, sticky liquid over his hand. Looking down, he saw blood dripping over his hand, and his shirt was ripped at the front, his chest scratched up. Slowly limping back home, he whispered almost like a mantra, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u2026 it\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Kaede\u2019s House====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really do need to be careful!\u201d Kaede chided Shippo, as she finished wrapping bandaids around his chest and foot. She looked down at the small fox, gently rubbing his head. She knew he tried so hard, but he always got so frustrated. He trained so hard, only for everyone to treat him like delicate glass pottery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026 it\u2019s just frustrating\u2026\u201d Shippo grunted, perking up a little bit as Kaede handed him his shirt back, mended. \u201cThank you!!\u201d He shouted happily, glad to see his favorite shirt fixed. \u201cUm\u2026 Kaede\u2026\u201d He continued, as he put his shirt back on over the wrappings on his chest. \u201cDo you think you could rub my feet at least, they still hurt a bit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Shippo.\u201d Kaede replied kindly. For all his anger, he could still be so innocent. She smiled, eye shut in amusement, as she bent down to rub his furry feet, listening to the gentle purrs he gave off. \u201cYou know, they say that pains in your feet and hands are the sign of a major growth spurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippo yawned, obviously tired from his journey. \u201cYou really think so? My hands have kind of been hurting lately too\u2026\u201d Kaede laughed, as Shippo swayed back and forth, eyes barely staying open as he struggled to stay awake. Eventually she decided to carry him over to his room, since he stayed with her, in one of the spare rooms she had, and she laid him to bed, covering him with his covers, and rubbing his soft hair, soft almost like a fox. \u201cWho knows, maybe?\u201d She said, as she began walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wish I could be bigger\u2026\u201d She heard him say, smiling sadly. She knew how much he missed his mother and father, but she was glad that she and Inuyasha and his group could help cover that. Right as she was about to leave the room, she could have sworn she felt a frighteningly terrifying presence. Turning around, she looked around intently, trying to see what it was, but she couldn\u2019t see anything. \u201cI must be getting old\u2026\u201d She chuckled, as she exited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she wasn\u2019t wrong as Shippo slept, gently scratching at the bandages around his chest. In truth, had she looked closer, she would have seen a familiar pink glow, from a particular shard embedded in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Inuyasha had dealt the final blow to the Shikon Jewel with his Meido Zangetsuha, the good within the jewel triumphed over its evil, and it shattered, forever lost to history, or so they thought. As testament to the final triumph, a sole, pure shard had survived, one that had become embedded in Shippo\u2019s chest, and one that had heard his wish\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the days passed by, Kaede watched with a sort of joy in her eyes as Shippo got back into her training, She still wanted to keep the bandages on, which he somewhat agreed to reluctantly, although it was mainly because she threatened not to make his favorite meal for a while. She was probably just being paranoid, since as a demon he could heal very fast, but still, she wanted to be cautious, since he definitely took a fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was interesting to see, especially since he seemed to have a new vitality. Every day he woke up, he seemed a little bit more energetic, and it made him happy, and seeing him happy made her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippo seemed to be feeling the effects as well. He kept trying to develop new techniques. He always had his illusions. No kitsune could call themselves that proper if they didn't understand the basics of them. But he needed actual offense, so he'd been always trying to work on honing his Kitsune Fire. He'd been working on control first, forming a ball, then just trying to bounce it back and forth. The hardest part was simply keeping it in ball form when he tossed it up. Mainly because it exploded...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! I almost got it!\" He muttered, sweat rolling down his brow. He wasn't sure what happened, but his fire felt so much more energetic, even he did. And he liked it. But he kept tossing the ball up, and catching it, and exploding, and he kept that up for a while. But finally, after much effort, he tossed the ball up, and caught it again! He blinked for little bit as he looked at the orb in his hands before a giant foxy grin that could rival another famous one appeared on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! I DID IT!\" He shouted, bouncing up and down with glee, unable to restrain himself. Although he did stop once he smelt something weird. \"Wait... what smells like its burning?\" He muttered, looking around to try to figure out what it was. It smelled meaty, it smelled like... him? Finally, he looked at his hand, and saw it was smoking, mainly from the fire he was holding.... he probably should have realized that. \"OW OW OW OW!\" He shouted as he dropped the fire ball, catching a small portion of the field on fire as the blue flames spread, even as he shook his hand, smoke coming from it. \"Hot hot hot...\" He whined, as he blew gently on it. Once he noticed the other fire, his eyes widened in surprise, \"Oh crap! Kaede's gonna get mad at me again!\" He shouted as he moved over to stamp it out. Kaede got mad when he accidentally set fire to her favorite tree, and tended to get annoyed when he set the forest on fire. It's not his fault Kitsune's natural affinity was for fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting after he finally got the fire extinguished, his ears perked up as he heard a far off boom in the distance, turning to see some giant, dark story clouds a ways off. He hadn't seen some like those in a long time. They almost reminded him of the lightning demons that killed his father... eyes drooping down at the thought, he picked himself back up. No need to let old ghosts bother him... Plus, he better get back to Kaede, no need to make her worry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Kaede's Hut====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaede was busy sweeping the front of her hut, not really because it was dirty, but mainly because she was waiting for Shippo. Perhaps she thought it would keep it clean if she swept hard enough before the storm, but really, she was just hoping the boy would make it home soon. She strained her old eye trying to see if she could see home, silently cursing Naraku for taking her other one. Honestly, she was having a hard time seeing as is! Maybe she could persuade Kagome to get her a pair of those things, what were they called, glasses?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaede!!\" She turned to see Shippo running over, his appearance slightly dirty, and... was that soot? Agh, the boy was working on fire again. Hopefully he didn't set anything on fire again. Running over, one of his feet got caught on the other, and he tripped face-planting on the ground, making Kaede smile. Oh, to be young again haha. \"Ow...\" Shippo muttered as he pulled himself up, brushing a bit of dust off, before his smile came back. \"Kaede! Look! I did it!\" He yelled as he formed a ball of fire in his hands, Kaede looking on impressed at it, before he drew his arm back, making her blanche. Surely he wasn't thinking of! *WHOOSH* And he threw the orb a ways off, both of them watching as it exploded in a burst of fire, leaving a decent sized crater nearby. \"Uhhh.... oops?\" Shippo said, sweat dropping as Kaede's eye twitched. That's right, to be young again for certain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll fix it in the morning. Come now, it's gonna be stormy soon.\" She said, keeping her eye on the approaching clouds. It's been a long time since they'd seen anything like this, she thought as she ushered him inside. That night, was one of the roughest storms she'd seen in all her years. She hoped it wasn't any kind of omen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====The next day====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippo stirred as he heard the sounds of Kaede grunting nearby. \"Agh, why do tree branches have to be so heavy!\" Waking, and wiping the sleep from his eyes, he walked out, seeing Kaede trying to get a decent sized tree branch from the middle of the road where it had snapped off a nearby tree. Had she been 20 years younger, she might have been able to move it, but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted as she felt an extra push, smiling as she saw Shippo trying to give her hand. Of course, \"So heavy...\" He muttered, trying to push against it with his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, use your whole body, push with your legs!\" She encouraged, as he followed her instructions, \"On the count of three, we'll push at the same time. One... two... three!\" She shouted, as they moved the tree out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... my shirt!\" She heard him whine as she looked down, seeing a stray branch had caught and ripped his shirt up. She suppose she should probably mend that again, but her eye caught something else, mainly that his clothes perhaps needed a little bit more than mending. They actually seemed a bit smaller than him! She could see his furry ankles where they stuck out, normally when they were covered. Heck, she realized he'd actually gotten a lot bigger. He normally came to her shin, but now, he was almost reaching her knee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she saw his pouting, his face seeming just a barest hint of a bit more mature. \"Haha, I'd say I'd mend it, but I'm gonna need a bit more fabric!\" Confused, Shippo looked at what she meant, before his eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bigger! You were right Kaede! It was a growth spurt!\" He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I'll get your clothes fixed and adjusted, but I'll need to borrow them to find the right fabric, but that means you'll have to stay inside until I get back, as I don't have anything in your size.\" Kaede explained, somewhat unprepared for his unexpected growth spurt, but she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... fine...\" Shippo muttered, somewhat disappointed, he did want to go train more. Walking inside, he stripped down, handing his torn clothes to Kaeda. She had to admit, his body seemed a lot more mature, the barest hints of muscle showing, and although he seemed a bit clueless about it, he had the beginnings of something that could make any man or woman lust, if how tight his undergarment was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh if only I was a young girl!' Inner Kaede shouted, leaving Kaede blinking if whether or not she was going insane. \"I'll be back as soon as I can, until then, find a way to entertain yourself!\" Kaede said, as she took his clothes and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Shippo said as he watched her walk off, adjust the underwear Kagome had given him from the future, although they felt tight. What could a guy do to keep him occupied for a day...?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shippo yawned as he laid on top of Kaede's hut somewhat bored out of his mind, clad only in the underwear Kagome had given him. \"This stinks...\" He muttered. He wanted to go train more, but he couldn't, since he was nearly naked. Akuma did have their dignity, and training nearly completely naked wasn't part of that. He at least didn't have to worry, Kaede lived enough on the outskirts thatmostly everyone was working in the fields, farming or cleaning up after that giant storm last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could go take a nap..\" He sighed. After an hour or so of cloud watching, trying to find whatever patterns he could, it was always an effect that it made someone tired. Standing up, he jumped off of the hut's roof, his leg muscles tensing up as he hit the ground. Suppressing another yawn, he walked into Kaede's hut, his tail wagging behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before he was going to lay down, he caught sight of himself in a reflective piece of glass nearby, and paused, brows raised. \"Wait, is that really me?\" He gasped as he actually got a bead of how much he'd shot up. He really did get quite the growth spurt! He'd grown a couple inches, and he'd lost a lot of the childish fat he'd just assumed he'd have forever. Combined with his increase in height, it left him with a kind of lithe lankiness, he thought as he wrinkled his toes, noticing his paws had grown a little as well, the fur starting to travel up from his paws to cover his mid-legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching his chest, he saw just the faintest hints of what promised to be muscle. Just the barest hints of what could be an impressive set of pecs and abs. If he had to stuck with this for the next 10 or so years, he would be fine with that. Still, \"How did I not notice that....\" He wondered. Now that he thought about it, he did notice that his perspective was a lot higher. He didn't remember that table, or even that doorway being as low as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer, he saw a lot of that childish pudge on his face had melted away as well, leaving him in that borderline between a child and a young adult. His tail wagging behind him caught his attention, and he saw it was starting to lose a lot of that soft, fluffiness as it started gaining a certain stiff, length to it, although it still maintained the fluffiness for now, as he felt it, letting it flick to the front so he could examine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting it back, he realized that there was one other improvement he had missed. He was packing!! \"Damn, now how did I really miss that!\" Fortunately, before his dad had passed, he had taught him about the foxes and the wolves. (heaven forbid that Kagome, Inuyasha, Kaede, or especially Miroku had to teach him about that!). He did pick up a few things from them. He'd feigned sleep enough times to hear a few things, and he'd had to bathe with them enough too when the girls weren't around. As for as things went, demons were well known for their impressive sexual conquests, and even Inuyasha, being half-demon, basically took the size curve for humans, and completely smashed it to pieces. At least, if he was going off of the information Miroku had gotten from Kagome when he had asked the question, some info she got from some web thing or whatever, to which he proudly claimed he was much above average, earning him a good smack from her. At least for what he could tell, they didn't seem to be lying if appearances told the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, he grabbed the tight waistband of his boxers, pulling them down to let his soft penis hang out. It hung down to his mid-thigh, which was not nearly as impressive if he was fully grown, but on his smaller frame was still a sight to behold. Slowly, he reached down as he gripped it. He'd seen enough from those two guys, honestly, they were as horny as dogs (pun intended), and repressed a moan as he gripped his cock, feeling it slowly feel with blood as a nice, pleasurable sensation filled him. His knees twitched as he started slow, steady motion, biting his lip as he teased his head. \"Ungh... that feels... so good...\" He groaned as he slowly hit his full length, nearly 7 inches although he wasn't fully aware of the modern measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping on his foxy butt, he groaned as he hit his full arousal, barely able to wrap his hand around it. \"Ungh, no wonder they were always doing it...\" He moaned, his other hand cupping his balls as he stroked faster and faster. Sweat poured down his brow as his hand moved faster and faster, feeling the veins on it throbbing, the clear, liquid he was leaking enough to lubricate his stroking. He began feeling better and better as he stroked faster and faster, moaning all the while as he started feeling his stomach tighten, as if he needed to use the bathroom. The pleasure was so good, it saturated every part of him, until it felt as though he opened the floodgates<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, he came, at least six or seven long spurts shooting out over the span of a minute, the long, thick ropes raining down over him, and even shooting to the other side of the room, thrusting particularly hard with each spurt. Panting heavily, he regained some of his focus, as he looked down. \"Whoa, did I do that...?\" He blinked, seeing he was covered in white, cum, along with another large puddle on the other side, followed by sputtering drops all the way across his futon to his softening dick. \"That... was awesome... now how do I clean this up...?\" He muttered, as the scent of his release hit him. Kaede would definitely notice that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====With Kaede====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaede looked carefully through the fabric selection offered as she tried to find the right match for the clothes. \"Hopefully those selections will match what you were looking for Lady Kaede!\" The merchant cheerfully answered, glad to help out the village priestess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certain they will!\" Kaede answered with a smile, as she looked down at the fabric in her hands. She found a match for nearly everything except his fur coat. Hopefully he wouldn't mind if that was a little too small for now. She would have to wait for the hunters to get back to find a match for that. As she turned to leave,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaede!!\" A familiar voice rang out as she turned to face her sister. No, her eyes blinked as her sister was replaced by the somewhat wilder image of Kagome, dressed in her miko robes. Honestly, there will probably never be a day where she wouldn't have to correct herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kagome!\" She replied, always glad to see the young girl, accompanied with her companion and now husband, arms crossed as he looked annoyed. \"And you brought Inuyasha too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you too old hag.\" He chuffed. She huffed at him back. At least he hadn't lost his sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the clothes?\" Kagome asked, tic mark somewhat pulsing on her forehead as she tried to ignore his rambunctiousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, these, they're for Shippo. He's hit a bit of a growth spurt lately, so I'm just getting some materials to fix up his clothes so they can fit him.\" She answered, to which they seemed a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, so the little brat's finally growing up eh? It's about time!\" Inuyasha smiled before he heard the familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inuyahsa...\" \"Oh crap.\" \"SIT!\" *WHOOM!* Kagome said, with a smile that even scared Kaede, making her wonder if she should back up a little bit. Perhaps its true what they said. Marriage did change people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blergh, ugh, geez, you've been like this ever since we-\" \"SIT!\" \"AGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaede didn't need for him to finish his statement for her to understand what he was saying. She blinked somewhat in surprise. The somewhat chilling sadism, possible mood swings... it all added up... \"You mean to say you're-?\" She gasped out, to which Kagome smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm!\" She replied as she placed her hand on her stomach. \"About four months along now! We were able to get a check-up in the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I thought the Bone-Eater's well had ceased to work.\" Kaede wondered. Perhaps she had to check it out.\"But congratularions! I'm sure you must be so happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delighted.\" Came Inuyasha's muffled voice from the ground. Kaede had to feel a bit of pity for him. How would he survive a couple more months of this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did too, but I just had an feeling it would work.\" Kagome said. \"Mother was very happy too, and its been delightful. Plus it didn't hurt, okay it did hurt, but since Inuyasha is hung as a- \"KAGOME!\" \"Oh, sorry haha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, it did change people. Kaede decided it was best to take her leave. But considering she supposed whoever it was would essentially be her niece or nephew, she supposed she couldn't complain. \"Well, I must take my leave, I must get these to Shippo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Kaede!\" She waved them off, while Inuyasha just gave off a muffled groan. Kaede offered a silent blessing for him and walked off. Within a while, she had managed to make it back to her hut where Shippo welcomed her back. He acted a little weird, but she figured it was nothing. Now what was that weird smell...</span></div></div>",

When it got to the point when it was too much, he blacked out. When he woke up with a massive headache. He was surprised when he felt the wind caress his naked skin. He looked down and saw he was very naked. Not only that but he was incredibly strong. Jaden began to feel the rest of his new body. His pecs were the size of large beach balls, had a full, ripped set of ten-pack abs, biceps the size of bowling balls, his thighs widened to the point where he was standing on small trees and his calves grew to form a perfect diamond and found a one foot penis with large baseballs that dangled between his thighs. Jaden couldn't help at this point to have a giant grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this a card that can change a duel.\" Jaden grabbed his duel disk and headed to...</span></div></div>",

With gentle care, he tapped the door to his room with his index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden that you?\" Cyrus asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Could you and Hassleberry come out here? I've got something to show you guys.\" Jaden said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright but I feel like I should warn you. Hassleberry isn't wearing much.\" Cyrus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden just laughed softly to himself at that. Cyrus, in his pajamas, opened the door with a nearly naked Hassleberry, just his boxers, saw their friend now a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden you're..you're\" Syrus tried to say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh\" Jaden said \"Meet me at the forest entrence. We'll talk there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden then leaped off to their meeting place. However what took Jaden a single jump, took Hassleberry and Cyrus about 20 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay how this happen?\" Hassleberry asked as they found Jaden<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I had gotten out of detention with Crowler and as I was almost back the dorm, I saw a card on the ground. Thought it looked at little weird so I tried it out and then this happened.\" Jaden responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still have the card?\" Cyrus asked \"Maybe it can turn you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah its still in my duel disk.\" Jaden said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then set down the disk and Hassleberry picked it up and accidentally turned it on. The hologram of the card then appeared. Like with Jaden, the card turn towards Cyrus and Hassleberry. It bathed the both of them in a bright light for a short time and once again the hologram disappeared and the duel disk turned off. They then felt the intense burning that Jaden had felt. Cyrus was growing to be about as strong and tall as Jaden. The only differences were he was a few inches shorter, only had an eight pack and his penis was just about a half inch shorter. As to Hassleberry, with him already having muscle he had the biggest change. His boxers quickly gave way to his three foot penis with volleyball.  His legs were as thick as a small house and lead up to a massive twelve pack that held abs the size of beach balls. These abs were shadowed by gigantic pecs which looked like two boulders had been pressed into his chest. His biceps were out of this world with each being half the size of most adult humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their transformation were done they blacked out. Cyrus ended up falling on top of Hassleberry. At that point, Jaden just sat there and waited for them to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyrus was the first to wake up after about ten minutes thinking everything was a dream until he saw Hassleberry and Jaden. Hassleberry woke up a few minutes later with the first thing he did flex his new bigger muscles.</span></div></div>",

Bouncing his giant pecs up and down, \"I'm even bigger than you Jay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyrus was entranced by his new size, he was feeling ever inch of his body, abs, pecs, biceps, and his new \"tool\". Jaden and Hassleberry looked over at their once tiny friend, smirking at the boy's wonderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm huge!\" stuttered Cyrus. \"My arms, my chest, my um, whoa...\" Cyrus felt his new pole, slowly reaching a hardened state. Both his classmates raised an eyebrow, their own massive cocks stiffing up as well. \"I'm so, so, <b>HOT</b>!\" Cyrus started to ferociously rub his cock up and down, intoxicated by his size. \"Oh, yes, yes!\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there Cy!\" Hassleberry cut Cyrus off. \"Before we treat ourselves, don't you think we should thank a certain someone first?\" he said turning to Jaden, who blushed as his dick twitched with anticipation. Cyrus opened his eyes and let go of his manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" said Cyrus, kneeling in front of Jaden. \"Thank you, Jaden.\" He took Jaden's dick in his mouth, all the way down to the base. He sucked and slurped, fondling his friend's balls while Hassleberry took Jaden from behind, shoving his monster rod into Jaden's sculpted ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahh!\" yelped Jaden, completely unprepared for what was happening. Once he adjusted, he shut his eyes and enjoyed the feelings. Cyrus's mouth was wet and warm, Jaden was surprised it could take his foot-and-a-half long schlong. Tyranno's own pole was a massive, rigid fire hose of a dick, repeatedly slamming Jaden's sweet spot. \"Mmmm,\" Jaden moaned, he took a massive hand and set it on Cyrus's head, coaxing him to go faster. With his other, he reached down and took Cyrus's own cock, deciding that his friend should be allowed to have some fun too. He felt as Hassleberry reached up towards his chest and squeezed his pecs, the euphoria about to reach its apex \"Guys... muttered Jaden, \"I'm about to...\" He squeezed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" exclaimed Cyrus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me three!\" shouted Hassleberry. There was a silence as time seemed to stop all around them. Then all at once, all three titans, screamed as a torrent of cum was expelled from their bodies. Cyrus couldn't keep all of Jaden's in, his friend's cock popped out and splattered cum on the ground. Cyrus's own cock released a wave of seed that covered himself and Jaden's chest, while Hassleberry unloaded into Jaden's ass only to pull out and have the remainder spray across Jaden's back and himself. Their cocks sprayed for almost two whole minutes, until they died down as the three laid on the earth, huffing and puffing, exhausted from their experience. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cloudy day in Amestris as Edward Elric and his younger brother Alphonse made their way to East City HQ in response to a summons issued by their superior officer, Col. Mustang. Edward, as was to be expected, was rather despondent having to see the Colonel again, especially after his last assignment had been such a disaster. Everything had been going fine, he had finished his assignment with no problems whatsoever in fact. Then someone had made the mistake of mentioning how miraculous it was such a small boy could be so good at alchemy. Well, needless to say, the result of that comment wasn\u2019t pretty and the town he had been in had suffered massive collateral damage, several injuries, and Ed\u2019s own automail arm getting broken. He had been resting in Resembool while Winry fixed it when the summons had arrived. He had apologized to Winry and had left, making sure to stand in front of Al so that any flying wrenches struck his metal brother rather his own head, and taken the next train to East City. He was there the next day and now stood in front of Roy\u2019s desk, a frown on his face. Al was standing outside Roy\u2019s office, trying to listen in, ready to charge in should his brother try and start anything. The other soldiers in the immediate area had looked up when Ed and Al arrived, then had promptly went back to work, waiting for the bombshell that was sure to come. Roy just stared at Ed for a few minutes, his hands folded in front of him, while Ed stared right back, waiting for the admonitions and the mockery to start. Roy reached over and grabbed a paper, looking it over, letting Ed stew awhile longer. After setting the paper aside, he continued to stare at Ed. Finally Ed lost his temper and shouted, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\nRoy, who had been stacking papers inside one of his desk drawers looked at Ed in surprise and said, \u201cPatience Fullmetal.\u201d<br>\r\nEd just sighed in annoyance and tried to fold his arms, forgetting that he had left his automail one at Winry\u2019s to get fixed. This seemed to annoy him even more, forcing a smile on Roy\u2019s face. He seemed to think he had tortured the blond alchemist enough for now, because he took out a different sheet of paper and said, \u201cThis is the report for your next assignment. Read it over.\u201d<br>\r\nEd grabbed the paper and scanned over it. It was a pretty simplistic report. Apparently a strange substance had been found in the wreckage of Lab 5. Even now, secrets from that place were still appearing. Hidden bunkers, skeletons of failed experiments, dangerous substances, and all manner of unpleasant things had been unearthed. Ed hadn\u2019t been forced to deal with anything from Lab 5 since his own experiences there and he had been hoping to never have anything to do with it again. The report was extremely vague. No one knew what the substance was, what experiments had been performed on it, or what use it might have. Ed looked up from the report and said, \u201cSo what do you want me to do?\u201d<br>\r\nRoy grabbed the report back and said, \u201cThe substance the report was talking about was found in liquid form in a bottle. This bottle had the appearance of an experiment, since it was found attached to electrodes, the wires severed. When the bottle was brought up from the underground room it had been in, it crystallized instantly into a stone. Whatever the stuff is, it had undergone similar experiments as the red water. This,\u201d he reached into another drawer and pulled out a small bottle with a purple stone in it. \u201cis the substance.\u201d<br>\r\nHe handed the bottle over to Ed who held it up close to his eyes. It looked similar to a Philosopher\u2019s Stone, but purple in color. He opened the bottle and held it out to Roy. Roy cocked an eyebrow at him but took the bottle back. Ed held his palm out to Roy who understood and knocked the stone out onto his palm. Ed held it up to his eyes and looked it over again. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything unusual about it at first glance, but some experimenting and research would no doubt yield results on whatever this stuff was. He dropped it back into the bottle and put the bottle in an inside pocket of his coat. He turned to leave, not quite believing his luck. The Colonel hadn\u2019t even mentioned his previous assignment. Just as he reached the door, his hand closing around the doorknob, Roy\u2019s voice called out, \u201cOh and one more thing Fullmetal.\u201d<br>\r\nEd groaned in frustration and turned back to the Colonel. He raised a finger and motioned Ed back to his desk. Once Ed reached it Roy said, \u201cAbout your last assignment.\u201d He pulled out a lengthy report and said, \u201cIt appears that after you delivered the research to South City I had commissioned you to deliver, you went on a rampage, causing massive collateral damage, several injuries, and emotional trauma. What exactly happened?\u201d<br>\r\nEd tried to explain, but knew it was doing no good. Roy did not look happy. When he finished his explanation, Roy stood up and turned to the window. \u201cAnd so another mishap thanks to the pipsqueak who can\u2019t control his temper.\u201d<br>\r\nEd growled in anger and leaped onto Roy\u2019s desk, grabbing at his collar, yelling, \u201cWho are you calling so sm\u2014\u201c<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, Roy pushed him off the desk. Ed lost his balance and fell backward, landing hard, the wind knocked out of him. Roy walked over to his sprawled form and said, \u201cThis can\u2019t keep happening Edward. I\u2019ve had too many complaints about you that have been ignored by the higher ups due to your skill as a State Alchemist. But they won\u2019t turn a blind eye forever.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike I care!\u201d Ed managed to gasp out in defiance.<br>\r\n\u201cWhether you care or not doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Roy said coldly. \u201cJust keep yourself under control or I\u2019m going to have to take drastic actions against you and that\u2019s not something I want to do.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right.\u201d Ed thought, but didn\u2019t say anything. He merely stood, saluted the Colonel coldly and left.<br>\r\nAl had heard the shouting, but hadn\u2019t done anything. He didn\u2019t want to burst in on Ed and the Colonel unless it was really necessary and nothing too awful seemed to have happened. Ed looked like he was in a foul mood, but he was always like that after seeing the Colonel so that didn\u2019t worry Al much.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, Al did start to worry when his brother\u2019s bad mood persisted on the train back to Resembool. The Colonel must\u2019ve said something that had really made him angry. Halfway back to Resembool, Al finally said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong big brother?\u201d<br>\r\nEd, who had been staring moodily out the window, turned to Al and said, \u201cNothing.\u201d<br>\r\nAl sighed and said, \u201cBut brother you\u2019ve sulking since we got back from seeing the Colonel. What did he say?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust drop it Al. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Ed said, anger creeping into his voice.<br>\r\nBut Al persisted, \u201cCome on brother, you can talk to me! Whatever it is, I\u2019m sure\u2014\u201c<br>\r\nEd finally lost his temper and shouted, \u201cI said I don\u2019t want to talk about it!\u201d<br>\r\nAl looked taken aback but stopped talking. Seeing his brother clam up like that, Ed started feeling bad and rubbed his head, a sharp pain accruing there. Going to see the Colonel always gave him a headache. In a much softer voice he said, \u201cI\u2019m just getting tired of him Al. Every time we see each other he\u2019s always so smug and cocky. He\u2019s always putting me down while I go out and make him look good.\u201d<br>\r\nAl suddenly thought of something and said, \u201cDoes this have anything to do with your height?\u201d<br>\r\nEd\u2019s eye twitched as he said in a dangerous voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my height?\u201d<br>\r\nAl gasped, held up his hands, and waved them around, saying, \u201cNothing! Nothing at all!\u201d<br>\r\nThinking fast, he changed the subject. \u201cSo what did he want?\u201d<br>\r\nEd pulled out the bottle and said, \u201cThis was found in the wreckage of Lab 5. No information was found about it, and no one knows what kind of experiments was run on it. So they left it up to me to figure it out.\u201d<br>\r\nAl grabbed the bottle and looked it over. He handed it back and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen or heard anything similar to this except for the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. Do you think they\u2019re connected?\u201d<br>\r\nEd shrugged and said, \u201cMaybe. It would explain why the Colonel is just handing it off to me instead of over to a different Lab.\u201d<br>\r\nEd and Al spent the rest of the trip talking about what the stone might be, what Lab 5 was doing with it, and what they were expected to do with it. As they stepped out onto the platform, Ed said, \u201cNow that I think about it, if this thing came from Lab 5 do we really want to have anything to do with it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026do you think this was made by sacrificing humans like the Philosopher\u2019s Stone?\u201d Al asked nervously.<br>\r\nEd pulled out the stone and looked at it. He tucked it away again and said, \u201cCall it intuition Al, but I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that. Just looking at this stone\u2026I don\u2019t know, it just feels safe to me.\u201d<br>\r\nAl looked quizzically at Ed. \u201cWow brother, you never judge things on just feelings. You usually need research and science to prove something.\u201d<br>\r\nEd looked a little crestfallen and said, \u201cYou make me sound like an emotionless monster.\u201d<br>\r\nAl giggled at that and said, \u201cWell you do attack innocent bystanders for calling you sho-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cDON\u2019T SAY IT!!!\u201d Ed yelled lifting his suitcase up, ready to bean Al on the head if he dared utter that terrible word.<br>\r\nAl just laughed again and the two brothers headed down the road to Resembool.<br>\r\nIt was early the next morning by the time they made it to Winry and Pinako\u2019s house and the two brothers were happy to see a friendly house. Of course, with Winry in a bad mood over the littlest things, the house never started out friendly. As soon as Ed was in range of the upstairs window, Winry appeared, running onto the balcony with a wrench cocked back in her hand. With a shout of, \u201cHey Ed!\u201d she hurled the wrench directly at the little alchemist\u2019s head. Ed looked up at her voice just in time to get hit directly between the eyes. He fell backwards and was caught by Al who was prepared for just such an occurrence. Ed instantly leapt up, a trickle of blood running down his face from his new abrasion, and shouted, \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d<br>\r\nWinry gripped the wooden rail of the balcony and shouted back, \u201cThat was for running out on me you jerk! I wasn\u2019t even halfway done with your arm! What if you needed it before I finished? You could\u2019ve been killed!\u201d<br>\r\nEd groaned in frustration again, rubbing the blood from his face. This wasn\u2019t helping his headache which had persisted since his meeting with Roy. When he looked back up at the balcony he saw that Winry had disappeared back into the house. Ed felt a little wary. She might\u2019ve gone back inside to come down and greet them\u2026or she may have gone back in to get something else to throw. Regardless, Ed decided it would be best to head inside. Once the two brothers were inside, Winry appeared again with a large bundle in her arms. Ed flinched as he saw her but she gave him a withering look and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. This is just your arm. I\u2019m almost finished with it.\u201d<br>\r\nEd looked at the huge bundle she was carrying and said, \u201cWhy is it so big?\u201d<br>\r\nWinry rolled her eyes and said, \u201cThis is your arm plus a bunch of other metal and tools. I\u2019m moving it all from my workbench upstairs to the one in the living room.\u201d<br>\r\nEd sighed as Winry seemed to be over her bad mood. That was another strange thing about Winry. She got angry easily, but she never stayed angry for very long. Ed smiled at Al and said, \u201cMight as well get comfortable. We\u2019re going to be here for awhile.\u201d<br>\r\nAl nodded and they both headed upstairs. Most of the rooms in Winry\u2019s and Pinako\u2019s house were devoted to storage for various automail related projects, tools, materials, and records of their various patients. However, there was one room that they kept clear for recovering patients and this is where Ed and Al normally stayed. Ed took off his coat and kicked off his shoes before walking over to Al and opening up his chest plate. Instantly, several books and papers came cascading out into Ed\u2019s waiting arms. Before leaving for Resembool, Ed had grabbed some reference books and previous research data revolving around Lab 5, hoping to find some kind of lead as to what this strange stone might be. Just as he and Al sat down, however, Winry rushed in and walked up to Ed. Before he could say anything, Winry said, \u201cTake off your pants!\u201d<br>\r\nEd, wondering just what the heck was going on, said, \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\nWinry looked impatient as she said, \u201cJust do it!\u201d<br>\r\nEd stood up and did as she asked. As soon as his pants were down, she pushed him back into the chair and grabbed his automail leg, pulling it painfully from its socket. Ed yelled out in pain and said, \u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d<br>\r\nWinry looked at him scornfully and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be such a baby Ed! I\u2019m making some extra modifications to your arm and I need your leg so it can get the same treatment. It should only take a few extra hours. I should be completely done by tomorrow since I don\u2019t have to reconstruct them by scratch.\u201d<br>\r\nWinry actually looked a good deal cheerier as she left with Ed\u2019s leg. Al looked at Ed whose face had a slight shine to it from the sudden painful exertion and said, \u201cI think that was revenge for running out on her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, no kidding!\u201d Ed said, annoyance clear in his voice. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even give me a spare or anything!\u201d<br>\r\nAs though those words summoned her, Winry appeared and tossed a spare arm and leg to Ed. \u201cSorry I almost forgot about those!\u201d<br>\r\nEd inserted his arm and then his leg and stood up and stretched them out a little to make sure they were in properly. Once he was sure they were, he pulled his pants back on and sat at the table with Al. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s start experimenting!\u201d<br>\r\nFor hours and hours the two alchemists worked never stopping. When lunch came Pinako left something for Ed to eat and drink and Ed took the tray back down with the dirty dishes before heading to use the bathroom. Night was falling by the time Ed and Al threw down their pencils. Ed looked at the stone in disgust and said, \u201cNothing. No records, none of our experiments are yielding any results, and I can\u2019t even begin to figure out with this stuff is made of! It\u2019s almost like it came from a different world!\u201d<br>\r\nAl started stacking the loose papers and said, \u201cI wish we could\u2019ve seen what it looked like before it was crystallized or before the scientists at Lab 5 started experimenting. That might\u2019ve helped.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s no point in wishing about something impossible.\u201d Ed had a sour look on his face as he said this and Al thought Ed must\u2019ve spent a few nights wishing things were different.<br>\r\nWinry came at that moment into the room, breaking through the atmosphere of gloom that had settled in with each of the two brother\u2019s failures in identifying the substance and its purpose. She was dressed in her overalls which were spattered with oil and her hair was starting to fall out of her bandana in sweaty strands. A wrench was in her hand and Ed eyed it warily since Winry looked a little annoyed. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s taking a little bit longer than I thought to fix your arm and leg, so I\u2019m going to be pulling an all nighter. If you need anything, I\u2019ll be in the living room.\u201d<br>\r\nEd watched her leave, knowing she must\u2019ve come in here for company. It must get lonely standing all day by yourself in front of a tool bench. He grabbed the stone and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go down and keep Winry company alright?\u201d<br>\r\nAl looked surprised but nodded and said, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll just go through the research again to see if I can find anything we may have missed.\u201d<br>\r\nAl watched as his brother nodded and headed downstairs. Al knew what his brother was up to and didn\u2019t want to interrupt. He just hoped his brother would be able to keep his patience with Winry. Ed made his way to where Winry was and saw her hard at work at her bench, his arm and leg open, wires spilling out of them. Ed walked up to her and looked over her shoulder. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\nWinry turned to face Ed with a smile on her face and said, \u201cWorried about me Ed? I can take care of myself you know. You don\u2019t have to always worry about me.\u201d<br>\r\nEd blushed and said, \u201cWorry about you? Whose worried? I was seeing what was taking so long!\u201d<br>\r\nWinry frowned and said, \u201cWell excuse me Mr. Hotshot Alchemist! I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m taking time out of your busy schedule!\u201d<br>\r\nEd huffed and threw himself onto the couch, looking away from Winry. Winry in turn turned back to her bench and continued working. After a few minutes of silence Winry said softly, \u201cSo how\u2019s work going on that stone thing?\u201d<br>\r\nEd sighed and said, \u201cNot so good. No matter what me and Al do, nothing seems to work.\u201d<br>\r\nWinry sat down next to him and said, \u201cHere let me see it. You\u2019re looking at it through the perspective of a scientist. Maybe if you think about it through the perspective of a mechanic, you\u2019ll think of something new.\u201d<br>\r\nEd didn\u2019t look to enthusiastic about this idea, but handed the stone to Winry. She grabbed it and said, \u201cWow, it\u2019s so soft. I thought it would be hard like a rock.\u201d<br>\r\nEd was surprised to hear this. He\u2019d never touched it barehanded before, since he hadn\u2019t taken off his gloves since he got the stone. He pulled it off now and felt the stone, surprised to find it had an almost gummy quality. Pressing his finger into it clearly left a print, like silly putty. Winry pulled it and prodded it, trying to split it open, but it always stayed in a gooey strand.  No matter what she did, the thing wouldn\u2019t be split apart. Winry brought the stone to her nose and smelled it. \u201cHey it doesn\u2019t smell half bad.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore Ed could stop her she licked a tiny spot on the stone. Ed grabbed the stone back and said, \u201cWhat are you doing Winry?!? You don\u2019t know where that\u2019s been!\u201d<br>\r\nWinry seemed fine however. In fact, she seemed better than fine. She jumped up and said, \u201cSuddenly I feel like I\u2019m full of energy! Wow, I think I\u2019ll have your arm and leg done before morning Ed!\u201d<br>\r\nEd watched as Winry darted back to her bench and started frantically working again. It was strange. Winry had seemed so fatigued a minute ago, disappointed that she was going to have to work all night to finish repairs. But now she was moving like it was her first major job. Not only that, but her precision was also greatly increased. No matter how small the screw she would instantly find the proper screwdriver and have it screwed in as though her arm was an electric drill. Ed looked at the stone and wondered. Had the scientists in Lab 5 simply created a kind of energy booster? There was no doubt that it would greatly help the military if all the soldiers who were broken with fatigue could suddenly get all their energy back and more. Now that he thought about it, he was feeling pretty wiped out himself\u2026<br>\r\nEd started up the stairs back to the room he and Al were currently in, and bit the stone neatly in half. He wasn\u2019t worried about the effects the stone might have. After all, they hadn\u2019t hurt Winry. As he chewed he reasoned that Winry might also have taken in so small an amount that any strange effects if might have had wouldn\u2019t show. The stone tasted wonderful. Ed had never eaten anything that tasted quite like it, and he quickly swallowed it and ate the other half without thinking. Roy would probably be angry if he knew that Ed hadn\u2019t kept a small sample for later use or study, but Ed didn\u2019t care. As soon as he swallowed it, he was back in the room and Al was running towards him with a paper in hand.<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, look!\u201d Al held out the paper and said, \u201cI found something out about the stone! During one of the experiments in Lab 5 something came through the Gate after a failed attempt at human transmutation. The scientists disappeared and in their place was a bottle filled with purple liquid. Apparently it was called Giga Booster and was a kind of energy supplement. There was supposed to be strange side effects for anyone if they ate or drank the whole thing though.\u201d<br>\r\nEd felt a sudden fear enter his body. Strange side effects? He shakily sat down and said, \u201cWhat kind of side effects?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t really say. The bottle carried a warning, but it was ripped off when it came through the Gate.\u201d<br>\r\nEd looked at himself and wondered what was going to happen. Al noticed his brother was looking worried and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\nEd swallowed and said, \u201cI ate the stone.\u201d<br>\r\nAl looked shocked as he said, \u201cBrother how could you! What if it\u2019s poisonous?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell Winry licked it and it gave her a huge boost of energy and it tasted really good and I didn\u2019t think it would be that big of a deal!\u201d Ed yelled, his voice rising in panic.<br>\r\nBefore Al could say anything Ed felt a strange sensation course through his body. He felt flushed as he said, \u201cI think something\u2019s happening.\u201d<br>\r\nAl started to say something, but stopped as he saw his big brother appeared to be growing. Ed looked at himself in shock as his body started to expand, his back moving against the chair he was sitting on. Ed stuck out his legs as he saw his flesh and blood leg start growing longer, and thicker, while his spare leg stayed the same small size. The same thing was happening to his arm. A loud ripping noise was suddenly heard as Ed\u2019s leg became too big for his tight pants. Ed looked down at it and was shocked to see it wasn\u2019t just getting longer, but more muscular as well. Ed had always been pretty well muscled for his age, but the definition in his leg was much greater than anything he\u2019d had before. Ed flexed his arm and saw a bicep rise up much higher than normal, veins clearly snaking down the muscle, feeding it with blood and swelling it higher and higher. Ed\u2019s attention was drawn to his extremely tight shirt as it slowly ripped down from his collar revealing his expanding chest which felt much heavier, drawing down on Ed\u2019s torso until his back caught up, flaring behind him, broadening his shoulders and tearing his shirt apart, the cloth fluttering down around his abs, still clinging as he continued to expand. Ed pulled off the last remaining cloth revealing his abs as they deepened from six pack to an eight pack, cutting deep into his torso, each layer completely visible. Turning his leg around Ed admired his calf which had bulged up as much as his other muscles, giving it the appearance of a thick trunk of muscle. A loud groaning filled the air and the chair Ed was sitting on collapsed under his sudden extreme increase in weight. Winry, who was still operating under an extreme energy boost, didn\u2019t notice, nor did Pinako who was in the deep sleep of the elderly. Using the wall, Ed managed to stand on his one strong leg, the spare one dangling. Ed hadn\u2019t noticed it before, but the metal bases on the ends of his right arm and left leg hadn\u2019t grown with him and were cutting painfully into his flesh. He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cGo get Winry, quick!\u201d<br>\r\nAl looked up (yes, for once, up) at his brother and said, \u201cAre you sure Ed? This might be kind of a shock for her.\u201d<br>\r\nEd grabbed at his leg and said, \u201cShe\u2019ll deal with it. Hurry!\u201d<br>\r\nEd\u2019s voice had a deeper tone to it and made Al jump at the authority it afforded. He ran downstairs to find Winry working like a maniac on arms and legs that would now surely be far too small for Ed. She turned as she heard him coming and said, \u201cHey Al! What\u2019s up! Need something?!\u201d<br>\r\nAl sweatdropped at Winry and said, \u201cActually, Ed needs your help. He\u2019s\u2026well, you\u2019d better just come and see.\u201d<br>\r\nWorry suddenly clouded Winry\u2019s face as she followed Al back up to the room. Her worry was replaced by shock as she saw Ed, monstrously huge, sweat covering his face, grabbing at the metal that was clamping down on his stumps. Winry nearly fainted but Ed yelled out, \u201cDon\u2019t faint Winry! I really need you to remove these bases!\u201d<br>\r\nWinry got hold of herself and said, \u201cOkay, but it won\u2019t be easy. Those bases are attached to your nerves, which apparently are now a lot bigger thanks to whatever happened to you and that\u2019s why you\u2019re in so much pain.\u201d<br>\r\nEd nodded quickly and said, \u201cSure, whatever just get them off!\u201d<br>\r\nWinry pulled out a screwdriver and said, \u201cAlright, but it\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d<br>\r\nEd lost his patience and shouted, \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt more than it already does!\u201d<br>\r\nWinry wasn\u2019t listening. She quickly unscrewed the base around Ed\u2019s leg and pulled it out, disengaging the mechanism that connected it to his nerves. A sharp pain broke through the haze of constant pain already plaguing Ed, followed by immediate relief in his leg. Ed pushed his arm towards Winry who quickly unscrewed the base on it as well. Relief washed over Ed as he felt the pain replace itself with a much more bearable ache. He fell onto his back, causing a tremor to shake the room and knock a few books off the table. Winry just watched as Ed breathed heavily, his huge chest rising and falling. Before she knew it she was reaching out to touch him, but quickly pulled her hand back, picking up the bases. She saw that Al had seen her reaching and red flooded her face. She quickly said, \u201cI\u2019m going to make some new bases. I\u2019m going to have to start from scratch again. Looks like it\u2019s going to be another three days before I\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\nEd quickly sat up and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Winry. Just finish making my arm and leg like you were going to and gather up a bunch of scrap metal. I\u2019ll transmute them to a bigger size.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh brother? You can\u2019t transmute without your arm.\u201d Al pointed out.<br>\r\nEd thought about it and said, \u201cDammit, you\u2019re right. Well, I\u2019ll just draw up a transmutation circle to alter them the way I want and that\u2019ll have to work.\u201d<br>\r\nWinry felt relieved as she heard this. Still feeling the effects of the boost, she ran back downstairs and continued working. Ed, feeling better, stood up shakily to his full height. He was surprised to feel his head pressed up against the ceiling. He looked down at Al and smiled, realizing what all this meant. He was tall! No, he was beyond tall. He was taller than anyone he\u2019d ever run into, including Armstrong! He looked his muscled body over and realized he was far more built than Armstrong. He laughed as he thought about that. Then his thoughts trailed to the Colonel and his grin turned a little evil. Never again would the Colonel call him short, a shrimp, a pipsqueak. Never again would he look down on Ed with his smug smile and his demeaning attitude. Al must\u2019ve noticed his now giant brother\u2019s grin, because he said, \u201cBrother, I hope you\u2019re not thinking of doing something bad.\u201d<br>\r\nEd looked down at Al and said, \u201cNo, of course not!\u201d<br>\r\nBefore Al could say anything else, Ed started hopping towards the door. Unfortunately, he had to stop as the floor started to creak alarmingly and the table had fallen over. Instead, he jumped onto the bed, which promptly broke down under his new greater weight. He rubbed the back of his head and said, \u201cThis is going to take some getting used to.\u201d<br>\r\nThe night drifted by uneventfully with Al worrying about what had happened to his brother, Winry working like a maniac, and Ed fantasizing about what he was going to do with his new size. Every once in awhile he\u2019d flex a different muscle on his body, loving the way it bulged and filled with size and definition. Finally, as the sun was rising, Winry walked up the stairs trying not to focus on Ed\u2019s straining boxers and said, \u201cI finished them, did you make the transmutation circle?\u201d<br>\r\nEd suddenly realized he hadn\u2019t. He had been too busy fantasizing. Al dropped a design in Ed\u2019s lap and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I did it for you brother.\u201d<br>\r\nEd looked it over and saw that Al had made it so it would be exactly the same as his old automail arm except larger. He looked at his bicep and his defined arm overall. He didn\u2019t want to lose that, so he made a few adjustments to the circle. When he was ready, he used Al as support and managed to make his way down to the living room. It was an arduous trip due to both his and Al\u2019s huge sizes. They got stuck in the doorway, halfway down the stairwell, and in the doorframe to the living room. In each of these spots they both made enough noise to wake the dead, but Pinako still wasn\u2019t waking up. But that was for the best, since Ed\u2019s condition would be difficult to explain. Ed placed the circle on the ground and Winry dropped the arm, leg, and spare metal onto it. Ed touched the edge of the circle with his large hands and, with a flash of light, the arm and leg bulked up in size and muscle so that they matched their flesh and blood counterparts. Winry then placed the new bases against his arm stump and leg stump and reattached the nerves which was a great deal easier thanks to Ed\u2019s previous operations. Sweat had once again beaded on Ed\u2019s forehead but he grabbed the arm and shoved it into place followed quickly by the leg. The pain was intense and Ed felt numb with it. Within the last few hours he had undergone quite a bit of pain, but since it was a result of his body growing so drastically, he really didn\u2019t care. He stood to his full height again and stretched out his limbs making Winry stare, naughty thoughts running through her head. When Ed turned to go looking for something, she found Al staring at her again, which made her embarrassed all over again. Ed had left in search of spare fabric so that he could fix his clothes and get a fitting outfit. He managed to gather enough black and red fabric together as well as bits of metal to make buttons, zippers, and pocket clasps. Once it was all gathered along with the shreds of his other outfit, he clapped his hands and transmuted a much bigger outfit. He pulled it on as Winry came into the upstairs room with a small screwdriver, a small can of oil, and a rolled up kit of other tools. She said, \u201cI tried a new design with your arm and leg this time, so I want you to check how it\u2019s working every night and tell me about it so I can improve the design.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Winry.\u201d Ed said, smiling down at her. He was in a much better mood than he normally was thanks to the night\u2019s events.<br>\r\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Winry said with a gleam in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to charge you extra this time!\u201d<br>\r\nEd looked a little nervous since he hadn\u2019t brought much money with him on the trip. He said, \u201cSure\u2026I\u2019ll pay you next time I come.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that, he turned to grab his suitcase, yelling, \u201cAl! We\u2019re leaving!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Winry shouted, chasing after Ed as he ran down the stairs. \u201cDo you know how much steel I had to use to make those? Hey!\u201d<br>\r\nEd and Al waved good-bye to Winry, apologizing that they had to leave so fast. Winry crossed her arms and shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t stay away so long next time!\u201d<br>\r\nAs she watched them running into the distance, she realized she never found out what caused Ed\u2019s sudden growth. She sighed and decided she\u2019d call him about it later.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ed was basking in all the attention he was getting from the people of Resembool. All of them were shocked about his sudden change from pipsqueak to muscle giant. The people at the station were in the same awe. Many admiring comments came Ed\u2019s way, lifting Ed\u2019s spirits to the point that he was looking forward to seeing everyone back in East City. Ed and Al had a train car to themselves, since not many people from Resembool were heading to East City. They would probably pick up more passengers on the trip as they stopped at the different stations. Ed had an entire seat to himself, his legs crowding in on Al.<br>\r\nAnd so the trip passed by, worried thoughts plaguing Al\u2019s mind at the trouble Ed was going to get into, while Ed\u2019s head was filled with thought\u2019s of all the fun he was going to have.</span></div></div>",

Imagine his surprise when he saw none other than \"ED!!?\" He shrieked when he saw the former pipsqueak flexing his gigantic muscles outside his window. \"NOW I know why Armstrong likes to do this so much!

Then again, there was no guarantee that Ed was going to hold a grudge against him. Roy smirked and said, \"Well? What do you want Fullmetal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd didn't say anything he just bent down and grabbed Roy under his arms, lifting him to his face level. Roy nearly lost his composure at this sudden invasion of his personal space and kicked out at Ed's chest. His foot met with Ed's ripped pectoral and he swore he felt his toe break. He gritted his teeth at the pain and Ed grinned. \"What's the matter Colonel? Did you hurt yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy glared at Ed and said, \"Fullmetal, I am your superior officer and I demand that you let me down! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd laughed and said, \"I don't think you're in a position to give me orders Colonel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy didn't like the sound of that.

Tell her he's taking the next few days off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl was torn between going to get help from Hawkeye, and going after Ed to make sure he didn't do anything to Roy. Before he could decide, Ed took off running, disappearing into the distance within a few seconds. Al sighed and ran into East City HQ to tell Hawkeye what happened. Meanwhile, Ed was carrying Roy off into a forest that was a little ways outside of East City. He didn't want his time with the Colonel to be interrupted. When he got to a clearing in the middle of the woods, he dropped Roy onto the ground and loomed over him, his hands on his hips. Roy looked up at the blond giant defiantly.

Roy Mustang coughed, his eyes began to water as Ed took off his other boot with not the least bit of difficulty seeing as how his other foot didn't sweat.

With a sigh Mustang kneeled down and began to rub both Ed's feet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roy felt like he was experiencing torture. About half an hour ago Roy had stripped off his jacket and rolled up the sleeves of his white shirt to better rub Ed's foul feet. Ed had fallen into a half sleeping stupor due to the relaxing sensation of Roy's hands. Since Roy did very little in the way of hand to hand combat (and since he hardly ever uses a pen unless he's backed into a corner, not to mention that he always wears gloves) his hands were very soft. While Ed was enjoying it, Roy was suffering. Ed's real foot was so big he needed two hands to rub around his massive toes and it wasn't fun pulling massive clumps of sock lint and who knows what else out from between them. The stink was nearly unbearable though Roy soon got somewhat used to it. Just when Roy thought he'd go nuts if Ed didn't tell him to stop, Ed sat halfway up, leaning on his elbows, and said, \"You make a good foot massager Colonel. But I think you can do better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy glared into Ed's golden eyes and said, \"This isn't enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smiled and pretended to think. \"Hmmm...How long have I been working under you Colonel? I don't keep track but it's been a good long time, don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy didn't say anything but Ed wasn't really looking for an answer anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in the time I've been working for you you've been unequal parts helpful and rude. To balance out your rude behavior, your smug comments, and your insults, you have to do what I say for as long as I deem necessary. Equivalent Exchange after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy still didn't say anything. He was waiting for the proverbial bomb to drop. Finally, Ed said, \"So instead of rubbing...get licking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down at the moist foot in front of him and shuddered at the the thought of putting his tongue down on Ed's rough foot. He looked up at Ed who, underneath his gloating smile, had a look that clearly said, \"Don't screw with me. Just do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy closed his eyes and prayed no one would ever know of this. He stuck out his tongue and slowly lowered it to Ed's big toe. He took a tentative lick and nearly gagged. He managed to keep his cool though and took another lick. This one wasn't as bad. He continued licking all around the toe, between it and the others, and eventually down to the sole and heel. After the first few licks Roy didn't really notice the taste. He had cleaned off most of the crap with his hands (which were still moist with sweat and stink) and the most dominant flavor was salt and sweat. Ed chuckled as he felt Roy's tiny tongue work all over his foot. He didn't bother instructing Roy to lick or rub the automail foot since he wouldn't feel it anyway. The only question on his mind, outside the enjoyment, was what would he have Roy do next.</span></div></div>",

Without another word Ed grabbed Roy and flung him over his shoulder. Roy, having time to reflect on his situation as he bounced up and down on Ed's shoulder as Ed ran, was left wondering what exactly was going to happen to him. Surely Ed couldn't keep this up for too long? Would Ed really keep torturing him like this? I mean, they had a couple of rocky moments throughout their time together but hadn't they built a relationship based on mutual respect? Apparently not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was too busy ruminating to realize that Ed had arrived back in the city and was setting him on his feet in front of an apartment. Ed pushed him forward and Roy realized he was supposed to walk in first. He did so and stood back to see how Ed planned on getting in. He heard the echoing sound of Ed's hands clapping together and watched as the door frame grew big enough to let Ed through. Ed left the door as it was since he would be going in an out of it a lot in the next few weeks. Ed let Roy walk ahead of him, transmuting everything to match his size as he went so he'd be able to comfortably fit through. Finally, they reached Ed and Al's apartment. Roy stood by and watched as Ed increased the size of everything in the room until Roy felt like a child again. Ed grinned down at the small Colonel and said, \"And now it's time to get clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd grabbed Roy by the back of his shirt and lifted him into the bathroom with him. Roy stood frozen in fear as Ed slowly undressed himself. Soon, he was down to his boxers. At this moment Ed turned to Roy and said, \"Strip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy gulped and said, \"Now Fullmetal...this can't happen. I don't know what you're thinking but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd stomped over to Roy and gripped his shirt collar in one hand. With a swift downward motion Roy's shirt was torn off leaving him bare chested. Roy shouted in surprise and said, \"Stop that! I can do it myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked and crossed his arms. \"Then do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy muttered under his breath but undid his pants and pulled them off along with his shoes and socks. Now they were both in their boxers. Ed turned on the shower and waited until the water was warm. When it was he pulled off his boxers leaving him in his very impressive nudity. He looked back at Roy and said, \"Off with the boxers Colonel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy waited until Ed turned back around before removing his boxers. He felt very vulnerable, a feeling he hadn't been forced to feel in awhile. It was very uncomfortable. Ed stepped into the shower and sighed as he felt the warm water hit his huge body. It was very relaxing. He beckoned Roy who stepped closer to the shower but didn't step in. But Ed wasn't having any of that. With a quick jerk he reached out and pulled Roy behind the curtain. Roy was very careful not to look up at Ed's crotch. Ed smirked at that and said, \"You'll have to look sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt his arms forced upward and something deposited in it. He looked in his hands and saw the bar of soap. He looked up (moving fast over Ed's crotch) and looked up at Ed's smiling face. Ed just said, \"I was going to use you as soap, but you're not quite that small. So instead, you get to soap me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighed and made a lather. The faster he did this, the faster it would be over. Once he had a good lather going he started scrubbing. He did Ed's feet first, getting the sole and scrubbing between the toes. He moved up Ed's legs next, skirting his crotch and butt (at least for now) and reaching his highest only managed to reach Ed's hips. Ed grabbed him and said, \"Wow, guess you're too small to reach. Hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt the bar of soap taken out of his hands. Before he could say or do anything Ed ran the soap all over Roy's body, getting him completely lathered from head to toe. As soon as he was covered, Ed started running Roy's body over his chest. It was a strange feeling as Roy's body was shoved all around. One of the worst parts, for Roy, was when Ed forced Roy's face into his armpits, the stink of sweat filling his nostrils again. When Ed pushed Roy over his shoulder to scrub his back Roy ran his hands over whatever he could reach, hoping to move this whole process along. Finally, it was almost over. Only one thing remained. Ed's privates. Roy held his breath, just waiting for Ed to force him face first into his meat.</span></div></div>",

Ed moaned in pleasure, high on his new power over the colonel. \"Hey Mustang! Take a few licks would ya?\" Ed moaned. Roy had no choice, he slowly stuck his tongue out and began to lick Ed's penis and balls. Even the sweaty crevices on either sides, above and under his sack. Edward slowly but surely, began to stroke himself. Moaning in pleasure, he began to quicken his strokes.  Very soon Ed reached his climax, spraying his seed all over Mustang.

His face is rubbed thoroughly throughout the crack, then he is moved on to the cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tons of pure muscle and fat of the cheeks is almost too much for Mustang. He began to cry, and his tears mixed with the soap to run down Ed's ass and snake around his legs, ultimately leading him to believe that this, just like his tears, was only turning into a spiraling descent of depression and sadism.

He tried wiping off as much of it as he could, but Ed said, \"Don't worry about it right now Colonel. You have something more important to focus on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy watched in horror as Ed's dick started hardening again. It didn't matter that he had just stroked himself off less than a minute ago. Ed looked pointedly at it and said, \"Start sucking. Before I lose my temper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd said it in a low and dangerous voice that Roy knew meant business. He closed his eyes and put his lips around Ed's dick head. It was huge, the head alone filling his mouth to the overflowing point. Ed moaned as he felt the Colonel's hot little mouth sucking a portion of his head. This just helped illustrate how much bigger Ed was in comparison to Roy. Roy could taste the residual cum left around his head from his previous ejaculation along with the heat and salt of Ed's skin and the water pouring over his body. Ed flexed his muscles, loving the power he held over the Colonel. Roy, hoping to hurry this process along stuck out his tongue directly into Ed's piss slit, tickling the urethra and sending Ed under a wave of pleasure. With a few gasps (and a few magic licks) Ed came explosively in Roy's face. The pressure forced Roy backward into the wall, where he slid to the bathroom floor, his face and chest covered in Ed's seed. Ed sighed and said, \"Good job, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy noticed he hadn't bothered to say \"Colonel\" this time. That surely was a bad sign for Roy. Ed finished cleaning himself off and stepped out of the shower. He looked down at Roy and said, \"I decided to give you a few minutes to finish cleaning yourself. When you're done, just come into the bedroom. I'll know if you try to leave since I've rigged all the exits with security traps. If you try to run you won't get far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ed left Roy sprawled on the tub floor. He slowly got to his feet and went about cleaning himself up. It didn't take as long as he thought it would (though it was sometimes difficult reaching things since everything was so much bigger than him) and he barely managed to turn off the water. He stepped out and found a pair of pajamas and a towel waiting for him. His other clothes had been taken away somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose he's going to start telling me what I'm supposed to wear now.\" Roy muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to jump to grab the doorknob on the bathroom door and he made his way down the hall to the bedroom. The door was partway open and Ed was laying on his bed covered with his blankets, waiting for Roy. He smiled, pulled back the blankets and said, \"Time for bed Roy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked a little apprehensively at the bed. He took a few steps forward and said, \"What do you want me to do after I get in? Rub your feet again? Jack you off? Some other demeaning act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd laughed and said, \"It's not all work Roy. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy crawled up into bed and Ed closed the blankets around them. It was really warm for Roy laying next to the giant alchemist. Ed wrapped an arm around Roy and said, \"See? You've earned this spot tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy lay still, still waiting for a bomb to drop. Ed reached over and switched off the light, throwing the room into darkness. As time passed Roy realized that Ed meant what he said. It seemed he wasn't going to have to do anything this night. Ed just wanted him to sleep with him. Roy sighed and turned his back on Ed, so that his butt was next to Ed's abs and his head was resting just below Ed's bicep. It was really rather comfortable and within a few minutes Roy was asleep.</span></div></div>",

He was about to open the door leading out of the apartment when he noticed the doorknob was too high. Grumbling to himself, he pushed a chair over to the door and climbed on top of it, trying to twist the knob. Locked. And it was one of those old fashioned locks that only opened with a key whether you were inside or outside. In other words, Roy was trapped. He instinctively snapped his fingers before remembering his gloves had been taken somewhere by Ed. Sighing Roy pushed the chair back where it belonged and walked over to a nearby armchair. Jumping onto it and climbing onto the back of it, he tested the window and found this one locked by conventional means and alchemy preventing any kind of escape. Truly Ed had thought of everything to keep Roy captive for as long as he wanted. Knowing he was in for a world of hurt for this escape attempt, Roy slowly approached the bedroom door. He heard Ed's voice talking to someone, no doubt over the phone. \"Yeah, I need help again Winry. What? What do you mean you can't come down right now? When is the soonest you can get here? Next week? Are you kidding me? Fine, fine...Whatever, I'll see you then. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy peeked into the room as Ed slammed the receiver down onto the phone's cradle, smashing it into pieces. Ed turned to glare at Roy and said, \"Have trouble escaping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy just stared back at Ed and said, \"You know, you look really pathetic laying there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd snarled at Roy, \"Shut up! Even when I've got you trapped you still ridicule me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled and said, \"It's going to take more than kidnapping and forced servitude for me to respect you Edward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked calmly over to Ed and said, \"So your mechanic can't make it down here soon enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gritted his teeth in pain and said, \"No. She's on a shopping trip in Rush Valley, looking for parts she can't get anywhere else. She won't be able to come until next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy reached out and touched the metal bases on Ed's stumps. Ed pulled back with a hissed intake of breath. \"That hurts you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy put his hands in his pockets and said, \"Do you have a screwdriver anywhere around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked funnily at Roy and asked, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy rolled his eyes and said, \"Why do you think? Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gestured to the kitchen and said, \"Bottom drawer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy went and out and picked up the screwdriver which had increased in size with everything else. He half carried half dragged the thing back into the bedroom and said, \"Okay, now pull out your arm and leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd narrowed his eyes suspiciously at the Colonel but did as he asked. With two almighty tugs both arm and leg were disconnected. Ed was sweating by now, the pain intense. Roy hefted the screwdriver up and started disconnecting the bases. It took about half an hour to get both bases off but the job got done. Ed just laid still for awhile, catching his breath and enjoying the sweet relief. Roy just stared at him until Ed sat up and muttered, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled and said, \"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd turned to face him and said, \"This doesn't change anything! I'm not done with you yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighed and said, \"Why are you really doing this Fullmetal? Why can't you let it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd pushed himself onto the bed, hopping one one leg and said, \"That's none of you business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy walked over to the bed and coughed. Ed reached down and lifted him up next to him. Roy said, \"I don't know what's bothering you, but you can tell me you know. I may not always act sympathetic but I do care about my subordinates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked down at Roy and seemed to be deep in thought.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Ed could reveal his wicked plans to Roy, looking for at least one more opportunity to humiliate him before this whole thing came out and was done with, there was a series of loud knocks on the door. Ed glanced over at his bedroom door before ignoring the knocking. His mouth was open once again to reveal the plan when a metallic sounding voice shouted, \"Brother! I know you're in there! Let me it right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd groaned and said, \"I didn't think he'd be home so soon. Dammit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd rose to his feet and walked to the front door, Roy walking a few steps behind him. It wasn't easy thanks to his lost leg and arm but he managed it by leaning his weight on the wall. Ed pulled a small (to him anyway) box out from the top shelf of a cupboard. Opening the box Ed pulled out a heavy looking silver key which he used to unlock the front door. Roy made a mental note of where it was in case Ed became unbearable again. Ed glanced behind him but Roy was one step ahead and hid behind the huge couch. Luckily for him Ed didn't see him and assumed he was back in the bedroom. As soon as his back was turned again Roy did just that and went back into the bedroom. Ed opened the door and stepped aside as his little brother walked in. Roy glanced out from the bedroom and saw that, despite Al's daunting height, he only reached Ed's stomach. Al sighed as he saw Ed even taller than before. He glanced at the bedroom and saw Roy looking out. He turned back to Ed and said, \"Big brother what have you been doing in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd made an impatient sound in his throat and said, \"I haven't been doing anything to him that he didn't deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ed sat down on the couch. Al impatiently followed and said, \"Brother you know better than that! You can't just go around doing whatever you want now that you're like this! If he wanted to the Colonel could have you arrested for this! I mean, you kidnapped him and I don't want to know what else you've been up to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked at Al and said, \"Like I'm afraid of the military. Let's see them try and take me in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl clambered up onto the couch and said, \"You're not invincible brother! You're just taller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd flexed one of his massive biceps and Al said, \"And stronger I guess. But still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd groaned and said, \"Come on Al! It's not like I'm killing him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl looked over the armrest at Roy standing in the bedroom door frame. He looked back at Ed and said, \"He doesn't look like he's been having a good time brother! This is worse than anything he's ever done to you and you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd stood up, steadying himself on the couch and said, \"Fine. I'll stop. But I'm not letting him go until I've had a few words with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ed maneuvered into the bathroom. Al pushed himself off the couch and walked over to Roy. Roy smiled tiredly at him and Al asked, \"Has it been really bad Colonel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it wasn't as bad as Ishbal but it also hasn't been a walk in the park.\" Roy said truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl sighed again and said, \"I'm so sorry Colonel. I knew that Ed was going to let this get to his head but I didn't think he'd ever try something like this. But you don't have to worry. He's not going to try anything with me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nodded and said, \"Seems like this whole thing is going to be over soon anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and rubbed his forehead with one hand. Ever since last night he hadn't been feeling well. His insides felt like they were smoldering, like something was happening inside him. He didn't know what it could possibly be but it was worrisome. Oh well. He would just have to make sure to get it checked out when he got back to HQ.</span></div></div>",

The formally tiny Alchemist's enormous feet reeked like an armpit after a workout without deodorant. It didn't help that as Elric began to truly enjoy the rub he spread his toes apart in satisfaction, letting out another wave of sweaty footstink down into the Colonel's nostrils from the human foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll... *cough*... get you for this - *gag* - Elric...\" Mustang managed to wheeze out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you will, eh Colonel?\" taunted Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge teen adjusted his feet, sandwiching the older man between the pillars of sweat and flesh.

Ed just laughed and laughed, loving the feeling of the Colonel trapped between his huge feet. He was so busy enjoying himself that it took him a moment to realize something. He was growing again! He looked over his body in disbelief as his muscles started expanding, his legs and torso getting longer, his shoulders broadening. Roy quickly came to realize what was happening as well as the toes of the foot that had trapped him, which had previously been a few inches below his line of sight were quickly growing up around him. Ed was about to stand up and enjoy his increasing vantage point when a sudden pain shot down his fake limbs. In a few seconds more pain shot through them. Ed could feel something building up inside his body, a pressure at the stumps of his arm and leg. Before he could do anything to alleviate the pain the metal limbs popped off his arm and leg, the bases popping off with them, and two human limbs burst from the stumps. Ed looked at his right arm and left leg in disbelief. Somehow, he had gotten his limbs back! The substance that had originally done this had come from beyond the Gate so it was entirely possible that it had effects similar to the Philosopher's Stone. Ed wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth however and flexed his arms appreciatively as he continued to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy could only look up in horror as his giant assailant grew even more massive in front of his eyes. A loud ripping sound suddenly rent the air and Roy looked down from Ed's face to see that the younger man's pants and boxers had split completely revealing Ed's junk to the world. Roy quickly averted his gaze and glared up at the giant alchemist. When Ed had finished growing he slowly got to his feet. The shifting of his weight from foot to foot sent severe tremors through the ground throwing Roy onto his butt. Ed laughed, his voice echoing into the distance. Roy got to his feet and found, to his utter dismay, that instead of being between Ed's shin and knee he was now just slightly taller than Ed's ankles. He looked up at Ed's hugely muscled body and nearly fainted when he saw Ed's god like hand reach for him. Ed scooped him up without any trouble whatsoever and brought him to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well Mustang.\" He said with evil glee. \"Looks like you have a lot more area to cover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustang tried his best to look defiant but all he got for his trouble was a deep chuckle from Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glare at me all you want, runt, you're still doing whatever I tell you to.\" </span></div></div>",

A massive, throbbing python of sheer man meat.

This is MY world now and you're just living in it. If you don't do as I say I can just as easily take you out of this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt Ed's palm twitch underneath him and he flinched thinking Ed was going to try something. Ed just smirked at him and said, \"I know you understand what I'm saying little man. Now tell the truth. You want this don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said this last sentence with as much sexuality as he could muster in his young voice, which was  a surprising amount. Roy felt his breathing increasing. He couldn't hold out like this for much longer. He had never in his life been tested in this manner before. He had never been aware he could be tested in this way before. But he was a trained military man and he wasn't about to be a sexual toy to his subordinate! Keeping as much composure as he possibly could he glared into Ed's golden eyes and said, \"I don't want anything you have to offer and I never will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd rolled his eyes. Always so dramatic. Well he knew exactly what was needed to break Mustang into a quivering blob of sexual desire. He lowered his palm down to waist level and Roy was assaulted with Ed's strong manly scent along with a wave of heat from the massive junk. Roy moved back until he ran into Ed's fingers. He wasn't escaping from this. Ed slowly brought his throbbing cock closer to Mustang. It inched closer and closer until Roy felt himself forced against the soft purple dick head. Ed continued to move closer, crushing Mustang against a cock head bigger than the older alchemist. Mustang was assaulted by Ed's scent as Ed slowly ground his dick into the Colonel, his hips gyrating ever so carefully. He wanted to make sure Mustang got a face full of man meat without actually hurting him. Soon enough pre-cum started dripping from the slit, which was just to the left of Mustang's body getting Roy quickly covered in the clear liquid. Ed moaned in pleasure and said, \"Come on runt! Tell me how much you want it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy just shook his head, his voice failing him in this crucial moment. He was so close to cumming in his pants it wasn't even funny.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roy was pulled away from the mighty rod of younger alchemist as Ed suddenly began to vibrate, lifting his prey back up to ab-level as he stood up straight. There was literally a loud rumbling as Elric... started to grow again! And this was nothing like the previous growth spurts - it was FAR bigger, FAR faster, and FAR more intense. If Roy thought Ed was big now, he was in for quite the gargantuan surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd grew. And grew. And GREW. AND GREW AND GREW AND GREW. His body continued to pulsate and vibrate and undulate as literally tons of mass were added to him in both size and bulk. Not only was Ed getting bigger, he was becoming more ripped by the second. He had the body of a pro bodybuilder... the body of a young Arnold Schwarzenegger... the body of somebody MEGA abusing steroids... and soon his bod put the Incredible Hulk to shame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustang quickly found that within about three minutes the hand he was on had roughly quadrupled in size, leaving him a mere speck in a massive field of sweaty male skin. The abs before him stretched dozens upon dozens of feet vertically and horizontally before hi eyes. He was sure the rest of Ed was going through similar changes, but Ed was getting so massive that he couldn't see much of him from his height. Roy was probably a mere millimeter tall from Ed's perspective by the time the growth subsided. An insignificant nothing just barely visible to the huge alchemist's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd wasn't just giant anymore. He was a titan. A colossus. The guy's foot could fill a football stadium. In fact, his two feet took up the entirety of the clearing they were in. He could see the whole of East City from up there... though there was something much smaller he wanted to focus on right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked up in a combination of horror and arousal at the mountainous muscle-bound man before him. He fell back onto his tush as he strained to look all the way up to where Ed's head peaked hundreds of feet upward. But soon he felt himself rocketing upwards - the hand was rising. Soon he was looking right into Elric's gargantuan golden eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhmhm... Oh, Mustang...\" Even though Ed was speaking softly, his voice was slightly booming to Roy. \"What should I do to you now, eh?\" The giga-alchemist grinned sadistically. Oddly enough, his voice also sounded quite different after this growth spurt. Ed's voice was deeper, more masculine, more dominating... and, though Roy hated to admit it, sexier too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many options... so many ways to humiliate and torment you... and I'm so HORNY now too. Take a look~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy reluctantly walked to the edge of the hand (which took a moment) and looked down, to appease the deadly monster holding him. Mustang felt his blood run a bit cold - There was no way?!... was there? Ed's length must have been 600 FEET LONG and as thick as a large silo. Massive veins snaked across it as it throbbed, hard and lusting for release. Said release was probably needed to - Ed's ball's were disproportionately BIG even given the shaft's size, and looked to be THROBBING from the sheer amount of seed that was backed up in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, what should I do...\" Ed asked rhetorically. \"Should I just use you to satisfy my sexual desire now? Or maybe just do tons of mean things to you while the pressure in my cock builds and builds and builds until it's ready to explode and THEN use you for that?\"</span></div></div>",

So let's take this one step at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Roy could even begin to fathom what Ed had in mind he felt his stomach drop as the gigantic hand descended down past the massive chest, down beyond the road of abs, and...Roy could only stare with a blank mind at the sheer size of Ed's cock. It seemed to jut out almost beyond Roy's sight. The purple mushroom head bobbed lightly, just begging to spew forth a volcano of cum, to bury a mile of ground under a river of jizz. Roy was so preoccupied with the veiny engorged shaft, the deep purple head, and the forest of golden pubes, that he missed Ed's powerful thighs and bulging calves to be dumped off the hand in front of Ed's colossal big toe. Roy looked up and could just barely see the glint of Ed's toenail. Looking beyond that was absurd. Ed's body was just a mountain of muscle towering above him, casting Mustang and everything in the vicinity in his shadow. The mountainous alchemist shifted downward until he was sitting down, an act that caused the ground to crack and rumble, sending Mustang to his butt. As Roy got back to his feet he heard Ed's voice rumble down at him from on high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright bug, listen up. My dick is already begging for release but I'm going to build up to a grand finale. You're going to start by servicing my feet....well, by providing as much service as an itty bitty little speck like you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy didn't even bother answering. There was no chance that Ed would hear him from way, way, way, way, up there. He turned his eyes to the foot in front of him. Roy had had trouble seeing the glint of Ed's toenail. The towering sole that was before him was greater than a building. In comparison to the foot Roy felt like an ant. He truly was a bug to Ed. He couldn't seem to make himself move to touch Ed's foot. The whole situation, mixed with Ed's gargantuan presence, was too staggering for Mustang to comprehend all at once. Unfortunately for him Ed wasn't giving him time to comprehend his position. He raised his voice slightly, increasing the rumbling to a roll of thunder, and yet he was still talking quietly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Mustang! Get with the program and start licking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy jumped at the booming command and threw himself forward at the feet, his tongue darting out of his mouth so fast it was a red blur. Roy ran his tongue up and down, left and right, reaching as much in his immediate vicinity that he could. His hands wandered along the surprisingly smooth flesh, reaching the spots his tongue couldn't. Roy wondered if anything he was doing was even registering to the monstrous man in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly enough when Ed grew to this colossal size his senses had also increased in sensitivity and strength. He could see farther, hear more clearly, feel any and all of the touches of even the smallest human bugs and even interact with them without crushing them, and could even taste to the extent that any food item placed in his mouth, no matter how many things were in it, he could tell what they all were and even where they had come from. In other words, as Ed grew bigger he became more and more god like. When he was finished enjoying Roy (and that could take awhile. Ed believed that he'd never truly be bored with using Mustang like this.) he would turn his attention to the rest of the world. Things were going to change. The thought was enough to drive Ed that much closer to the edge, his balls filling with even more cum. But he didn't want to release just yet. There was still much to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy, meanwhile, had thrown off his military coat and undershirt leaving him in a pair of blue pants and boots, and was starting to rub his entire torso over the foot. Since Ed's foot stretched dozens upon dozens of feet in either direction Roy had to keep moving in order to cover as much of the foot as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on Ed started growing bored of feeling Roy run himself ragged over his feet. He wanted to move onto something different. He reached down and grabbed the tiny man between his thumb and forefinger and brought him up his body. What does Ed want now?</span></div></div>",

But first... a little ride. I'd hold on if I were you.\" Ed's now-manlier warned the smaller man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Edward bounced his titanic pecs. At this size, each bounce literally made a massive BOOM or THUD  from the sheer force. Down on the nipple, it was like trying to stay atop a bucking bronco for little Roy. The motion of the bucking was causing the nip to grind against his wang... it was both nauseating and arousing at the same time. This went on a good five or six minutes - Ed was finding that flexing his muscles at this height felt REALLY good, so he was enjoying the bounce quite thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bounce subsided, a tuckered out Roy flopped forward.<br>\r\n\"Did I say you can rest, runt?\" Ed boomed. \"I told you to TEND. TO. MY. NIPPLE.\"<br>\r\nRoy, quite exhausted from holding onto the nipple for dear life just a moment beforehand, did all he could... which at this point was pretty much just grasping at various chunks of soft nipple meat with his hands and feet and writhing a bit. As small as this action might have seemed, Ed's newly developed senses were enjoying it beyond measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thick rod looming for far out in front of Roy's view was THROBBING for attention - the nipple play was really turning Ed on, if it was possible to be any more turned on then he was now. The pressure was building and building and building. Ed's balls seemed to actually be growing a little they were making such much man-pudding down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby does that feel good...\" Ed cooed out.<br>\r\nRoy felt strangely... pleased? Was he really enjoying giving Ed such sexual satisfaction? No... of course not... right? He felt apprehensive to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd bit his lower lip... the pressure down below was so intense now. So he decided to...</span></div></div>",

He had wanted to prolong Roy's torment for as long as possible but with the tiny Colonel exhausted on his nipple there wasn't much left for him to do. With a little rest Mustang would be at the top of his game again and he could continue using Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd started getting to his feet prompting Roy to scramble over the tip of the nipple so that he was sitting on the top of it. When Ed was standing up at his full height, Roy peering down over the edge of the nipple to see what was going to happen, watched as Ed's throbbing member pulsed once, twice, three times...and erupted. It was more magnificent and impressive than any volcano on Earth. The cum that spewed forth shot high into the sky before thundering to the ground. The devastation was incredible. Trees snapped in half and were buried under the deluge. The ground was broken up as the drops of cum shattered the top soil and the much harder rock beneath it. Ed moaned loudly, his voice bellowing out of his chest, the mere sound of it sending vibrations through Roy's body, arousing him even further. It was a testament to Ed's power that even his voice, in the throes of pleasure, was enough to make Mustang hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's cock continued to pump, his balls contracting, forcing more and more cum up through the shaft and out through the widened slit of the purple head. More and more cum splattered to the ground breaking it apart to the point that a crater was forming, quickly filling with Ed's seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like at least five minutes of pure cumming, the stream slowed and stopped. Ed, panting heavily, fell to his butt, his balls at the edge of the cum lake he had created. It was a truly impressive thing. Ed's seed had blasted a hole so deep into the Earth that the middle of the forest, where the clearing had been, had been completely replaced by the lake of cum. Ed sighed in contentment and looked down at his nipple. He smirked when he saw Roy visibly trembling at the sight in front of him. He was quickly coming under his power. Ed's penis, still quite impressive even soft, was laying against his thigh, his massive balls looking smaller, but still huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was quiet at the moment. It was the calm after the storm, when a massive event has come to pass. But all would not stay quiet for long. What happens?</span></div></div>",

Ed began to rumble again, just as he did when he grew before. Roy gulped... if Ed grew any bigger, he would be completely unstoppable. Just imagining this immature and irrational young man having such power was a nightmare of a thought. But, alas, it was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nipple beneath Mustang began to grow... and grow... and grow... AND GROW. What was once a perch that was a little hard for him to sit on had become a gargantuan platform that twenty of him could have lay on comfortably. He looked up to see a  titanic wall of pec meat stretching up beyond his sight. Roy began to ponder just how high he was at this point... a mile? Two miles?... three? When was this going to stop?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd felt euphoric. He was towering miles in the air and still growing, dominating all he surveyed - his foot could probably level all of  all of East city in a few steps. His muscles were bulking up with ton upon ton of muscle at the fastest rate yet. He was getting JACKED; even to scale he put Armstrong to shame! In fact, his shoulder muscles were starting to loom over his head. He flexed his arm triumphantly, watching it peak... and then additionally peak upon the peak... and then peak on the peak on the peak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growth finally subsided, Ed was FIVE MILES TALL.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The feelings that were racing through Edward were unexplainable. The sheer power, the size, the force he could exert on any and all things with no fear of reprimand was a powerful series of thoughts. To think he could crush East City out of existence with no effort whatsoever, that he could, in theory crush entire towns without even realizing it! It made his dick throb all the harder, all the bigger. Looking down at his nipple he noticed Mustang leaning against his chest at the base of his titanic nipple. He had a dazed look on his face as he stared into space. It seemed like he had finally started coming to terms with what he was dealing with here. Ed was now an unstoppable force of nature and it was time this country learned he meant business!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first things first. He needed release and he needed it BAD. Even though he carefully lowered himself to the ground his sheer size and weight caused the ground to crack apart underneath his powerful ass, earthquakes shaking the country for miles around. Ed had made to sure to position himself so that he was sitting far enough behind East City that, sitting with legs fully outstretched, his feet were on either side of the city. The populace of the city was in a mass panic seeing the gargantuan alchemist that had appeared growing in the sky. His attention, which had been diverted for quite awhile, was now trained fully on minuscule city between his feet. Ed smirked down at the city and said, in his deep, booming voice, \"I was thinking about converting all of you people in East City into my personal worshiping slaves but I decided you're not worthy to touch THIS BODY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd flexed his muscles as his voice rolled across the tiny citizens causing each and every one of them to drop to the ground, their minds totally converted to nothing but shaking fear. Ed's muscles exploded all over his body showing all the immense power he possessed. Ed scanned the city and was pleased that everyone had decided to accept their fates, whatever they may be, at Ed's hands. Roy, who had been shaken out of his blank stupor by the rumbling strength in Ed's voice, got unsteadily to his feet and ran down the length of the nipple. This took longer than he thought it would but he eventually made it to the edge of the nipple. He gazed down, down, down at East City barely able to make out the buildings and totally unable to see any individual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all in awe of me micro man.\" Ed whispered down at Roy. Roy jumped and turned around to see an enormous golden orb staring down at him. The immensity of Ed's eye was enough to nearly send Roy back into his blank stupor. Staying strong he turned back to East City and waited to see what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of them are as close to me as you've become though. It would be awesome to have a devoted city of worshipers on different parts of my body but there are too many people down there that made fun of me or looked down at me. So they don't get the satisfaction of living on my body. Oh, yeah, by the way, my body is your new home. You're never leaving it as long as I'm alive. Get used to my manly smell, my mind blowing size, and my insatiable sexual appetite because it all just became the entire point of your existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd had totally crossed over. He was no longer thinking of himself in terms of humanity anymore. It was hard to associate yourself with creatures that, in comparison with you, were no more than invisible specks milling about your feet. Roy couldn't help but feel oddly privileged to be kept alive by Ed knowing that those of East City were about to meet an untimely end in some manner. He could only hope that his subordinates had enough sense to get out of East City while they could. Al had been down there too. Mustang briefly wondered if this thought had even crossed Ed's mind. Roy sighed. Al was a smart kid either way. He had probably already left to alert someone, somewhere, about what was going on. But that was all problems that were beyond Mustang's control. He could now only watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd breathed deeply, his chest inflating before exhaling and grinning at the city beneath him. Slowly he grabbed his enormous veined shaft and started slowly pumping it. The time of talk had passed. Now there was only action. He was so incredibly turned on already by his increase in size that it wasn't going to take a whole lot to cause a cum typhoon especially since he wasn't trying to hold back in the slightest. He'd have plenty of time to play more games with Roy. His enormous body was a playground that could literally keep Roy occupied for the rest of his life. These thoughts helped push Ed closer and closer to climax. His balls, resting on the ground, began churning the ground actually vibrating from their power. The purple cock head jutted toward the sky, the slit widening in preparation for the main event. Panting, realizing he was a stroke or two away from white gold, Ed pointed his might rod down until the slit was directly over the city. Every citizen looked up into their own demise which had taken the shape of a massive hot void. Ed moaned loudly heralding the coming end and the first shot traveled down the shaft, out the hole, and onto East City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devastation was incalculable. The first shot alone demolished half of the city, the second taking care of the rest. People couldn't even shriek in terror as the deluge continued. Shot after shot after shot reduced East City into nothing more than a cum filled crater with the ruins of buildings poking up here and there. Ed sighed in contentment, his eyes scanning the remains of the city. He was amused to note that a few citizens had survived, clinging desperately to ruined buildings, coughing up cum. Ed laughed at the sight and looked down at Roy. Roy was standing perfectly still, knowing that this was the first of many acts to come.</span></div></div>",

All of Amestris lay before him to be played with, to rule over, to smash into oblivion if it so inclined him to. Of course, Ed wouldn't forget about his personal whipped dog that was currently residing on his nipple. The mere thought of the things Ed could do with Mustang made his colossal dick start hardening again. Ed chuckled at his own inability to be satisfied, a chuckle that nonetheless rolled deeply from deep inside his chest out over the landscape, and slowly got to his feet. Even this simple act caused devastation all around him the ground continuing to crack and warp. Using his god like sight Ed scanned the horizon for his next target. There was no need to hurry. He would have plenty of time to deal with everyone and everything in the country. There wasn't much even the vast military power of Amestris could do against a five mile tall teen. Especially one that could perform alchemy. Finally, Edward decided to head to South City. After he had his fun there he could move onto to West City before going after North City and ending in Central City. Along the way he might even pick up a few more devoted worshipers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his titanic foot Ed took a step forward. Wind whipped around the appendage as it sailed through the air moving thousands of feet in a single step. When it touched ground an earthquake shook the countryside for miles around. No matter how lightly Ed stepped now untold destruction was going to occur. The sheer size of his body combined with his massive muscular weight made delicate movements effectively impossible. To Roy, who was still perched at the edge of Ed's nipple and gazing out into the distance, each step sent shocks through Ed's body that the mountainous alchemist couldn't even feel but shook Roy with varying degrees of severity. Any wrong movement from Roy could send him tumbling to his death down below on another part of Ed's body. Roy's only hope of survival was that Ed wasn't bored with him at this time and wanted him around to torture and play with. With his improved senses Ed would catch him before he fell to the ground. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above Roy Ed could feel the tiny man fidgeting around on his nipple, hardening it. They weren't even halfway to South City and already Ed was itching for another release. His cock was getting progressively harder and thicker, his balls starting to fill with more cum. There was so much he wanted to do with Roy and, like he said before, what's the rush? Stopping he peered down at his nipple and saw Roy staring back up at him, wondering why they had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's voice boomed out, \"Before we arrive at South City, how about we have some more fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's body, at the sound of Ed's voice, underwent conflicting emotions. He felt fear, awe, a small shred of his stubborn pride, and, though he wouldn't admit it out loud since it would only fuel Ed's already supremely huge ego, arousal and desire. His own dick was getting painfully hard despite his best efforts to resist. Roy waited as his master pondered what to do with him next.</span></div></div>",

Ed become aware of this when he felt massive waves of pleasure radiate from his cock through the rest of his massive body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARRRGGHHH!\" he screamed in pleasure as he felt the poor man squirming inside his massive cock,\"Oh god that's feels soooo great!\"<br>\r\nRoy was not enjoying the scene as much as Ed. There was no light inside the massive meat tube and barely enough room for him to move around in. not to mention his still raging hard-on and the moans he could hear outside from the massive young Alchemist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was in pure heaven. The sensations coming from Roy squirming inside his massive cock, and the though of having swallowed a fully grown man inside his manhood was almost too much to bear. <br>\r\nEd slapped the side of his cock causing the Colonel to jumble around inside his member, sending even more waves of pleasure coursing throughout his body. <br>\r\n\"How does it feel to be inside a real man Colonel?!\" he manged to shout through his gasps of pure pleasure. Although Roy did not want to admit it, he was actually enjoying getting Ed off, to some degree.<br>\r\n\"I show you how it feels runt\" he said to himself. At that moment the Colonel began to shake and gyrate his body wildly inside Ed's cock, \"See how that feels shrimp!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Ed's body was filled to the breaking point with pleasure. He knew the Colonel was trying to get out by making him cum, but he didn't care since he was feeling sooo good right now. The massive stimulation inside caused his massive cock to harden further, limiting Roy's movements. Ed's balls churned with gallos of cum that he had been holding back during the whole event. He bit his lip as he felt the pressure build higher and higher in his balls, and the pleasure mount in his cock. The feeling was so intense that he could no longer stand and was forced to sit down on his massive butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd grabbed his balls with both strong hands and began squeezing them to help mount the pleasure even further. <br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh mann, it feels sooo goood\"  he moaned as he fondled his two massive orbs. After that he turned his attention to his massive, hard member. \"Man if this keeps going I'm gonna explode\", he moaned. Every massive muscle in his body was tight and bulging in an effort to keep the pleasure building. Ed could no longer resist the call of his massive member, and in the blink of an eye was pumping his huge monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy could hear grunts and moaning on the outside and was filled with hope and disgust at the same time. He would finally get out of this dank place, but whatever was left of his dignity would leave with him. \"I guess beggars can't be choosers\", he sighed as he prepared for the moment of truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd could feel the mounting pressure build up at the base of his cock, he was reaching the point of no return. \"Nghhhh, I can't hold it I'm gonna blow!\" he monaed through clenched teeth. The pressure was building to insane levels, Ed's balls were churning so much they sent small shockwaves around him. <br>\r\n\"Nghh ahhh ARRRGGHHHH!!!!\" With a mighty roar resulting from nearly an eternity of immense pleasure Ed's cock exploded violently all over the place, sending gallons of cum flying across everything in front of him. Roy was sent flying in one of those spurts, landing in one of the many pools of cum in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of furiously blowing his load, Ed finally stopped. He fell flat on his back, still reeling from the most massive orgasm he had ever experienced.<br>\r\n\"Oh man....that was....incredible\" he panted between gasps of euphoria. Roy was also recovering from the experience, having been shot out and landing roughly on the hard ground. As the Colonel caught his breath he noticed his hard-on had faded, his faced flushed red as he realized he must have came during Ed's explosion. It's a good thing Ed was nearly passed out from the pleasure to notice his embarassment, or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sir, it looks like you enjoyed that almost as much as I did\" he said with an smirk on his face. If his faced was red before it was now completely scarlet, it was bad enough that it happened, now that Ed noticed he would never live it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I'm beat from that full release you gave me. But in a few minutes I will able to play with you again,sir\" he ended with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was too exhausted from the ordeal to even try escaping, he could only imagine what Ed had planned next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, strangely, the smell was starting to become more bearable... even pleasant, changing from a masculine reek to a mild manly delight, like a body spray or a nice cologne. Unbeknown to Elric, all this contact with his Alchemically grown body was slowly altering Mustang too - the sudden adaptation to Elric's giant foot musk was because Mustang himself was gaining the same kind of body transformation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt his body suddenly pulse with an intensely tense feeling. His muscles pulsed and undulated, a strange sense of power coursing through his veins. He felt as if his pectorals were pumping out, his biceps bulging, glutes growing, pants... tightening.

Roy was now exceedingly ripped, his muscles comparable to Armstrong and then some! Not only that, but his own feet had grown beyond the rest of him to be roughly 1.5 times the size they would have been had they simply grown to scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down at Ed with a smug look, bouncing his new gargantuan pectorals to emphasize his new dominant role in this clash of the giants.</span></div></div>",

It seems the growth's effects were not just physical, but mental too, literally morphing his personality into a more sexually dominating direction. \"You WISH you were as big a man as me, runt.\" he went on, flexing both arms now; not in intimidation, but to humiliate Fullmetal over his current emasculation. He grunted as he flexed the arms with all his might; not only did he get peaks on peaks but, somehow, he got peaks on the peaks on his peaks! It was like two small towers of pure muscle were jutting up from Mustang's arms. \"Now these are what freakin' arms should look like. Not like those toothpicks you have, you scrawny nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gulped hard.

He moaned pathetically into Roy's chest before shouting out, \"Colonel, please, please, please let me fuck your pecs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of desperation in Ed's voice surprised Mustang. You hadn't expected this of the short tempered and eternally stubborn alchemist. He quickly recovered and dropped Ed to the ground. Ed fell to his knees and started fumbling with his pants. Roy very carefully pushed him with his foot. The size of the foot combined with the colossal amounts of strength in Roy's body still sent the smaller man flying backward a few feet.

But if I let you you'll have to be my slave for as long as I want you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, his mind clouded by the intense aroma of the Colonel's body and his own raging erection, quickly said, \"Yeah, sure, of course, whatever you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy lowered himself onto his back with an earth shaking rumble and Ed immediately went over to him. He climbed onto the hot slick body of the older man and slid over his abs to his pecs. He rubbed them both with his hands, one warm and soft, the other cold and stimulating. Ed didn't waste any time. Ripping off his pants and boxers he guided his throbbing erection over Mustang's muscle and slid it between the furnace that was Roy's pecs. The intense heat sent a wave of pleasure coursing through Ed, his hips slowly moving back and forth between the mounds of meat. He was purposefully going slow, hoping to prolong this pleasure as long as he could. He was already so close from just being in close proximity with Mustang it wouldn't take much more to send him over the edge. But Roy wasn't about to let Ed go at his pace. With as little effort as he could expend Roy flexed his pecs, the muscle massaging Ed's dick powerfully yet gently. Ed moaned louder and laid fully down on Mustang's chest, his hands seeking something to grab onto. Another flex and Ed screamed in pleasure, his meat twitching, his balls pulsing, begging for release. Roy knew he was close. With one last flex Ed reared his head back and shot load after load in between the massive muscles. After emptying his balls Ed slumped forward onto Roy's chest, panting with exhaustion and pleasure. The amount of cum, which would have been quite sizable to a normal person, was nothing to Mustang. He grabbed Ed's ripped pants and slid them down his pecs, easily cleaning himself with little effort. He then stood up and Ed slid down his massive body and down onto the ground. He stared hazily up at Mustang who was smirking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better now Ed?\" He asked, usual smirk in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd nodded weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

Ed felt the hot drops of cum spattering his head as the cum not only shot into the sky but also dribbled down the sides of the cock. The ground rumbled and shook like an earthquake, the feelings being transmitted all the way back to East City. To those in the city it wast the strangest thing. The ground suddenly began vibrating, knocking dishes out of cupboards and upsetting furniture but not much worse beyond that. When it was over the citizens merely shrugged and went about their days. Why should they worry about something that didn't affect them in the slightest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the clearing where Ed and Roy were enjoying themselves, Roy was currently slumped on the ground, his massive chest rising and falling as he breathed heavily, his muscled body covered in cum. His dick was now limp laying on the ground like a dormant snake. Ed was clinging to Roy's chest, covered in cum and overcome by the scent of it which was the strongest scent Ed had every smelled from Mustang. He was delirious with the scent, his cheeks flushed, his eyes half lidded, and the only coherent thought in his mind was to be near to Roy. When he came down from his sexual high his mind would probably revert back to it's normal thought patterns but for now he was an obedient slave to Mustang. The entire area was covered in Roy's seed, a pond of seed twenty feet from where the pair were laying. If anyone would come into the clearing they would be met with a very strange sight indeed. But Roy and Ed didn't care in the slightest. Roy sat up and smirked down at Ed. Ed looked up at him wonderingly. Roy stood up to his full massive height and said, \"Well my little slave I think it's time we moved on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd nodded and Roy grabbed him lifting him to his shoulders. \"But we can't just stroll into public looking the way we do now. So listen up: Your second act as my personal slave is to find material to transmute clothes for us. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd nodded and wandered off looking for the materials to make clothes. When Ed was out of sight Roy flexed his biceps and grinned at their massively huge size. He was the biggest thing Amestris had ever seen of this he was sure.

Ed rubbed harder into the soles of Roy's feet trying to express his distaste with the giant mountain of muscle but his fingers weren't strong enough to do any damage. Ed had always been short in comparison to Roy but now he was even smaller! Sure he was bigger than...everyone else but what good did it do if Mustang was still lording over him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Ed thought about it the more he came to realize another fact. The Colonel had always been an ass to him but he had never done anything beyond verbal abuse. Ed, on the other hand, had resorted to kidnapping and forced servitude for at least the next few days if not longer. It was almost enough for Ed to believe in karma. As he continued rubbing and Roy moaned in contentment Ed started noticing a strange smell coming from Mustang's feet. Or rather the absence of a strange smell. He had expected Mustang's feet to reek of sweat and manly odor but instead they smelled...good! The smell was hard to place but it was pleasant. Ed glanced up at Mustang to make sure his eyes were closed before leaning in and taking a big whiff of the foot. It smelled better than good...it smelled great! Ed took another deep smell and sighed out loud. He quickly made sure Mustang hadn't noticed (he hadn't) before going back to rubbing normally. Heck one he got past the idea that he was massaging his superior's giant feet this was actually a pleasurable experience. He kind of hoped Mustang would let him keep doing this for awhile. He kneaded the sole with his fist before rubbing in between each large individual toe, his hands gliding carefully down the soft skin on the sides of the foot. If he was going to do this, he was going to do it right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Ed know that just by being exposed to his own feet Mustang had managed to grow much larger than him. No such service was going to be awarded to Ed. Since there body chemistry was on the same wavelength now neither would get larger from smelling the others feet. However, to a normal guy the feet would still just like that: feet. If they were to spend enough time with the feet however they too would eventually grow much much larger. It would only work on males though since the chemicals that caused the changes in the first place only affected those with the Y chromosome. But that was neither here nor there since Mustang was planning on keeping Ed to himself for awhile before he moved on to anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down at Ed at his feet and said, \"It's about time you learned respect for you betters Fullmetal. I'm proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd muttered under his breath but knew better than to argue. Mustang could flatten him under his foot or pound him into a mass of bloody tissue with a single punch. He just waited to see what the Colonel had in store for him next. </span></div></div>",

It was as if the odor had been transformed into taste and it filled Edward's mouth like candy. He couldn't get enough! For Mustang, it was extremely gratifying to be so powerful that he could order another man to bend over and lick his feet. The power was intoxicating. It was overwhelming. He could almost feel it increasing in every inch of his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd continue licking, moving up from the soles to the toes. Grabbing the big toe he shoved his mouth over it and started sucking, wanting every last bit of that flavor he could get.

Looking up at Mustang his jaw dropped as he saw the Colonel's head leaning back, his mouth wide open, a lustful moan escaping his lips as his body started expanding feverishly. His muscles were all swelling considerably, his pecs jutting out and over, his shoulders broadening, his abs deepening. With a terrific cracking sound the tree he had been leaning against was uprooted and knocked over as Mustang continued expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had finished he stood at a colossal height, though he was still sitting down. Judging by the size of the feet in front of him Edward estimated that he was now less than shin high to the Colonel. He was truly becoming more and more insignificant in comparison to Roy. Suddenly, he caught a whiff of the feet in front of him and found that the smell had grown even more luscious! It seemed that the bigger Mustang got the more his feet smelled. The scent was positively overwhelming to Ed who started breathing heavily, his own lust rising. He wouldn't be able to hold himself back much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustang, meanwhile, was reveling in his new size. His body felt so much heavier, so much more powerful! He had uprooted a huge tree with nothing more than a casual lean. Imagine the power he could unleash if he really focused! He would have to make sure to test that out later. Right now he was content dominating Edward. He looked down at the now truly puny State Alchemist and was surprised to see Ed staring back at him, his eyes wide and his breathing heavy.</span></div></div>",

He wildly began to lick and slurp at the foot, occasionally just opening his mouth wide and taking in a big mouthful of toe flesh to suckle on: it tasted heavenly. It was too much! SO good! Ed, completely overcome, soon had his wang firmly wedged between two toes and went to town, thrusting with all his might.

An idea popped into his head he couldn't help but wanna try.<br>\r\n\"Edward... how would you like to experience more of my... aroma?\" he teased. Ed could only nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Roy stood up, his outrageous height looming once more and the sun fading from sight. And then Mustang turned around... his ass was mountainous, but DAMN fine too - that perfect ratio of fat and muscle that makes it huge and tight, yet smooshy and bouncy. Elric wasn't quite sure what the Colonel was attempting to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're an ass-man Ed, 'cause you're about to get more then you can handle!\" The Colonel's legs bent at the knees, and before Ed knew what was going on, he had been sat on with an earth shaking BOOM. The ass was heavy, but it didn't hurt to have its many tons on him - in fact, the pressure of it combine with the comfy quality of Roy's ass cheeks was just making him hornier. Being in such close contact with the Colonel's bod, Ed could hear the gurgling... it was loud, intense, and... getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy made noises of strain, attempting to hold back his gassy contents to build up pressure - he wanted to give Ed the full treatment. So much was building up that Ed could feel Roy's ass literally bloat out. And then, with loud, sexy grunting from Mustang, he let it all out with a:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd had been indented into the ground a good 3 or 4 feet by the blast, and had also jizzed again. Something about the farting action - the pent up pressure, the intense release, the masculinity of it all, Mustang's grunts and the SOUND of it coming out, not to mention that sexy 'aaaaaaah' in satisfaction over the relief at the end - it all turned him on so much. The fart, like the rest of Mustang's odors, hadn't stunk at all but had taken on an aphrodisiac sort of aroma that was now lingering in the air.</span></div></div>",

The last time they tried human transmutation, Alphonse lost his body and Edward lost first his leg and afterwards his arm when he sealed his brother's soul into an armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had no way to know how much they could lose that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time is different.\" Ed repeated to himself, trying to convince himself, as he hold a red stone tightly. \"We have a Philosopher's Stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it was true they had the fabulous stone that allows to do incredible alchemic feats including human transmutation without paying a toll... but the stone he got his hands on was one of Dr. Marcoh's... an imperfect gem, still very powerful, but also less endurable and stable than a actual mature Philosopher's Stone. Anything might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In the canon timeline, Ed refused to use such wicked object after he found out it was made of human lives. In this timeline, although I found the idea of using it revolting he chose to use it only once to fix his biggest regret, his brother's state.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother, we don't have to do this yet. We could wait, look for better options...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ed knew they didn't have unlimited time... so he gulped nervously, took a deep breath and put his hand on the floor, igniting the transmutation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imperfect stone shone like a sun as its energy leaked, flowing around them like a whirlwind before getting inside the subject of the transmutation, Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nii-San!!!\" He screamed scared, feeling pain for the first time in years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother didn't stop, he couldn't, that could kill him... instead, he summoned even more energy from the stone, hoping it would be enough to fulfill the Law of Equivalent Exchange and bring Alphonse's body back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle he knew he had already used enough energy to make up for the body. Using more than necessary wouldn't kill them, but it may cause some interesting effects on Al...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, more supernatural energy penetrated into the armor. Al screamed louder. Some of them seemed to be absorbed by Edward, unnoticed. He extracted even more energy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the stone was completely squeezed it broke up, releasing a shock wave that destroyed the room and whole house (fortunately empty except by the pair)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother got himself free from the debris and started to search for his brother frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al! Al!! Al!!!\" He feared he had killed his brother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he noticed some debris was moving. He ran to that point, but before he could put them aside something powerful underneath rose, hurled the rocks yards into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Al...</span></div></div>",

It was against the light, so Ed couldn't see who he was until his eyes got used to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Al... I'm sorry it didn't work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still an armor. The plan had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisibly saddened, Ed hugged his metalic brother instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'll find another way to restore your body...\"<br>\r\n\"I... can't... breath...\" Al muttered softly<br>\r\n\"Uh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis big brother didn't understand that. Al didn't need to breath because he hadn't a body...<br>\r\nBut every became clear when his little brother's gauntlets grabbed the helmet and removed it.<br>\r\nThe sight of Al's human face made Ed freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-Wh-wh-Whaa...!?\" The short alchemist was unable to speak coherently, and kept babbling while pointing his little brother face.<br>\r\n\"What happened, Nii-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl found out the truth a moment later, when he realized he had lungs. He took off one of his gauntlets and saw a human hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a body... I HAVE A BODYYY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his little big brother and euphorically hold him in the air, like a doll. Ed kicked his feet in the air, trying to get free and get a chance of make sense of all what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl didn't drop his brother until a minute had passed. On the ground again, Ed watched his brother thoroughly. Al's head towered several feet over his, still wearing the 7 feet tall armor, and by the way he moved with it, it seemed like it fit him like a glove...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd asked him to remove the shirt front part of the armor, his brother agreed. Behind it there was a big, toned upper-body, with an incredible pair of pectorals and 3 rows of rocky abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confirmed Ed's suspicions... somehow Al's body had grown big enough to fill the huge armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was supposed to grow so tall after 5 years? Or it's a side effect of the human transmutation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was the right one, the excess of alchemic energy had done more than just recreate his body... but at that moment the brothers couldn't be sure about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Al had always been pretty tall to his own age, taller than his one-year-older brother since kindergarten, so maybe if he hadn't lost his body he would have grown more and more into a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So unfair... Why I have to wear elevators while my brother becomes as big as Amstrong without moving a finger?\" One of the brothers thought (you know who). The other, guessing his thoughts, smiled kindly and said something to cheer him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the only one who had gained something from the transmutation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed with his finger to his right arm and his left leg, which now were flesh and bone instead of metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the unstable transmutation Ed had absorbed some energy by his own, at least enough to restore his lost limbs. It was unknown to them if that could cause more changes in the future...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems we had got back everything we lost during that night...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Ed smiled weakly, feeling years of guilty disappearing slowly. \"We got a fresh start.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the inn we stayed yesterday. I want to check how comfortable its beds really are!\" Al said jubilous, happy of recovering his lost human senses. \"Also I'm so hungry, like I wouldn't have eaten in years!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens laughed and walked together to the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what you look like without the helmed, eh?\" The innkeeper, a nice 40-year-old lady, welcomed them back to her humble inn. \"You have a handome face, you shouldn't hide it under that helmet all the time... Although you also seem much younger than I expected\"<br>\r\n\"Hehe... thanks.\" Al smiled shyly. After spending 5 years without a body, he wasn't used to appearance compliments.<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately at this moment I only have one room free... but has a spacious double bed, probably big enough to your big friend and you.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to their room Al had to go throw a few 6'4\" doorframes, but wasn't a big deal for him. He had got used to small doors years ago when he became the armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside their room, he hurry to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, I was boiling inside this armor. Tomorrow I need to buy real clothes.\" Al complained as he removed more pieces of the iron armor, exposing again his upper-body again, but this time it looked even more impressive due the sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Ed could see his trunk bare legs once they got free from the metal trousers... that also freed a long fat python than swing halfway to his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok, brother?\" Al asked when he noticed his nervous old brother was looking away with a slightly redden face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He needs to relearn some social etiquette... like not undressing in front of others\" Edward thought, trying to rationalize his blushing discomfort, although it shouldn't be a problem to a brother to see another brother naked... shouldn't he?</span></div></div>",

His initial plan was to stop his horniness with a cold shower, but he changed his mind after a few seconds of winter cold water and heated it up until a nice temperature. The plan B was indulging his hormonal instincts and masturbating the second time in that day, after doing it quick in the bathroom when Al shook his ass in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lately I've been too busy to release <i>tensions</i>... yeah, it must be that.\" He lied to himself, trying not to think in the person who had triggered that reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to masturbate quick. He wasn't used to his restored meat arm and wasn't sure what to do with it while he used the other hand on his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had a big cock like Al, I could use both hands on it...\" His penis twitched with the thought. \"No, stop thinking about him!! Not now... think about Winry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis excitation reduced a little, but it remained high. The free hand helped a little massaging his balls, but when that grew bored it changed the position, caressing the rest of his body... his skin... his nipples...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt better, but Edward was still far from orgasm. He knew Al was waiting outside, so he wanted to end it now. He fastened the pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively his free hand touched his toned ass and accidentally a finger went inside his anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" It felt weird, but also really nice. He put it again, and then several fingers more. Edward had discovered the anal sex and loved it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had something bigger to put it there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help it. An image of his grown-up brother appeared in his mind, with his huge cock, bigger soft than his hard cock, who knows how long at his hardest... and Ed's cock responded to that idea with a big shot of cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" He felt guilty. He didn't want to think about his brother again. Meanwhile his cock shot a few lesser ejaculations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs shacked due the intensity of the orgasm. He wanted to deny it, but the source of his horniness was evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm satisfied...\"<br>\r\n\"Shower timeee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother, sicked of waiting, burst in the bathroom and into the shower. His big body took up most of the space, pushing his big brother to the wall of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A-al, I'm showering right now!\" Ed, recovering from a micro heart attack, could barely talk.<br>\r\n\"You were taking too long, so I decided to join you!\" Al replied with innocence. \"We'll bath together like in the old times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Ed was facing the same wall when his brother appeared, so he couldn't see his still semihard, cum-dripping cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al, please, there's no space for both of us!\"<br>\r\n\"But who is going to clean your back, brother? Or mine? Let me help you, I want to thank you for restoring my body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(But that's not your body)\" Ed think worried, sure his brother would never grow over 3 feet (like 1 meter) in a few years. Their father, who was pretty tall and corpulent, couldn't match any of Al's dimensions, and much less Edward (so upsetting).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to look back to him to remember that (also there wasn't enough room to turn).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thick pecs were gracing against the top of his head.<br>\r\nLooking down, he could see the tip of his huge feet next to his own tiny feet.<br>\r\nAnd sometimes something long and soft grazed the lower side of his back and butt... he didn't want to think what was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later Ed noticed something weird and looked down... and saw his cock once again rock hard, asking for attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Damn you, what's your problem!!)\" He thought angry. It was the third erection in the day.</span></div></div>",

Now with Alphonse looking down on his brother, a wild hunger in his eyes and monstrous erection pressing between both boys Al found himself at a loss and stopped. \"Um, brother...I don't really know what to do now\" Alphonse confessed an embarrassed look coming over him, but without another word Edward pounced on his brother's manhood as if it were the prey he'd been seeking for a lifetime. \"WHhAaaa...mmmm,\" Al exclaimed as the pleasure of his older brother's small mouth attempting to swallow as much of his massive phallus hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly choking now as he began to bob up and down and his brother's meat Ed dared to open his eyes and see just much he'd managed to take, but the reality of the situation hit him like a tidal wave as he some he had only managed to choke down just under half of his brother's enormous cock. This sight both disheartened and thrilled  Ed as he was disappointed he could not take in more than the obscene amount he already had due to his damn stature but more than that he was enamored with this gorgeous monster he called his brother, feeling enormous amounts of gratification knowing that he was causing someone so impressive to be so pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys silently, with the exception of soft grunts and moans, continued on for several minutes until Edward felt his brother's hands on his head before he began to face fuck his older brother which was met by Ed with shock and thirst.

Can we do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked Al was already asking for more Ed dared to look and saw that, despite his ferocious release, his brother was still as erect as ever. \"Not yet, Alphonse.\" Ed managed to wheeze \"I'm way too sore, besides it's more fun if it's treated like something special.\" to which Al just stuck his tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine brother, than you should rest.\" Al said hoisting his brother on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al what the hell!\" Ed griped <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're gonna make me wait I at least want to feel you for a while.\" Al said, not asked \"And don't like you don't want it too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd however had no such intention as he nestled against his brother's hard body. Ed's sleep however was fairly restless as he could feel Alphonse squirming the whole time. Finally having enough Ed woke himself up enough to complain at his brother, but before he could he was stunned into silence when he saw that his brother's legs now reached the other end of the room and that halfway his massive hand was pumping his massive dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry brother. Did I wake you?\" Al boomed, apparently not in the least bothered by what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yeah,\" Ed stammered \"But what in the hell happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not really sure, but I think it has to do with when I orgasmed. Besides feeling really good it also felt kinda, tingly I guess and now that I'm playing with my penis I can kinda feel it again.\" Alphonse explained matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if that's the case Al why are you trying to do it again?\" Ed asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a dumb question brother, because it feels soooo gooood.\" Al exclaimed as he began to pump a little harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then when Ed could see the smallest bit of growth as his brother further increased in size. \"Alphonse, you have to stop so we can figure out what's going on.\"</span></div></div>",

His partner, Toriko, could easily lift several thousands of pounds, possibly more. Compared to such a powerful man, Komatsu felt...inadequate at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one time he remembered when he felt power. It was that one night when he ate the Meteor Garlic. Because of the incredibly high nutritional value, Komatsu had briefly became a musclebound monster. For a short time he felt what it was like to have giant muscles, and now he craved more...a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut simply eating a rare and difficult ingredient that caused only a temporary change would not give him what he wanted. The real answer would be to solve this problem through his cooking. He had managed to recreate the taste of the Century Soup after all, so why not come up with a dish that could make him grow into the biggest man ever? For months he had toiled away in the kitchen, testing and working on his secret recipe, until finally the fruits of his labor was now coming to fruition. Komatsu lifted the lip of the pot that had been simmering away and smelled the aroma wafting out of it. Instantly he felt his body feel energized and invigorated. In the moment of truth, Komatsu dipped his spoon into the soup, brought the broth to his lips and sipped it down.</span></div></div>",

Izzy explained a list of things to be careful about, but Tai being Tai, of course kind of zoned out. \"Did you get all that?\" Izzy asked, snapping Tai out of his own little world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, sure.\" He looked down, expecting something, but so far, nothing yet. \"Wasn't something supposed to happen though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy slapped his face, dragging it down. \"I told you Tai, it'll take a couple hours...\" Any more ranting was interrupted by Tai's phone ringing, leaving them staring at each other until he told him to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai answered, and found it was one of the soccer club mates, asking him where he was? They did have practice after all. He shrugged, and said, \"Izzy...\" He overheard something about may Kami have mercy on him or something like that. They knew if Izzy wanted something, then he got it. He hung up, sighing. Izzy better hope that they win, or he's gonna owe them something big. At least he gets paid for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to do something, I have a little workout thing set up for you if you want to keep yourself occupied.\" Izzy said. He knew Tai could never sit still. It sure led them into a lot of trouble in their earlier years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai leapt at the opportunity. It wasn't too much, just one of those pull up bars you can set up in a doorway. He didn't bother putting his shirt back on, just leaving himself in some shorts. He entertained himself for a bit, his muscles straining, as he lifted himself. He enjoyed the muscle burn, but strangely he thought it felt easier as time went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPull ups, pushups, some sit ups, he used them all as best as he could. Before long, a few hours had already passed him by. He looked in the mirror, and was actually decently surprised. Just looking at his shorts, the bottom of the legs was now mid-thigh, when they were formerly at his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis definition had definitely improved, and he enjoyed looking at his reflection, trying to see if he could bounce his pecs like he's seen some people who were buff enough. Although... he looked down, and wondered if there weren't other things he could bounce. He's gonna need a bigger jock strap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy walked in, and found where he could nearly look Tai in the eyes, now he was eye level only with his pecs! It actually worked! Not that he didn't think it wouldn't!</span></div></div>",

A chuckle emerging as he saw Izzy turning red before he even spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tai please! I need to study your measurements!\" Izzy stammered for only a second as he pulled out a laptop, entering the password and opening the program to observe Tai's current statistics through the Digi-Mass Extractor. \"It says here you've gained about 4 inches (2.54 cm) since we started this two hours ago. As well as about 10 lbs of muscle. Prodigious. I didn't expect such an increase so quickly.\" Izzy eyes shined bright with curiosity. Tai liked the look on his friends face, even if he wasn't into this the way he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I meet your expectations?\" Tai asked, hoping he might have surpassed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You even managed to surpass it. I was expecting 1.5-2 inch (3.81-5.08 cm) at maximum and only 1 pound increase in muscle mass relative to your size.\" Izzy was fixated as he went over the additional info displayed. <i>Tais body appears to have been altered to absorb more nutrients from sustenance. Then there's his phall-</i> Izzy stopped himself after he realized just how big that had gotten from it. Tais formerly six inch erect penis had grown more than three inches to reach 9! Even Izzy did not expect a noticeable increase by even an inch! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai had a cheeky grin on his face as he saw just how much his bodies change excited Izzy. He could even see him trying to hiding a tent in his pants <i> If he likes it this much I'll give him a surprise</i>. Moving close enough to whisper in Izzys ear, Tai seductively spoke to him. \"You know you could see how much I'll grow with a second  patch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing so red even his hair was a lighter shade, Izzy coughed \"I can't do that. We have a week here to test how much growth one patch causes. A second would ruin the experiment!\" However, Tais larger hands entering his shirt caused him to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it though? You could justify it as an attempt to see if you could get greater results from multiple patches. To be honest I'm already liking the current results, so an additional few feet would just make me the biggest soccer player in the world.\" Seeing Izzy was still hesitating and knowing reason or temptation could dissuade him, Tai came up with an idea \"How about I use a patch against your will and you can't stop me due to my stronger body? Would that get you to let me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy didn't believe for a second Tai was threatening him, but the digidestined of Courage could be incredibly stubborn. \"All right. I'll let you use one additional patch for the experiment. I was carrying it in my pocket for when another of my test subjects got here, but you really want more growth huh.\" Izzy pulled out the second patch from his pants pocket, handing it over to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Izzy. I'll make sure you don't regret it\" Tai smiled as he prepared the patch \"Now get back to studying my bod.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\" With that distraction out of the way Izzy began to study to see if there were any other changes, only for a long tanned arm to in a flash reach down into Izzys shirt and place the patch on his lithe chest . \"What the-? Tai!\" Izzy said in shock as he looked up only for Tais mouth to meet his lips. \"Mmf-!\" The warmth of Tais lips caught him by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorry Izzy but I think you should enjoy this too!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, Tai'd have to fix that! He smirked as he leaned in for yet another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, let's get started!\" Tai said, not bothering to wait for his friend's response, grabbing Izzy by his waist, all 5'11\" (180.2 cm) of his still growing muscle body tensing as he carried him back over to the training area, shutting the door as he prepared to get to teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooff!\" Izzy grunted as Tai plopped him on the ground, landing somewhat hard on his butt. \"Did you have to drop me....\" He muttered, rubbing it tenderly, at least until he heard the sound of cracking knuckles, Tai looking down with him with a twinkling look he didn't like. \"Uh, mercy?\" He muttered, as Tai locked the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====x====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Izzy's office, \"Hello? Anyone here? Izzy?\" A voice rang out as the front door opened up, the blonde-haired face of TK popping into view. He looked around, but still didn't see anyone. \"Did he forget?\" He muttered, as he waited for Izzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited around for a bit, before absentmindedly sitting down in Izzy's chair, enjoying the comfiness of the seat as he adjusted himself, before noticing Izzy's laptop open. \"Oh, what's this?\" He said, leaning in further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Digi-Mass Extractor?' He thought as he read through the statistics on it, names attached to each: Tai: height gain- 5 inches (12.7 cm), muscle growth (15 lb). Izzy: height gain - 0.5 inches (1.3 cm), muscle growth (1 lb). His eyes widened though as he looked at some of the other stats though. Erect Size: 9 inches (24.1 cm) 5 inches (12.7 cm).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoa... That's kind of hot...' he thought, as he clicked another setting, pulling up the camera in the training room. \"Whoops!\" He muttered, seeing Tai put Izzy through all kinds of exercises,  both of their bodies covered with a sheen of sweat as both developed and developing muscles worked. It was so hot, and he honestly couldn't resist not looking, feeling his pants getting tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting his lip, he looked around, getting up to lock Izzy's front door, before sitting back down. 'I'm sure they won't mind, if I take a little peak...' He thought, fumbling with his belt as he pulled them open, stroking at the tent in his boxers. This was so wrong, but the perverseness of it, jerking off at his own friends working out, it felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like he wasn't well-endowed either. He sometimes had to thank the French part of him, a full 10.5 inches (26.7 cm) of meat at his disposal. He panted as he kept on, watching as they both worked out, growing bigger, growing stronger as he tried to see if he could zoom in, one hand messing with the laptop, the other masturbating himself.</span></div></div>",

He fumbled with moving the video to press on a button concerning the Digi-Mass Extractors. Set before him qere unknown numbers. \"Dang I ended up changing it!\" Frustrated by his mistake, Takeru didn't really pay attention to what the bar before him was used for as he began messing with it. Two sets of 1-100% were on display as he began moving the first one. 1.5% was moved up to 25%, while the second one was moved from 1% to 50%. The bottom button with apply changes lite up as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure apply changes. Get me back to Tai and Izzy!\" Clicking it the blonde had no idea the first was Tai's and the second Izzy's set percentage for the patch's as he fumbled through. With it completed the window automatically closed. TK was relieved as he saw it return to the screen with Izzy and Tai on it. Though much to his display things had halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy had moved from the weights to relax. Sweat glistening off their bodies and giving them a nice sheen even if ir it didn't take long before Izzy. A few minutes later Tai leaving his own exercises to go over and massage Izzys more slender frame. The red head smiling as Tai started to massage every muscle in Izzys back tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe it was getting good.\" Takeru sighed as he began moving the mouse over to make the video full screen. He ended up fumbling some more, and now a new program. \"Time set for periodic growth\". Reading it, and realizing what the other screens numbers likely did lead Takeru to a realization. \"Oh I can make them grow as big and fast as I can with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lead him to a devious idea \"I can make them as big and as much as I desire.\" He was soon changing the time for growth from one hour to 15 minutes. Enough time for both subjects to enjoy it and for Takeru to relish in his voyeurism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should try the Digi-mass patches too.\" The blonde began searching through the drawers for one while Tai and Izzy had gone from massaging to making out. He went through three drawers before finding them. An entire batch of them ready to use. Thinking of how many to use it didn't take long before he decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One for now. Don't want to grow too big just yet.\" He smirked as he thought of posing in front of his brother. Showing off his new size alongside a just as massive Tai and Izzy. He put it aside as he began to put on the patch. He wasn't sure where, but putting it on his arm was fine right? So he did. Upon being placed on his left arm it soon disappeared, becoming indistinguishable from his skin. Line like veins glowing as they appear on his skin before disappearing with the patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets set it up for me!\" TK began going through the program from the Digi-Mass Extractor, finding his face was now displayed with them. \"Good let's open those two.\" The blomde then opened both. Seeing the third one was set to 1% like the other two, TK decided to not completely indulge as he set it to 25% like Tai. Pressing apply changes, he moved to the next one as it closed and set his own to grow every 15 minutes and apply changes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! With that done I can enjoy myself while watching those two!\" TK smiled as he saw Tai and Izzy were back too using the weights again. Setting the window to full screen let him watch as he could. \"Best not play with it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that out of the way TK no longer had anything keeping him from masturbating as he took his 10.5 inches (26.7 cm)  in his hands and began again. Waiting for him and his friends growth. Having ruined Izzys test experiment with his actions.</span></div></div>",

You grew 14cm (5.5\") in hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaichi smiled. He was taller than his father. At 185cm, he was probably the tallest guy in the school. And he had never felt so strong, so energetic... He was sure his performance in tomorrow's match was going to be outstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tai was daydreaming, Izzy kept talking about boring technical data.

I think I understand why he was so devoted to this experiment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better remove the digi-patch from your body before you outgrow the bulding\" Izzy's words drew Taichi's attention.

I sensed something off with you, but I couldn't tell what it was. Why didn't I tell apart something so obvious??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That because I added to the experiment something extra. I injected him a magic aura of \"normality\". It makes anyone around him to feel he's normal and fine, even if they saw him the day before the changes. Some won't notice any changes, others could, but they automatically accept them as something perfectly normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That extremely useful.\" Taichi admitted. He hadn't thought about how his parents would react to this radical change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the ones altered by the experiment, or me, are immune. The aura is based on the digital barrier I used against Myotismon's minions to make my family invisible to them. The basis behind it it's fascinating...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes of boring presentation later, Izzy ended his explanation. Taichi was almost sleep. Takeru was still listening attentive. He seemed very excited about the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we start with the experiment, please?\" He asked nervously the young scientific.<br>\r\n\"Of course. Take off your shirt\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the patch in his lean pec, the three friends waited silently. Tai could have left, but he preferred to stay to support TK. After a minute, Taichi suggested him to do the same exercises he did before. Takeru gladly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK steadily exercised with the pull up bars for hours. He was shorter and thinner than Tai before the experiment, so it was hard for him, but he never stopped.<br>\r\nHe increased the frecuency of the pulls while his swear covered more and more of his pale back, until it dropped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so interested in this?\"- Taichi asked him whereas an uninterested Izzy played video games on his laptop. \"Being tall and strong is great, but you look quite... motivated\".<br>\r\n\"Ugh... For you, it's great... UGH ...but I really need it.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I'm short.\"- He admited, a little embarrased.<br>\r\n\"You're not short. You still young, you can still grow a few inches naturally\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. UGH. My brother Matt is taller than me. Naturally tall, like my father. UGH. But I can't catch him up.\"<br>\r\n\"He's two years older\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but eventually everyone stop growing, I haven't grown a single centimeter since January. I'm afraid I reached a dead end for my development, and I will be 'the shorty one' of my family forever. That will only worsen their tendency of treating me like a baby. And Matt's jokes about my height. Gosh, I hate them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"That's a serious inferiority complex\" Taichi thought, although he sympathized with him)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, you're acceptability tall... 169cm (5'6.5\"), am I right? \"<br>\r\n\"It's not so acceptable, not in basketball.\" TK continued as he went even harder with the bars and himself \"I have problems with my performance and my style of play. There are a lot of people physically better than me. Faster. More resistant. And of course, taller. This year the competitions got really serious, the mediocre players left and the talented stayed. I wanted to stay because I love basketball and an sport scholarship would be so nice... but I'm not talented. My rivals, like those morons of the <b>The Generation of Miracles</b>, usually remind me. The last team we faced has 208cm tall guy, Murasakibara, who mocked of my height so many times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru when even faster. The changes hasn't just simply started, they were accelerating as Taichi was witnessing. The blond angel did the pulls easily now, but his face, full of selfpity and resentment, wasn't angelical at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The coach take my Team Captain title to give it to a jerk 198cm (6'7\") newie. And the other guys are between 180 and 190cm (6'-6'4\") and as brainless as him. And due their stupidity we lost 3 matches in a row. The team wants to blame someone of this collective failure, and they chose me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was getting more red, but it wasn't due to the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to prove them that I'm as good as them! BETTER... THAN...THEM\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Clack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last pull, the bar slipped on its support and the boy and the bar fell off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fine, TK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK slowly got up from the floor and them he noticed he was slightly taller than Taichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never better\" - He muttered with a sweet smile.<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that\" Tai answered sincerely. Maybe he would like to be the biggest guy, but after all he heard he knew TK needed and deserved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the meassures came. Takeru's height had increased from 169cm (5'6.5\") to 188cm (6'3\"). He wasn't the tallest guy in his team, but it was an incredible improvement. His muscle mass was increased too, but not as much as Tai, as he still has a lanky type of body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt radiant. Victorious.

After that, we can talk about further improvements...\" Izzy told him, but Takeru wasn't completely in accordance with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a last few tests, the genious confirmed Tai and TK's growth had stopped and they were healthy.

His feet, like everything else, were bigger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike his shoes, his sport t-shirt was tighter, constricting and short enough to show a few centimeters of his abs. Tai was dying to get more comfortable clothing, but he doubted there were any of his size in his wardrobe. It was getting late, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to go shopping until the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he got home. His parents were making dinner. Initially the digidestined was worried about their reaction about his changes, but they acted as usual, like his son growing 15cm in an afternoon were completely normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be that \u2018normality aura\u2019 Izzy told us about...\u201d He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing his mother realized was his unfitted clothes, and she recommended him buying new clothes as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will give you some money later. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think about renewing your wardrobe until now...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, mom. I\u2019ll buy them tomorrow after class.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity you have to wear such small clothes to school. They\u2019re going to look ridiculous on you...\u201d Her mom worried, but then Taichi\u2019s father had an idea. <br>\r\n\u201cI have plenty baggy clothes\u2026 they could fit you pretty well, If you don\u2019t mind wearing clothes from your old man.\u201d He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pretty good idea. His father had always being bigger than him, at almost 180cm (6\u2019) and wide shoulders. It was such a change, looking at his big dad and noticing the son was now the tallest one. Although they were still pretty similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner went well, as always. After the dinner and taking the most baggier and \u2018least unfashionable\u2019 clothing he went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he undressed, he looked at the reflection of his almost naked body in a mirror. Such a difference since before the experiment. His \u201calmost unexistent\u201d pecs was now more prominent, and his 7cm wider shoulders had given them more space to widen and grow. He caressed his newfound abs, they still didn\u2019t stand out much, but they were hard as rock. \u201cIs it weird to think my own body is hot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis longer and wider legs were a little tightened by his underpants\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one thing remains...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his underclothes, and discovered a part of him which had grown specially well\u2026 his flacid penis hanged from his body, visibly fattened and lengthened by the experiment. His whole body had grown, but even so that part of him looked specially big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he touched it it twitched and grew fast. It was more sensible, and he was hornier than usual.<br>\r\nHe smiled as it reached its maximum size. It was\u2026 17.5cm? (7\u201d). He couldn\u2019t believed. He didn\u2019t complain much about his average sized cock before, but secretly he always wanted something better\u2026 and now he got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stroked violently, enjoying every second\u2026 He though about Takeru, about if he were doing the same, visualizing his naked, fit body\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*splash*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ended with pleasure. Then he felt the accumulated tiredness of the day and went to bed. His new body was amazing. He couldn\u2019t wait to find how much had improved at soccer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter how wonderful was his new body, he couldn\u2019t help thinking about what another session of Izzy\u2019s experiment could do\u2026</span></div></div>",

Although it was somehow amusing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t seem to notice nothing extraordinary in his growth spurt. The \u201cnormality\u201d aura worked perfectly on his family\u2026 but now he would have to test it in a building full of bitter teachers and teenagers obsessed with appearance. Tai hoped they didn\u2019t say anything about him not wearing the now-too-small uniform\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were approaching to the building they saw T.K. Kairi chuckled. Unlike Taichi, he was wearing the mandatory school uniform, even if it was too short, exposing part of his navel and ankles. The blond boy clearly left as ashamed as we were amused by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, big guy. I\u2019m sure anyone will understand you had a growth spurt and nothing to wear. And I\u2019m sure my brother wearing my dad\u2019s old and ugly sweatshirt will gather all the mockery\u201d Kairi tried to reassure him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went in the school first as the boys kept talking outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I had been able to borrow some clothes from Matt or Dad, but I spent the night in my mother\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat sucks, man. But after 6 hours of mockery we can go to buy something more appropriate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru smiled a little. A few second of silence, looking each other at the eyes. Taichi felt so strange near Takeru since the changes\u2026 \u201cdoes he feel the same?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang. They went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Taichi was getting ready for the soccer match. His sport clothes were tight, but he couldn\u2019t care less about that. He was so excited about trying his big body in football. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match started and his body met and excedeed all his expectations. His muscular legs were much faster than he though, allowing him to cross the whole field and score in the first minute, and no player of the opposing team was able to reach him. The same scene repeated many times, and Taichi kept dominating the field, intercepting all rival team\u2019 attempts of score and scoring afterwards until the first half of the match ended. Unlike the other players, he didn\u2019t feel tired at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped to see the score. 18-0. He couldn\u2019t believed. He even felt a little bad for abusing of his physical advantage. Also, his teammates hardly had had a chance to score, as he was always the one controlling the ball. He decided to play less hard in the next half, focusing in the teamwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe assured the others had the ball most of the time. Although that allowed the rival team to score a few points, it was impossible for them to turn the tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaichi\u2019s team won, and they went victoriously to the changing room. Taichi had taken an hour and a half of intense soccer to sweat whereas by then his teammates were completely exhausted, although happy to win and amazed for their overwhelming score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they undressed and hit the showers. The water trickled down his toned body, traveling through his noticeable pectorals to his abs, then crossing his slightly hairy pubis and finally caressing 10cm of fat, flaccid meat before falling to the ground. It was relaxing. Taichi tried to focus more in the relaxing part instead of the erotic part of a collective shower. That wasn\u2019t the best place for a hard-on, but his libido felt stronger than usual...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, you were amazing during the match! I\u2019ve never seen you playing so well! Like a professional!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you keep playing like this we\u2019ll win hands down the winter tournament.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never see you so toned. Have you started some kind of workout?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled many times, but he didn\u2019t answer all of their questions. Something distracted him. He had caught one of the freshmen, Akio, glance repeatedly at his enormous manhood. Of course he felt ashamed when he noticed Tai had noticed it, but that didn\u2019t stop him to try to peek some time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkio was almost as tall as his old-self, but now he was as high as his collarbone. Slightly muscular, thin waist, quite wide shoulders, cute face\u2026  Taichi waited waited for the others to leave, to talk to his hormonal kohai alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a clumsy conversation full of stuttering questions about the obvious sexual tension, the two boys agreed to have sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slow at first, perfectly understandable due the lack of experience of both.<br>\r\nTai kissed him, waited for a response. Akio had to stand on tiptoe to reach his lips and kiss him back. The longer the kiss lasted, the more skin they explored with his hands.<br>\r\nAkio\u2019s hands pawed Tai\u2019s back, scouted his curvature and then pressed his fingers against his hard, toned ass. Meanwhile, a huge hand was stroking Akio\u2019s dick, rising it to his hardest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai bent his legs a little, lowered his waist until it was at the same height as Akio\u2019s one, so both cocks were brought together. Then he started masturbating both. Akio groaned of pleasure. Tai too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower kept watering both teens for minutes. Akio ended first, but Tai couldn\u2019t be further from the finishing line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me try something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Tai put his considerable cock between his buttocks and pressed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Akio gasped. Slightly unpleasant, but slightly pleasant too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7 inches of meat went inside, then outside, and repeated the cycle at an increasing speed. The kohai\u2019s legs felt weak\u2026 Tai\u2019s strong arms grabbed his legs by his thighs and he lifted him off the floor like he were as light as a feather. Then he rose him up and down as his cock penetrated his ass, faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh! Slower, please\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t in control of his body anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was happening to him. His temperature was rising... his body started to shiver\u2026 His muscles tensed and hurt\u2026 His bones creaked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body started to inching upwards, so was the guy Tai was holding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tensed muscles inflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the uncomfortable growth, Tai hugged Akio so tightly he hardly could breath.<br>\r\nHis large penis, completely inserted in his asshole, started to grow too\u2026 centimeter by centimeter, it was spreading by his anus, deeper than anything else, as its diameter grew too, pressing the walls\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys scream of pleasure (and less pain) and collapse to the floor. The shower was still on, cleaning the immense amount of cum Tai was released on their bodies\u2026<br>\r\nTheir minds went white for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was amazing\u201d Akio confessed. \u201cOverwhelming\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai could feel how much his body has changed. His pecs were much more prominent now, like all his muscles, he probably had the body type of a professional gymnast. He knew he was taller, but not how much taller. His cock, soft, looked as big as Akio\u2019s hard one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch\u2026 ouch...\u201d The kohai moaned while he got up. \u201cMy ass\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I overdid.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I enjoyed it every second\u2026 although\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to train tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to do it again?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c...not today. Another day.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, this was amazing, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his titanic cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my ability to walk each time we have sex.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI understand\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo hard feelings\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was getting dressed, Tai wondered if Takeru was underwent the same changes at that very same moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Taichi was having fun, Takeru was wallowing in misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach was fed up of so many defeats, but he was too incompetent to notice the real problems in the team (like the lack of teamwork or the deficiencies in most of the players\u2019 playstyle), so he simply scheduled a harder training session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t a big problem for TK. His stamina was improved a lot since the previous days, so were his other skills. But he didn\u2019t get praised for it\u2026 The others were still jerks and his growth didn\u2019t change the way they treated him. Although they couldn\u2019t keep joking about his height, they figured up new topics to tease him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut of the way, fag\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru deeply regretted asking Arata, his tall stupid captain, to lend him spare clothes because his own uniform didn\u2019t fit him well. Arata twisted the facts to make it look like TK felt a fetishist attraction for his used clothing, and so he told that to the whole team. And the mockery kept going for the whole session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru almost cried of rage, but he could suppress his feelings as much as he could. That would only worsen the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach didn\u2019t gave a fuck about the homophobic bully he was witnessing. He merely criticized TK\u2019s skills instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you score at least a single basket, kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the training, he discovered a new issue related to his new body. His transformation had improved his speed and strength, but the extra height had messed with his ability to shoot. He still had to get used to his size, had to readjust his instincts to calculate right the throwing\u2026 during the training he practiced his shots nonstop and improved much, he only needed another hour of practice to perfect it, but the coach and the teammates had already seen him missing enough shots to destroy his reputation as a basketball player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re terrible, kiddo.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sir. I\u2019m having a bad day...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAfter what I\u2019ve seen, I will not risk tomorrow\u2019s match by letting you play. You\u2019ll be a reserve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team laughed at him, and Arata was the loudest of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru walked away from that humiliating place, looking for a friend. Then he met an overgrown Taichi. He was like a head taller than him and much more bulky, really imposing, but he also irradiated happiness and relaxation. Of course, after those changes his father\u2019s sweatsuit looked ridiculous on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He asked with a wide, goofy smile in his face. \u201cCan you believe I grew again...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t say anything. He just stared at him with wet eyes for a second before he threw himself into his arms and broke down crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprised Taichi didn\u2019t know what to say\u2026 although he did comfort him, as his taller, wider body helped him to hug the other pretty big teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he calmed down, he told him what happened. Tai felt bad for him, but he couldn\u2019t do anything for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, they went shopping\u2026 unfortunately for Tai, the japanese clothing stores don\u2019t usually have clothing for a 206cm tall client. And the one which sold the school uniforms never though they might have to provide one for the tallest teenager in the city. Taichi ended up ordering custom made ones, despite it wouldn\u2019t be cheap or fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little easier for Takeru. Their biggest size fit him, although his strong build felt constrained on them. He bought only a school uniform and some sportswear, as the other clothing weren\u2019t much bigger than his father\u2019s baggiest clothes. He could ask him for some casual ones and save some money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he wasn\u2019t sure if how long those clothes would fit\u2026 he might have a second growth spurt like Tai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I should have already have one\u201d He though bitterly. \u201cMaybe I have stopped growing\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made him fell even worse. Takeru\u2019s inferiority complex strikes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they made a visit to Izzy. He was very surprised to see Tai even taller, although he confessed he always suspected the growth spurts might continue after the initial dose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy decided to do some tests on Taichi to make sure he was fine. Both digidestined went to the examination room, leaving TK alone in the other room\u2026 where the equipment and the growing patches were stored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they closed the door, TK took another patch and put it on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on\u2026 do something...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited, but he only got frustated by the lack of changes. After a few minutes he heard his friends aproaching and he quickly put the patch back on Izzy\u2019s desk and acted like nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...beyond my expectations. All your physical attributes off the charts, and you\u2019re incredibly healthy too. I wonder if this experiment could be the key to lengthen life expectancy beyond 120 years\u2026 maybe beyond 200!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. I\u2018ve never felt so strong\u2026 if this growth carries on, I\u2019ll become a real ife superhero\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused by his commentary, Izzy added \u201cI know you\u2019re joking, but\u2026 that\u2019s right. My analysis shows you have a level of strength and stamina similar to a Champion level digimon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf this goes on\u2026 who know what will you able to do.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, Izzy, I had some concerns about\u2026 you know\u2026my private parts\u201d Tai whispered. He wasn\u2019t used to talk about that topic with friends<br>\r\n\u201cYour giant penis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai blushed a little. \u201cIt had grown a lot, much more sensitive, and that\u2019s cool\u2026 but I\u2019m worry about it becoming too big for sex...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t grow much more\u2026 but even if you do, I\u2019m preparing something that will solve any sexual problem. It\u2019s a magic digital thing\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey said goodbye to each other and went away. That time Takeru went to his father and Matt\u2019s home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be nice to show Matt how big I\u2019ve gotten\u201d He smiled.

He told him his brother was in the bathroom, giving himself a bath before dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I\u2019m going in too. I had training in the basketball and I couldn\u2019t take a shower afterwards. I stink. We\u2019ll save water and time if we take a bath together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru entered silently. Yamato was there lost in though inside an old, circular bathtub big enough for four persons. Takeru stripped off and went inside the bath without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTK??\u201d Matt didn\u2019t expect him.<br>\r\n\u201cMatt.\u201d TK greeted him coldly as he sat in front of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt embarrassed being naked in front of his brother\u2026 and his being naked too. They didn\u2019t get a bath together since they were kids, and their bodies and minds had changed since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had a nice physique. He was slim and still a little shorter than his father, but his muscles had a little definition even he didn\u2019t exercise like him. Also he had a nice face and hair, but his popularity among women was more due to his role of rebel rockstar than his looks, although Takeru recognized he was a little handsome...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the experiment, Takeru was a shorter version of his big brother. But now it was undeniable he was the biggest in every way. As they were sitting, Matt\u2019s head and neck protrude from the water while Takeru had half of his chest outside. He had proper pectorals, similar to the ones of a swimmer. His slightly bent torso made his 6-pack more noticeable, whereas Matt didn\u2019t have anything to show there. And his longer and thicker legs could reach Matt\u2019s hip whereas Matt\u2019s feet couldn\u2019t go beyond the middle of his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another, more important thing. Takeru had left his legs open on purpose, showing his penis to his brother. If it were hard, anyone would say it was an acceptable size, slightly smaller than average\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t hard, it was completely soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed and tried to hide his crotch between his flexed legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t act like a girl\u201d Takeru reproached him as he moved apart Matt\u2019s legs with his hands.\u201cWe\u2019re brothers. We\u2019re beyond complexes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tried to stop him, but he was way stronger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he saw Matt\u2019s penis again, but this time hard. It was \u201cslightly smaller than average\u201d.<br>\r\nHis owner almost died of shame. He jumped out of the tub as his brother watched him maliciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow who\u2019s the one with a tiny wee~nie, Matt?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru finally poured his heart out to Matt and told him the source of his bitterness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast year we were changing clothes and you saw my thing and commented it was small. You called me \u2018tiny wee~nie\u2019 for weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember that\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI remember it. And I also remember you has named me \u2018shorty\u2019 several times over the years.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c...eh? But that\u2019s\u2026 normal stuff between brothers\u2026 inoffensive jokes<br>\r\n\u201cNot for me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato looked at his sulky face and started to understand the source of his problems. He was the one with a complex, and his jokes didn\u2019t help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Takeru. I was tactless then, but I\u2019ve never meant to hurt you\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not hurt\u201d He replied irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt went round the bathtube to where his brother was and he hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d He repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug lasted a minute and while it lasted Takeru couldn\u2019t help sobbing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a terrible person\u201d He confessed.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think you only had a very bad day\u2026 for the last month. I noticed you weren\u2019t fine for some time, but I didn\u2019t say anything. I should have.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m bullied or something, but\u2026 my teammates are the worst. Hurtful. But I would prefer to talk about that another day.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Tomorrow then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt separated his arms out from his shoulders, releasing him. A much more vented Takeru stood up and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best brother in the world\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m the best singer. You\u2019re the best brother, bro\u2026 whoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccidentally Matt\u2019s eyes looked way down and was an incredible column of meat rising from his bro\u2019s crotch. This time it was Takeru who blushed and jumped to hide his erection. Matt enjoyed his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t act like a girl\u201d He mocked at his ashamed brother. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly normal to have erection when you\u2019re with other naked people\u2026 Look, I\u2019m still rock hard\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got closer. Their bodies were almost touching each other\u2026 The \u00be heads taller, broad shouldered and muscular Takeru and his thinner and cunning brother Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I know a trick to force our cocks to go flaccid again...\u201d Matt proposed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next minutes Matt sucked his brother\u2019s huge cock while he kept stroking his 11cm (4 \u00bd\u201d) one.  It wasn\u2019t easy to put TK\u2019s 20cm (8\u201d) of meat inside Matt\u2019s mouth, but his brother persevered and did a blow job with great enthusiasm, until they both cummed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rested for a while, catching breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like how big you are. Everywhere.\u201d Matt confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later they came out and had dinner with his father. He asked them why they took so long. They exchanged an accomplice look and shrugged.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next time. Neither Tai nor Takeru had grown more since yesterday. It was a little disappointing for the blond guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring classes, the only thing TK could think was about the imminent basketball match and how much he wanted to play\u2026 but he was a reserve player. So unfair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf only had something to make Coach change his mind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he felt an uncomfortable sensation in his insides for a few seconds and then\u2026 \u201cbump!\u201d His knees bumped against his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026 I\u2019ve grown? Finally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t feel like a big one, but he couldn\u2019t calculate his new height while he was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe trouser legs rose a little, I can see my socks now\u2026 but my uniform trouser never fit me well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tingle, but this time was more superficial, over his muscles\u2026 His biceps blew up several centimeters, pressing against the sleeves. His calves and thighs grew, and he could distinguish the shape of the muscles cramped on his pants. His pectorals swelled too, they were like two mountains covered by tight fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing grew a few centimeters under his pants, Takeru had to use all his willpower to avoid touching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the bell rang. He still wanted to touch \u201cit\u201d, but he had to run to the gym. They was about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoach, I let me play!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach was with the other players. He looked at him sceptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taller now. I\u2019m the second tallest player in the team\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true. His growth spurt had increased his height to 195cm (6'5 1/2\"), three centimeters less than \u201cCaptain Jerk\u201d Arata. This incompetent coach always thought the height was everything in basketball, so TK believed his growth would change his mind. Unfortunately, he was also stubborn and had hardly changed a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing tall doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t score\u201d The coach said as he passed him a ball.<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u201d He answered him back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the hoop. It looked lower than usual. He feared his extra centimeters would mess his shot again. Anxiety struck him hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a moment to calm and calculate the shot. Breath out. Breath in. He threw it and scored three points. The turned around and looked at the flabbergasted faces of his teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, kiddo, don\u2019t let me down\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match was about to start. Before it did, Arata told him some \u2018encouraging\u2019 words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA tall fag is still a fag. And next to me you\u2019re not tall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frown, holding himself back his desire of hitting in his face.<br>\r\nAs his anger grew, his muscles reacted, growing a little more. His build was becoming into one similar to a bodybuilder\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Taichi, TK didn\u2019t care about teamwork during this match. Every last of his teammates were egocentric bullies who only wanted to be the star of the team. Why should he pass them the ball?<br>\r\nNo one could match his speed or his grasp\u2026 his body stretched further, now he was slightly taller than Arata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 3 pointer. His body transformed the praises of the crowd in pure muscle. His wider shoulders tensed his tshirt even more, hindering his moves. His growing pecs were so tight in that uniform he hardly could breath, so he flexed his arms until his sport tshirt ripped a little over his back, loosening the clothering enough to move again. His basketball shorts become tighter, and he felt how \u2018that thing\u2019 grew even more without getting harder. He hoped it wouldn\u2019t grow much more or it would put \u2018its head\u2019 out the trouser leg, becoming visible to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scored point after point, raising the score marks until they (he) won. The crowd cheered him even more. Arata couldn\u2019t abide his success and once they were in the changing room he tackled him by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, fagot? What do you think you are? Not the captain of this team, bitch. That\u2019s ME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I\u2026?\u201d He repeated as he stood up slowly from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe faced him. His frown face glared his. He was only half head taller, but during the match he had got so much muscular Arata looked scrawny next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a basketball player since elemental school, and I was the captain of this team until you came\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body grew 10 centimeters more (4\u201d). He was half a head taller now, approximately 208cm tall (6\u201910\u201d).  His 6 abs were exposed again. His clothes started to rip everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m today\u2019s top scoring player because I\u2019m better than you\u201d He sentenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words were driving Arata mad. Out of his mind, he tried to punch him in the face, but TK grabbed his fist before it hit. He grabbed his other hand and he didn\u2019t let them go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis growth accelerated even more. In a matter of seconds, he grew 15cm taller, almost another head taller. Arata\u2019s head was at the same level of his collarbone. His strengh grew too, and Arata started to writhe in pain, unable to free his hands from his tightening grab. The small rips in the back and front of TK\u2019s tshirt widened more. His crotch had bulged so much it looked it would burst anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally released Arata\u2019s wrists, but immediately grabed another thing: the collar of his t-shirt.<br>\r\nThe other teammates couldn\u2019t believe what they were witnessing: Takeru was lifting his 198cm muscular captain above the floor. His feet moved on the air \tconstantly, unable to touch the ground.<br>\r\nTakeru was still growing, and with each centimeter he added to his height the jerk were separated from the floor a little more, as TK\u2019s clothing fell down in pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bully and a poor player and I don\u2019t want to see you in my team never again\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped him. He got up fast and took a last look on his enemy. He was so tall now that Arata\u2019s eye level were at his nipples.<br>\r\nAt 235cm tall (7\u20198\u201d), Takeru was a like 2 head taller than him.<br>\r\nHe never felt so small in front of anyone\u2026 so he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru looked around. His teammates were staring at him. Then he found out what they\u2019re looking at: The last remaining piece of his clothing, his shorts, couldn\u2019t contain his cock anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis penis had grown among the rest of his body and now it poked out the left trouser leg.<br>\r\nIt was 100% soft, but now it was almost as big soft than it was hard the day before\u2026 19 cm (8\u201d) long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time you saw a penis\u201d</span></div></div>",

The only thing he was wearing was his undersized basketball shorts, visibly constrained by his huge thighs and crotch.<br>\r\nHis other muscles were equally enormous. And as he held his head up again his hair brushed against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d That was the first thing he said about his transformation. \u201cMy little brother is all-grown up now\u201d Added proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt\u2026 I won the match!\u201d He told him emotionally. \u201cand I got my captain role back!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSuper!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis big brother tried to hug him properly, but his arms only could surround his lower torso.<br>\r\nTakeru, unsatisfied with that poor hug, picked him up like he was a child and gave him a huge hug.<br>\r\nWhile Matt\u2019s head was resting on TK\u2019s shoulder, his legs were hanging like 50cm off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the small discomforts, he enjoyed being rounded by TK\u2019s powerful, big arms, resting on warm pectorals almost as thick as pillows\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease let me go\u201d Matt asked him politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the floor he scanned his body again. His incredible 6 packs was at his eye level now. A little   below that, there was a huge bulge demanding attention. Matt was licking his lips thinking about what he was going to do with that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTK, I think my services are needed again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe trick I taught you yesterday...\u201d He continued as he put his hand on his short shorts \u201cYou can\u2019t stay here with such a hardon, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m not ha--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt didn\u2019t waited and took his shorts off in a fast move. A huge uncut cock was released from his prison and hanged (almost )halfway through his leg. Matt wasn\u2019t prepared for what he saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy growth spurt\u2026 hit me overall\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s soft. It as big as I was erected yesterday\u2026 but completely soft.\u201d Matt was out of his mind.<br>\r\n\u201cNo for long\u201d He warned him while the amazed brother kept touching and examining his genitals.<br>\r\n\u201cI remember you were not a \u2018shower\u2019 yesterday, you were a great \u2018grower\u2019. So how big can it get now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLets get us comfortable. To the sofa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK obeyed his big brother and sat there. He felt it so tiny and low now, almost like he had sat on the floor\u2026 3 days ago the back of that sofa was big enough to cover TK\u2019s back. Now it hardly covered half of it, and he could rest his arms on the top of the piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bent legs were so long that his knees almost could reach Matt\u2019s hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis butt and opened legs took up a lot of room and hardly there was enough free space for another person. But Matt wasn\u2019t planning sitting on the sofa\u2026 instead, he sat on Takeru\u2019s lap, on his rock hard abs to be exact, so his cock and his could be touching. Takeru\u2019s chin was touching the top of his head, his arms surrounded his body, the inner face of his long legs in direct contact with his\u2026 It was felt so comforting\u2026 so secure\u2026 and very, very hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt started to massage his python to get it hard. His was already in his hardest state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, it began to be filled with blood, adding inches every second. It rose beyond Matt\u2019s navel, fattening as it grew longer, until it reached Matt\u2019s chest, who -don\u2019t forget it- was sitting on TK, so his chest was higher than usual. It had doubled his already impossible initial size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t a cock at all. It was an industrial pipe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn\u2019t resist the urges and bent a little so he could kiss that superpenis. When he tried to put it in his mouth, he realized his glans was too big to fit inside. He tried and tried, but it was physically impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlan B: \u201cIf Mohammed does not go to the mountain, the mountain will go to Mohammed\". In this case, his tongue, saliva and lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked the cock and that single caress made it twitch, sending waves of pleasure through Takeru\u2019s body, who grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNggg\u2026 It\u2019s so sensitive now...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt made a good use of his resources. He started to lick and kiss the head of his cock while he kept caressing the rest of it with his hands. Takeru moaned. His \u2018Little TK\u2019 moaned its own way, releasing important amounts of precum, which they came in handy as lubricant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat bizarre sex became more and more frenzy, as Matt started to masturbate it faster. He hugged the meat pole with his whole body and started to rub his torso and cock with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaah!\u201d As Takeru moaned he realized his brother was giving so much pleasure, but he wasn\u2019t receiving anything in exchange. He decided to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent forward and start kissing Matt neck while his left hand pinched his nipple and his right hand flapped his cute cock. His hand was so huge, and his brother\u2019s dick was\u2026 well\u2026 less-than-average at 11cm, he only needed two fingers to cover his whole cock and stroke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, both men moaned as one. That lasted several minutes, until they ended with fireworks\u2026 although Takeru\u2019s was more like a nuke of cum, as some of his spurts reached the ceiling and the opposite wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 was\u2026 so\u2026 good...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was...\u201d Takeru said softly.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you worried for something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 his was fun and all\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t sex\u201d The giant confessed a little sad.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026? It looked pretty much like sex to me\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not real sex like anal\u2026 not even proper oral...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt understood his concerns before he said them out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs my cock too big for sex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt wanted to say something reassuring, but he couldn\u2019t. No matter how much Matt lusted for that huge cock, anal sex was impossible for them, and life threating\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and took the phone.</span></div></div>",

When they finished, Takeru fancied a bath to clean himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go first.\u201d Matt said \u201cI\u2019ll go in after finishing a thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was acting unnecessarily mysterious, but Takeru was too tired to care.<br>\r\nWhile he was filling the bathtub he heard the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid we expect visitors?

I had invited him to come here\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?<br>\r\n\u201cTo take a bath, of course\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Taichi entered into the room. His 208cm tall body had to duck a bit to pass through the door, but not as much as Takeru did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already undressed, and the sight of his gorgeous tanned and fit body made Takeru blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks to let me having a bath with you, guys\u2026 My shower got broken and the only places I can clean myself is in the showers of the football club or in a public bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaichi got into the tub, and it overflowed even more, flooding the floor of the room.<br>\r\nThat bathtub was designed for 4 persons, but the three friends left pretty cramped there, specially Takeru, who had to bend his legs a lot to fit inside.  But the lack of space was kinda hot too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was sitting between the two giants, planning something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Tai\u201d Matt was grinning \u201cYou have a nice cock there\u201d He pointed his crotch, where a long flaccid cock floated between his legs. <br>\r\n\u201cMatt!\u201d complained his brother.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess\u201d His owner answered uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\u201cMy brother had one gigantic too\u201d Takeru felt more and more embarrassed as Matt kept talking \u201cI wonder who had the biggest one\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Taichi took a peek at his friends\u2019 huge penis, but he looked away as soon as TK noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s huge\u201d He thought, and then he sensed a reaction in his own cock. \u201cPlease, it\u2019s not the time\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cHow long is it?\u201d Matt insisted.<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Matt\u201d his brother protested.<br>\r\n\u201cEm\u202615cm\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI meant when it\u2019s hard\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMatt!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all men, we don\u2019t have to feel embarrassed for our own penises.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u2026 It grows to 30cm long.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWow. That\u2019s way beyond my 5-to-11cm dick. You must be proud\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to TK\u2019s embarrassment, he kept talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut my brother hold the record. I measured it a little earlier and it was 19cm soft and 39cm hard! And thicker than my arm!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStop, please...\u201d He begged.<br>\r\n\u201cA giant cock is cool, but it might make sex difficult\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I think it is true\u201d He admitted. He didn\u2019t forget the time he had sex with his kohai and then a growth spurt almost destroyed his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a solution to your problem\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou only have to find someone big enough to be penetrated by your cock. It would be perfect if that person were still growing like you, so you\u2019ll never outgrow his anus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. Both giants now exchanged looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m clean enough. I\u2019m out\u201d Matt said before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute of silence. Then Taichi talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look great.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes. My last growth spurt was very powerful\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I mean you look cooler\u2026 more relaxed\u2026 Yesterday you were\u2026 sad\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve fixed all my problems\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNice\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look hot as hell too\u201d Taichi thought\u2026 but accidentally he also told that out loud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK blushed. And Tai. In his embarrassment, Taichi added...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want\u2026 to have sex with me\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started kissing violently. He moved from one side of the tub to the another, creating waves who flooded even more the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai bit his lover\u2019s nipples as he grabbed his big, strong ass. Takeru interrupted him with another kiss, putting his body over his, making him unable to move under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir cocks bumped against each other, and grew more as they slapped again. Tai kept caressing Takeru\u2019s large torso with his hard abs and those pectorals which were like 8cm thick and so wide as his endless shoulders. Every part of his titanic body was bigger than his, and that made him so horny\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir cocks were so near to each other Tai couldn\u2019t help grabbing them and rubbing non stop. Tai\u2019s hands had gotten huge, but he couldn\u2019t surround the two penis with one of his big hands and had to use both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 I\u2019m tired of masturbation\u2026 I want the real thing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried another thing: a \u201869\u2019 position. Tai\u2019s cock in Takeru\u2019s mouth and vice versa. It wasn\u2019t easy for Tai, after all TK was a giant bigger than him and his colossal cock was out of proportion with the rest of his body, but he managed to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the \u2018real thing\u2019 began. After softening his anus with his fingers, he tried to put Takeru\u2019s cock inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went slowly at first. He took 15 seconds to get the head inside. 30 secs until it put the whole thing inside his anus. It was less painful than Taichi thought. And more pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru put it out, and then what it took him 45 seconds to archive he did it in 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaAh\u201d Tai moaned again, as Takeru touched the depths of his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru\u2019s hands hold Tai\u2019s pecs and played with them as his muscular hip shook in spasms, hammering his insides with his tool...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose penetrations had driven Tai to the verge of orgasm, he didn\u2019t need to touch his cock to reach it. But Takeru did it anyway. He stroke Tai\u2019s cock fast, ignoring Tai\u2019s objections...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop\u2026 ahhh\u2026 I\u2019m about to cum!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cMe too!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the growth happened.</span></div></div>",

His body blew up even more, his arms became almost twice as thick as his. His pectorals rose even more, pressing against Tai\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bent legs lengthen beyond, raising from the surface of the water like icebergs, more muscular than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tub overflowed again, and the waterfall kept going as they kept growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai was surrounded by growing muscular extremities, unable to move, while his ass was under attack from a growing invader who stretched even further from his 39cm of length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAHG!\u201d He cried, as he felt TK\u2019s penis growing more inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n40\u2026 41\u2026 42cm\u2026 no man had had a cock as big. No one had had to receive either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, his beating cock increased his girth by 10cm, and then it kept growing longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n43cm\u2026 44cm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru\u2019s cock twitched again, and his girth increased other 10cm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other man would already have died\u2026 But Taichi was the strongest man in the world, only second to TK. His rectum was as strong as the rest of his body, and stoicly resisted that swelling cock...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut everything had limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n45cm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUggg\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n46cm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTai, move out!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t move!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru was paralyzed due the growth, his muscles kept flexed in a long spasm, Taichi couldn\u2019t get free. TK\u2019s body was getting huge, Tai looked like a child in his arms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think my cock is going to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026grow again. A lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n46cm\u2026 56cm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAHHH\u201d He cried out. This time he felt much more <br>\r\n\u201cI feel another one coming\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai could have died that day, but something saved him.<br>\r\nHis own growth activated and his tensed rectum, almost in the point of ripping, expanded. The rest of his body followed it. As his build became something bodybuilders only could dream, his cock extended slightly beyond his navel, trying to reach his chest but his torso were growing too, trying to keep them separated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai grabbed his cock as tightly as he could. It was longer than TK\u2019s old size at 43cm, specially thick, and it was still expanding, and each centimeter it added it sent orgasmic waves of pleasure for his whole, colossal body.  Tai hold it tight, trying to stop its grown, unable to bear that immense pleasure anymore, but his penis was stronger and kept expanding no matter what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTOO MUCH AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\u201d He cried again, this time by pleasure<br>\r\n\u201cSTOOOPP AAAAAAAA!!\u201d TK cried too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut TK\u2019s cock hadn\u2019t given up the idea of destroying Taichi\u2019s rectum and went all out with a final explosive expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n58cm\u2026 70cm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last growth spurt was like one thousand orgasms at the same time.<br>\r\nTakeru cummed like never before, like a hose. He filled Tai\u2019s rectum and intestines with cum and then the pressure of the liquid forced his penis out of Tai\u2019s ass where he kept covering with cum the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai\u2019s experience was similar: Although TK\u2019s growing penis stimulated his anus while it grew, its suddenly departure released hundred of nervs and glads which sent pleasant signals to their owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 50cm his swollen penis couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and cummed, adding a centimeter each time it spurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an unknown period of time, they woke up and looked what they did to his beautiful bathroom\u2026 There was more cum than water in the tub\u2026 and on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDizzy, Takeru stood up and got his head hit against the ceiling. He staggered and his impossible cock moved like a pendulum of meat. He was taller than the room. He tried to stand up again, but more slowly, bending his back when he touched the ceiling. <br>\r\nAt his full height of 281cm, his head and shoulders pressed against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaichi rose next, but fortunately for him he could stay straight.<br>\r\nAt 224cm tall, he was half a head smaller than the ceiling or TK before this growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now TK was way taller than that, and his nipples were at Tai\u2019s eye level.<br>\r\nThe difference of height between those two were almost 3 heads. The difference of body mass was similar, Takeru\u2019s build was much broader and taller than his, which made room for his muscles to grow beyond Tai\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir soft cocks were now as large as his previous hard ones.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This... this is... terrible...\" TK muttered.<br>\r\n\"I think you meant incredible.\" Taichi corrected with a goofy slime. \"It was the most incredible sex no one has ever...\".<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking about the sex!\" TK answered annoyed \"(although... yes, it was fantastic...)\" He thought \"Look at me! I'm a fucking giant!\"<br>\r\n\"Wasn't that what you wanted...?\"<br>\r\n\"I wanted to be tall, but no so freakish big. I'm over 9 feet tall! (over 274cm) and a muscle beast! Finding clothes is going to be impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaichi looked at TK's whole body, starting from his long feet, then to his big, muscular, calves and things, then to a flaccid cock which doubled the size of the hardons of the biggest porn (actually it was more than 2 two times bigger), then his quite narrow but also really toned waistline, his torso widen dramatically as Tai looked upper to his balloon-like pecs and his muscular shoulders. A great deltoid and a thick, long neck ended in the beautiful face of his blond lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could go everywhere naked.\" Taichi replied sincerely. The sight of his body was making Tai's cock hard again, although they had finished having sex 5 minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugg, stop looking!\" Takeru felt a mixture of embarrassing than anger for his reaction. \"This is serious. I'm so tall I don't think I can steal the ball from the normal sized basketball players anymore!\"<br>\r\n\"I guess that could be harder for you, but I bet it's impossible for them to steal it from your long arms.\"<br>\r\n\"...Maybe... but what about everything else? I won't be able to fit in a car, bus, elevator or plane never again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaichi couldn't deny that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you have a point\"<br>\r\n\"I hardly fit in this apartment. What would I do if I hit another growth spurt? We have to see Izzy to reverse the experiment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Maybe inverting the growth would be... dangerous? 'Stopping the growth' sounds like a much better idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai didn't like the idea of becoming smaller, no after he experienced the strength of his new form, and the greatly improved sensibility and stamina of his over 50cm (20 inches) hard manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru ignored his lustful comments and searched for the basketball  shorts he was wearing when he went home.<br>\r\nThen they were very tight, but after this sexual growth spurt they looked like doll clothing in his hands. There was no way his thicker legs, butt, waist and  enlarged cock to fit in it without bursting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there wasn't any clothing in that apartment which could fit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could wear it.\" Said Taichi.<br>\r\n\"But what about me...? I don't want to go outside in the nude!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tai said that he was joking, but TK had taken it seriously. He looked like he was about to cry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I have an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaichi went to Takeru's father's bedroom and came back with a bed sheet of his double bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can wear it like it was a towel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good idea. He tied it around his waist and it covered most of his long legs. He still seemed ridiculous wearing that, but he would no longer be an exhibitionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to Izzy's. He must be still working in his office\"<br>\r\n\"What about the bathroom...?\" Taichi said, pointing to the liters of cum that covered the four walls, the floor and even the ceiling.<br>\r\n\"My dad probably won't come back until a few hours. I'll ask my brother to clean this mess for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first hardship in his journey was the bathroom door frame. He was already too tall to that room, so the door frame was much lower than his pecs, a little higher than his navel. He knelt and bent down his back to try to pass through, but the he discovered another dimension of his problem: His shoulders were too broad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a whole minute of twisting, he managed to cross the door. But there were a few more doors to be gone through before he could go outside.<br>\r\nTK feared the pedestrian's reaction to his half-nudity, but once he was there no one cared much about the two boys (except for some lusting peeks from some women). Fortunatelly, the normality aura they had was attenuating their reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they reached Izzy's office. The workaholic digidestined was there, like always, working in something, but he didn't mind to put aside that project when he saw how much his lab rats had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect this could happen... You were the first ones testing the treatment... I wasn't sure how much digi-energy you needed, and you ended up getting to much\"<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you warn us about that??\" Takeru was clearly angry.<br>\r\n\"I did it. Multiple times. But you were too obsessed with the idea of getting big you didn't pay attention, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... It might be true...\" The blond titan admitted after recalling there was a long, boring talk about the details and dangers of the test. \"But I don't wan't to be so big. Can you change us back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Can you change <b><u>you </u></b>back' \" Mumbled Taichi, who was pretty satisfied with the results. \"Or don't change us at all\" He added, because he loved Takeru's gigantic form. Of course, no one actually heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I have to do some reseach, but I think the transformation are irreversible. I think it should be stabilizing and you won't growth much more... but I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK's face turned pale. Taichi grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did this big guy grow so much, so fast?\" Taichi asked as he hugged Takeru's back. \"He was originally smaller than me.\"<br>\r\n\"Yesterday... mayyybe I used a second digi-patch for a few minutes...\" Takeru admitted ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was stupid... but I think that isn't the main cause of your extreme growth. You were smaller than Tai, but because you are younger. I have just ran a test, and the results reveal that you have a great genetic potential...\"<br>\r\n\"Genetic potential? For what?\"<br>\r\n\"For growing. I meant you were a late bloomer. You were going to hit various growth spurts in the next years and probably you were going to become a really tall guy, probably over 2 meters tall (6'8\"). The treatment has taken all that potential and amplified a lot...\"<br>\r\n\"So I didn't really need the treatment to begin with...\" Takeru had never felt so stupid in his whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep investigating, maybe I'll find some way to interrupt the growth... until that, I can only do this other thing for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy pressed a button and a blue light covered their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've strengthened your digital auras of normality. Now, no matter how big you become or how naked you are, no one will find it strange\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that'll fix our clothing problem...\" Taichi thanked him as he was walking to Takeru's back \"but there's another thing I want to discuss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the sheet Takeru was wearing to hide his private parts and untie it, falling to the floor and exposing his humungous, uncut, flacid cock. A 42cm long and considerably thick meat tube. Takeru tried to cover it up with his hands, but it was too long for that even with his two huge hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAI!!\"<br>\r\n\"It's amazing, don't you think, Izzy?\" His small friend remained speechless, blushing. \"Mine has improved too\" He pulled down his tight shorts and showed him a 31cm long flaccid penis, which was tanner than his friend's. \"The bigger they get, the more sensitive they become, and the orgasms become more powerful and longer ... I'm not going to complain about that... but the last time we grew, TK's dick almost impaled me. Do you have a solution for that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy started to type a small program in his computer. When he finished, he pressed ENTER and another blue light surrounded their cocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tingled, and that single sensation was enough to make them hard again, rising to a length of 70cm (28\") and 53cm (21\"). Their owners had to restrain themselves to avoid masturbating in front of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Digi-cock app activated\" The computer announced.<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n\"It's another 'magic aura'. This one protects the insides of the penetrated body. It makes any tissue in touch with the cock elastic. Muscles, bones... nothing will break due to the pressure of a giant cock... They only deform temporally. It also eliminates any pain from the anal sex.\"<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what I was looking for! Thanks, Izzy\"</span></div></div>",

TK on the other hand, despite being 57 cm taller, and bulkier was trying to seem as small as possible, a nearly impossible feet given the 70 cm (28\u201d) jutting from his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 uh,\u201d TK stammered out, obviously still suffering a bit from his lack of confidence, \u201cshould we head to the bedroom.\u201d Tai only grinned as he walked over, grabbed TK by his shoulders and pulled him down into a kiss. TK could only stare wide-eyed in shock as he tried to register what was going on. Before he felt like he was going to suffocate, Tai broke it, and shoved TK onto a nearby couch, This time, the back of the couch barely came to above TK\u2019s waist, his butt nearly halfway up it, as he sat there spread eagle, Tai staring at him intensely as he bent down to grab TK\u2019s cock, TK hissing at the rough touch of his calloused hands.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wait?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBu-but, we\u2019ll make a mess!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares? Izzy won\u2019t mind. I know it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Izzy really didn\u2019t mind as he continued typing on his computer as he finished his program and pressed enter. With a clink of some nearby machinery, and a hiss of steam, the apparatus opened up to reveal his latest patch. Grinning happily, he grabbed the patch gently, holing it up to the light and admiring the transparency. This was in part why he helped Tai and TK, they were perfect for setting this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic of data is that it can be copied easily, literally creating something from nothing, a physical anomaly, but one not limited by data. By copying the data and thus it\u2019s effects for Tai and TK, so whenever they grow, the effect is copied on him. The reasons he used both Tai and TK were that they both had high growth potential. When Izzy first started this project, it was with the hope that he could use it to grow more, but it didn\u2019t work due to his low growth potential. It took him a few weeks, but he figured out which of the digidestined had the highest growth potential, and use it to enhance himself. When he found both Tai and TK had golden amounts of it, he had to use both, and the fact TK used two of the original patches made it even better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven better was that it was able to copy whatever pleasure was going on between the two as well. Shouldn\u2019t be anything going on yet he thought as he slapped it on his neck. \u201cUGH!\u201d He very quickly found he was wrong in that opinion, as he felt a wet feeling surround his cock at the same time as he felt a sliding sensation, as if someone was jerking him off at the same time. His 13 cm cock was hard instantly, making a semi-decent bulge in his pants. \u201cThey got to work faster than I thought hehe. Ah! Just what are they doing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the main room, TK\u2019s head was tilted back, mouth open in a silent \u2018oh\u2019 as Tai leaned forward, mouth enveloping his 70 (28\u201d) cm cock. Unlike Matt though, Tai\u2019s mouth was large enough for his prodigious manhood, and TK couldn\u2019t stand the tight, wet hole it presented. Moving his tongue over, Tai teased TK\u2019s swollen head, and swirled around it, making TK clench harder on the couch, absolutely crushing the arm in his hand. Tai\u2019s other hand was busy stroking his own cock, enjoying the grip behind it.<br>\r\n\u201cT-Tai, it-it\u2019s happening again!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHu-hghck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai gagged out, eyes widening for once when TK\u2019s cock lurched inside of his mouth, suddenly expanding and lengthening once more as the digi-effect continued once more. He tried to pull back, but out of reflex, TK\u2019s hands shot forward and dug into his hair, forcing him even further down. 70 cm\u2026 79 cm\u2026 91 cm\u2026 104 cm (41\u201d)! Tai was gagging, but he realized with a start that it wasn\u2019t hurting, even as his hand reached up to feel his throat, feeling it stretching without almost any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy was cleaning onto his rolling chair as hard as he could, feeling his crotch warming up significantly. Drool leaking out of the side of his mouth, he looked down to see his bulge expanding. He grunted as cm after cm rolled out of his groin. 13 cm\u2026 22 cm\u2026 34 cm\u2026 47 cm\u2026 (19\u201d)! He maneuvered his cock downwards so it didn\u2019t actually rip his pants, but it formed a long, thick tube down his leg. \u201cHehe, now this I can use!\u201d He smiled, as a thick, dark stain spread across his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slurps and gagging of Tai could be heard throughout the room, along with TK\u2019s moans and gasps. As he was trying to catch his breath, he felt that warm feeling pouring through him as well. One hand reached up to feel his pecs expanding, becoming thick globes sticking a couple inches out from his chest, even as he felt his chest tighten, his 6 pack becoming an impressive cobblestone road of an 8 pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his muscles quickly followed suit, his lats expanding as his back became an impressive wall of muscle. He suddenly found his hand gripping a lot more of his cock as he felt his hands and feet elongate, followed by his limbs, and torso. Of course, he also knew what they say about big hands. He moaned as much as he could with a giant cock in his mouth, as he felt his hand get forced apart by his expanding manhood. 53 cm\u2026 59 cm\u2026 65 cm\u2026 74 cm (29\u201d)! He could feel his balls filling his sack more, dragging it even lower down, gurgling with his seed. He barely could even think, overwhelmed by the pleasure, even as he moved his hand up, teasing TK\u2019s hole with his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy however was enjoying this as he felt his heartbeat accelerate. Gripping his armrest, he watched with amazement as he felt his pecs increase just a little bit, the buttons flying off from his shirt as he saw the bare flesh underneath. Lifting his shirt up, he watched as his stomach seemed to ripple, tightening up into the beginnings of an impressive pack, moaning as he felt his pants run up to mid-calf, even as the cuff ripped apart, his height finally above a regular person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final part hit him hard though, but he couldn\u2019t complain. 47 cm\u2026 53 cm\u2026 59 cm\u2026 68 cm (27\u201d)! He was almost as big as TK was now! His pants couldn\u2019t take it though, and his leg ripped completely through, his prodigious cock reaching up almost under his chin. He couldn\u2019t resist though, as he leaned down, leaking the head of his cock, enjoying the sweet taste he thought he\u2019d never have. \u201cBest\u2026 experiment\u2026 ever!\u201d</span></div></div>",

He started thrusting his hips forward, he was definitely enjoying this, even as TK started feeling warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK felt his back starting to press more against the ceiling more, even as his feet pressed more against the wall. \"Tai, I'm growing again!\" He shouted. He really shouldn't have taken that second treatment! He felt another spurt centering in his front, while the ceiling started to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened as he realized what was going to happen. \"Tai, move!\" He shouted, as his back broke through the ceiling, bones cracking as they elongated. His body locked up as his muscles went through their own growth spurt, veins throbbing as they forced more blood through. Of course, that wasn't what he was warning Tai about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Tai shouted, as a sudden spurt clocked him right in the jaw. 70 cm... 78 cm... 89 cm... 108 cm...  132 cm...  and still growing. Tai watched as TK continued growing. TK started panted heavily, as his panic escalated  He was pretty glad it was a two story house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap crap crap!\" TK shouted, as the rest of his upper torso finished breaking through, having shot up swiftly to 426 cm (14 ft). Tai was panting, feeling TK's cock growing still as well, the warm sensation of it rubbing against him driving him insane. Drool was leaking out of the side of TK's mouth as he could feel the growth accelerating, meat pouring out of his crotch rapidly, finally petering out at close to 176 cm (69 inches), taller than he was formerly at regular size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I done...\" He muttered.</span></div></div>",

He looked down at his cock head to see Tai was licking at the top, a small red area where the first growth had whacked him in the jaw, and a giant smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tai, what are you doing!\"<br>\r\n\"Hehe, isn't it obvious!

His 53 cm (21 in) shuddered as his cheeks tightened in pleasure. 53 cm came and went as TK went stiff, feeling the rod within lengthening. Tai could feel the tube tightening around his manhood, thrusting in with each spurt of growth. And this was a violent one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK tried to move, but Tai was too far in, Any efforts to dislodge him only seemed to make him drive further. 53 cm... 61 cm... 74 cm.... Tai could feel another growth spurt, but he tried to concentrate as much as he could, to make sure TK could enjoy the brink of it as he gripped TK's cock, fingers digging his growing fingers into the head even as veins popped all over his body, muscles growing thicker and thicker on his body due to him trying to channel his growth into his front. And so it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n126 cm.... (50 in)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK felt the expansion, and so the band grew as tight as it could.

The Bakery was closed on this day, with Mr and Mrs. Matsuki on a date while their son remained home. The bakerys kitchen that should be empty was instead filled with the heat of cooking bread. The Ovens contents pulled out as the second batch was put in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brown haired youth in a blue shirt wore an apron and hair net as he went to work making more honey bread. Water, yeast, and honey stirring together in the bowl before adding flour, salt, and vegetable oil into the contents. He smiled as he slowly added small amounts of all-purpose flour every few minute. \"That's finished. Now on to the next part.\" Finished with the mixing, Takato pulled his D-Power out of his pocket and a Blue Card. Swiping the card through the device, the glow of digital power transferred to the dough <i>Can't wait till Henry tries this.</i> Takato cheerfully thought as he began pouring the dough across a flat surface, kneading it with tender care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good thing I sent Guilmon over to play with Terriermon. He'd be eating the finished product right now.</i> The black, white, and red saurian digimon had been sent away to play to keep him from eating all the finished baked goods. <i>He'd ruin my surprise.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the kneading was finished Takato placed the dough into an oiled bowl, turning to spread the oil before letting the dough rise in a nearby warm spot. \"I've gotten really inspired by that dream last night.\" he rubbed his head as he thought back to that weird dream he had the night before. His body massive in size and bIg enough to hold a building in his hand. Henry, Terriermon, and Guilmon in the palm of his colossal hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato didn't know why but he had felt nice when dreaming about it. When he awoke a blue card that seemed to be called by his wish lay next to him, an unseen Digignome flying outside his room. Recalling that dream is why he's made lots of bread, feeling as if it was natural to use the blue card on it. With his thoughts over, Takato knew it was time to start punching the dough, which had finished its increase in bulk. Punching it, Takato began shaping the dough into four pans. The preparation for them being cooked in the oven, the second batch finishing with a ding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the four loaves out and placed them with the other four, \"Now for the last batch\" Placing the remaining ones into the oven, awaiting the tim till completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that it's almost done Henry and Guilmon will be here soon since I asked them to be here by 3. I should try some.\" Looking over to the cooled 1st batch, Takato pulled out one loaf and begam cutting it with a knife. The loaf cut into 14 nice little slices. Taking one, the timid brown haired boy ate one slice. \"Mmm~ that was better than I expected. I. I guessed it would come out a bit worse than this.\" Takato had helped his family from time to time, but he never practiced it enough to be a master of it. He slowly finished eating down to the last crumb, oblivious to his bodys change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm feeling flowed through his body as his stomach broke down the bread, his stomach dimly glowed beneath his blue shirt as the intestinesc was absorbing all the broken down material into his body. Not a single scrap left unabsorbed. <i>I'll try the next slice with some cream cheese. This bread is amazing.</i></span></div></div>",

Mom and dad really need to get a better one for our bakery...\" Takato muttered, tapping his foot impatiently as he waited for the timer to finish, as he leaned back, crossing his arms behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*rip*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato blinked, trying to figure out what the sound was, turning his head back and forth as he tried to figure out where that small ripping sound came from. \"What was that?\" He asked, idly touching his sleeve, although he noticed that it felt awkward. \"Huh?\" looking down he was surprised that it was ripped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that happen?\" He asked, feeling the torn edges. He thought it was weird how tight it fit around his arms. They didn't look any different, but he did think they they seemed thicker than he remembered. He looked down to see how faded it was, and realized, 'Whoops I wore an older jacket!' He thought. That must be why it ripped so easily, he figured, unaware of anything seeming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the small piece of toast wasn't enough to create any significant change, but it was the start of a very beginning. Underneath Takato's shirt, there wasn't a significant increase in definition yet, but for what he did have it was providing a stable base for what was to come, strengthening his base muscles and bones, preparing him for what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Takato didn't know or care about that, as he took a bite out of his toast. \"Huh, that's actually pretty good!\" He said between bites, walking up to his room to change his jacket.</span></div></div>",

His shoes burst as his feet grew too large for them, the sound of cracking bone heard as he wiggled his toes, looking down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was growing taller too, his shirt barely coming to his stomach as his chair started groaning under the growing weight, the back of shorts a bit tight as his ass grew in tight muscle. Between his legs, he was having other issues as well, his thighs were competing for space, and, gritting his teeth, he looked at how much his bulge was swelling, making it a three-way competition, the base sticking out as it pulled the lip of his shorts and boxers down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward, the motion ripping the back of his shirt, the rippling muscle of his back, a nice V-shape in the back.

You?\" Takato saw Henry shake his head. \"Maybe it was Rika or Jeri?\" Takato's suggestion was also unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that thinking about it was getting them nowhere, Henry changed the subject \"For now let's get to somewhere with more room. This place is too-*GRRRR*\" The sound of a primal need for nourishment erupted from boths abdomens. The growl made both tamers awkwardly smile as they pat their abs. The desire for food came suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to eat another loaf?\" Takato asked his guest.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" They both eyed the remaining six loaves. Their appetite amplified by their growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen another *GRRRR* emerged the two flustered more as Henry reached for a knife. \"Don't worry about adding anything else. Just enjoy it\" Takato said as he grabbed his own. With less than two bites he had consumed it whole, crumbs falling as he swallowed instantly. Once the first was done he moved to the next as the crumbs from his bites fell upon the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Takato eat so quickly made Henry put the knife down. He'd enjoy it just like Takato is. Grabbing a loaf with one hand he hungrily took a bite, chewing as fast as possible before swallowing. He licked his lips, loving the bread his friend made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the three loaves eaten by each were gone, swiftly travelling down their gullets to their ravenous pits to be digested. To make them both even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!

Takato flushed from embarassment as his friend moved his hands towards Takato's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look nice like this\" Henry said as he got as close as possible, lovingly caressing Takato's larger obliques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too\"</span></div></div>",

His eyes observed charcoal deep markings began to slowly emerge upon Takatos skin. The brown haired boy oblivious to the changes as he cheerfully wiped crumbs from his lips and let out a \"Sigh....\" of satisfaction. The markings getting ever more visible across his skin as they began to take form as proper shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriangles on his deltoids, hands, feet, and forehead. Black circular bands on his forearms and thighs. Two boomerang shaped marks below the eyes. Finally followed by the emergence of four triangles connected with a duller circle around the points where the four touch on his chest. Henry, fascinated by the sight before him and wondering what was going on, reached for Takato's bigger pecs as he touched the hard muscle of that beautiful canyon. Thick fingers softly caressing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato's eyes opened wide as he was awakened from his temporary stupor. Cheeks flushing as he saw the leaner Chinese boy touching his pecs. \"H-Henry! What are you doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing both pecs with his hands, awakening a stiffled *Groan* from the bulkier Takato. \"Your skin is changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" Looking down, he saw the same markings as....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The marks I gave Guilmon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It must be a side effect of all the bread you ate.\" His eyes focuse as spreading out from the chest marks was chalk white...skin? White moved to fill the space as his jutting pecs and slowly trailed down to cover his abs and deep into his shorts. Both realizing the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm changing more aren't I?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes. Look your arm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving a hand to Takato's arm, he lifted it from his side to show his tanned skin seemed to be getting darker. Specifically of a dark red tint.

Otherwise these changes should be more...extreme.\" His skin from his face to his toes turned more and more red as the white of his chest completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brown eyes looked longingly into Henry as they began to turn from brown to gold, earlobes making a *Squelch* noise as they became long fin shaped like mini-dragon wings, sticking out from the side between still brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments the changes appeared to have stopped. Nothing major beyond his outer appearance changed. Both boys sighed with relief. Though it was not to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness it didn't get worse. We need to figure out why we've changed Takato.\"<br>\r\n\"...mon\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"My name is Takatomon.\" Takatomon didn't think twice to why he'd declare himself that. It just felt....natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrys eyes widened in concern as he began touching the hulking red mini giant muscles. Squeezing and touching to feel if something else was different. Fingers dancing across skin as he squeezed biceps, thighs, lats, calves. Takatomon, who eyed his actions and was starting to think Henry wanted to feel him up for...other reasons happily flexed the muscles Henry touched each time, causing the muscle to bulge out bigger than should be possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's minor but his skin looks like its still smooth, yet feels like the rough hide of a lizard. Even his muscles feel denser despite being bigger than me as is. </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakatomon felt a rush of desire pushing through as his cock, the big rod hanging out of his shorts, to began to stiffen as Henry felt him up, rising up across abs. He wanted something far more intimate and his desire for it was overwhelming. His mind losing some control over primitive desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Takatomon pulled Henry into his pecs. The bigger chest smothering Henrys face as Takatomon happily brought a hand into his hair to ruffle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tak-mmmf-efm!\" Mouth smothered by the big chest as he tried to get loose, the now partly dinoboy was looking down, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry~ I want to do something special with the two of us~\" Cock erected to full mast, pressing itself between the two as it squeezed for room. Henrys face turned bright red. Realizing that Takatomons inhibitions have been screwed as well and now was not the time to admit such feelings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet only \"Mmmmfffs\" were heard from the Chinese tamer, unable to vocalize as a thick rod pressed into his chin from below as its owner shoved him happily into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gotta think fast</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. They are stopped as Takatomon feels a sharp pain above his posterior. A newly grown tail emerges. Regainig his senses and awkwardness ensues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Takatomon gets a special move that releases hormones into the air, making Henry give in as they kiss and begin to make love. Growing bigger than ever.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a day since the defeat of Musclemon. Yujin was at his home, sitting on his bed while holding his Applidriver DUO in his right hand. Offmon was sitting next to him, chewing on the blankets. ''I need to find a way to become stronger protect Haru. I don't want to lose my friend because of my weakness.'' His thoughts in self-depreciation as he pulled out a chip from his pocket with his left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYujin looked down at the chip as he held it open in the palm of his hands. '<i>'I know Musclemon is the key, but I'm unsure of how to utilize him properly. I can't rely on him to try to teach me.\"</i> Yukon thought back to Musclemons humiliating fight, where his attempts to show off his strength boosting made him insignificantly stronger by a few points, and Musclemon lost without even a proper fight. \"Wait that's it.\" Yujin said aloud as he he recalls the Net Ocean, Offmon looking up from his spot to stare at Yuujin while continuing to chew the bedsheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put Musclemon into the Apllidriver as the device activated \"APPLIARISE!\" The device yelled in its usual hammy tone as the chip came to life, giving form to the AI stored within. \"Oh Yuujin.\" The Ball with massive arms spoke as he flexed his biceps. \"Is there something you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Is there an island in the Net Ocean where one can get stronger?\" Yukon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed there is! I was quite famous for my feats of strength there y'know!\" Musclemon tried to say with an impressive flex, but Yujin ignores it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you send the location to my phone?\" Yukon has asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" The Applimon briefly entered Yuujins phone to set the location in map app, while downloading unnecessary training apps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>''Best delete those later'' </i> Yujin nonchalantly thought as Musclemon exited the App.  The Appmon was sweaty as if he had worked out, looking proud of his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. Now let me take you there and we'll get you a workout sch-\" Musclemon was unable to finish his sentence as Yujin removes him from the Applidriver. A look of shock on Musclemons face as he is put back into Yujins pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the hard work Musclemon.\" He said with a smile. Looking at Offmon, Yujin pat him affectionately on the head.  \"We're going on a trip to the Net Ocean Offmon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffmon removed the sheet from his mouth to speak \"Okay Yujin.\" Offmon jumped into Yujins arms as they headed off from Yujins house to enter the Net Ocean through the AR-Field. Yukon thought about calling Hari, but felt his plans didn't need to worry Haru as they found a nice spot to enter the Net Ocean several blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>--15 Minutes Later--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yujin and Offmon  had been flying through the digital water for some time, passing by numerous islands networked up to earth and those closer to the Deep Web. It had surprised Yujin had isolated this island was compared to the others according to the location Musclemon gave, but it didn't matter as long as he arrived soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Yukon called to Offmon who floated nearby as they saw an island with a giant faceless, buff statue and smaller ones carved in the shape of exercise equipment, from bronze dumbbell to  silver treadmill.As they moved closer he could  see homes were built into each. \"Does seem like the kind of place Musclemon would live doesn't it?\" He  said to Offmon as the shy Appmon moved to ride on Yujins head once gravity took effect, the two landing gently on the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked around as they saw Coach, Muscle, Dosuko, and more Appmons around. Each one performing different tasks or training to become better Appmons. \"Now let's find the best means to train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wandered around, looking at different extreme exercise equipment the Appmons use while Coachmon tells at them to do better with their burning passion. He saw a massive dumbbell that wasn't in use nor any Appmons nearby, with a sign nearby. He walked over and read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> \"Worlds heaviest barbell. 1000 pounds.\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes. I can't believe anyone would try that.\" He thought aloud. He wasn't sure if these Appmon were crazy or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you try it'll work out?\" Offmon  questioned as he looked around, seeing a stand  with shakes across the street. \"Or maybe you can try the Protein Shakes over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shakes?\" Puzzles by it, Yuujin walked over to see a Musclemon making a series of different shakes, with a sign above that reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"Power In A Single Drop! Try A Super Musclemona Muscleshake!\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not, but I do need to try something here so the tript isn't a waste.\"  Yujin looked at some other spots to see if there were better alternatives, sonlyneeing that while not as ridiculous the exercises use inhuman levels of weight and weird protein shakes. \"Well looks like it's all weird stuff. So what do you think I should try Offmon?\"</span></div></div>",

He wandered aimlessly to find something that would be fun and interesting to waste time until his partner comes home. after about an half an hour of walking, Agumon stumbled upon something odd. It was a small shop in the middle of the woods. It had a sign on top of the roof saying \"Digi-Fitness\", indicating that it was some kind of health care store. There was also a small picket sign outside saying \"Grand Opening\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then decided to go in and check it out. As he entered, he saw the store owner, a slightly slim AeroVeedramon, behind the counter who took notice of Agumon's arrival. \"Ah, a customer! My first one too!\" the blue dragon said. \"Since you're the first you can have one item in this store for free! Come to me if you need anything.\" \"Okay, thanks!\" Agumon replied as then took started to take a look around the store. He did find some amusing stuff, but still couldn't decide what to get so he then asked store owner for some help. \"Um, do you have anything in the back?\" \"Of course.\" said the AeroVeedramon as he went to the back room. He then returned with a big grey box with the label Bulk Bars: Beef Up with Every Bite!. There were about 48 bars in total with 3 assorted flavors; peanut butter and chocolate, apple cinnamon, and raisin. \"These are recently new and experimental in the market right now. So do you want them?\" Agumon then thought hard. He was really curious about what he would look like as a muscular mon, and to be very strong. So why not take the opportunity to see if they work? Besides, they were free! Agumon then agreed on taking the product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith box in tow, he said goodbye to the store owner and headed back home which took about 15 minutes since thankfully, there was a TV portal nearby the store. Once he arrived home, he looked at the time on the clock in the kitchen which said it was practically 12 noon lunchtime, and he started to get pretty hungry. Then he set the box on the kitchen counter and opened it. He looked at all the bars, and couldn't wait to try them. He then ate.....</span></div></div>",

It was advertising something called DigiMuscle Wear, underwear that can gives you muscles just by wearing it. There were two pairs of red underwear and two pairs of panties in one package. It was weird that something from the Digiworld to be advertised in the real world. However, It did fairly intrigued him and he had wonder what it would be like to have hulking muscles. Also, it was free! He thought it was a bit sketchy, but he didn't thought about that too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then clicked on the ad which led to another pop up window asking for personal information and address. After filling the e-form, he pressed enter. Then, there was a loading screen strangely saying, \"Delivering your product...\" After a few moments, it finished loading with another pop up message saying, \"Delivery Complete!\" Suddenly, a very bright flash came from the monitor blinding him for a minute. After the light faded, he found a package on his lap. It surprised him that the product would come this way. He took the package and set it on the bed. He opened it up to reveal the contents which were described in the ad, two pairs of red underwear and two pairs of red panties. He then took one of the red underwear and immediately put it on, anticipating if it can really works.

The doctors had warned him anymore overuse of One for All would destroy his arms completely, but this could change all that. \"Then I can catch up with Kacchan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rival Bakugou Katsuki, who used an exploding Quirk made from his nitroglycerin sweat had bested him in their last fight, and Deku vowed he he'd catch up and beat him, to Bakugou's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a bag to carry it in Deku left UA High and headed to buy from Chikara Mugen. As he was leaving Iida had called out to him. \"Deku! Remember to get back before nighttime!\" Iida had called out, doing a weird, robotic gesture with left hand going up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Deku waved back as he left, getting on a bus to find the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the hour and a half trip Deku went over what he could possibly do with greater control of OfA, maybe even using a Full Cowl that isn't so limited or taxing, to increasing the limit of power he gets. His mind swirled with possible ideas as the bus arrived. Deku exited, walking towards the small store he knew was his target, cramped between two larger businesses. The place wasn't as well kept as the pictures online suggested, but he didn't let that bother him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Deku entered he saw all manner of weightlifting tools, amulets, ancient looking artifacts, and more stuff to the brim around the store. \"A bunch of interesting looking things\" he thought aloud as he reached out to touch a statue of a wolf nearb, only to jerk his hand back when the statues head moved up to bite with sharp teeth made of precious gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to get hurt by accident Deku began looking around for the drinks stored within. He saw them nestled together under a larger shelf filled with Astral themed artefacts. \"There it is!\" He grabbed a pack of gold elixir sealed in crystal bottles called \"Quirk Control Lacertus Gigas\". He was unsure what the last part of the name meant, but he assumed it was related to its function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku went up to the regist, only now noticing the lack of a clerk. The sign on the register  only says \"Leave money and name of product\". Deku was unsure of why they'd not properly attend the shop considering the quirks that can easily steal from them, but he needed to get back before it gets dark and the teachers punish him. \"Sorry\" he apologized while leaving some money next to the register, placing the elixir in the bag before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurried to the bus and left for school. He thankfully arrived just in time, but Eraserhead was waiting at the gate. \"Next time don't get back when curfew is about to start. Makes more work for us.\" Eraerhead grumbled before heading inside. Deku gave a bow before heading for the dorms and heading straight for his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kaminari nearby with a look of stupidity plastered across with his thumbs up, spouting \"Wheyyyyy.....\" as he moved his arms back and forth in his current state brought about in his laast skirmish with Kirishima to penetrate his skin. Kirishima's body, however, had hardened to his strongest point as Red Riot Unbreakable. Every bit of his skin, teeth, hair, even eyes, sharpened into a living blade with protrusions that seeve as sword and shield. Now protecting him in conflict with his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou showed off his teeth in a cocky smile as he casually stretched his arm during their training. \"I hope you aren't finished yet. I haven't even started .\" Moving into a aggressivd position as tiny eruptions popped up across his palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah....Not yet..hah....I hVen't shown you a fraction....hah...of my strength Bakugou...\" Kirishima lied as exhaustion was wearing away his hardest state. Thirty Minutes of battle that devolved into a test of endurance that was in Bakugous favor over whose quirk would give out first. He raised his sharp arms, the tips of his fingers joints slowly losing their sharpened edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou smiled proudly at Kirishimas resolve \"That's what I expect! Now DIE!\" Bakuogu charge forth as he set off two massive blasts to fly straight toward Kirishima! Kirishima closed his fists to ready a punch when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Past your curfew! Go to the dorms!\" Yelled the dark haired Aizawa with his eyes wide and hair flying up. Bakugou landed flat on his face with a anticlimatic splat! Kirishima sighing with relief as Kaminari continued to \"Wheyyyy.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou raised his face from the floor \"Dammit! Aizawa sensei let me kill Kirishima first!\"<br>\r\n\"No. You three got personal time to train. Take any longer and Class will file me complaints of favoritism.\" The dreary and near exhausted man sighed as he as he quietly left the building. Bakugou gritted his teeth in frustration that a good fight was ended so abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his quirk turned off Kirishimas hardened form return to soft and smooth, the fit hero in training looking down to notice his shirt had been tore and little remained to cover her abs. He sighed with relief as the battle ended the way it did. \"Should have worn my hero costume.\" He walked over to Bakugou and held out his hand. \"Nice fight man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou grabbed the hand with his strong grip. \"Too bad we got blueballed. I was totally ready to kill you.\" Bakugou frowned as he stood up with Kirishimas aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Thanks for training with me. You and Kaminaris aid Im sure helped me so Im positive I can transform longer.\" Kirishima had a toothy grin as he headed over to grab Kaminari's arm, still going \"Wheyyyyy.....\" as they head for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta train your body if you want to train your quirk.\" Bakugou. Walked beside the spiky red head as the three exited the training facility. \"I know something that might help you train easier Kirishima.\" <br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n\"There's some methods I saw online to help toughen quirk users that armor their bodies. I'll take you tomorrow.\" Bakugou sagged as hs walked with hands in his pants, careful to keep the money he had on him stashed away. He knew how much it ate Kirishima on the inside to feel weak or boring. Though he'd never say it upfront.v<br>\r\n\"Thanks man.\" Kirishima gave a toothy grin that showed off his shark teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither would expect <i>exactly</i> the effects Bakugous plan had in mind.</span></div></div>",

The kind, white haired Rei Todoroki was happy for his latest visit, the two passing time talking and watching movies. Alas, all things must end, especially for a boy who needs to return to his dorms or be punished. The sky crimson as the star descends on the horizon, curfew starting soon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Shoto!\" A white haired, stocky college student called out,  smiling as he headed to the wards emtrance. \"So you came to see mom today too. Lucky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu. Yeah I spent the day with her.\" Todoroki replied, the side of his lips tipping up as he saw his older brother, Natsuo Todoroki, whom he has rarely interacted with in the past due to their father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man the three of us could have hanged out! Though I got super busy with schoolwork and had to wait till now.\" Natsuo grimaced as he remembered rows of papers he had to finish for classes. \"Let me know next time you come see mom. I'll come too if I can!\" Natsuo slid an arm around Todoroki as he smiled, Todorokis lips creeping up into more of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Natsuo's eyes went wide as he...\"OH! That's right! I got something to give ya Shoto!\" Natsuo called as he moved to a bag on his side, opening it to take something out. The content removed was a.... Weird object. It resembled a gun. But the tip looked like it was made to prick skin than shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n\"This is an invention my friend made. He makes all kinds of crazy stuff in his spare time. He wanted me to test it, but I think a huge college student would be pretty easy to notice.\" He flexed his arms beneath his jacket, showing off to his more slender younger bro.<br>\r\n\"So it works like an augmentation quirk?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. This converts element based quirks into power for the body. Enhances <i>everything</i> when you do it. Watch this\" He pointed the tip at himself, pressing the button as he let loose a bit of ice, much smaller and weaker than his younger bro, to a *ZING*. Whirring hum came forth as an unseen beam made contact with his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsuo's already firm body thickened as flesh flushed red despite the ice hes producing. \"Yeah...this feels so good.\" Jeans tightened as the hem  moved up to expose thicker calves. Chest pushing out against shirt and jacket, exposong more of his pecs at the top. Neck throbbing as it bulged bigger, shoulders pushing wider, abs carving into place as the shirt rose up to give a peak at the bottom. The cuffs of his jacket exposing wrists throbbing with mass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodoroki took in the sight as he saw his brothers body inch higher. One...two...three... He wanted to see how big his brother could get. Sadly, Natsu started shaking his head, fingers pressing button on the device as a *DING* stopped. The hum slowly died as his skin returned to normal.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hah.....so great.\" Natsu instinctively flexed a bicep, feeling his jacket stretch *GROAN*, cloth struggling against mass. Easily having grown six inches thanks to the virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Was all Shoto could proclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right!? I was in awe myself when I saw it first in action on a guy with a mud quirk.\" He stopped showing off as he moved his hand with the tool to Todoroki. \"Now its yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Todoroki hand shook for a second, but his stoic appearance hid his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! When I think of you out there fighting villains, why wouldn't I want you to be able to protect yourself if you need to in a pinch?\" Natsuo smiled at his yonger brother, patting him on the head with bigger hands than he had before the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Natsu.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem! Though don't let dad learn about it. The world doesn't need him to be as big as his ego.\"<br>\r\n\"I won't even let Fuyumi know.\" Todoroki smiled, amused at the idea of making their father a toy in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made sure to not inform her myself. She'll definitely tell him .\" Natsuo shared the sentiment. Seeing the sky turning dark, Natsuo decided it was time. \"Well I gotta go for now. I want to see mom before they close off visiting hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom will be happy to see you.\" Smiling, the two waved as Natsuo entered the Ward, Todoroki heading to the trains to head back to his residence at the UA Dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device held tightly as crowds gathered around him, fillling every space of the coach, awaiting the moment he reached U.A.....</span></div></div>",

He stood in front of the principals desk, where a scarred faced mouse dressed in a fine suit sat in the chair, moving his paw to grab a cup of coffee to take a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I've heard your concerns before Aizawa. I will not change my mind on this!\" the mouse in the fine suit put the cup down. He moved to go through a file of papers as they conversed \"We need extra security to keep the students safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still disagree. Especially with the student you've chosen.\" Tired eyes shooting darts into Nezu as he gazed at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no fear Aizawa. Iida Tenya will be perfect for this job.\" A blonde man, skeletal in appearance despite his healthy skin with a pointed chin and jaw, spoke up from his seat next to Aizawa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is not prepared to handle such responsibility. Iida not only tried to get revenge, but chose to help Midoriya save Bakugou instead of stopping him. Yet you want him to become extra muscle to keep students safe?\" Aizawa shook his head. Feeling his words will fall on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. He has made such mistakes in the past, but its clear from his hard work for Class 1-A as President, and his concern for his fellow classmates, that he will do whatever it takes to keep his fellow students safe. Once he undergoes the process even keeping Izuku Midoriya out of trouble will be possible. \" Nezu confidantly proclaimed as he put the file up with others on his desk, moving to pull out a bluish liquid. \"All Mights already shown to favor him a lot as is, so we need someone who won't enable his worse traits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SHIVER* The skeletal All Might, Toshinori Yagi, had hoped no one had caught on to that who wasn't in the know of their secret. <i>\"I'm not sure keeping him out of trouble will work considering Midoriya has inherited my quirk.\"</i> But those thoughts were only for himself. \"Yes. Iida will certainly keep Midoriya pacified if he takes it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've already had his parents do an evaluation on him to see if he's stable <i>and</i> his parents have already given their permission. All we need is his personal consent to ingest this special liquid.\" He moved the vial between his paws as he talked. \"Getting the Scandinavian Growth Hero, Big Feeder, to produce special growth hormones for people isn't easy or cheap. He spends a good deal of time having to ingest the DNA of what he'll use to make said hormone. Lucky for us there was a stash of Iida's DNA given up by his parents for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa let out a *Huff* as he accepted they weren't going to agree with him. \"Very well.\" Toshinori moved to pat Eraserhead on the shoulder as he gave a smile, the disheveled man turning the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's settled-\" Nezu jumped onto his desk with a *THUMP*, his coffee still safely sitting there. \"You can come in Mister Iida!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors burst open! In came a blue haired, broad shouldered teen . Blue-Eyes hidden behind rimmed glasses. He proudly beamed as he stood proud, one arm on his sidevas the other saluted \"I'M PROUD TO BE ACCEPTED FOR THIS POSITION!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa closed his eyes, acceptance washing over \"You already informed him before this didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. It was Midnight who was, <i>gushing out loud</i>, about having a giant male student in need of releasing urges.\" Toshinori expressed with a tinge of reluctance over Midnights....hobbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she did.\" He placed a hand on his head, one eye squinting as he thought about her, gritting teeth before returning to his normal position. \"So he consented to all this along with his parents already\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could answer Iida stepped forth, arms shifting as he walked in a robotic fashion, moving left arm back as right went forth, the space between him and his teachers disappeared. \"I'm proud to be accepted for this role Aizawa-sensei!  Keeping my friends out of trouble so they can achieve their dreams gives me great pride!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand once you take this you won't be normal anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe changed movements, pushing his glasses up as he he placed a fist to his side. \"Of course sensei. I've seen pictures of the animals fed this drug by my father. Giant goats, colossal chickens, fields of massive grains and sugar beets. I was even informed he gives small doses to other Scandinavia Heroes and it doesn't limit their quirks. Ill take just what I need to keep the others safe!\" There were other important factors like the hormone makes defying the square cube law easy, the increased musculature, etc. but he figured his teacher knew those facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then! Satisfied Aizawa?\" The mouse happily beamed his way as the three looked made contact with his, their eyes bright and shimmering. Well glowing pupils in All Mights case. Confidant this wouldn't go bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. But know this Iida, you mess this up and Ill have you kicked out. Got it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir!\" Iida saluted.<br>\r\n\"Now take this and ise it wisely\". Nezu held the vial in his paw, Iida bowing before gripping it firmly in his grasp.<br>\r\n\"How much should I take?\"<br>\r\n\"About one drop a day. Take too much and you're growth will be erratic.\" All Might patted him on the back.<br>\r\n\"You're new room after you've reached half of your estimated size will be a special roo. set away from the rest of the Dorms. We had them set up a hallway to connect it to the others and to the main building, right where you can see students sneaking off. Its the closest to class so you better not be late. Clothes and other materials have already been made to make it an exact copy of yoour dorm room. Including your....shelves of glasses.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes Aizawa-sensei!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIida bowed again before heading to leave \"Thank you for trusting. Me! I won't let you down!\" The boy quickly disappearing into the hallway as he went to his dorm, eyeing the liquid in the vial.<i> Ill keep you out of trouble Midoriya. No matter what it takes</i>.\" He arrived in his neat and orderly room, moving to his blue blanketed bed as he sat down, preparing for a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP* the lid came off as he brought it to his lips for the first small taste....</span></div></div>",

The two and Nighteyes desired champion to replace All Might as the successor of One For All, Mirio \"Lemillion\" Togata had seen him leave this world, cheering up his protege Mirio with his last moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a bit later here Deku stood befofe the cowlick blonde with blue oval eyes, offering him his quirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words escaped Mirio's lips as he sat cross legged on his hosptial bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear as his lips were parting that the blonde had more to say with his big wide smile, but Deku, dejected and filled with self-doubt and pity, moved before Mirio could finish. Gripping his senpais hospital gown, the greenette moved forth and pressed his lips onto Mirio's own, eyes closing before contact was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirio's oval eyes lengthened as Deku's tongue entered his mouth, saliva being shared. Stunned by Deku's response to his words, unkowingly having something passed on via the DNA within his saliva, and not immediately reacting to stop it as he held his hands in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might, just outside the room and listening in, stood in silence waiting for Deku to speak to the boy even he saw as a good candidate if circumstances had been a tad different. <i>\"Finish Midoriya. I want to hear your answer.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku continued to kiss his senpai, who remained surprised, but decided to wait for Deku to realize what he's done. After a minute had passed, Deku slowly opened his eyes, looking straight at Mirio as green eyes instantly widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku let go as he immediately jumped away in shock at what he done. Rapidly bowing multiple times as he began panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry M-Mirio-senpai! I wasn't thinking!\" The green boy's face turned beight red as sweat began to leak down like a waterfall on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his kohai having stopped, Mirio simply sat with lips open awaiting to say something. The lips rose upwards as he began laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! What was that about!? You gotta go on a date first before doing stuff like that Izuku!\" He swatted a hand down just as Deku was initiating his 23rd bow to give the greenette a pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was passing my quirk on to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words, Mirio lips opened. He was going to mention declining before the kiss, even if passing on quirks was possible, and cheer Izuku up so his kohai can regain faith in himself. Instead the younger tren gave up his career for his sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deku you should k-\"<br>\r\n*SLAM*<br>\r\n\"MIDORIYA MY BOY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku stopped bowing in his tracks, his face becoming a torrent of sweat as a waterfall descened from his forehead. For in came the buff form of All Might himself, his mouth twisted down as he bared his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All Might!\"<br>\r\n\"All Might!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PUFF* Instantly his frame deflated back into his normal skeletal like state. His sharp triangular chin on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*COUGH*  Blood now dripped from his mouth as he wiped it off, eyes piercing into the back of Deku's head. Sensing the tension before All Might even continued, Mirio erupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow it's like seeing parade balloons lose all air instantly by popping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for trying to ease this situation. Midoriya, however, must take responsibility for his actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku rose up, the green boys face filled with shame as tears stsrted to drip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before that I have to inform you of what Deku just did to you and the nature of OUR quirk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"''Our''? So that means....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. The quirk I passed on to Midoriya, who has now passed it on to you? One For All....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deadly thin blonde began to exposit everything. Deku, who let his tears dry stood with sorrow while Mirio listened, learning what Sir Nighteye wanted for him, Nighteyes antagonism towards Deku, and the burden. Once All Might finished:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is there anything you would like to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Can't I just pass it back to Midoriya with a kiss? No harm and I'll help keep the secret! Well unless I blurt it in front of Tamaki, or Nejire, or the principal....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still trying to lighten the mood, but All Might had none of it as he shook his head. He had his left reach for Deku, not to lash out, but to ruffle the messy green on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately your body must ingest it over the course of a few hours. Once the power becomes a part of you then you must adapt to it. After say about 5% then you could return it to Midoriya......Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it it's never been done before?\" Mirio assumed passing it to a past holder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct Mirio my boy. If you're willing to try I will help you. Now I'll go make sure no one else is peeping in so this incident doesn't get worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing Deku's hair, All Might pgave a big *SIGH* as he exited. Leaving the two boys alone. Deku brought his hands to his face for a *SLAP* followed by shaking his head before peering at the older teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for acting rashly senpai. I should have let you finish\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine! I must admit I just assumed you were going for a roundabout confession than actually passinga quirk on. i just....wish Sir Nighteye had confided in me about whether I would want such a thing in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirio looked at his bandaged arms, thinking to his mentors last moments. His lips bent down for only a second as he began to think he let all this happen so he could-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirio immediately pushed it out of his mind as he smiled. <i>He would never do that. He knows how much he meant to me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai?\" Deku waited till his senpai was smiling, a gesture he put on to not let the negative weigh him down. \"This is likely just my fault. He didn't believe he could change fate until it was too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, Mirio asked \"So when do I know when the power is within me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You clench your butt and scream SMASH in the bottom of your heart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super simple! Man imagine if that's all it took for Permeation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes! Except....for all the times I struggled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! You just needed to smild and be proud when you began. Here since it hasn't started for me yet here goes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing tightly with a loy of cheer, a loud *BOOM* and *RIIIIIIPPPPP* erupted as Mirio's body expanded instantly! The 181 cm (5'11\") body <i>exploded</i> in mass as he reached 230 cm (7'6\") in a moment. Surpassing All Mights hero form in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowlick blondes hosptial gown stretched over bulging, mountainous curves carved from granite, pushed to their absolute limits. The lightest of flexes could rip the shirt and pants in twain. Lemillion's arms, bulging and rippling with muscle that made All Mights arms look downright small! Tattered bandages fell to the ground as a loud *GRROOOAAANNN* of the hospital bed told how it was struggling to stay up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth stayed stunned by the resulting transformation. What took Izuku a good hour to do with disastrous damage to his arms Mirio had done in under ten minutes with no ill effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! I was just trying to flex my arm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was flexing!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green boy almost fainted as All Might returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Hell!?\" Blood erupted forth from his mouth as the blue in the pitch black schlera swirled around in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====Unknown Surprise=====<br>\r\nDespite what Izuku, his doctor, and mothsr believed he had indeed been born with a quirk:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReplicate - A quirk that replicates any quirk within the user, allowing it to copy itself in the user should they pass it on to another. Useless by itself and eaving one effectively quirkless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the day Deku became All Might's successor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with it inherited into OFA, both Lemillion and Deku could endlessly replicate the quirk of OFA as they pass it to the other. Amplifying its effects to endless heights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their last trip ending horribly following the remaining habitable landmass was swallowed by the catastrophic tsunami's that regularly plague the mostly aquatic planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7...8...9...10!\" Kanata huffed as he finished his last set of pull-ups and finished his weight training for the day. \"Man I'm beat! I should take a shower!\" Kanata took off the red, white, and blue suit he normally wears and heads for the bathing area on the ship to take a quick shower, the girls already asleep for the night. His muscular and fit body from years of weight training and track showing off as he entered. He made it quick and fast, cleaning his body quickly to use as little as water possible to keep them from running out before they arrive at the next planet. The captain of the Astra put on his suit once more for the night, knowing he needed to make sure everything is going well with Zack before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the bridge, where Zack Walker was finishing up checking the ships controls. The white haired, bespectacled genius was in his own turquiose and dark blue suit. He was checking to be sure the autopilot was functioning properly before going to bed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything working properly?\" Kanata asked as he looked over Zack, seeing him check the system in case of damage or malfunction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Just being safe. Never know when we might get trapped in the middle of nowhere due to something malfunctioning.\" Zack replied as he finished up, getting out of the pilot seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we wouldn't have to worry about more of those spheres showing up.\" Kanata chuckled as he thought back to how this all started. A sphere dragging them off into space lightyears away from their homeworld or Planet Camp. Now they were using Astra to make the trip back to their home. The Sphere making another appearance on a previous planet, but thankfully none of them were dragged off like last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure of that. That Sphere could appear at any ti-!\" Zack went wide eyed as he saw it. The Sphere was forming right before their eyes in the bridge, golden in color and shining brillianty as it stood between them and the exit. It's center was not the vacuum of space as before, but what appeared to be a lush planet. \"Kanata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! We gotta do something about this!\" Kanata said as he tried to look around for what they could use to stop it from sucking them in, or hopefully a means of getting pass it. The Sphere seemed to know his thoughts, as it began to move at a fast pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time!\" Zack called as they both were swallowed into the sphere, spiraling them away from each other as a vortex of energy surrounded them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on!? This feels..mhm...different than before\" Kanata was trying to question what was happening at first, but the strange vortex was filing him with an intense, but good feeling that he was enjoying. ''No! Don't think about the good feeling! I've got to see if Zack's okay and if anyone else or the Astra itself might be consumed!'' Kanata's thoughts were all over the idea of what might be happening, not helped by the intense energy filling him before the Sphere finally spit him out. Kanata crashed face first down on top of a massive, glowing, fruit-like plants growing between smaller, but still massive trees with vines connecting the trees and fruits. Unharmed just like the last time it spat him out, but now the intense feeling was going away. Leaving him with a strong desire to sleep. \"Sooo...tir..ed...\" He barely droned out before unconsciousness swept over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanata, still unconscious, hadn't noticed that his body had been changed by the Sphere's mysterious actions and would not wake up for some time. Several hours had passed by the time he awakens, his eyes gazing upon the glowing vegetation that littered the landscape below. \"Where am I?\"</span></div></div>",

''I could use Megumi, but she usually looks like she'll have some kind of panic attack. Ah I'll have Zenji try it. He usually lets people walk all over him after all.'' Soma sinisterly chuckled to himself as he finished his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice, however, came out of the Speaking Tube nearby. \"Yukihira. There's a gift here from your father. Please come to the kitchen to receive it.\" Satoshi Isshiki stated as the tube went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. He usually doesn't send me anything. Wonder what I got?\" Soma contemplated, trying to think of when his old man did something like this before, but nothing came up. With that in mind Soma headed downstairs for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Yukihira you're here!\" Isshiki said cheerfully, dressed in his usual naked apron attire. Next to him was a bottle of Wine and a letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Isshiki. So this is what my dad sent me?\" He asked as Isshiki gave him a cheerful nod. Coming over to inspect the bottle, he wasn't sure if it was Cooking Wine or not, but hoped his father remembered he isn't old enough to drink. Look at the letter next to it, Soma opened it and read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey Soma, found this interesting drink given to me during a travel through India called the Drink of the Gods. Figured you might want to try. Had a sip myself, but that's a secret for another day. Don't worry it's not Alcohol.</i> The letter held nothing more than that, which irked him that his dad sent him a drink without the details for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it?\" Isshiki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue. My old man didn't say a thing besides it being interesting and not wine. I can take of sip of it at least.\" Soma said as he went and pulled out a small cup. Opening the bottle, a mysterious vapour of gold light filled the air, shining with unrivaled splendor. A shining gold liquid poured from the bottle into the cup. Bringing it to his lips, Soma felt the liquid touch his taste buds and was overwhelemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA taste so heavenly and bliss filled he couldn't even describe it with words. But thoughts began to fill his mind as the liquid slid gracefully down his throat. <i>The Peaches of Immortality of China, The Ambrosia of the Greeks, the Apples of Eternal Youth of Norse, the alchemic Elixir of Eternal Life, and the Amrita and Soma of ancient Hindu</i>. The collective mystical foods of the gods merged into one divine drink, blessing one with power to become a true divinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Not bad. Should use it when cooking squid\"  Soma chuckled as he felt the change begin.</span></div></div>",

All the while clothes tightened, bugging him as his body inched upwards, his chest pushing out against the fabric of his shirt &amp; jacket, sleeves straining on his growing biceps, the lower set of forming abs showing.

Hisako stood in awe with Erina at S\u014dma as binoculars of their known stalker Nao spies on them from a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-y-yukihira S\u014dma!?\" ErIna lasted only a second before collapsing from shock. Her red head servant swiftly grasped her collapsing body. Her protectiveness overwhelming even her own desire to faint. Though her quivering legs make clear she could fail at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. What's with you two? It's like you've seen something out of this world\" He chuckled, almost taking a willful oblivious tone to his new state of being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y--Y-yukihira S\u014dma-kun! Look at your body!\" Hisako could barely muster the will to start the sentence, fanning Erina's face as she fell into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS\u014dma looked down, seeing growing clothes nicely fitting his perfecting form. \"Well that's different!\" Mused with the current situation rather than shocked or surprised.<br>\r\n\"You should be a lot more shocked by this Yukihira!\" <br>\r\n\"No point. I've got dishes to make and people to test them on! See ya later! I have a feeling Erina's going to try my experiments whether she wants to or not\" Waving as he headed for the entrance, smaller students moving out of the way instinctively as they felt his slumbering divinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisako waved back before picking up Erina, struggling to carry her. \"T-this *huff* would be a lot *huff* easier if S\u014dma had offered ro help. But the clueless and cocky chef wanted to show off.</span></div></div>",

While he should be keeping up with his training for next years Grand Prix, he was instead at home in Yu-topia, A table sat before him with five empty bowls and a sixth one half eaten. Yuri was looking miserable as he continued to eat his sixth Pork Cutlet Bowl. ''I really shouldn't be doing this, but Viktor left  and my mom made me that huge feast'' He begrudingly thought as he directed his misery towards himself. ''I should have gone with him, cause then I wouldn't have given into temptation.'' he brought his hand down to his stomach, Yuri's shirt riding up his belly from the gut he had gained from indulging himself the past week. His mom bringing him more pork cutlet bowls each time he convinced himself <i>this time</i> would be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viktor.

Grabbing one of the sealed bowls, he slowly peeled open the top as he continued speak \"It just so happen a fan sent me something that could help you catch up, cause you are gong to spend the next week working three times as hard to catch up.\" VIktor flashed a sinister smile, letting Yuri know he was furious with him. Yuri gulped in tense worry. \"But for now you are going to eat this product a fan sent me to help me keep going. Said it was all healthy and not dangerous.

The masters of that dojo were a little... extravagant, but also very strong and fit.

Take one pill while I get all the equipment so we cam start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Japanese skater didn't feel as confident as his coach, but he couldn't let him down.

I mean, I'm sure you don't have any 'genetic predisposition', whatever that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exhausting physical efforts during the treatment isn't recommended so it could worsen the described side-effects.\" He read with a specially high voice tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've already concluded you won't suffer those side-effect, so it won't worsen something didn't happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktor's reasoning was so absurd Yuri couldn't refute it.

He took another dose and rested for a few more minutes until the pain disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope Viktor knows what he's doing...' he thought, fearing what kind of horrific training he had planned for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he didn't. He could be a superstar of figure skating, but he had been a coach for less than a year. He was always very demanding regarding his own training and he had assumed the same would work with his kissable pupil. And the closing deadline wwould be making him be even harsher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that day and the next one, Yuri had to endure even more intense sessions with heavier weights. But, in the morning of the third day, he went to see Viktor with a big smile in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.\" He said as he lift his t-shirt, exhibiting his reborn abs. His gut was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All your hard work worth it... I'm so proud of you.\" Viktor told Yuri as he hugged him tenderly. \"I don't want to be the strict, bad coach anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I prefer you as the funny coach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could do something... relaxing... for once...\" He said with his sexy voice. moments before kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the kiss concluded and Victor and Yuri separated slowly from one another, the former stayed still and silent. He had noticed something strange. There wasn't anything wrong with the kiss, it was great, like the previous ones... but in the previous kisses he had had to stand on tiptoes to reach his lips, whereas this time he hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose minor concerns disappeared as soon as Viktor revealed his plan... a private bath together in the hot springs. While they were taking the bath, Yuri, who had enjoyed the first kiss, went for the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. It's weird to see you took the initiative...\" The silver-haired man admitted after his lover let him breathe \"...but I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kissing continued. And the erotic caressing. And eventually, their cocks received the attention they were asking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktor had been blessed with one vigorous, powerful dick, standing at 17.5cm (7\"). Yuri loved that cock almost as much as his owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe played with it with his tongue until it was wet enough to go inside his ass. When his coach was about to put it inside, he stopped to admire the toned back of the pupil, how his shoulders seemed broader than usual and his ass felt more muscular too. His whole body felt fit and hard, like a Greek statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a great coach\" He told himself, proud of the results of his 3 days training, and then he penetrated Yuri. The younger skater enjoyed it. It didn't hurt at all, maybe due to the final effects of the painkiller, or maybe the painful training had somehow hardened his inside. Pale, warming hands stimulated his cock with energy. After a quarter of hour of pleasure they reached climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning themselves, Viktor went outside to walk the dog. Yuri, still a little tired of all the training and sex, decided to stay at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was waiting for his return, he heard his mother complaining in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear... I've made too many pork cutlet bowls. It's so sad to waste food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't had dinner, I could eat one.\" Yuri offered himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course, son. You trained so hard these days you're becoming too thin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time after, Viktor came back and saw his pupil surrounded by lots of empty bowls. His gut was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri, didn't you know how easy it is to gain weight after loosing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... sorry...\" He apologized with tears dampening his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's my fault... I was a terrible coach. Too soft and flexible... for now, I'm going to be as strict as my old coach! Tomorrow you're going to train like never before!\"</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly, he had gained a considerable amount of muscle mass in only 4 days of exercise. Everyone could notice it even with the extra layer of fat he had also gained the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs, biceps and thighs were considerably thicker now, tightened under his t-shirt, but his new gut was even more noticeable, a hill of meat which shook constantly during his workout. And that was the only concern of Viktor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rookie coach had some wrong ideas about exercise, like \"if you don't get tired or sweated it isn't working\". He was afraid the current workout plan was too easy for him and it wouldn't burn the 10 pork bowls he had eaten. He left his lover to exercise his muscle alone while he phoned his friends from the Ry\u014dzanpaku dojo. He returned a few minutes later with a new idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri, stop. I think the basic 'go up and down steps' exercise won't be useful for you anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you calling THIS a basic exercise?\" He exclaimed annoyed \"Viktor, I'm doing it while I carry almost 30Kg (66Lb) in weights\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I think you have already got used to it. 2 hours and you're not even tired...\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm a little tired...\"<br>\r\n\"...it's time to do something more... challenging.\" Viktor kept talking, ignoring him \"Different. Stimulating.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh\" Yuri was wondering what new torture his coach had prepared for him.<br>\r\n\"Let's do a little jogging for the town.\"<br>\r\n\"That's... actually nice, Viktor. I don't think the excessive workout is good for me, and I don't think I really need something SO extreme to slim down. A more long-term, softer workout plan with jogging and similar things could make me loose the extra kilos (pounds) in the remaining weeks...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Yuri, you misunderstood me. I don't plan to go easy on you... and the more intense the workout is, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Viktor didn't have a change of heart all of a suddenly. His false kind smile was a signal for something terrible coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to jog carrying all your weights AND an extra 80Kg (176Lb) weight.\"<br>\r\n\"What!? That's too much! Also, I thought you didn't have heavier weights...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but my friends of the dojo suggested that I could use another thing as a weight... MYSELF!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, gosh...\" Yuri couldn't believe what he had been hearing \"Are you really going to make me carry with you while I run? How??\"<br>\r\n\"The masters of the dojo...\"<br>\r\n'I'm tired of hearing about that damn dojo.' Yuri thought.<br>\r\n\"...told me to get a truck wheel, tie it to your waist with a rope and sit myself on the wheel while you run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri was fed up to the back teeth of Viktor's evil-coach mode, but he ended up complying with his orders. He couldn't say no to him. Maybe it was because of he always admired him as a skater... or how much he loved that man... or how handsome and hot he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly, he always thought he didn't deserve someone as charming, intelligent and hot as him. Even less then after getting so fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the training started, and it was as humiliating as Yuri expected. Every citizen was staring at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri, you're slowing down.\" His coach warned him.<br>\r\n\"I'm tired, Viktor. We're being doing this a whole hour!\"<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's necessary... I'm your coach, I know better. Now speed up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri didn't answered, nor accelerated. His coach had to take a hard line...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri, if you don't go faster, I'll send photos of your last year dance-off to your mom...\"<br>\r\n\"What?? You don't dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ping!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already sent the first one in which you started wearing your tie over your forehead. And I'm sure you hadn't forgotten what you were doing in the next one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri didn't know where he found strength to keep running so fast for another hour... but when he finished, his coach congratulated him for his efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad for your first day, but I'm sure you'll do it even better tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that dreadful training carried on for four days... in the 5th one, Viktor measured his waist and gladly announced he was again in good shape. Although the diameter of his waistline was still quite bigger than usual, his now prominent 6-pack clearly indicated he didn't have a gram of fat in his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had worked so hard I think you deserve a reward... What would you want to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri remained silent. He couldn't be happier for his achievements, but he decided to keep it for himself. He was still mad at Viktor for his incredibly hard workout plan and didn't want to recognize its efficacy nor thank his coach for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktor perceived his resentment, but didn't say anything more. Both men stay one in front of the another for a few uncomfortable seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was broken by Yuri, who noticed something that made him forget about his grudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viktor... Are you... smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Russian was always half a head taller than the Japanese boy, but during the last days Yuri failed to notice the difference was slowly reducing until, until that moment: standing in front of Viktor,  the top of his silver head was under his nose. That would make him 10cm (4\") shorter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or could it be you're taller?\" Viktor replied, a little dazed for the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body had been changing since he started the training. His lean physique had become something like a beefy gymnastic... becoming so brawny in only a week is weird, but becoming taller? Something really strange was going on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're 180cm (6'), right? So I must be a little over 190cm (6'4\") tall...\"<br>\r\n\"Heh. I like your new height. It makes you look much more imposing... and handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri blushed a little. He wasn't used to be called 'handsome', specially from a beautiful skating star like him (actually he never had a high self-esteem). Although tt was true his physique had changed a lot lately, his slim built had been transformed into the build of a beefy gymnast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think this is a little weird, Viktor?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's just a growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm 24 years old.\" Yuri answered him back.<br>\r\n\"A LATE growth spurt then.\"<br>\r\n\"I grew 20cm (8\") in a week!\"<br>\r\n\"So it's a FAST, LATE growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n\"Uggg...\" He signed, tired of Vic's obliviousness. \"It think it's time to stop taking those pills. It's not like I would need them anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student avoided his coach for most of the day.</span></div></div>",

The last thing he wanted to do was putting on weight again. He avoided talking to Viktor and when he finished eating he went to bed without saying a word to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Viktor sneaked in his bedroom without turning on the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuuuuri...\u201d He whispered erotically, waking him up.<br>\r\n\u201cViktor\u2026 are you drunk\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no\u2026 I only drank a few  bottles of sake\u2026 nothing too serious\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri had forgotten his coach was Russian after all\u2026 Although it was the first time he had seen him drunk. \u2018What did it drive him to drink so much?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuri, do you hate me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He answered, still sleepy \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t hate you. Just a little pissed-off. This week has been really challenging for me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut you aren\u2019t going to break up with me, right??\u201d He asked with a voice tone too loud for that time of the night.<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so good, Yuuuuuri...\u201d The touched Viktor jumped over the lied man and hugged him \u201cBut I\u2019m the worst\u2026 the worst trainer, the worst boyfriend\u2026 Please don\u2019t fire me as your coach!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrunk Viktor was actually nicer than Evil-Coach Viktor of the last days. Still he preferred the normal, charming Viktor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the worst. You\u2019re a great skater and lover... And a pretty good coach. But sometimes you go to far and make mistakes, like with the hellish extreme training, but that\u2019s because you want the best for me\u2026 I still want you to be my trainer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-yuuuri\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was crying, as awkwardly as a drunk moved all grown-up man could. That made Yuri smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh\u2026 Lie down with me and let\u2019s sleep together, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYuri...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktor\u2019s mouth got closer to his lover\u2019s ear, almost touching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to do other things...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri was completely worn out to \u201cplay\u201d, but somehow, his suggestive voice (and the way he touched him when they were alone) always turned him on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktor only needed seconds to take all his clothes off and had time to help Yuri to get undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisses and caresses in the dark. The darkness in the room enhanced his other senses.<br>\r\nViktor got surprised when he put his hands on his chest and noticed how thick his pecs had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is muscle or fat?\u201d He asked, unable to distinguish in the darkness.<br>\r\n\u201cMuscle!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood, because I love how it feels under my hands...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktor kept playing with the other\u2019s big pectorals, stroking his nipples, licking them\u2026<br>\r\nUntil his mouth was invaded by surprise by an unknown tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kissed while their hands were either touching each other\u2019s ass, or their cocks. While Vik was masturbating both cocks at once, he noticed the cock of his beloved felt much more bigger than his. <br>\r\nExcited, he wanted to feel it inside his body, and so he sat over his crouch and tried to put the cock inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit?\u201d Yuri worried as the seconds passed,<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 I didn\u2019t put it right under the hole\u2026 god, had it always been this big? Almost there...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Unnngg*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it went inside, although only halfway. He had never had that problem before the pills. But Viktor didn\u2019t give up and kept moving his body upwards and downwards faster, and the cock went an inch deeper with each repetition, until the whole fat cock went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGodddd!\u201d He muttered in pain and pleasure.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok? Does it hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels\u2026 challenging\u2026 but also so good at the same time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey start to fuck faster, and Yuri, lost in the lust, grabbed Vik\u2019s waist and moved him nonstop until both men reached the climax and cummed abundantly, specially the younger sportsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair waked up the next morning covered in cum. Yuri showered off first and went to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Yuri, so timely. I was preparing some pork bowls for a client and accidentally I cooked three times more pork than I actually needed. Would you like\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d He said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had gone through a hellish training twice to loose the fat of two night\u2019s whim. Never again.<br>\r\nHe also had something important to do while Viktor was showing\u2026 He wanted to get new clothes. The old clothes were too tight now, they had become uncomfortable to wear, didn\u2019t let him move freely and they emphasized too much every muscle of his body (including a long, thick, and now visible muscle between his legs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Also his long-sleeves t-shirts didn\u2019t even cover his wrists and the same with his ankles and the trouser legs)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had some problems to get the clothes (most of the Japanese clothing shops lacks of clothes for a 195cm (6\u20196\u201d) 110Kb (242Lb) imposing sportsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he eventually got them, something terrible happened: A nearby truck driver lost the control of his tank truck and crashed near the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Yuri could move aside and miss the truck, but all the content of the tank spilled over him. It was chocolate, an amount big enough to cover his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a bad feeling and tried to get away, but then another truck filled with milk cream collided a few meters beyond in the opposite direction.<br>\r\nHe cream and the dense chocolate was almost covering his head when a third truck which were transporting candy hit the first truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri was trapped between the remainder of the trucks, drowning in a sea of sugar and fat.<br>\r\nViktor, who wasn\u2019t far, saw it all and went to rescue him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuri!! Wake up, please!\u201d He begged after taking him out of that lake of chocolate and cream.<br>\r\n\u201cV-Viktor...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYuri! Thanks goodness you\u2019re fine...!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cViktor\u2026 I\u2026 swear...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI swear I didn\u2019t drink any of it\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Yuri\u2026 I love you so much...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently kissed his lips. It tasted like candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we both know that isn\u2019t true.</span></div></div>",

He decided he didn't feel ready for whatever hell his coach had planned for that day and chose to remain safe hidden under the blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that had never been a good hideout, even less after his legs grew long enough to poke them out of the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuri...

I became fat again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri got ride of his pajama shirt, showing him his gut was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Viktor commented \"...Your belly actually looks much smaller than the last time you overate.

I won't be able to burn it in 2 weeks unless...\" His voice faded a little \"...I do another of your special workout plans.\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"What?

Viktor gave him his baggiest clothes, but even those where too tight for him now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe border of the t-shirt ended over his navel, and couldn\u2019t wrap up his gut at all. But it wasn\u2019t all due his new fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeves and trouser legs were too short too, exposing all his wrists and ankles, and his pecs were squeezed under the cloth. The extra layer didn\u2019t diminish his muscular features except on his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Kinda hot, in a different way now...\u2019<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say something, Viktor?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when they were about to leave, Yuri\u2019s forehead bumped on the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you fine, Yuri?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d After looking at Viktor, he started doubting it. He seemed smaller than yesterday, and now the top of his head was just under Yuri\u2019s chin. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day\u2019s training was a piece of cake for him and kinda fun, but when he got his warm-ups done, he ran into a new problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis old ice skates were too small, almost like child\u2019s shoes for him.

The skates his friend had sent right over did not fit Yuri's massive feet, which had grown large enough to make that Viktors own 17 were too small for even the tip of his feet to enter. The second set his ordered immediately after their arrival wouldn't arrive till today, but that was not the sole thing going wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri's already tight clothes borrowed from Viktor were tearing and becoming impossible to wear,  his shirt ridimg up his body becoming smaller and smaller as Yuri's belly shrunk in size till his granite hard abs were showing. Though Victor took a few moments to caress them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Viktor had been under Yuri's chin the day before, now his head was sllightly below Yuri's nipples. This growth spurt had lead Yuri to hole himself from the outside out of embarassment. Which, admittedly, Viktor and his mom didn't help by indulging his gluttony more by getting as much food and pork as possible to satisfy him. Seeing Yuri hurt only made Viktor feel it, and that lead to him continuing to indulge his giant buff piggy. Watching with interest as that gut expand and contrast the rest of his massive, hard body with its softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri's mom and sister, thnakfully, took two old blankets and had them taken apart with aid from friends to make makeshift clothing for Yuri, who had been eating and cuddling Makkachin nonstop while Victor was calling whoever he could to make things for Yuri to wear. His clothes he required. Much bigger than his current size, having measured the black haired beefcake with aid of his future mother in law Hiroko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo help ease things over, Viktor brought over a laptop with connections to Phichit. \"As part of your training I've selfishly kept you away from interacting with your friends Takeshi and Phichit. I hope this makes it up to you.\" He spoke with earnest, though wishing he could keep the growing Yuri to himself as much as he wanted him to not grow more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh!? You're huge Yuri!\" Phichit said loud enough for Viktor to overhear.<br>\r\n\"Nah I've just gained a few pounds\"  Viktor smirked in peace hearing Yuri say those words, knowing this helped at the moment. He'd have to call Takeshi and ask him to help tomrrow. Though he left before hearing Phichit planning to head on over to hang out directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest problem happend that night. The two having a tender moment as Viktor lay wrapped in Yuri's large embrace as they kiss. Their nude forms together on a bed on the verge of collapse. Their penises rubbing together as they moved away from making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Yuri's dick was now too big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had grown considerably in girth and length, enough that Yuri could not fit the head in at all much to the two skaters frustrations. Even orally it was too big for Viktor, who did what he could just with licking. Though Yuri suggested Viktor could still do both to him, his coach declined. \"I want you to get as much lleasure from this as me. I'd get exhausted before you even finish\" Those earnest words were the truth, as Yuri's sexual appetite grew just as much as the rest of him. Enough that the dark haired hunk had to lay Viktor gently next to him while he comtinued to masturbate. Rubbing their dicks together only bringing him to climax three times.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nPlease let this end by tomorrow. I'll do anything... </i>Yuri though as he climaxed for his 7th time, white seed plastering the roof and Viktors entire body. Sleep finally coming for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas his wish was unanswered as the two woke in the present time to Viktor, who sleeping Yuri had picked up and held like a little doll, had seen Yuri crushed the bed under his massive and wide torso. His growth surpassing even yesterdays. His body had grown enough that Viktor's head reach just the lower set of abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Maybe those pills I gave you may have caused a bit of a problem.\"</span></div></div>",

Tunnibg across the grass before hiding behind a bush, with the second following him. \"If you had kept watch better we could have gotten in and out far easier by evenly distributing these.\" Checking each direction they resumed resumed their secret flee from the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm sorry. I didn't even know  that teacher who makes non-sensical proverbs would stay late. Plus once we get these to your place we can complete the formula. Let's take the long route and get out of here \" The first  Shadow replied as they hid behind trees while looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but oh no-\" The Second stopped as he saw several shadows were clearly heading the route they planned to take. \"Let's go through the Swim Club. There won't be anyone that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" The First Shadow replied as try both rehabbed directions to head for the swim club. Once they arrived there the two looked around, hoping to avoid being seen.\"Good no ones here let's walk through here and get out. The two niodded as they headed around the pool that had been cleaned by the club members, only recently seeing use again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had only walked a few feet beside one of the pool ladders that a hand reached from the clear poolwater they had overlooked, grabbing the Seconds Shadows foot. \"Ahh!\" He screamed  as he freaked out and threw the box, breaking the vials within on the concrete as it landed . Its contents pooring out, leaking from the box and slowly making a small trail of liquid that lead into the pool. Each drop falling into it before it quickly merged with the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Run!\" The First shouted as he began to run like crazy, accidentally stumbling and dropping the few vials he had, which like cracked as he stepped on them, but neither him and the Second Shadow cared as try fled, hoping to not get caught and punished. The two had ran off into the distance as the liquid of the remaining vials merged with the pool water and the figure that grabbed them stood there..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark blue haired Haruka looked on without displaying a hint of emotion. ''I figured that was Makoto since I invited him  to come enjoy the school pool. Though Nagisa did overhear and invited himself and Rei.'' He contemplated he look at the destroyed vials and box on the ground. ''Guess they destroyed their stuff. Well as long as it doesn't interfere with  the pool'' He shrugged it off, jumping in to do his beloved freestyle swimming. Unbeknownst  to him of the chemicals now flowing through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only swims free after all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pool isn't big enough to swim in anymore.\" Haru solemnly spoke as he tried to look down, the dark haired mini-giants pecs obscuring his view of the three normal teens before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Haru-senapi we just got here. We had to sneak in and everything!\" Rei the farthest away asked in shock as his red framed glasses moved, pushing his glasses back into position. <i>\"The fact Haru-senpai was inhuman in size is already bizarre. He should be crushed under his own weight. That he wants to stop swimming is more surprising.\"</i> He saw Nagisa was oogling the sight of the giant and moving close to the edge, moving hands to happily feel the massive cut abs below Haru's pecs. Magenta eyes drinking in the sight as he feels the powerful muscle protected by inhumanly strong skin. Makoto himself resisting the urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So big\" Nagisa giggled before he felt Haruka move, taking back several steps out of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haru is something wrong?\" Makoto became concerned as he moved back a few feet to see Haru's face, the serious look plastered on it as Haru's eyes sparkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to become big enough I can't swim in pools.\" The giant admitted as he began to move. Haruka raised one of his thick, tree trunk thighs from the pool and planted it firmly on the cement. The ground rhythmically shook as Haruka put only a fraction of superhuman strength that supports his frame into it, combining with his new stature and weight. The three moved back further as they drank in the sight of Haru's full body, his massive pecs still obscuring them from Haru's silent view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was breathtaking. Wide, powerful, huge shoulders with massive biceps and triceps. The bicep when flexed would easily be the size of a medicine ball at his original height of 5'8. Massive tree thick thighs pressed against each other desperate for space, fighting with his third leg massive junk for space. Longer and thicker feet built to support his new height. Even his wide hands could enguled Makoto's head easily, each finger thick and strong enough to inflict heavy injury with the lightest touch. His intense blue eyed dark haired head grown in proportion and supported on a thick neck. Haruka Nanase wiggled his large toes, cracks appearing in the ground as his empowered foot pressed into it. His jammers' still sticking on tight to his frame, even as there was clearly a big change in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three blushed as they got sight of that monster sealed tight wthin the pitch black with purple-lining material. <i>\"It's huge!\"</i> The three thought simultaneously as their faces turned red. Makoto's the brightest shade. As it sank in, they slowly adjusted to it. Haruka being a giant standing twice their heights with a dense, muscular phsyique more likely to send him down to the oceans depths than swim made accepting that a tad easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto moved as far back as possible to look up at Haruka. \"Alright then Haru, but we better hurry. Who knows if someone might glimpse you at this size.\" It wouldn't be night-time forever, and the sun will eventually rise on the horizon. People are going to see him if he doesn't hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired giant had not prepped himself to walk, instead moving down to his knees as two fingers of his meaty left hand moved to grip Makoto by his shirt. \"H-h-haru!?\" Makoto was surprised as he was effortlessly brought into the air and desperately holding his shirt tight to not fall. Haru remained silent as he rose from the ground. He stood tall and proud as he placed Makoto on the right shoulder. The muscle big enough for Makoto to sit on. The wind at Haru's 14 ft. height gently caressing his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't keep up....shorty.\" Haru face hid he was having a blast at being bigger than Makoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Makoto smiled as he saw Haru was being silent, keeping his thoughts to himself at the moment. Looking down at Nagisa and Rei, who moved from in front of the giant \"What about Rei and Nagisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll walk. Don't think I can catch three people.\" The blue eyed giant didn't mention he felt strong enough to snap one in half with a poke. He'd have to be careful walking with just Makoto. \"Sorry\". Haru looked down as he apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Haru-senpai. You go ahead and we'll try to keep up.\" Rei replied as Nagisa headed to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Haru began to walk. Even step shook the area around him just a little, the ground cracking as he took step, by step, by step. Smallest of imprints dug into the ground. Traces of his movements inevitable even as he left the pool to heads for his home in the dark of night. The outline of his and Makoto's figure in view.  Makoto talking to Haru \"We should let Rin know about this later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. He'll probably tell Sousuke.\" Grumbled the giant. Him and Sousuke had the oddest feud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei meanwhile moved down to touch the initial cracks \"We'll need to explain the cracks in the ground.\" Rei sighed at the headache as he turned to see Nagisa fumbling with his pants. \"Nagisa-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to take a dip in the pool before we go!\" Nagisa was happily tossing off his pants before Rei grabbed him from behind, tugging at the smallest members shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't Nagisa-kun! We have a huge Haru-senpai already. We don't need you trying to have fun at thet size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei-chan!\" Crocodile tears poured forth as the magenta eyed boy tried to evoke sympathy with a voiced dripped in sweet honey to make Rei give in. \"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answers still no.\" Unfazed purple eyes looking straight at the short blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch! You're no fun Rei-chan.\" Nagisa crossed his arms as the tears shut off instantly.  Rei letting go as Nagisa was annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's go.\" Rei started walking making clear he wanted Nagisa next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Rei-chan\". Nagisa grumbled as he walked. <i>\"I'll try it later.\"</i> Thinking that to himself, he thought of what fun he could have.</span></div></div>",

The sheer mass compacted on his hulking frame unwilling to keep silent as the earth cracked beneath his powerful toes with the slightest press. Makoto was sitting tightly on his massive shoulders, gripping hair to keep himself from falling. Haru's hand also helped in that regards, holding Makoto with as little pressure as possible. Though his increase musculature was making it an uncomfortable trip for the normal green eyed teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back, he could see the imprints left behind even with only a few lights on and the moonlight <i>There's no way to keep Haru a secret</i> Sweating furiously, Makoto swallowed <i>These steps will lead straight to his home.</i> The fences did nothing to hide his growing friend, who easily stood more than twice their height. <i>Huff...please don't let anyone look out their windows and see him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru, though, cared for little at the moment as he turned and glimpsed back, seeing his tracks. \"Hmph\" Solely motivated by a desire to retreat for home and rest as his blue eyes shone with an unnatural glow in the darkness. Reaching steps made for normal folk, Haru simply ignore it as he raised one and planted it into the stone steps. With just a little applied pressure *Crack* he had smashed right through the cement, creating his first step upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Haru!\" Makoto was taken aback by the damage Haruka was causing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru ignored his surprise, putting his next foot up to push forward to continue. He did if only a few more times before finally reaching the top. What usually took an hour of walking from home to school was done in less than ten. The Nanase residence now in view. The open path that lead to his home. Only there was one problem both Haru and Makoto realized....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I was so taken aback I didn't consider how you'd get inside Haru!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Getting down on one knee, his hand holding Makoto on his shoulder gripped him slightly, pulling him off his shoulder. Instinctively Makoto let go of the pitch black hair, letting the hand place himself on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. That was a very bumpy ride you had me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was easy.\" Haru huffed as he moved his arm for the human sized door. Makoto had been so lightweight, holding him as a doll was as simple as breathing, but he won't let him know that. For now at least. Feeling something was off, Haru realized immediately what his other problem with the door was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left the key at school. With my credit card for food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Neither of us were thinking so I can just call Rei and-\" *SLAM* Makoto didn't get to finish as Haru raised his palm, casually pushing it into contact with the door, his veins twitching as he exerted just the slightest pressure, instantly ripping it off the hinges and tossing it onto the floor. \"Sigh...Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru was looking between the door and his arm, the hugd biceps and triceps with the smallest flex would easily collide with the walls, making going in sideways with his shoulders even less feasible with those massive delts. Yet the distant gleam in Haruka's eyes and the smallest smirk crossing his lips made clear his intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast before his friend destroyed it with reckless abandon. Makoto rushed into the residence to speak \"H-haru I can get anything you need from in here. Is there something you want? We'll need to move you elsewhere since your home is clearly incapable of handling the new you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes as his mouth curved down into a passive state, masking his disappointment with Makoto's interference \"Nothing of import. Not even any mackerel in the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto sighed with relief. \"Thank goodness. I'll call the others to inform the change in plans\" Stepping out of the doorway, Makoto pulled out his phone to text Rei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">M:Things aregood over there</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">R:Yes. Keeping Nagisa out of trouble. Had him go get Haruka-senpais things. You?</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">M:House too small. Need new place to hide Haru. Tracks make it easy to find him.</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">R:Hm....How about Sukishima Island where we trained? Since it has abandoned lighthouse for us to stay?</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">M:That works! I'll tell Haru now! Order some food with Haru's card and we'll see you two at the beach! He keeps it in a wallet.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his phone, Makoto green eyes gazed up to glowing blue eyes staring intently at his small body. Harus kneeling position made him look like a greek statue carved from marble. Well if the ancienf Greeks decided a giant phallus sealed tight was suddenly to their tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to Sukishima. Better to hide you on a deserted island.\" Makoto smiled brightly as he looked up, getting Haru to close his eyes again and look away, hand moving forth to grasp Makoto. \"Whoa! H-Haru warn me when you do that!\" The giant rose from his spot, his gaze fixed towards the direction of the beach with Makoto held securely in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is worse than sitting!</i>. A quick jog unconcerned for the plight of people around him as the area shook beneath Haru's bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===At the pool=== <br>\r\nRei adjusted his glasses as he closed his phone, preparing himself for their new destination at the beach and Sukishima Island. \"Haru-senpai is in quite a pickle. Now where is Nagisa? He should have already gotten his things....\" A shadow had dipped something into the pools waters, before rising to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got them!\" Nagisa held up Haru's bag as he scared Rei from behind. The butterfly swimmer jumped back in surprise several feet. His hair and glasses disheleved briefly before quickly composing himself to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't scare me like that!\" With no time to wait he informed Nagisa. \"We'll be stopping by the nearest convenience store and buying whatever we can to feed Haru-senpai at the beach and for us. Then we'll head to Sukishima\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we gonna pay for all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Haru's card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's go Rei-chan! Haru-chan and Mako-chan are waiting! Haru-chans probably famished to feed that studly bod!\" The bubbly blond pushed the blue haired teen to run with him to head for the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Rei, Haru's bag began to shift as the zippermwas opened slightly. Inside resided a number of bottles of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater that Nagisa filled from the pool as Rei was distracted by texting, a mischievous grin crossed Nagisa's lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka Nanase = 5.1 meters (16'8 ft)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once in the beach, the two teen watched the ocean and the deserted islands far away.<br>\r\nThere was not a single soul there, not even Rei nor Nagisa had arrived yet. There were alone, with time to think how exactly they were going to reach their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had to travel to the main island, they went by boat. They couldn't hire one without revealing Haru's state to the captain and probably their giant friend wouldn't fit on one (probably it would sink under his weight).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they had swam around the islands during their training there, the archipelago seemed too far away from the mainland they were to reach it swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This idea isn't as good as I initially believed...\"<br>\r\n\"I can do it.\"<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usually mute boy looked at his a-head-taller-than-his-knee friend with confidence. Makoto read his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious... it's so far...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut couldn't help but to trust Haru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant extended his huge hands towards the other boy, who let himself be grabbed by those powerful hands and be placed on his nape, with his two legs surrounding his neck. Fearing he could fall at any moment, he hold tightly the other's dark-blue mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the gigantic dolphin jumped to the sea and started swimming faster than the quickest motorboats, for Makoto's dread, who still wasn't fully overcome his fobia to the open sea. Fortunately, they reached their destination before it overwhelmed the brown haired boy, who jumped to the sand and looked back to his giant friend slowly standing up from the horizontal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sea water trickled down Haru's body like a cascade, from his hair to his huge pecs and then to his abs, around his bulging crotch, covering his muscled legs before his immense feet and the ground. A godly vision that mesmerized Makoto, and got even better when the titan took his stretched trunks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing??\" Makoto exclaimed, covering his face with his hands, although he was still able to see his giant bird between the gap between his fingers.<br>\r\n\"It's wet and cold.\" Haru replied like undressing in front of another guy was normal... although maybe it was normal because as a member of the swimming club he had to get changed in front of his friends hundreds of times and Makoto had reacted beyond looking away politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe that was because Haru was different. If he shrank to his original body he would still be much more thick than his older self, with broader shoulders, killer pecs, a more prominent but toned ass and flaccid cock that fell halfway though his leg to his knee, easily thicker than Makoto's hard penis... which it was well above average. The tampered water had done to him more than just trebled his size, and being three times his height only emphasized those sexy features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru was now too hot for Makoto to ignore, which it says a lot about the boy's hidden sexuality. He still tried to act cool and unaffected while focusing in make a fire... although sometimes he unconsciously had a peek at his figure, who was sitting on the ground with his big dong between his crossed legs, and quickly looked the other side blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bonfire was on, its warm let the two boys relax for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is going to be okay.\" Makoto commented, noticing the sad grace of the usually inexpressive boy over the fire. \"Maybe this will fix itself. If it doesn't,  we'll find an antidote or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru smiled weakly, feeling a little better. The two swimmers stood next to each other in front of the fire. The night was peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going back to the beach, maybe the others are already there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru jumped to the sea (an incredible leap even for a giant 3 times taller than yesterday) and disappeared in the waters while a 3 meters (9') tall wave generated by him impacted against the coast and everything on it (in other words: Makoto).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown haired teen was too kind to curse, so he just came closer to the bonfire and removed his swimwear. According to how long Haru's took to reach the island the first time, he calculated he had over a quarter before their friends arrived, enough time to dry his trunks and himself and get dressed again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but after 8 minutes he heard a sound behind him. Makoto turned around to see it and then found out Haru could swim faster than he thought and all the gang was already there, looking at his nude body and his big, fat flaccid cock hanging in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe covered his genitals ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing naked?\" The childish Nagisa pointed in crotch.\"Wait... Haru's naked too!! What were you two doing here naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto tried to explain he was just drying his swimwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you're right, mine is wet too after riding Haru's back. And it is a little cold here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagisa removed his too, making Rei and Makoto more uncomfortable (Haru didn't care), but they didn't try to convince him to dress up (they knew the pinguin boy was a fan of naturism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent a nice night together, joking and sharing stories while they ate the snacks Nagisa had bought, enough for 12 people in anticipation to Haru's appetite. There were a lot of left overs because, curiously, Haru barely ate. He didn't felt ill, he just didn't feel hungry at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei wondered if the same transformation that increased his size and mass from the air also provided the calories his needed. Haru didn't show any symptom or weakness, which was a relief, and instead looked stronger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glasses boy wanted to make some test on his friend and the water to be sure, but he thought his transformation was benign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagisa heard his speech interested. The way Rei has explained it made it sound like Haru was now a superhero. The short boy would love to be super like him...<br>\r\nAnother thing that bothered him was Haru amazing, still nude, body, and the appendix it hanged between his legs. Clearly, it was a side effect of the metamorphosis... but after looking Makoto big dong and compared to his little one, shrank due to the cold, he wondered if everyone was bigger than his. He didn't like that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer for those two thoughts was inside the bottles inhis bag...</span></div></div>",

But eventually the highschoolers had to leave, as the following next was a school day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru acted as a ferry for them, bringing all of them but Makoto to mainland. The once tallest boy in the team had decided to spend the night in the island with Haru so he would not feel alone. He ended up sleeping over the torso of the giant boy, warm and quilted due to his greater muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning Haru swam like a torpedo to the other side to leave his friend there. After a few minutes getting over his dizziness, Makoto said goodbye to Haru, who disappeared under the water before anybody else could see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just the time to take a quick shower and race to his school with a toast in his mouth. There, he noticed the spare uniform he kept in his locker wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has it being stolen?\" He wondered worried \"But nothing else is missing.\" Including some money he put in there. \"No one but my friends know my password.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came alone. Makoto noticed something big was behind him, casting a shadow over him, and turned around. He saw the smiling baby face of his friend stuck to a body taller and muscular than his. And wearing his lost uniform, although it couldn't be buttoned up on his chest area (too thick there), nor cover fully his ankles and wrists (not long enough). He seemed to be a head taller than Makoto, so if he hadn't already reached 2 meters (6'8\") mark, he was close to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid tried to sell that as a natural overnight growth spurt. It's unnecessary for me to tell you he didn't buy his history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nagisa, why did you swim in the pool?? We don't know what long term effects might have in your health! Or if the growth continues until you have to hide like Haru!!\"<br>\r\n\"I told you I didn't swim in it.\" It wasn't technically a lie, as he had drunk the magic water. \"Maybe I got exposed in a different way, maybe our growth spurts are caused by a different thing or Haru's state is contagious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto raised an eyebrow. He knew how carefree Nagisa could be and how much he would like to be tall like most of the swimmers... even if he had to expose himself to that tainted water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto decided to leave him be, for the time being, but before leaving he asked him to alert him if he felt ill or experimented more changes.<br>\r\nThen the \"killer whale\" swimmer decided he had to get rid of the pool's water before someone stupid (another studient or Nagisa again) fancied a dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that would be harder than he thought...</span></div></div>",

Little did they know the grief it would cause... one little crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a light coating of blue flames covered Rin, power flowing into him. He thrashed about, grunting in discomfort due to the heat. Before long, with one swift movement, he threw his sheets off, somewhat relieved from the heat, revealing his lithe, somewhat athletic body. He was bare chested, sleeping only in a pair of blue pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly though, his grunts of discomfort turned pleasurable, especially as the flames licked near his crotch. He unconsciously began thrusting his hips forward, as blood began to move southwards, and slowly his hand began to move down his smooth skin towards the tent he had pitched, impressive both for his age and size. Gradually, his hand pulled it from the tight embrace of his pants, gently gripping it in a fit of pleasure, and unknowingly accelerating as his arm began to move repetitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin moaned, what was once a budding 6 pack now becoming an impressive full one, even as his impressive pecs began to bulge out, not quite full, but certainly getting there. His biceps began to expand as well, despite already being tensed from certain erotic activity. 15 inches gradually became 17, then 19, even as his movements accelerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven below his stroking, his legs were not immune from the change, his calves slowly becoming fuller, and his thighs became more defined as well. Even his ass fortunately was not spared, becoming fuller, not enough to protrude, but enough to be toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin moaned, feeling his release coming, while not consciously aware of it, and came it did. \"Ah!\" He moaned as he was soaked in a burst of pure pleasure. Unaware as well with each spurt that his hand was being forced more and more apart. What was impressive already was well, more impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently the flames retreated for now, having been exhausted enough to retreat to the seal, but now other things needed to be dealt with...</span></div></div>",

What the hell's going on!\" Rin muttered, shaking himself off as he finished his leak, shoving his enhanced manhood in his pants hastily, enjoying the bigger size, but how much tighter his pants were, if not for the fact they reminded him what situation he was in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paced nervously as he tried to decide whether or not to wake Yukio, who was still asleep, considering he was a pretty heavy sleeper. Plus, he hated getting woken up. 'This is bad, this is so bad! I mean, this is so cool, but soo bad!' He thought in a panic, his bare feet slapping against the cool floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his hair in frustration. He was in enough trouble with the Knights as is! If he's suddenly bulking up and growing with little to no difficulty. He gripped his neck, already imagining what Angel would love to do to him. 'Agh, I could have phrased that better!' he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed his arms in frustration, realizing how much colder he was. He looked over, Yukio must've opened one of the windows before he went to sleep. He rubbed his hands against himself, trying to get warmer, enjoying the feeling of his muscle under him. \"I suppose this isn't too bad, but still... I need to figure this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at Yukio, who had flipped over away from him, licking his lips. He did kind of want to take this for a test drive, reaching down, gliding his hand down his abs as he took his member in his own hand, reaching into his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh... maybe there are some perks...\" He moaned, using his other hand to pull himself out as he enjoyed the new feeling in his hands. \"Mmm, that feels even better...\" He was big for his age, probably due to being a demon, but with his added length, he might be able to use more than two hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up his pace, feeling his body heating up a bit, but not enough to make up for the chill. Honestly, what was Yukio thinking, keeping the window open in winter! Fortunately, he did have another source of warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, Rin let his flames up just a little bit, enough to coat him in a thin layer of warm, curling flames, unaware of their effects as they licked across his skin, saturating him fully, gradually making him swell more and more. Even his member started growing again, him imagining some random sexy girl giving him a blowjob, faces changing from Shiemi to Izumo, heck, even Shura. 'Damn, that feel good..' He thought, unaware of his body slowly expanding once more, consequences be damned.</span></div></div>",

This way he could stop the growth before things got unreasonable while leaving his self-stimulation uninterrupted. And so he continued to stroke his meat, feeling it slide as it grew between the grasp of his bulking fingers. As he did this the rest of his body grew taller and his arms muscles grew wider. He could feel his pajama top rip a bit as his chest expanded and his abs grew more defined. Only when his cock had reached one and a half feet in length did the demon shoot his mighty load. A load so mighty and so thick it filled his toilet with so much demonic seed that the water actually turned white. It was at some point during this magnificent release that he extinguished his unholy flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God,\" Rin said to himself with his tong sticking out from the pleasure. \"I don't know if you love me or hate me -given that I might be the antichrist - but thank you! Thank you for allowing me to have this power.\" Rin took off his pajama shirt and flexed his arms in front the mirror, grinning cheerfully as he did so. \"I mean, seriously, I look so fucking good right now. It's everything I never knew I wanted so badly. Thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Fujimoto had always told him to be thankful for God, even if he had nothing to with what he was thanking him for. \"Life is his gift, and so are the joys in it.\" He'd say.<br>\r\nWith pride and optimism Rin</span></div></div>",

The taste salty and a tad burnt. He quickly rose up as it forced him awake, eyes scrunched together in annoyance at whatever caused that. Snatching his hlasses to put them on, Yukio prepared to yell at whatever caused that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight before him left the Exorcist dumbfounded. The room was sprayed in white seed, his brothers nude bod on display with cum still leaking from his large cock. It looked like his sleeping brother was finished as his arms fell down to rest, a still hard cock rising upwards in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" He expected it was his big brothers fault all of this happened, unwilling to accept his own use of flames might have started it all as he got up. He avoided the spots covered in white goop as he traverse their room in the dark, his vision with glasses just decent enough to avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Im not cleaning this up. He better learn to summon a demon that does cleaning like Silky or a sex demon like Incubi/Succubi. They love this stuff.\" Yukio said with a disgusted look. \"Can't believe I swallowed some!\" Despite his increase in volume Rin snored happily away like nothing could wake him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukio reached over to his brother in a minute and saw his brothers appearance. \"He's different. I don't recall nii-san being so big. THAT especially\" as he glimpsed Rin's dick in full glory. A massive foot long cock with an equally impressive girth. \"Just what happened last night to cause this?\" And more importantly, why did he have a desire to touch it? That massive demonic phallus that could be used as a weapon combined with Rin's improved body. Eyeing him up again Yukio even felt jealosuly that it appeared Rin got taller too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it always Nii-san?\" He mumbled as he heard Rin happily start to speak in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-!

Whatever spiteful emotion fueled this action would be his regret. As the grip of both hands squeezing Rins now sensitive cock had the opposite reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~\" Rin moaned out as a geyser of cum came out, dousing both in a torrent of cum. Rin's body growing more with the unintended act. Biceps thickening to 23 inches, calves becoming more beautiful with every inch of muscle added to their beauty. His body inching higher till his younger twin could only stare into his magnificent beefy chest if Rin stood tall before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Yukio stood there. Covered head to toe in white seed.

'I should stop... this is Nii-san!' He thought, wondering what his brother would think if he saw his younger brother doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, harder....\" Rin moaned as Yukio slowly added his other hand, barely able to cover the thick shaft, while the tip still hung out of both of his hands. Every twitch of his arms sent small pulses through his brother as well, his pajama pants slowly growing tight around his growing legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's starting to look painful... maybe I can help?\" Yukio muttered, trying to justify this in his mind, Rin's goofy face blushing entirely. Gulping, Yukio got up on his twin's bed, the already suffering mattress squeaking under the added weight, as he got in between his legs, and Yukio leaned in close, giving the cock a minor lick as Rin moaned, and slowly he got in close, trying to take as much of the 13 inch cock as he could, the tremors sending shivers down his spine and tail, his biceps and pecs slowly growing, 25 inches as his pecs stuck out a few inches from his chest, nipples completely erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing at the taste of Rin's pre, Yukio looked up, seeing his twin's body slowly starting to glow with bits of his fire, starting at his head, and slowly spreading down, seeming to accelerate his growth somewhat. Yukio kept at it, and wondered what to do.... Should he stay... or should he keep at it, the flames drawing closer and closer....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time frame to decide was slowly getting narrower and narrower...</span></div></div>",

His minds ability to reason told him to run as fast as possible from Rin's growing form. Yet no matter how much Yukio thought about needing to stop logically, his enthralled state consumed by lust was winning out by a vast margin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukio still sucked the monstrous phallus as his hands continued to stroke the '15 inch pillar affectionately.<i> \"Maybe I can finish before it reaches me...\" </i>He weakly made an excuse as even his reason had finally tapped out. Eyes closed as he tenderly sucked and stroked, pre still oozing forth as the flames spread past Rin's six pack of cobblestone abs. Oddly Rin Okumura's body had not grown further since the flames danced upon his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held both hands still affectionately massaging the beastly dong as Rin still flushed red beneath his flames, rumbling of laughter emerging from Rin's throat. \"You two sure know how to please a guy!\" Rin still dreamed of those two, which began to tick off his brother. <i>\"I'm the one pleasing you! You need to think about me!\" </i>Yukio completely lost himself in his prideful passions as he began to grip the cock hard. He squeezed the throbbing demonic beast tightly as he worked harder than ever to drink the pre that spilled upwards from the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flames finally trailed across the half-demons dick and Yukio, the warm power of the flames combined with Yukio's fellating Rin had nearly brought him to climax. Rin snickered as his thick, powerful tail slithered about as the flames swallowed it in blue. It slipped its way to Yukios pants and.wrapped itself around Yukios own cock. The 7 inch hard dick rising to life as the black tail gripped it amd moved up and down to give the glasses wearing twin a tailjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmf!\" Yukio moaned as he enjoyed the tail trying to get himself off, working even harder to please Rins hypnotizing rod. Two more minutes passed before the blue flames finally engufed all of Rin's body. With its complete transition across him did the pent up cock make its biggest, and last, release for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA geyser of white erupted upwards into Yukios waiting maw, who welcomed it all as the tail tightened on his own cock. Yukios nightpants now dirty from the white cream that stained it and the black tail that slithered out. Yukio himself tried to swallow as much as he could, but it was coming so fast, and there was so much, his bloated belly couldn't take it all as he moved his face away. The geyser of white rammed into the ceiling for a good minute before ending. The spurts becoming smaller and smaller as it landed upon both. Sperm stuck to ceiling as it started to dloely move downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukio, released from his daze of desires and the enthralling call of Rin's now soft shaft, sat there for a good thirty seconds. His hair was disheveled and sticking in weird positions, his clothes wet, dirty, and sticky,. His stomach bloated from swallowing so much demon spunk. His face and hands covered in seed from sucking his brothers dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know what's going on with me.\" Jealously. Pride. Lust. Greed. Anger. had consumed him. It was as if Rin's new appearance had such an effect on humans, or at least made Yukio unable to continue suppressing his negative emotions. He examined Rin's final height. A towering 7'3 with a 16 inch cock. <i> \"That can't be true. He's still mostly human. Just...bigger.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even when those flames engulfed us I wanted to continue. Nay. Seeing him like that made me want it more!\" Looking as his cum stained hands Yukio felt he knew what comes next as he placed a hand on his face, a headache and a desire to ignore what he did coming to him. \"I need to rest. I can't deal with...this at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got off of Rin's bed, looking at Rin with envy as he still slept in peace before mentally slapping himself. \"No! None of that. I feel like being jealous of nii-san may have caused all this somehow\". He walked stairght for his bed. He didn't care if he stepped in anything as he simply went to lay down, rubbing his stomach as he went to lay down. A quick blanket wrapped around him as he heard Rin's deep snoring. Eventually slumber took him once again. But the younger twin never noticed as his belly shrank his clothes began to snuggly fit on him, tightening as the 511 boys body beefed out with some attractive muscle.</span></div></div>",

The young men and boys who make up its ranks already inside for the night. In a normally empty room were three human sized tables, where three pilots of Tekkadan were laying down as they waited undergoing the experimental procedure, a device connecting a tube directly to their arms veins. Mikazuki Angus, Mika for short, sat in silence as he looked around. A good few feet away was the much larger Akihiro Atland, laying in the middle table, and farthest was the lustful Norba Shino. The three had volunteered for the experiment, and were being prepped by assistants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHush was tending to Mika while Yamagi was preparing Norba and Derma aided Akihiro in preparation for what was to come. Above Orga and Eugene looked from the rooms doorway. \"I think we shouldn't do this Orga.\" the blonde man told his leader \"There's far too much danger in doing something that Mcgillis guy offered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll work fine. Once we've confirmed it works as he states it would we'll share it with the other pilots. Chad and Takaki might even see some use from it on earth since our base there is recent. As long as we move forward we'll get our dreams made into reality.\" The dark skinned, silver haired leader of Tekkadan replied. <i>I hope</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Three Weeks Earlier----<br>\r\nIt had been some time since Tekkadan proved their worth and bested Gjallahorn, their lowercase strong enough with their connections to Teiwaz to let them establish their earth base several months ago. Orga was sitting in his office as he awaited their ally in Gjallahorn, Mcgillis Fareed, call to come through. He had recently sent an unarmed batch of boxes containing an unknown substance through his Montag Company guise, and Orga wished to know what lies within its contents. In the room was Eugene, Mika, Akihiro, and Norba as the call finally came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orga Itsuka. You sent a message through my men on our Mars base about wanting to know about the contents I sent you, yes?\" His voice calm and collected as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know what it is, or I'll have to report to Gjallahorn about illegal content sent to Tekkadan.\" Orga replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. During the end of the Calamity War a scientist had been creating a new means for humans to fight the enemy using Nano-technology adapted to human biology, similar to the Nanomalite armor on mobile suits. The goal was to make humans strong enough to handle the Gundam Frames drawbacks without suffering damage to their bodies and brains-\" at those words Mika looked at his paralyzed right arm and touched his right eyelid, injuries sustained from the battle against Ein Graze. \"As well as heal their injuries. Unfortunately, although she completed the research the War had already ended, with Gjallahorn erasing her research and keeping the contents locked away and preserved for the last 300 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you want us to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is for you to decide. I will wait with anticipation for your answer. Farewell for now, Orga and Mikazuki.\" Mcgillis cut off, revealing he knew about the others despite their silence. With him gone the group turned towards Orga for what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you all think?\" Orga asked his comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm opposed to this. Who knows what shifty experiments that Mcgillis might be using us for?\" Eugene replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be fine if we test it. Better safe than dealing with an experience like Mika did.\" Akihiro replied with honesty. \"I'm for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I can get laid it shouldn't cause a problem. Better to enjoy life as long as possible.\" Shino proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use the free tool Choco-man gave us. We pilot gundam so we need protection\" Mika bluntly stated. The last to reply and staring intensely at Orga. Seeing that look on his face was all Orga needed to make the decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I'll have it set up and ready to use on you three. In a couple weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----The present----<br>\r\n\"Mikazuki I've got everything ready.\" Hush said as he turned on the machine. A humming sound began as it started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Mika replied as a silver liquid flowed into the tube and eventually into the veins in his paralyzed arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamagi and Derma had also finished, with Norba ruffling Yamagis hair while the blonde look frustrated. Akihiro pat Terms on the head, thanking his adoptive brother as the silver substance likewise flowed into him. The three moved back to where Eugene and Orga were as they watched  The machines continue to him as they channel the nanos into the three Gundam pilots, a warm and pleasant feeling spreading inside them as it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels good!\" Shino smirked as he felt the warmth  slowing down as they tapped out and the liquid stopped pouring. Yamagi covered in his eyes, blushing as he noticed that Shino was  turned on. His pants getting tight as a bulge showed. He felt even more embarrassed for being the only one to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does feel pleasant.\"  Akihiro mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm\" were the only sounds to leave Mika, feeling as if his body was in bliss. Unbeknowst to the short pilot of Barbatos the nanos were already working to fix his  body, his arm moving ever so slightly as he subconsciously clenched it into a fist. His eyes closed as his  right eye began to see once again. The process continuing for the three of them even as they start to call into pleasurable dream...</span></div></div>",

As it did an orange-haired, short, and energetic fellow rode his bike through the mountain as part of his daily training. Shoyo Hinata was riding his way on the road through the mountain, moving from the road to the trails that lay between the trees. \"I can't wait for today!\" The team was having another practice math with their rivals Nekoma, the Crows and Cats facing off once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to travel between the mountain on the path to Karasuno, only to slow down as he saw a mysterious pillar like object block the path. \"What's that!?\" he called out as he stopped several feet away. \"Wasn't here yesterday.\" Hinata got off his bike as he went over to check the pillar. \"I've got to move this or I'll have to backtrack and be late for school!\" Hinata placed his hands onto the pillar in order to move only for a voice to call out from the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop human!\" The voice called, its tone both gentle and deep. To Hinata it sounded like a male, so he assumes as such. \"That artifact must stay as is for four days and nights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata moved his hands off the pillar. \"But if I don't move it I'll be late!\" calling back to the voice. Not being the brightest bulb, he never questions why the voice calls him human. <i>Kageyama and Tsukishima will also start off making fun of me too!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, but in exchange for going back the other way I will grant a wish of yours.\" The voice called back. \"What is your wish that I, Daidarabotchi, can grant human?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? Well then sure.\" Hinata, really wanting a wish granted and not questioning the reasoning, began to thinand move back over to his back, getting ready to leave. \"I wish...\"</span></div></div>",

He always wanted to be a respected and skilled volleyball player despite of his small height, like his idol \"The small giant\". But in his sport an insufficient height is an important handicap, and if there is a chance to increase his height to match (or surpass) the other players he would take it without the slightest doubt. Also, he was tired of being the subject of jokes...<br>\r\n\"That counts like two wishes, young human.

Unfortunately for him, this other path was much longer than the first one and he had wasted too much time talking with the invisible \"Monolith\". He had less than 5 minutes to cycle 6km (3.7 Miles).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless some kind of miracle happened, he would surely arrive late, then the match would have already started by then, and he wouldn't be able to take part in it and he'd be lectured and mocked by everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut miracles never happen... unless you conclude a deal with invisible entities...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The greatest players need strength...\" The voice considered before casting a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the exhausted boy felt a surge of energy going through his body. His bike, which was starting to slowdown, sped up dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after that initial power rush, he started to decelerate again... his previously agile legs felt weird... numb... for a few seconds he almost couldn't move them... but then they began to beat like they were a heart, blowing up their muscles with each beat. After a few spasms, they had almost doubled their original girth, with incredibly toned quadriceps and calves... His new, herculean legs propelled his bicycle faster than any pro cyclist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the spell focused in his upper body... The stiffness came back, but this time affected his arms, shoulders, chest... His arms were completely rigid, frozen in a long spasm, and that's a problem when you're going incredible fast on the middle of a mountain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a big tree in front of him, he was going to collide in seconds unless he recovered his mobility. The orange haired boy clenched his teeth, trying to change the direction, but there was no use, they refused to obey him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the voice added, \"They need strength, as much as possible, and also quick reflexes to use it properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike his legs, his arms and torso gained pounds of muscle in seconds, the sport shirt he brought almost to the ripping point from the rising pecs, delts and abs... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy didn't regain control over his arms until he was about to crash in less than a second... and with incredible reflexes, he was able to change the course and avoid the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after the life endangering experience, he didn't slow down... instead, he went faster. Maybe he wasn't aware of his new strength... in the last minute, he had packed a lot of muscle, the same as a professional gymnast, which looked weird on his short 164cm (5'5\") frame. But that was the next thing to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to leave the mountain, and he could see the school from faraway. He had less than 2 minutes to reach it. He kept pedaling as he went downhill, and as he descended, Daidarabotchi\u2019s voice echoed in the forest behind\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut strength and speed isn\u2019t everything\u2026 A great player has to have a great range\u2026 reach\u2026 so be his body as big as it must be to achieve it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata frowned as he felt pain in every bone in his body\u2026 growing pains, as his extremities and torso started to lengthen. The border of his shirt rose, showing the last row of abdominals, then his navel and finally his whole 6-pack.<br>\r\nAnd his feet grew at a steady pace, from his size 6 (36.5EU) to a humongous size 16 (46.5EU), obviously bursting the shoes during the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis longer legs had to bend a lot to pedal, making it harder and uncomfortable, but that didn\u2019t stop him, neither the fact he looked ridiculous on a bike so small, wearing clothes equally short...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to worry about those things: He only had one minute to reach the school. He had arrived at the suburbs in record time thanks to his new powerful body, but there still were a dozen of blocks between him and the finish line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the more great sportsmen have...\u201d The spirit admitted hesitantly, \u201cI confess I know no thing about that sport called Volleyball\u2026 but I know another thing which the great men are known for\u2026 a thing which will end our deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden in the cloth, a small soft extremity of no more than 7cm (2.75\u201d) became numb\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ping*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hidden, pink piece of meat shook, gaining two extra centimeters (0.8\u201d) and a little girth and sending an intense signal of pleasure that surprised his owner, who decreased the pace for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*piiing*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meat rode twitched again in a longer spasm which added 3cm more (1.2\u201d) and a sensible increase in thickness. The 12cm (4.7\u201d) manhood, still in his soft state, had almost matched his old hard-on, and it started to feel a little constricted there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn\u2019t help but moan a little when it happened. Distracted by the intermittent pleasure, he stopped pedaling, coasting slowly through the street... until he experimented a big one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* PiiiIIIInPiIIng PING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dick expanded 6cm (2.3\u201d) further, in waves of growth and pleasure that almost threw him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough. The wish is fulfilled, so my duty.\u201d Said the voice before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy got up slowly, unable to process what had happened to him. He was meters away from the school entrance. He went in, and saw a few cute schoolgirls looking at him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t used to that kind of attention, but he liked it, and his new dimensions (he was almost 2 heads taller than them) gave him confidence to answer waveringly, maybe with a little too much enthusiasm. The girl responded giggling. After a few seconds, the boy realized the reason of their laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis oversized cock was poking over the trouser leg of his sport shorts (which, by the way, were now a few sizes too small, like all his clothing). As red as a tomato, he ran to a corner to adjust his junk, but it took a few tries. It was so long that it always ended up falling again through the trouser leg before he entered into the gymnasium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe met his friends there, and there weren\u2019t especially happy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re late, Shrimp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming voice shook the former midget. It was Kei Tsukishima. Or a giant version of the blonde blocker. He had undergone the same transformation as Hinata, and he was huge\u2026 nearly three heads taller and muscular, with an ego even bigger than before. Tobio Kageyama wasn\u2019t far, and he was one and a half heads taller than the orange haired boy. The other teammates were taller than him too, between Kageyama\u2019s height and his. The only one who didn\u2019t tower over him was Nishinoya, half a head shorter than him. Everyone was wearing clothes that were multiple sizes too small (except Nishinoya, who had stolen Tobio\u2019s spare uniform from his locker)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wish had worked. Together, they were the tallest volleyball team (in Japan? The world?), but the growth spell had respected the height differences between teammates (worse: it had increased them) and Hinata still was the shorty of the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(although maybe that could change\u2026)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hinata was dealing with his pissed-off friends, Nekoma entered the room.</span></div></div>",

Captain Daichi replied back as he walked over to the now short Kuroo. Their silver haired vice captain Sugawara joining Daichi in conversing with him. Hinata wanted to listen in on their conversation, and even noticed Daichi was a lot thcker compared to the rest of them after the growth now that he had a good look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it. Most of Japan may have a problem with you guys being so big but not having any rival schools to play against just isn't fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully Date Tech and Fukorodani like to practice with us as well.

The three continuing to converse as Hinata lost interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't get what the Heavenly Blessing was about as he looked over to Lev and Kaiba, his face beaming as he realized the taller Lev was now shorter than him. \"Hey Nekoma!\" Hinata beamed as he quickly ran over and jumping over to him. Barely landing before the blonde he could have crushed underneath his new size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't jump at people idiot!\" Kageyama yelled at him. Annoyed at his typical idiocy while Tsukishima snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Hinata. Have you gotten even bigger?\" The demure Kenma asked as he looked up at him, trying to not focus on the cock peeking out of his shorts. Something the rest of Nekoma High also try to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I? I haven't really noticed\" Hinata fibbed, mostly cause of how everyone seems so casual about their growth spurts. Not their coach, not the girls, not the rest of the team, or even their now short rivals Nekoma high. Hinata started to believe his encounters with the stone pillar was just a fantasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you've definitely gained a couple of inches!\" Lev said enthused. \"I want to see how high you can jump now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven a chance to show off, Hinata wanted to take it only for a hand to grab him by his shirt. \"This idiot won't be doing that in doors. He nearly hit his head on the roof last time he jumped with full strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was awesome seeing how high Hinata jumped\" Tanaka butted in. The shaved head Wing Spiker was shirtless and showing off his formidable bod, only Daichi's own surpassing Tanaka's \"We even betted that Hinata could jump through the roof when he gets big enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Nekoma was more stunned than anything while the thought of facing Hinata only made Lev more pumped. \"But what are you going to do about clothes? Your uniforms are the old ones you wear. Weren't there new ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah you're right! I need to get into something new!\" Hinata just remembered how tight his clothes are. Tsukishima snickered as Yamaguchi just hid behind his now even taller friend, too embarrassed to let others see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember Hinata? Tanaka and Nishinoya ruined them showing off to Kiyoko. Our new ones won't arrive till tomorrow.\" Yamaguchi said from behind Tsukishima. Not sure if he wanted to participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Hinata replied with honesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough catching up! Let's start the match!\" Both coaches said, and Hinata finally noticed their coach Keishin Ukai himself was also big. He was nearly Tsukishima's height, but with strong muscles as a former Karasuno volleyball player. The blonde was massive next to the tiny managers and tiny Advisor Takeda, with tight but fitting clothes that showed off his biceps and calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all separated as the two teams prepared to face off.</span></div></div>",

Their stamina had been increased by the Hinata's wish, the same about their reflexes and strength (the biggest players, Tsukishima and Asahi, could lift a car with their bare hands... an impressive feat of power, but with little use on Volleyball).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they should be able to defeat Nekoma easily, right? But there was a little aspect of the team the wish didn't affect (maybe, it worsened it indirectly): teamwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, on one occasion Hinata had an easy shot, but while he was jumping a long arm overtook him and did the shot.<br>\r\nOf course the arm belonged to Kei, who simply smirked at Hinata's complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Low players should limit themselves to low balls.\" It was his only answer.<br>\r\n\"Who are you calling LOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boing* The ball landed between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't argue in the middle of a match and focus on the game, morons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKageyama's yell stopped their discussion, but their conflict was far from over. As the match progressed, they often tried to humiliate the other or prove their worth taking complicated shots, shots which could have been received safer by other players, often bothering the others... Ken's play didn't suffer much for this stupid competition, Hinata's did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe icing on the cake was that most of the team wasn't used to their new heights (in this altered universe, they were normal teenagers until the last year/s, when they grew really quickly), making them clumsier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose two problems messed with the team's dynamics. They didn't lose this time because they were volleyball monsters magically empowered, but the normal teenagers from Nekoman shouldn't have been so close to victory again Karasuno. That worried the coach Keishin, who feared he wasn't doing a good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team problems escalated when Kageyama joined to the argument. He didn't approve Hinata's behavior during the match, but he was specially pissed off by Kei, who in multiple times interfered with his perfect passes to Hinata. And Yamaguchi took Kei's side in the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeishin was watching it all when he had an idea \"Ok, it's enough.\" He separated them \"I think I know what your problem is: you need to learn how to work as a team. So as your coach, I'm going to give you some homework... some bonding activity... Know! You four will have a sleepover!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey protested, but Keishin had already made his decision... Hinata drew the shortest straw, so the sleepover would be in his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, guys, please come here\" Hitoka asked them while they were still trying to make the coach change his mind \"We want to measure your heights.\"<br>\r\n\"Again?\"<br>\r\n\"You have been growing so fast lately probably our reports are already outdated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\nDaichi Sawamura\t- 214cm<br>\r\nK\u014dshi Sugawara\t\t- 210cm<br>\r\nAsahi Azumane\t\t- 236cm<br>\r\nY\u016b Nishinoya\t\t- 182cm<br>\r\nRy\u016bnosuke Tanaka\t- 218cm<br>\r\nChikara Ennoshita\t- 219cm\t<br>\r\nHisashi Kinoshita\t- 215cm\t<br>\r\nKazuhito Narita\t\t- 220cm<br>\r\nTobio Kageyama\t- 224cm<br>\r\nSh\u014dy\u014d Hinata\t\t- 195cm<br>\r\nKei Tsukishima\t\t- 247cm<br>\r\nTadashi Yamaguchi \t- 220cm<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A team with an average height of 216cm (7'1) and every month they're higher...

As if that's true...\" Tsukishima said arrogantly, dismissing it entirely. Neither Yamaguchi and Kageyama believed it either, but Hinata's interests was piqued as he heard those words about a Blessing again. \"<i>Is it the stone pillar...nah that was a dream I think?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again, the older man realized Tsukishima would learn it personally at this rate. \"Alright then. I'll let you four go now. Behave at miss Shoyo's or you'll be reprimanded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes coach!\" The four said as Kageyama let go of Hinata's arm and they started to stretch save for Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Shouldn't you get your bikes?\" Hinata asked as he went for his. The comically small bike for someone as tall as Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Yamaguchi replied. The freckled boy replied as he stretched his 220 cm toned frame. \"None of us use bikes anymore. It's easier and faster to just run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah idiot. You've been running each day to school remember? Don't know why you rode that bike.\" Kageyama spoke in his pissed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I forget\" Hinata tried to pass it off as ditzyness, but he was starting to feel weird and isolated with how everyone remembered things different from him. \"<i>Ill ask Natsu when I get home. If I have always been big then I definitely must be remebering wrong</i>\" Tsukishima snickered at Hinata's memory problems. \"So what should I do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully their positively tiny advisor Ittetsu Takeda spoke up to his bigger student \"You can leave it here. Ukai can take it to your home tomorrow when he checks to make sure you guys don't damage anything like you did at Kageyamas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what happened at Kageyamas Hinata beamed with gratitude as he handed the bike over. \"Thanks sensei!\" Turning to look at the other boys, Hinata noticed the other three were already gone \"Hey wait for me!\" Waving back he quickly ran at amazing speed to reach them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran, Kei Tsukishima's height would soon diminish as his 52 cm would soon be shared with Hinata and Kageyama...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the middle of the forest, the dark monolith signed gloomy. He only intended to help Hinata's current team, but his vague wish had accidentally created an alternative reality with a new history that forced him to continuously help a high school team. Keishin's body was the evidence the blessing had been present a decade ago, and probably it would stay active for the next generations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Yatagarasu haven't got any affection for humans, so he couldn't dislike more the idea of spending a part of his power in helping brats until the end of days. That waste of power might delay or even cancel the plan he had been preparing his whole life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think The Blessing is just a consequence of a badly granted wish.\" The monolith thought about in solitude. \"A punishment for me, because I couldn't fulfill entirely his command. I made Karasuno the tallest team, I improved their skills, but they still don't work well as a team... and maybe some of my changes worsened their teamwork. As long as they can be defeated due those deficiencies, the can't be the biggest team in the world... but If I fix it and make them truly unbeatable, the wish will be fully granted and I could stop this bless business and go on with my personal projects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monolith shook a little, and from its top a crow as black as the dark stone flew out. The bird, which looked exactly like a crow but bigger and with three legs, overflew the city until he sensed the presence of Hinata and landed just on the roof of his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see the orange haired kid through the window. He was talking with his little sister, who wasn't affected by the wish nor remember how short he was the original reality. The difference of height between them was almost hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did I grow so tall?\" Hinata, who partially remembered the old reality, had been examining his album and noticed that, although he was very tall in the recent photos, in the old ones from third year from middle school he looked very short, as short as before the wish.<br>\r\n\"Eh...? How could you not remember your own growth...?\" His brother shrugged. Natsu had to give him a reply \"Well... just when you started your first year in high school you began to sprout up... the first week you grew 5cm (2\")... and the next ones you grew even bigger. Everyone was pretty surprised, but the doctors said you were completely healthy, just a late bloomer. I heard all your friends from the team grew a lot too, I guess it's something sometimes happens to the boys...\"<br>\r\n\"What about my clothes...? I was trying to find well fitting clothes to wear tomorrow, but everything is too small for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Mom didn't have time to get you new clothes since you last growth spurt this week... she said your new custom size uniform would take some time to be delivered... but I think she gave you some money so you could buy some new informal clothes tomorrow... didn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why my wallet was so full.\" He thought. He said \"was\" because he had already spent half of it videogames that afternoon... he prayed he had enough for at least a decent t-shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're acting really strangely today, brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the house, the demoniac crow kept watching him. The fact Hinata 'kinda' remembered the changes it was a little troublesome for him. If he remembered him and his wish, he could come to visit him again and force him to grant more wishes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, his team mates arrived. The japanese house felt already quite small for the 195cm tall (6'5) Hinata, but for two 220+ cm (7'3\"+) teens like Kageyama and Yamaguchi it was really uncomfortable, with its small doors and a furniture adapted to the short family (well, they were, until Hinata's growth spurt). They didn't complained though, they suffered the same problems everywhere and they had accepted it like the price of being so tall in Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukishima arrived a 10 minutes later, whatever problem his friends had with the house he had it multiplied by 10. To begin with, he had to kneel to pass through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice doll house.\" He never let the opportunity of mocking Hinata pass.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry for not having a house as big as yours, Stingyshima!\" The shorter kid talked back mad.<br>\r\n\"I hope you have bedrooms bigger than this tiny hall, or everyone will have rough night.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Hinata didn't have any spare bedroom, the living room was a mess so no one could sleep in the couch...<br>\r\nThe only option was sharing Hinata's bedroom. It never felt big enough for one tiny teenager, not to mention 4 giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuki let out a guffaw when it saw it... a few seconds added \"Oh shit, you're serious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice, Tsukki...\" His friend Yamaguchi interfered.<br>\r\n\"Look, Tsukishima, I know you don't fancy a sleepover...\" Kageyama confessed \"Me neither, but it's an order from our coach, so let's behave during the rest of the night so we can get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easier said than done, but at least Tsukishima tried, shutting his mouth for a while... until the next source of friction a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was laying in the only bed in the room reading manga, while his guests were preparing their futons (the bed was barely big enough for him, even less for the others) when he saw something that startled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsukishima, what are you doing??\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis team mate start undressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm changing... Did you believe I would sleep with my outdoor clothes?\" He dropped his pants, showing (more like shamelessly exhibiting) the enormous package of his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your underpants are weird...\" The orange-haired boy noticed, with a little blushing in his face.<br>\r\n\"It's a jockstrap. It holds and protects the sportsmen's dick... if you had used it, you would have saved many embarrassing moments.\"<br>\r\n\"Everyone in the team uses them, Hinata.\" Yamaguchi added. \"It's not like we had a choice.\"<br>\r\n\"Specially me.\" The 4 eyes said with a evilish smile as he took off his strap slowly, showing his humongous cock to everyone. It was 28cm long (11\") and incredible fat, hanging freely half way his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My jockstrap has to be custom made, they don't normally sell ones as big.\" Kei kept bragging. \"And every month I have to order a new... this one feels already a little tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, as red as a tomato, tried to look away from the hypnotic movements of his giant penis, but Tsukishima, noticing his discomfort and what it caused, he approached to him, moving his cock closer to his red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Hinata... did I made you hard?\" He smiled with an evil shine in his eyes. \"...at least now it's big enough my strap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true... Hinata could have died of shame. Yamaguchi couldn't help laugh a little, although Kageyama didn't find it funny at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it off, Tsukishima!\" He pushed aside the giant jerk, who then moved closer to the other 1st year and looked at him menacingly from the heights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYatagarasu had seen enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's obvious who is the main source of discord in the team.\" He sentenced. \"No matter how talented he is, he needs a punishment... at least until he learns to be a better team mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon crow flapped his wings, preparing a spell...</span></div></div>",

It the shrinking kept going, he wouldn't have to put some pants to hide his manhood, the oversized shirt would cover it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opposite thing was happening to Kageyama and Hinata, whose clothes were becoming too tight and short for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think you should chill out a little, Tsukki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamaguchi seemed slightly taller than him too, but Kei was sure he had always been shorter, that's why he reminded him of a lap dog...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukishima felt he was loosing it, he needed a place to lay and calm down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move it, shrimp\" He jumped to the bed and pushed away Hinata from it. He was still taller than him, but just for a few centimeters \"I'm not going to sleep in the floor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukishima was used to sleep in comfortable beds, but Shoyo's bed didn't fit his standards, too small for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother weird shrivering, and the bed seemed to be big enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to think more about it, he wrapped himself by blankets and got ready to sleep.

An annoyed look on his face as he dreamed of Asta and Yuno being small and himself a mountain in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n217cm -&gt; 207cm<br>\r\n239cm -&gt; 244cm<br>\r\n210cm -&gt; 215cm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was observing his body after his new height, seeing more muscle to go with his new frame. The only one who could tell the difference, but the others remained ignorant. Seeing Kageyama at around Kei's former height was quite a sight.<i> \"This all confuses me. Sensei is probably right it's a curse making Stingyshima shrink.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot stop standing around and lets get to sleep\" An annoyed Kageyama spoke as him and Yamaguchi were already laying upon the floor in a room too small for four 7' (213 cm) players. Hinata was brought out of his momentary thoughts as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right!\" He moved down next to the two, grabbing a blanket and pillow to lay down. After a bit of readjusting between all three to get comfortable. They soon fell to sleep like Kei, and with it the last growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n207cm -&gt; 195cm<br>\r\n244cm -&gt; 250cm<br>\r\n215cm -&gt; 221cm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several hours the room was quiet as the four slumbered. Until an orange head of hair sat up. \"Gotta take a leak\" Hinata thought as he headed for the bathroom in his very tight clothes, exiting his room as quietly as possible, which still resulted in him bumping his head into the tip of the open door. \"Ow!\" He let out,, but thankfully the other three still snoozed away. Sighing in relief as he closed the door. Not noticing Kageyama's eyelids start to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his friends asleep Hinata started to take in how much smaller his home is. \"Kinda awesome\" Hinata smirked as he stood so high and wide in the hallway as he moved for the bathroom. Taking in how small the stools for washing off and the bath are quickly passed. He pulled his shorts down and was surprise by the size of his dick. 10 inches (25 cm) and nearly rivaling Tsukishima's in length and width. \"Can't wait to show it off!\" Hinata chuckled in confidence. A minute later he was finished using the toilet and went to wash his hands. That's when the door began to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata I'm coming in.\" Kageyamas voice called as he opened the door and entered. The black haired boy with a perpetual look of annoyance bent his head below the doorframe as he looked at Hinata. \"Wanna clean off with me Hinata?\" He spoke calmly without his usual nickname for Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clean off?\" Hinata asked as he saw Kageyama pull off his shorts, a large 12.5 inch (32 cm) cock standing proud. It was as wide as Kei's but the blushing Hinata found his more impressive. Soon Kageyama brought one hand to Hinata's nicely toned chest, which had gained a little more beef thanks to the 26 cm from Kei. His wider shoulders shuddered as Hinata was surprised by Kageyama moving his head down, giving Hinata a quick kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kageyama!?\" He was surprised by how foward he was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Hinata with his dark eyes, Tobio Kageyama smirked. \"So wanna do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Hinata's face flushed red at that statement. \"Bakageyama! We can't do that in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Kageyama refuted it as he locked the doorknob. \"No one else is awake. And if we do it now we can wash off afterwards. Though we will have to stand. Your bath and stools are too small for proper bathing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but what if Tsukishima or Yamaguchi need to use the restroom?\" He half heartedly replied, pulling off his shorts to let his cock be free, the two like mighty spears colliding with each other thanks to their freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they can go outside. If its your sister Natsu we'll just get dressed as fast as possible.\" Kageyama and Hinata pulled off their shirts before moving in to kiss. Toned arms wrapping around each other as they kiss.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once they had finished the two informed him Kei left, acting as if something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Tsukki has always had to deal with not growing like the rest of us after all. I do hope he comes back. That's why sensei had us stay the night eight?\" Yamaguchi asked as they put on a movie to watch in the living room. Natsu joining the three not to long after as she jumped onto the shoulders of her now much bigger brother who sat comfortably on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Though I don't mind that we had to stay today anyways.\" Tobio gave a creepy smile as he looked at Hinata, making the orange haired and freckled boys blushing as they knew what he meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Ukai had stopped by later with Hinata's bike as he promised the day before. Taking off his shoes once Natau let him in, the large coach crouched his head to enter and saw only three boys in the house. \"Where's Kei?\" They explained his running away to the coach, who sighed at the one who caused this with his antagonism was the one who opted out. Not that it surprised him much. \"I'm going to have to bench him from now on if he doesn't start playing with others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamaguchi got up, a sincere look in his eyes as he said \"Let me talk to Tsukki! I'll get hom to start taking others into consideration!\" Thanks to having grown while Tsukishima had not, there had even been antagonism from Kei towards his formerly shorter friend. Yamaguchi had let it bottle up for awhile. Not playing with Tsukishima, however, was unacceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that then. As for you two\" Looking over Hinata and Kageyama as Yamaguchi headed to leave. Both of whom were sitting awefully close he merely smiled \"Good job holding out and not fighting too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks coach!\" Both bowed as he headed to leave. Natsu likewise left, planning to go out and play with some friends. Leaving the two massive dark and orange haired giants by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell for a few minutes as both were unsure where to go with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we boyfriends now?\" Hinata asked Tobio, but Kageyama looked as unsure as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not sure? Part of why I did that was to soothe your nerves. You and Tsukishima had been fighting a lot ever since you grew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he was big too!\" Hinata spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tobio asked. Hinata finally let out all he knew about  the mysterious pillar he came across and how they all grew that day. Then Kei Tsukishima  was a huge jerk with his new size. Followed later by coach Ukai mentioned the Blessing of Yatagarasu would punish Kei if he didn't stop. Now he was tiny while Hinata and Kageyama were bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...a lot to take in.\" Kageyama admitted as he knew Hinata had to no reason to lie, yet was so different from what he's known ever since he started growing after entering Karasuno. \"Do you want to tell the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will they believe me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likely not. But I can help you deal with it you idiot.\" Kageyama affectionately called the now bigger orange haired boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think we should become boyfriends?\"' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's up to the both of us. Do you want to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just violleyball at the time for me! Dating someone on top of it would be too much!\" Hinata asmitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll not be boyfriends. We can help each other otherwise when we need it.\" Kageyama hoped he realized what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With schoolwork? Nope didn't get it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With stress and getting relief idiot!\" Now Kageyama was pissed. \"If you need help with ''that'' rod of yours let me know. I can let you fuck me next time okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? Thanks Kageyama!\" He said happily as he went and hugged Tobio, the black haired boy nestled into him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome idiot.\"</span></div></div>",

When he was almost there, saw the lights were on. He entered in the gym discreetly and recognized the intruder: Kei Tsukishima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now-shorter-than-average boy was jumping in front of the basket, trying incessantly to touch its board, falling in every attempt. It was clear for Ukai he was testing his Jumping Reach, one of the things the coach had measured the previous day. After shrinking so much, his jumping reach was way below Hinata's before the wish... he was as short as him, but he lacked of Hinata's natural talent to jump so his results were much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one attempt specially desperate for reach the basket, Kei fell badly to the ground. The boy was painting and covered with sweat, but somehow he found strength to stand up again. His coach wondered for how long he had been doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sent a quick message to Yamaguchi and went to the boy. He avoided stepping some papers scattered all over the floor... they were reports of the stats of the team he and the manager had gathered after months of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you hadn't just training here.\" Ukai commented with one of the pages in his hand \"Although I would recommend a different type of exercise to just jumping there...\"<br>\r\n\"The reports are wrong\" The angry little boy replied before doing another jump.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n\"My data is wrong. I remember my Jumping Reach was 334cm... no, wait, I remember I almost touch the gym ceiling with my fingertips yesterday...\" He clentched his teeths \"Why can't I remember it well? I'm sure I was second to none yesterday, and now those papers said I'm worse even than Nishinoya!! Worse, and shorter!!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't understand what your saying...\" Ukai thought it was crazy talk, but he didn't want to upset his pupil more \"but I think you had been under too much pressure lately. Do you want to sit down here and talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei stayed frozen for a moment. He didn't want to have a talk with the coach who forced him to sleep in Hinata's, but it was undeniable his poor jumping wasn't going to change no matter how much times he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally sat besides him in the floor and caught his breath. And then he started to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your height is a delicate topic for you... but you shouldn't let it affect you. You're like you are.\"<br>\r\n\"But I feel I lost everything good I had... and became the joke of the team! Everyone are fucking titans, superheroes, whereas I'm the weakest link, an encumbrance, a...\" He made a pause, like he had had a revelation. \"...shrimp.\"<br>\r\n\"Being good at Volleyball is important, but I think friendship and fun is even more. Just accept your limitations and just try to be nicer with your team mates... you'll start enjoying working with them, even if you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach!!\" Tsukishima grabbed his broad shoulders.\"I remember you talking about Heavenly Blessing of Karasuno... and how Yatagarasu stole size from players who bullied his mates...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, that? That's just a local myth, a joke between players to explain why everyone of this team grow so tall... but actually it's just a coincident it happened.\"<br>\r\n\"No, the blessing is real, and the punishment too! I was tall until the Yatagarasu punished me by making me short!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tsukishima, you're not serious... You had always being this size since you joined.\"<br>\r\n\"I think it also changed your memories...\" Kei's voice faded, unable to defend his crazy (but true) hypothesis.<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkai started to remember something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back in my school days, when I was a member of the team, I sometimes played some practical jokes on my teammates... after one specially bad, I recall I had a long nightmare... In that dream, I became really short and weak, the smallest in our team.\" Kei's eyes were wide-open. \"It was humilliating... but in the dream I started to behave better, I apologized to my friends and made up for my pranks... and then I waked up, and I was tall again... actually, it seems I hit a growth spurt during that dream and became the tallest of my team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that dream was real, and all was Yatagarasu's doing. If that's true, you have to become a better teammate and person to recover your height.\"<br>\r\n\"A better person...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach's phone beeped, he had received a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I have to go... Think about what I said.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach headed to the door.</span></div></div>",

He's a little... agitated now. I hope you can help him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the student watched a strange scene. Kei was finishing cleaning the floor as fast as he could. When he did it, he ran to a wall filled with marks and made another one over the top of his head. The new mark was at the same height than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. What am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Yamaguchi? Are you fine?\"<br>\r\n\"As fine as I can be now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked to the changing room. He didn't really want to talk to him. He considered him his friend (kinda), but he also used to think of him like a inferior player, not even near his level. Now the papers had changed, and the flecked boy seemed so big and powerful at 220cm tall... He hated that, hated to feel so inferior...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Yamaguchi followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried. You fled the house...\"<br>\r\n\"I was sick of being with Hinata and Kageyama. This punishment was stupid.\"<br>\r\n\"But it was kind of funny being with everyone... well, until you started to mock Hinata.\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukishima headed to the showers, hoping he wouldn't follow him there. He was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone. I want to take a shover.\" He demanded as he undressed fast and hided in one of the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking he had finally given up, he opened the tap and got covered by the water. Then he noticed a presence behind him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could make use of one too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamaguchi was behind him, naked, ready to have a shower. That close look of his body was the ultimate humiliation for the incredible shrinking Kei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head didn't reach his nice pectorals.<br>\r\nHis abs were remarkable, unlike Tsukki plain stomach.<br>\r\nHis arms and legs pretty muscular.<br>\r\nAnd a long penis were hanging under his crotch. A penis two times bigger (actually a little more) than his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate it.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I hate you... me.\" He corrected himself with a trembling voice \"I hate what I've become. I was the greatest, and now I'm just a weakling between giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The things aren't like that... you're not a bad player, Tsukishima. You can't hit the ceiling like Hinata, but you can do other amazing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei raised an eyebrow, unable to guess what he was talking about. He was lost all his size and muscle, what does it was left?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admire your analytical mind. How you can anticipate the other's movements. Quite amazing.\"<br>\r\n\"That might be true\" He thought \"But it doesn't compensate my lacks.\"<br>\r\n\"You're smart outside the field... you always get good marks... and you kept helping me with my tests even after getting sick and getting rid of Kageyama and Hinata.<br>\r\n\"Teaching one was easier than three...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but teaching none is even easier... you help me although you don't have to. I'll always thank you for that.\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"Also you're comfindent and cool, and I usually like your attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamaguchi's flattery was effective, Tsukishima was feeling a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... cool too...\" He admited very lowly.<br>\r\n\"Did you said something?\" The flecked boy couldn't heard his voice over the sound of the water.<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"Also, you're cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei's face flushed by his words. Yamaguchi did too, he wasn't sure why he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No man in the world wants to be called 'cute'!\"<br>\r\n\"But it's the truth! And that's a good thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukishima spent the next seconds observing his friend. Despite how buff and tall he was...or his huge cock... his shy face was incredibly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute.\" Tsukki said without thinking.<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n\"You're cute too. And cool! you're a great player, never forget that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Yamaguchi was the one blushing. His face became even more red when Tsukishima hugged his huge body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the one who should thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei felt a pleasant tingle over his body. He thought it was caused by hugging a naked hottie, but it was actually a Yatagarasu's reward, a 5cm growth spurt.</span></div></div>",

Cold water spurt forth and rained down upon the ground. Fifteen seconds passed before the water warmed and the two walked into the falling water. \"It's warmer now.\" Tsukishima said as he he hugged Yamaguchi, the freckled boy blushing as he hugged him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I want to have a nice time with you Tsukki.\" Yamaguchi moved down to kissthe shorter Kei, the glasses wearing boy blushing as he moved his head up so their lips could make contact. As if in response his body gained 5 more cm to make reaching up to the larger Yamaguchi easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThd twos hands started trailing the others as they kiss, more for Tsukishima to explore compared to Yamaguchi caressing Kei's smaller height. Soon hands trailed down as Kei gripped his friends large thick cock, bringing his hands gently around the tip of the head as he doftly caressed it. Pre started to leak, and not wanting to waste it Tsukishima broke the kiss to put his friends thick rod in his mouth. His tongue started to caress it softly while Yamaguchi blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-tsukki!\" Yamaguchi gripped his blonde hair with one hand as his cock moved back and forth as Kei's tongue continue to tease him. With that he felt it gushing \"Cumming!\" and a thick torrent of seed went down Tsukishima's throat, his belly expanding as he gained 10cm. As Kei released it from his mouth, a smaller spurt getting on his face, he smiled as he began to lick it. The droplets washing out what he didn't get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't plan on swallowing it.\" Kei Ttukishima admitted as he looked up at Yamaguchi, not noticing he was closer to him. His muscles more defined, his cock rising higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freckled boy blushed as he heard that. He bent down more, moving his neck around Kei's own. \"Wrap your arms around my neck.\" Tsukishima did as asked, wrapping them around his friends thicker neck. Soon he felt Yamaguchi gripping his tighs with his hands, positioning them around his thicker waist as he used his stronger body to stand. \"Hold on tight Tsukki\" Kei did as ordered as he wrapped both around him as Yamaguchi stood proud and tall, his large cock positioned on Kei's butt as they looked at each other face to face. Yamaguchi's throbbing ten inch (25 cm) on the verge of entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I Tsukki?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" With his consent Yamaguchi thrust inside. Kei let out a groan as the size was greater than he expected, slowly moving inside him with each thrusts. Yet it felt slightly easier by the seventh, as another 10 cm were added to Kei's height. Kei was red from joy and lust, going back in for a kiss on Yamaguchi who happily reciprocated. As Yamaguchi continued to fuck him under the warm shower water, both of them climax at the same time. A second torrent gushed into Tsukishima, followed by a third, and a fourth as they made love. Tsukishima's belly expanded out as he was filled with cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finished their second kiss as Kei gained 30 cm in total, feeling Tadashi's rod start to harden once more. \"Sorry Tsukki. I've had to deal with this for awhile\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. But after this I've got to rest.\" Kei went in for a third kiss.</span></div></div>",

Hinata and Kageyama were walking together to their gym, the meeting point of the two teams. They were wearing clothes ridiculously small, the reality change didn't seem to have affected their wardrodes, and although the day before they received the bigger sport clothes they had ordered days ago, they were 224cm and 195cm at that moment and obviously didn't fit them at 250+cm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, those tight volleyball uniforms were the only thing they could wear until the new regular clothes they had ordered would arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooa...\" Hinata got amazed by the new phone his friend had brought \"Where did you get a smartphone adapted to our sizes?

The two players joined his friends and practiced their shots, passes and serves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the team had some problems to calibrate their jumps, specially Hinata and Kageshima, whose physiques and jump capabilities had increased faster than they could get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"king\" throwed a really high ball to Hinata, but the little colossus jumped so high and fast his head impacted against the gym ceiling and the ball ended up hitting a blond player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Tsukishima.\" Hinata apologized once he landed on the floor (landing his huge body caused a little quake in the building).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukishima was going to give him a piece of his mind (a particularly rude one), but he controlled himself and breathed until the rage dissipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, a ball for the tallest player met his face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two...! ...how could you fail every time...?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry!!\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glasses boy sighed tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you have to jump less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one expected the arrogant player would give advices to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't... I can't control the power of my jumps!\"<br>\r\n\"I guess you need more training... (that's why you're the rookie of this team, btw)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukishima thought about it for some seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't control the height of your jumps... but you're always jumping at the same speed, right?\"<br>\r\n\"My head always hits the ceiling two seconds after jumping!\"<br>\r\n\"So you have to jump half second before the ball arrives, hit it as you ascends and wait until land again. You would waste several seconds in the air, but I think the others may cover your absence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bitter Tsukishima not only gave him the key to be useful until he proper controls his jumps, he also helped Hinata to practice until he synced his absurd powerful jumps with the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tsukishima! You're a lifesaver!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aforementioned boy closed his eyes as he felt the growing sensation again all over his body, and the increasing feeling of tightness as his body stretched his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it ended he discovered he had grown 10cm (4\"), standing at 202cm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have time to process all this (and assist more Hinata to his own benefit). They heard loud steps coming closer and the big doors of the gymnasium were opened by the visitor team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crows didn't expected...</span></div></div>",

It had been a while since someone made them feel small...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's body was long, it seemed he had gained more height than wideness, giving him a slightly lean appearance... but he had also a great layer of muscle, maybe not as prominent as Kageyama would have if the King was as tall as him, but still impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet was large even proportionally to his huge body. \"The foundations must be big and strong to support the greatest skyscrapers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't wearing anything but his sport shorts, strained to the limit. Clearly his growth spurt had caught him by surprise and couldn't get any decent clothes, except the biggest shorts he had, which still were too small...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a huge snake was hanging from a trouser leg of the shorts, going down half his long upper leg, <b>flacid</b>. No human shorts could hope to contain such long and fat pithon, so he has to walk with half cock visible to everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarasuno team wasn't short on that aspect of their bodies, which grew as fast as their heights, but none of them had ever seen a dick as big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seconds awestruck by his giant genitalia and height, they looked (way) up to his face and recognized that pale smiling face with cat eyes and grey hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-l-l-lev!?\" Hinata exclaimed it much louder than he intended.<br>\r\n\"Hi, Hinata!\" He said without stopping smiling.<br>\r\n\"When did you get so big??\"<br>\r\n\"Eh? I've always been big... but yesterday I hit a powerful growth spurt. I'm almost 3 meters tall now (10'). Cool, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe russian first-year boy was almost two heads taller than the already giant Hinata... and acted like it was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crows seemed a little confused by his change, their memories were quite fragmented and chaotic after so many reality changes, but they ended up accepting the current size of Lev.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wish was supposed to only affect my team... why has someone from Nekoma grown like us?\" Hinata go closer to the great guy, feeling a deja vu from their first meeting. \"Yeah... but tell, how did you REALLY get so tall?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n\"Did you make a wish to the spirit of the forest?\" He said almost whispering. He didn't wanted to anyone else hear it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, THERE IS A SPIRIT WHO GRANTS WHISHES IN THE FOREST??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata hadn't realized Lev's voice was much powerful than before, with the surprise he talked so loud everyone there hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononono! It's just a joke!\" He tried to play down his own words, but the suspicious glances of Nekoma and Karasuno's players made him understand they wouldn't let it go so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cblue\">Hinata nor Lev knew know the miracle happened, but I, the omniscient narrator, know it ALL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLev was always a really sociable and energetic character, but his own team didn't let him play with them as much as he wanted. They kept forcing him to train his shoots, serves and movements, boring training, and only letting him play in some occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was true Lev's lack of experience and skills needed the training, the kid sometimes got sick of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the previous match with Karasuno, he was suppose to get back to their hight school to practice more, but Lev decided to slip away and stay a little longer with the remaining Karasuno players (Hinata, Kageyama, Tsukishima and Yamaguchi had left a little before to prepare themselves for the sleepover).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLev and the others spent some time in the arcades, after that to a cafe, and more places... they spent a really good time and the captain and the others grew a little fond of the little kid (the grey haired boy was 194cm tall, but in the eyes of the giant players he was the little guy of the group, well, after Nishinoya)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eventually one of them joked, saying something like \"let's make Lev an honorary player of Karasuno!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words awakened the blessing of Nekoma, which didn't understand the difference between a joke and serious statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid grew a little during the following minutes, slowly at first, ripping his clothes a little. That made him say goodbye and go home to get new clothes... and in the middle of his trip the <b>blessing hit him hard</b>. Tsukishima was the tallest of his team (190cm) and grew up to 248cm tall. Lev was even taller, and the Wish affect him even further, enhancing his body until he reached the 293cm mark (9'6\"), with an almost 30cm (1 foot) flaccid penis... in the middle of the street. It was. of course, embarrasing and leaded to other events I'm not going to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's go back to the present. The boys were preparing to the friendly rematch. Karasuno felt a little anxiety. Nekoma felt much more confident, Kuroo couldn't help himself to smile with evilness, that made them feel even more anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"he's just a little taller, but not much taller than the rest of us... except Nishinoya\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu didn't like Tanaka's words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lev is huge, but we're way taller and stronger than the rest of the team... I think we can manage a big rookie first-year, even if he's taller than us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain kept a serious stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so sure... They seem strangely confident... like they had build a solid team strategy around Lev to counter our advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match was going to start...</span></div></div>",

Lev had reached the ball <b>without jumping</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always had long arms and legs, and the blessing had increased those characteristics further.

Kageyama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKageyama went next.

Figuring Karasuno's captain would know \"Where would a pervert go nearby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaichi brightly smiled \"He's probably in the showers. Sometimes <i>certain perverts </i>go there to relieve stress after a match.\" A shiver went up the spines of Kei, Yamaguchi, Tanaka, Nishinoya, Kageyama, and even vice captain Sagawara. All of them had relieved themselves in there at one point or another in this new timeline. The dark haired captain had smelled the scent of deviant acts in there when players did a sloppy job cleaning up after themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Let's go find our overgrown housecat\" Kuroo bemused as Kenma nodded and the three head to the showers. When the three entered a room drenched white lay before them. The half-Russian had splattered copius amounts of cum out of sexual frustration. Kuroo whistled at an even bigger mess of white goo splattered everywhere that was beyond his than usual amount. Yaku had an annoyed look on his face while Kenma had nearly become desensitized to it. Lev was beat red from embarassment.  Lev had realized the trio were behind him. \"Sorry Captain. You gave me a chance with my growth spurt and I blew it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lev you dumb behemoth!\" Yaku called out second later.

Lev perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to help him learn to control it.

Yakkun you have to help him for the next two months.\"<br>\r\n\"Me!? Two months!? Kuroo that's unfair!\" Yaku and Kuroo argued back and forth as they head to leave, making sure to still avoid any of the mess in the vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenma was about to follow before he heard Lev speak \"Kenma-senpai do you think what Hinata said was true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to gaze up at, Kenma Kozume answered \"A wish granting spirit?\" The massive russian shook his head up and down \"Not likely. Hinata's always saying stuff like that. First it was a bird. Next he said it was a snake. So on and so forth. Hinata has even mentioned it was a Buddhist blessing to his teammates .\" Kenma thought back on all the random guesses. He just assumed random questioning of their bizarre growth spurts was always Hinata's quirk. Everyone has become desensitized to it as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's guessing. That's dissappointing.\"<i> It sounded real when Hinata mentioned it though.</i> The two left the showers only to find Hinata and Kageyama with Hinata looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure nothing weird's happend to Lev-kun!\" Hinata earnestly yelled much to the relaxed state of Kuroo and Yaku. \"Is the spirit doing weird things to him even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine overgrown shrimp\" Kuroo mused, still considering Hinata the same chibi he original saw before that blessing made him grow like crazy. \"There's no weird magic doing strange things to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine Hinata!\" Lev moved over to the smaller giant. \"There's no weird stuff that ever changed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there was! There's this-\" Kageyama cut him off by grabbing his arm. \"Dumbass there's something important we've gotta do\" The shorter black haired giant pulled Hinata by his arm, the other boy still trying to speak. \"Fine. Geez Kageyama! I'll talk to you guys later! Kenma I want to play that new game I got with you! Just be online later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be on around Seven PM.\" Kenma called in his soft voice as the two quickly gained distance, yet too quiet for Hinata to make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Hinata yelled as he couldn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenma-senpai said he'll be on at seven!\" Lev yelled back, looking down at Kenma to give a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Hinata cheered up as Kageyama took him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then. Let's get everyone together to leave before they find out what Lev did in the showers!\" Kuroo declared as the four headed for the gymnasium. The larger Lev's stride putting him ahead of the other three easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest stopped looking and are slacking off with the crows I bet.\" Yaku mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one wants to deal with Lev's messes.\" Kenma said as quietly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. I discussed it with Yaku afterwards and I agreed the ones who gave up will clean up Levs messes instead for the next two months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Meanwhile====<br>\r\nKageyama had gained good traction with Hinata as they were near the schools entrance. He hadn't even bothered to get out of his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kageyama why are you being so forceful?\" Not that Hinata wasn't strong enough to get out of his grip, but Kageyama gave him a look that screamed ''Shut up and come with me!'' only now that no one was around did he decide to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata you do understand no one will believe you about the spirit right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. No. I mean I'm not sure? Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n\"My minds been flooded with you saying random things about what makes us huge for ages since we began growing. Don't you remember when I told you no one else would believe you?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess I just blurt it out when it comes to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine for everyday things. Yet that wish granter could have massive ramifications on the entire world if we're not careful. So we best find out what it's deal is. So the two of us are heading into the mountains to find it.\" He finally released Hinata's arm. \"So we should find it with us at the speed of current statures if I follow behind you.\" It was indeed peculiar how their agility and strength grew with the added mass and size they gained. Likely due to its supernatural origins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired giant smiled as he stretched \"Leave it to me! Then I can show everyone what I said is true.\" Hinata then sped off into the street and running towards the forested hills for his daily routines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said not to tell anyone else!\" Kageyama angrily shouted in pursuit of keeping with Hinata. The two making fast pace as their teammates and Nekoma were prepping to leave for the town/Karasuno High for Nekoma. Most of Nekoma with looks of despair as Kuroo smugly smirked and Lev smiled at all his helpers. The quiet, fresh air of the forest filled Kageyama's lungs as he trailed behind the bigger Hinata. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took less than ten minutes to find the secluded pillar of stones. The spirit currently at rest as two of his mystically blessed targets now stood before the shorter pillar. A deep rhythmic rumble hummed through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it Kageyama! So what do you you want to do?\" Hinata moved to touch the smooth stones of the pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobio Kageyama smirked \"We need to...\"</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure if Kageyama had never truly believed his story, and just went along with him until he heard the spirit, or he had always believed it and all those doubts he mentioned now were just an excuse to get some magic stones.

Now he was there alone, he couldn't help himself but think he wish Kageyama was there with him, spending the night, like they had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of spending the night with him made something in his tight shorts shiver. Uncomfortable, he took it down, releasing his snake from its slumber, which started to swell and rise as the blood filled the appendix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, it's huge...\" The orange haired kid thought when he saw it rose over his abs and slowly gain a few centimeters before stopping at a hair's breadth away of his chest. He hadn't had time to get used to its new size after his last growth spurt days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was a teenager and knew what to do in this situation: He went to his desk (accidentally throwing a lamp to the floor with his steelhard third leg) and sat in front of his laptop. The reinforced chair cracked under his weight, somewhere over 200kg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the computer booted, he took a 30cm rule from his drawer and tried to measure his giant phallus, but its head and a little of its body stood above the end of the ruler. It felt hot in his hand, which couldn't surround all its diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it's bigger than Tobio's. He was bigger during our first... <i>meeting</i> in the bathroom. \" He couldn't think about that without blusing a little. \"But that's because he was taller too. Now I'm like 7cm taller (3\"), I guess... damn, Hinata, stop thinking in that jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer was finally ready, and the boy opened his favorite porn page. He expected some fun, but it wasn't like the other times.<br>\r\nThe men over there were much less sexy than he remembered: smaller and much skinnier than the bodies he could see in the locke room. The 20cm (8\") cock of a proud pornstar felt ridiculous with the over-a-foot-hard cock he had in his hands... or the even bigger bare monsters Kei and Lev had shown to everyone that afternoon. And Kageyama... oh, Kageyama...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Tobio... mmm... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes, ignoring the dull porn video the website was playing, and started thinking in his frienemy with no clothes, surrounded by his teammates, at the showers. Perfect asses, pure muscle, broad shoulders, giant cocks that reach chest level... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(His both hands began shaking his giant cock compulsively)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis imagination could fill him with all detail, as they start fucking each other, even the boys with clear preferences (like Sawamura and Sugawara or Tsukishima and Yamaguchi) would let others to touch them and share cuddling, before joining in the most hot orgy even seen by the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(His rod started leaking precum)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in his mind, he saw Kageyama, untempted by the hottest men, waiting for him.<br>\r\nSmiling when he finally see Hinata comming.<br>\r\nHugging his nude body with his, an act filled with as much tenderness as erotism.<br>\r\nBringing their united bodies to the others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jet of cum touched the ceiling. The teen, panting, rested on the chair as his body were covered by the cum his semi hard cock still released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so good, and then seconds later so bad, once he realized how unfair he had been with his friend, deciding he had to make up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best... masturbation... ever...\" He mutted, still overflowed with endorphins. \"I wish something like that would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rock, which was accidentally dropped to next to his foot, shined for an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at Kageyama's, the boy had been trying not to think in his friend too and he had more success than Hinata, thanks to the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystical object had distract him with its mysteries. He had been trying to examine it, understand it, but he couldn't get any piece of information from it.<br>\r\nEventually, he dared to make a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me what I've forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA torrent of images flood his brain, his whole life changed every time Hinata's wish or Yatagarasu's blessing/curse changed the size of someone he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself rolled up on the floor, drowing in memories of deleted timelines.<br>\r\nIt took him long to get his shit together and stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck... it was all true. Hinata was right. Our lives had changed... all because of these stones and its creator...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobio sat on his bed, still shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is a lie... This terrible thing... can change everything.\" He dropped it, scared, but after a few seconds looking at it he felt even scared of leaving it unprotected and hide it in his draw. \"I shouldn't have given one to Hinata, who knows what kind of wish could make, changing our lives again without us noticing... but the same could be said of the creator of the pillar of stones. What does he want...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, he eventually fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Someone was awaiting for him, and he was already late for school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raced to his wardrove, but dressing up wasn't easy when you have a hard cock bigger than an average man's forearm towering from his crotch, refusing to go soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think unsexy things, think unsexy things...\" The little giant repeated to himself as he tried to put it inside his undersizing uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the doorbell rang more and more. Whoever was outside, it was losing patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'm going,  I'm on the way!\" Hinata yelled as he went down the stairs. With the rush he had forgot one of his shoes, he had put his t-shirt backwards and his huge cock was still half erect and poorly placed on his small trousers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he opened the front door, a ball of clothes impacted in his face. More shocked than hurt, opened his eyes and saw the one who had thrown it (or at least his muscular upperbody, as he was way taller than the doorframe).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready already, we're going to be late to school!\" The irritated voice of Kei was unmistakable.<br>\r\n\"Wait... what is this?\" Hinata asked as he unfolded the new clothes.<br>\r\n\"It's the XXXX...\" Tsukishima took a breath before continuing \"...XXXX-L school uniform we ordered together a week ago, don't you remember? They sent me yours to my home due to a delivery mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the orange boy noticed his blond teammate's clothes were new too: They fit him almost perfect, although the trouserlegs and sleeves were a little too short and the uniform's blazer was tight in the chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish it had come before my last growth spurt, but it's better than what I had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata closed the door and quickly removed his clothes (his tiny pants got stuck, so he had to tear them up) and put the new ones.<br>\r\nIt felt so good to wear fitting clothes for once, instead of the ragged uniform made for his short-lived 190cm body. It was a little short like Tsukishima's, but it was good enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left home with a smile in his face, but that disappeared fast when he saw Kageyama among with Kei. He hadn't come alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" The king said coldly before averting the eyes. He was wearing a new uniform too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere had turned bad... The two teens didn't know what to say to each other, if telling the other \"sorry\" o demand an apology... so they remained silent during the walk to their high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei enjoyed the silence. Since he was restored to his former glory and size, he had been trying to be less asshole so the curse wouldn't affect him again... but it was hard for Tsukishima not to be Tsukishima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was getting used to it. Getting his bitterness and foul mood under control...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until a armored van knocked him down in a pedestrian crossing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like that morning a band of thieves was robbing a nearby bank and stole one of its vehicles to escape.<br>\r\nBut they didn't take into account they could cross with a 263cm tall teenager, with the build of superman and the same strength and endurance.<br>\r\nKei was perfectly fine: His body hadn't been moved an inch by the impact with the 2 tons vehicle. Instead, the front part of the van had a huge dent and the thieves inside were dizzy, like they had hit a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his clothes weren't made for that and got ruined. The glasses-boy observed like the rags of his brand new, expensive custom uniform fell to the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugg... did we hit something?\" One of the evildoers said as he left the car. \"Ah!\" When he saw the giant teen in front of them, and his killing glare... instinctively knew he had to kill him before he did a move, or they won't escape with their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe emptied the loaders of his submachine gun, shooting so many bullets at the boy, but the only thing they perforated was what it remained of his clothes (and the lost bullets damaged Hinata's and Kageyama's).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... are you trying... to get me mad...?\" Kei said menazingly through her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis huge body got closer to the thug, casting a shadow that covered that scared man. He tried to ran away, but Kei only needed a stride to catch him. Tsukki lifted his body like it weighed nothing. His average 170cm tall body felt so small, partially covered between the immense hands of the one meter taller student. His legs kicked the air, trying to get free, in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief knew he could crush his body with a small movement of his long, powerful fingers. Kei knew he knew and enjoyed his pathetic reactions and pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the blond titan played with his prey next to the van, a half-conscious delinquent recovered enough to try to escape through the opposite door, but before he could open the damaged door he noticed the vehicle was leaning to his side.<br>\r\nThe cause was Kageyama, who was pushing the vehicle to prevent him from escaping. He needed a few seconds to knock it over, but of course a two tons van is harder to move than the 60Kg (132lbs) man Kei was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe occupant of the van remained in the car. He could have climbed and try to escape through the other door, but he feared what those teens would do to him if he get outside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tobio noticed there was a third thief who had fled through the back door of the van when they ran over Kei. He was already very far away, like 100m from them, but that didn't stop the black haired boy to try to capture him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started running. After 2 seconds, he was halfway to get him. In 4 seconds, his fingertips grazed his neck... but then he felt something dangerous behind and moved away. A volleyball ball flew beside his head, brushing his cheek, before hitting the escapee's back so hard he flew several meters before impacting against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gottcha!\" Hinata claimed proudly.<br>\r\n\"Idiot! You almost hit me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the police arrested the villains and recovered all the stolen money. The mayor organized an improvised ceremony in honor of their heroic feats.<br>\r\nIt was mounted so quickly they didn't had time to change their ripped clothes (if it's not like they had spare clothes of their size). Hinata and Kageyama felt a little embarrassed, being in front of so many people like this. Tsukishima didn't. He was starting to take a liking to go around half naked. Also, he felt radiant after finding out the curse won't punish him for treating bad people who wasn't part of his team (as he tested when he \"played\" with the caught robbers).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so the city want to thank these brave students for their heroic acts and grant them his medals. We're sure you'll be the GREATEST volleyball players, but if you want to try a different career the city will be honored to have you in our police our firefighting forces...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"blablabla...\" Kei thought.<br>\r\n\"How long is this going to last? We're so late for school...\" Kageyama asked to Hinata.<br>\r\n\"I think it's ending... but I think the medals will excuse us for our lateness at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so I'll proceed to give you these medals... ehm... umm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor was a short man, less than 160cm tall (5'4), and couldn't Tsukishima's high head. The blond boy noticed and smirked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a asshole, Kei\" Kageyama reprimanded him as he bent himself to get his head closer to the mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But his short arms were still uncapable or reaching the top of his head. He and Hinata had to put on their knees so they would be low enough to be gifted with the medals... but then they found out the ribbons of the medals were too short and wouldn't go through their knees, getting stuck around their foreheads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei guffawed at their ridiculous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, they arrived at their school with only a few hours of class left.<br>\r\nHinata expected they would have a free pass due to their heroic service, but he was wrong: The Vice Principal didn't want to hear excuses and got specially angry for their scruffy looks and broken clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This school has turned a blind eye to your clothes due to your... size complications. But I know the school's clothing supplier sent you new custom clothes yesterday, it's inadmissible you have ruined them in less than 24 hours!\"<br>\r\n\"But... but it was an accident.\"<br>\r\n\"They're expensive, and the school partly covered the costs of them, so you don't only owe your parents for them, also your school!\" The vice principal refused to listen to them.<br>\r\n\"But look, we got medals for our heroic acts...\"<br>\r\n\"You can't bring shinny accessories to school! You're violating even more the school's dressing code!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they ended up grounded for a week. But at least they still could participate in the volleyball club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a training session that afternoon. What happened until then?</span></div></div>",

His endless cock slipped and fell through the trouser leg again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you said I will be grounded for 2 matches.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Fukur\u014ddani Academy challenged us to a friendly match in 1 hour and a half and it would be great to have you doing your 'impenetrable force field' technique. I'll forgive your previous mistakes if you do it well.\"<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, of course I'll do!! I won't let you down!!\" The titanic player got all excited, jumping up and down of joy, shaking the ground with his tremendous mass, Kuroo almost fell to the floor because of this.<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, calm down, big guy!\"<br>\r\n\"But why so suddenly?\"<br>\r\n\"They heard we almost defeated the invincible crows and want to measure their chances against them by using us, 'their weaker version'. The Horned Owl Bastard literally call us that. So if they want to feel what to feel to fight a team of titans like Karasuno, we're glad to show them our biggest guns.\"<br>\r\n\"Biggest... guns...?\" Lev repeated the words like he hadn't understand them. Then he instinctively looked down and saw his huge snake oscillating near his knee. He got red and as he covered as much penis as he could with his big hands he screamed \"You can't be serious! We can't go and show them our cocks to intimidate them during a match!!\" He recalled the embarrassing incident with Karasuno.<br>\r\n\"What...? No! With 'biggest guns' I meant our better players, not our dicks, idiot!!\"<br>\r\n\"Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe almost 3 meters teenager relaxed his nerves a little with the captain's explanation... separating his hands, he exposed a cock noticeably bigger than before, fattening slowly as it ascended to 45\u00ba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emm... Lev, how many times has you jack off his morning?\"<br>\r\n\"Only 2.\"<br>\r\n\"You have to milk all your desire before the match. This time we'll have some public, what happen with Karasuno can't happen again.\"<br>\r\n\"I know... but I can't control it. Sometimes a think our a tap is enough to get it hard.\"<br>\r\n\"A tap, like when you bumb against Yaku during the trainings?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" He admitted blushing again.<br>\r\n\"If I'll let you emptying your balls alone, you'll probably won't be ready for the match on time. But I know that with others' help, it will get more pleasant and release faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuroo got his phone and called someone.</span></div></div>",

If you don't, forget about playing the next games!\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a quarter Yaku arrived to their locker room, where the two players were waiting for him. He wasn't happy with his assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming, Yakkun...\"<br>\r\n\"Stop your bullshit. And don't call me Yakkun.\" The short brownhead boy's mood was awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a look to his big kohai, sitting on a wooden bench too low for him so his bent knees reached his chest... but there was something else long enough to almost touching his chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaku made a disgusting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only this time.\" He said angrily, knowing he couldn't escape from this task. \"And after this day's session, it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n\"But Kenma did it several times before switching---\"<br>\r\n\"YOUR-TURN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuroo couldn't argue with him. He knew it would only make things worse, so he simply nodded and gave the pair some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny player stared at Lev from a safe distance, a little intimidated by the humongous dick and his not less astonish nude body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInadvertently, he spent a minute staring at the hard cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh... when are you going to start?\" Lev was starting to feel cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words irritated him. Feeling like a fool, he finally dared to approach the phallus and touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was warm and the skin, so soft... the virgin shortie didn't have much experience, so he limited to do to him what he did to himself every night: jerk it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut jerking Lev's cannon wasn't as easy as his own 11cm cock (4.3\"). To begin with, his two hands roughly coved half of the diameter of this cock. Not enough friction surface, and that got worse when the immense cock turned out it wasn't fully hard, only halfway, and gained more width and over 12cm (5\") in length. He wasn't sure how big was now, but he estimated it was over two times longer than his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gosh, this isn't going to be easy, isn't it?\" He thought, a little scared, but he faked self-confident in front of his kohai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands became sticky as the cock, more aroused by Yaku's presence than for his poor masturbation technique, began to release precum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Kenma used to undress to avoid dirtying his clothes...\" Lev suggested with an ulterior motive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Yaku followed his advice and remove his clothes in front of him, and Lev's penis grew a whole inch more due to the strip-tease. They continued, the little one trying his best to finish it as fast as he can, but Lev's much more stamina than he expected. He went beyond and hugged the giant cock to use his bare body to masturbate it. Lev enjoyed the improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, in this position you'll be more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for his answer Lev grabbed his small senpai and rose it like a doll, maddening him, before sitting him on his lap, between his wall of abs and his giant pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true it was more comfortable and allowed him to surround his dick with his calves and use them to add even more friction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaku was trying to maintain certain composure, a little dignity, that he was doing this for the team, for his kohai or because he was told to... but for some reason, he was getting more and more aroused in front of this cock almost as big as his upperbody... maybe it was the smell of the cock, intense but somehow intoxicating... or it was the pheromones Lev's body released, 10x more than the average... or maybe being surrounded by the biggest, hottest male in the world was what he needed to find out his true sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTried to fight his urges, but eventually they were too much for him and ended up sucking the giant cock (whose glans was at his eye level, tempting him). Although nothing more than part of the tip went inside of his mouth, it was enough to make Lev moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jet of cum filled his mouth. He liked the taste, but he'd never admit that.<br>\r\nHe got up, tired after almost half and hour of sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Yaku, don't go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back and saw the giant teen was still hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how are you still hard? You did cum!\"<br>\r\n\"That was just precum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 quarters later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenma, I need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaku had grabbed his phone and called his friend while he was still riding Lev's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have less than 45 minutes to the match and this giant jerk is still hard!\"<br>\r\n\"How many times has he cummed?\" <br>\r\n\"2...\" A sound of sea waves interrupted their conversation. \"...3. But the idiot says it's precum.\"<br>\r\n\"Unless the room is flooded with white, it's precum. I know it beforehand, I was playing with my Vita while playing with his cock when a wave of cum covered the room, including my handheld console, breaking it.\"<br>\r\n\"I have less than 45 minutes before the match begins. Could you please come here and help me with this useless giant?\"<br>\r\n\"...I'm playing Dragon Quest...\"<br>\r\n\"Please!\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn ten minutes the two-tone haired boy arrived to help.<br>\r\nHe spotted his friend resting over Lev's cock, strong and big enough to support his tired body.<br>\r\nDespite being exhausted, Yaku kept rubbing his cum-covered body (including his tiny cock) to the huge one, licking its head with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their eyes met, Yaku starled, jumped off the huge cock, falling to the ground. Ashamed, he tried to say something about how much hated this task (a lie), but stopped when he saw Kenma was removing his clothes as he approached to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to work fast to have him ready for the match.\" he said before hugging the giant cock. \"Do whatever I say, no questions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next half an hour was incredible for Lev, having two teammates doing everything to satisfy him (and, although they would never admit it, to satisfy themselves). They sandwiched the cock between his bodies. They kissed and licked its head.  But they were running out of time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenma put his whole arm inside his ass to reach his prostate, and when he did another jet of cum covered Yaku's face, who was still doing him \"oral\". He licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaku...\" Lev said a voice as much sexy as shy, separating his friend from his cock and raising him slowly to his face so he could heard his whispers better \"I think I could finish right now if I could put it inside you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaku laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible! It's almost as thick as my abdomen.\"<br>\r\n\"But maybe Kenma...\"<br>\r\n\"The same with him... and with all the population of the Earth. Your cock is too big for anal, or proper oral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLev's voice shook. He never stopped to think about that, but it was true...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means... I'll never have true sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaku noticed his new worried, sad tone of voice and feeling guilty, tried to fix his hurtful words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe the biggest crows could handle a cock like you. Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat suggestion left him thinking. About Karasuno, how big they were, how much they had grown. If there was someone capable of handle his cock, they were the ones. Although he liked them like friends, he never thought in them as boyfriends material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was another thing: Their gigantic growth, almost supernatural... and his growth spurts weren't different. \"Why does this happened to us? I'm not complaining...\" he loved it \"...but if I knew the secret, maybe I could help my team... sharing the amazing power of my size, making them as invincible as the crows... and maybe, I could...\" He blushed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered the nonsense Hinata said days ago about growth caused by spirits and wishes... was that worth a try?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Fukur\u014ddani Academy and Nekoma teams met for the match, but the cats lacked some players. The captain feared maybe Yaku couldn't get his job done. He went to the changing room to check on them, if Lev wasn't ready he could let him rest and use Yaku...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door and saw the white disaster their room had turned into. And in the middle of it, resting in a puddle of cum, Lev, Yaku and Kenma were sleeping peacefully after the frenetic orgy they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey couldn't join their team and Nekoma lost. Kuroo punished the trio later sitting them on the bench for more matches and forcing them to do exhausting and boring training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">[ Two future branches will be opened: Lev trying to get laid in Karasuno and Lev investigating Karasuno's growth.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Days passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarasuno were busy with his usual training whose purpose wasn't improve their physical strength (they were already literally the strongest humans on Earth) but to tune their technique to their giant size, control better their jumps (Hinata made so many headbutts against the ceiling),  their shots (the giant trio sometimes hit the ball so strong it bursted, maddening their managers who barely had money to equipment for this giant club) and improve their coordination with the other giant players. Although they could beat any team by sheer power, they still had much to do in those two areas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best example of this happened when Hinata miscalculated the landing of an accidental jump to the roof and fell over the poor Yamaguchi. The dozen of meters fall couldn't hurt Hinata thanks to his superpowers, but the same couldn't be said of his smaller teammate, 30cm/1' shorter and quite weaker, when a 200kg (440lbs) pal used him as a mattress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HINATA, IDIOT!!\" Tsukishima pushed Hinata away brusquely from his friend and made sure he was fine.<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, Tsukki... just a little bruised...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...fortunately, Yamaguchi was superhuman enough to resist it. Although he was pretty much fine, Tsukishima spent the rest of the session glaring Hinata, making him so incomfortable. He would have done things way worse to the giant jumper, but Kei was afraid of what the curse would do to him if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of their training, Shimizu, Yachi and Ukai gathered all the team for a quick checkup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We noticed some of your uniforms look tighter than when you received them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most obvious cases were the giant trio: Tsukishima, Kageyama and Tsukishima had additional growth spurts that although changed their history, hadn't affected their clothing.<br>\r\nSo 250cm tall Tobio had to wear clothes for his 224cm self, tight and stretched although bearable and exposed part of his tummy.<br>\r\nThe same for Kei, which after his shrinking and growing had ended up 16cm taller.<br>\r\nThe worst case was Hinata, wearing clothes designed for a 195cm player despite being 59cm (2') taller. His tshirt was more like a sport bra and his shorts, underwear. It would be unbearably tight if it hadn't ripped in several places, giving him space to breath and move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata would gladly use one of Tsukishima's, but the club only had bucket for one custom-sized uniform per player, so no one had spare clothes to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they were the most extreme cases, with extra magic growth spurts, the others seemed to have smaller issues with their uniforms too... they seemed to hug to their bodies more tightly than they used to, making their pecs more noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The club had enough money for another clothes change this year, so maybe we could get you more fitting ones. But first we need updated measures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in line to a height rod ridiculously high (290cm / 9.5' tall) lent by the local zoo veterinary, usually used to measure big animals like elephants, it was long enough to measure all the giant players(or isn't it?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wasn't sure when was the last time they were measured (it felt like a week ago, but after so many reality changes and memory rewrites, he wasn't so sure). \"How much could he have grown in so little time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one of being measured was Nishinoya, who was 182cm / 6' tall a week ago, and now was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...185 (6'1\")\" Shimizu read so Yachi could note it down.<br>\r\n\"Yes! One more inch! I'm catching up with you, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Hinata recognized. \"I guess we were growing boys before I made the wish. Now we're bigger, our on-course growth had increased too. I wonder if the others and me had grown taller too.\" Hinata grinned stupidly, he still had a little of his old height complex and still \tunconsciously desired to be taller. \"I wish we found out everyone had got a nice growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's biggest mistake... the teenager had forgotten he had brought his magic stone with him, afraid of what accidental wishes his sister could do if she found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden in his pocket, the magical item shone a little when he thought a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddendly, they heard a clank. They looked at the source, the height rod and the boy who was under it. Hinata immediately noticed he was different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait, change that: 221cm (7'3) even.\" Shimizu changed his data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes, for a 6' feet boy, weren't able to stretch fast enough at the sudden 36cm /1'2\" growth spurt and the extra muscle mass and ripped here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoes didn't survive the experience of an average size 9 (EUR42) stretching to a whopping size 18 (EUR51) (still dwarfed by the colossal feel of Kageyama, Hinata and specially Tsukishima (sizes 35, 36 and 39).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, no one but Hinata and Kageyama (who had wished to get his memory back) perceived the incredible change, the others acted like he was already that tall when he went to the stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened?\" Hinata was shocked<br>\r\n\"It might be your original wish... I guess?\" Kageyama hypothesized.<br>\r\nHinata shrugged, he thought his first wish would only granted one growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them realiced it was the new wish Hinata had thought minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy as a clam, he returned to his companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't call me 'tiny' anymore, eh?\" In fact, he towered over several of his teammates, although the difference wasn't great. \"I'm part of the big guys club now.\"<br>\r\n\"You won't be so happy when you have to find clothes or fit in a bus.\" Tanaka answered back. He was practically as big as him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka went next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"219 centi---\" Before the manager could finish, Tanaka head pushed the height rod's plate upwards. \"250cm!\" She corrected herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached to Nishinoya, now a little over a head shorter and quite lighter than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you saying, tiny?\"<br>\r\n\"Grrr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnnoshita, Kinoshita and Narita, who had barely gained one or two centimeters since their last check-up, grew a foot in seconds, reaching 252, 243cm and 258cm heights respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird for Tobio seen more of his teammates reaching and even slightly surpassing his height. He could have done something with his magic stone, but he was still afraid of the consequences of a poorly formulated wish might do, so he let it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahi Azumane turned into a 266cm tall beast, as tall as Tsukki but with a lot more muscle mass. He barely could walk do to the pressure his skin tight shorts put on his giant crotch bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did you bring your stone with you?!\" Kageyama exclaimed when he noticed his friend had something in his pocket.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I couldn't let something so powerful alone in my place... why?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe you made a growth wish accidentally and caused all this!\"<br>\r\n\"The hell I did!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe you thought it would be fun grow more and the stone reacted!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was yours! You have it in your pocket too, didn't you?\" Hinata had already forgotten he had done exactly that.<br>\r\n\"But I know what I think and I don't, and I can't tell the same about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember those feelings of regret they had a little ago due to their childish argument? They're gone.</span></div></div>",

It was Sugawara's turn, and got taller than he expected, up to 230cm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked awkwardly with his ripped clothes, feeling more shame than the others for showing so much skin, specially in front of the the female managers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. No one here would judge for that. Everyone has the same problem, and they already got used to it.\" Someone from behind said those kind words. The Sugawa turned to look who it was, but when he did a big shadow covered his face. It was Sawamura's, who had got a nice boost in height, making him almost a head taller than his vice-captain. Also gained a lot of muscle and wider shoulders, like their ace, destroying most of his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSugawara, more relaxed, smiled back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hinata and Kageyama couldn't stop arguing.<br>\r\nNone of them noticed Tsukishima wasn't far and was paying attention to each word... but eventually the giant blonde got distracted when a freckled boy appeared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like now I'm almost as tall as you, hehe...\" He said innocently happy.<br>\r\n\"Not for long.\" He couldn't wait to be his turn in the rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jumpy kid stopped this argument and looked at his big coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to stop this before we get too big, Hinata.\" Kageyama begged him, but he didn't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to the height rod. Ukai, tall enough to place the rod head over his and measure him, proceeded to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you grew some, Hinata!\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're 255c--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the magic happened, and was longer and a bit slower than with the others... and stronger.<br>\r\nHis head rose and rose as his shoulders grew apart.<br>\r\n\"No, 260... 265cm...\"<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis already generous pecs get 10cm 4\" of thickness in an instant of pleasure, the same could be said of his biceps, triceps and each muscle in his body. The sound of ripping cloth was added up to the constant noise his cracking bones made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"270... 275cm...\"<br>\r\n\"Uuuungg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother source of pleasure was created when his cock started to gain inches like crazy, getting close to Lev's, but it couldn't get free through the trouser leg (as I said before, Hinatas' short were made for his 190cm self, and were too tight to let anything slip for the \"trouser leg\", specially something so fat as his cock was getting). So as it elongated, the tip pushed the groin area of the underwear down, but it couldn't stretch more, so the \"body\" of the snake curved and poked out from the garment. After a few seconds of orgasmic growth (with a lot of precum) there was more cock outside the underwear than inside (only the huge tip and a dozen of centimeters of the tube).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"280... 285!\" The couch concluded, now as tall as his collar bone. \"And you look stronger than ever.\"<br>\r\n\"That's amazing, Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was going to say something, but the sensation of a little more growth prevent him talking. Everyone heard a strong \"CLANK!\" as the height rod's head reaching its maximum height and bent a little upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're the biggest and probably strongest of the team, maybe you could be our new ace!\" The coach suggested, half joking, as he tapped his endless back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird to see Kageyama as low height, compared to him. The king felt the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serious player didn't say anything to his friend/rival Hinata, they had just had an argument after all. But he recognized he looked really hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now it was his turn. Kageyama walked reluctantly to the rod, part of him wanted the same transformation as the other and more... but his logic brain was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if eventually we get too big for our homes? For the volleyball field? For our planet? I should stop it before it goes out of hand.\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he also wanted more orgasmic growth and power... he hadn't forgotten how sensitive his cock became after his first growth spurts... how well it felt with Hinata...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, Tobio! Don't think with your cock! Remember, each growth spurt changes the universe... do I want to play with history, only to get bigger?\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis contradictory thoughts flew for his brain as he was being measured by Ukai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"254cm. That's a nice 4cm growth spurt, Kageyama.\"<br>\r\n\"...\" He didn't say anything, waiting.<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his growth spurt never came... the only inches he grew were due to the normal development of a teenage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned deeply disillusioned to the rest of the team, who most were as tall or a little taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not me?\" He needed a few seconds to find out \"I had doubts about growing again. Maybe the stone responded to that, just like Hinata's did before?\" That didn't help him to ease his growing worries about the stone, about how dangerous it might be... and that's the reason he hadn't grown, his fears acted as a wish of not growing that was granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise draw their attention. The head of the height rod flew out, hit by a rising blond head which hadn't stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YESSS!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukishima roared triumphantly as he surpassed Hinata's mark, with no signs of stopping, kept growing taller and buffer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UNGGG, MORE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doubled his muscle mass in a second, then widthened his build to get more space to get more muscle... afterwards, continued his vertical marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll kept watching him, amazed and maybe a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGN, ugn... *MOAN!*\" WHen he thought it was finishing, he felt his cock on fire was it elongated more and more, getting more close to the floor until it oscillated between his knees (no one else had a cock long enough to reach their knees, although Hinata and Tobio's got close). Many blushed at his sight of his now nude body, and not only the girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how tall is he?\" Shimizu asked the coach.<br>\r\n\"He outgrew the rod, so surely over 9.5ft /290cm. BY A LOT.\" He answered, calculating the new height based on the size difference between them. His eye-level weren't no higher than Tsukishima's nipples.<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Some said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice...\" Tsukki thought out loud before going back to his smaller teammates. He loved how pathetically tiny they looked in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his biceps to show off. Despite being huge relaxed, they could still get a lot thicker while contracting. Tsukishima could feel their power, 2 times stronger than the day before. It felt intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be much bigger and stronger than that overestimated russian rookie, Lev. Can't wait to meet him and test my theory.\" He said maliciously as he flexed again his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't like the way the bigger giant looked at the others, with arrogance and superiority, like he did before his shrink spurt... But as long as Yatagarasu's curse remains active, he wouldn't dare to act openly like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as it remains active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukkishima's attitude relaxed a little when he joined Yamaguchi. Hinata couldn't hear when he told his shorter friend, but it was something that made the two-meters-and-a-half player blush in his flecked cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe wasn't due to his words, as he started to get red as he watched the colossal boy approaching almost completely nude (some rags remaining, none of them covering his huge flaccid cock). Or the fact he stood up close to him, his huge, perfectly chinseled pecs almost hugged his face. And his long, long snake \"\"accidentally\"\" whip his lower abs and crotch a few times. Or how his form, several head taller and way wider, almost surrounded his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the only one who felt a little embarrassed or horny that day. Most of the team had similar issues with his clothes and the growth spurts they shared also seemed to have shaken their already hyperactive teenage hormones. But most of them looked happy at their increased power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny teacher Ittetsu Takeda was there too, covering his face not to see this muscular, XXL sausage fest. Coach Ukai, less affected, came closer to him to chitchat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I feel a little envious. When I came, I swear they looked so small compared to myself, like cute kids...\" He extended his hand a little over his lips, more or less at the same height as Takeda, for his embarrassment \"...but they grew so fast! Some time ago...\" Ukai couldn't assing a date to his blurry memories, but he felt it like it had passed a week ago, as absurd as it seems \"...only the tallest matched my height, now most of the team are slightly or way taller. They're probably the tallest Karasuno team the school has seen.\" He said a little proud of, but also a little sad, as that title belonged to his promotion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as a teacher and school coach, it's our responsibility to turn the youth into men. And I think we're doing a really good job.\" After those words, the tiny teacher looked at his students with a smile, but soon one of the boys who were training accidentally got his 30cm soft cock outside of his damaged pants, so Takeda immediately avert his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's like they had a limitless potential, growing in body and mind. That's why I feel envy. I miss the way they look the world, like everything is new, and I miss becoming better as the time passes, growing up instead of growing old.\"<br>\r\n\"So, what you're saying is that you'd like to still being the biggest guy? I would never tell an almost 2.5m tall man would have an short height complex.\"<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, it's not that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was happy, but Kageyama. He was holding his stone, a wish away of getting the growth spurt he had denied himself before. But he was doubting...</span></div></div>",

Or maybe bigger?\" He kinda missed looking down at him. \"Or I could tower over Tsukishima, so I could keep his jerkery at bay. Isn't that too tall? But look at him, he looks so happy at 320cm, wouldn't a bigger height make me even happier? Tsukishima's cock is monstrous... I could have 'fun time' with something bigger than that?\"  He would like to try \"Would we eventually get bigger?\" He didn't wanted to become a freak. But he was already a freak and loved it. \"Getting bigger... Being tall and superstrong feels so good, but the growth feels almost orgasmic... I could get a little more ... no, I want the sensation to last: I want a lot, get bigger than anyone, and keep growi--- no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throw the stone to the floor before it could grant his wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growth is addictive, the last thing anyone needs is turning into a true titan or eternal growth. Sometimes getting everything you wish is dangerous. I have to be careful with the stone, I can't let it grant accidental wishes like Hinata did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked it up and put it away in his schoolbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to talk about this to Hinata, but it won't be easy after our argument\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he walked with his other teammates to the showers. Passing through the door was a challenger for many of them, not used to their unrealistic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNishinoya and Sugawara, the smallest, could went through \"only\" hunching and ducking a lot, if they were a bit taller, they would have to pass through knee-walking, like the others did (but many of those also got their heads hit agaisnt the doorframe, as they weren't still used to their new sizes. At 250+cm knee-walking wasn't enough and they also had to duck as much as they can to pass through safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had to walk on his knees, same with Kei (although the width of his shoulders gave him some trouble).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a pretty big changing room, but it wasn't as big as their gym: the high ceiling, taller than they ever needed at 3m, now looked small, as Kei couldn't stay straight, having to lower his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had two types of showers: The open ones, with sprinklers hanging from the ceiling, and about ten walled whose walls were about 240cm tall, so several of them were almost a head taller, for Hinata their top were as high as his chest and for Kei, they aligned with his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leaded to uncomfortable situations for some of the guys, like when Nishinoya was showering  calmly, shrugged when he felt like he was being observed, looked up and say the face of Tsukishima (and half of his body), leaning his arms on the wall, looking at his birdie (which were like half of his) looking amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the lose of privacy, many of the team simply went to the open showers and got used to showing  their nudity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was another problem that affected even the bolder ones: Their bigger bodies produced more hormones and that meant more horniness and easier spontaneous erections. No one was willing to have that kind of exposure, so sometimes one of two of the players hid in the walled showers to calm their beasts. That's why sometimes Tsukishima pranked them showing his face above the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir hormones had only part of the blame... the wish had affected their sexualities. When the spirit of the montain granted Hinata's first wish, he applied all kind of improvements to their bodies and minds. When he was molding them to his ideal of perfect sportsman, the one who was later called Yatagarasu couldn't help but think in the greatest olympic athletes from the ancient Greek, or legends like the powerful demigod Hercule, which usually were described their sexuality as bi. He accidentaly overwrote (expanded?) Karasuno's sexuality, but the players were fully aware of that and some still thought they were as hetero as always... until they got nude in a room filled with the hottest men in the world.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unbeknownst to Kageyama and Hinata, Kei had, with <i>strong</i> interest, overheard the conversation between the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality altered. <br>\r\nGrowing bigger. <br>\r\nMemories changed. <br>\r\nLosing size when mean.<br>\r\nGaining it when nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had clicked together in his head. So as the team prepared to go to the showers Kei held back, trying to slowly follow Tobio to his bag to see what it was he was concerned with, what miracle brought about this transformation. While huge, Kageyama was lost in thought near his bag and not paying attention, allowing the giant to hide behind a wall and spy through the open door. Even with his bad eyesight brought about by his much smaller glasses, squinting as he looked from afar at Tobio tossing the stone before reclaiming it to put away safely in his schoolbag. Kei quickly hid his head and listened to the sound of the smaller minigiants footsteps getting louder with every step taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved with as quiet a speed as possible to hide in a open room nearby, bending down as he turned his wide body with haste to hide behind the new wall as Tobios footsteps left the room, entered the hallway, and kept going. With a *Sigh* of relief, Kei turned his gaze to the direction of the bag as he hurried to leave the room with the same speed before others caught on to him not taking a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukishima entered the room where the scholbag lay, opening up each zipper to rummage for the oddity. Sure enough he discovered it in the larger side pocket. Gripping it strongly in his right hand, lips crept up as his brown eyes shoned strongly. \"So this is what changed my world and made me into\" he raised his free arm to flex, the right bicep bulging till it was larger than his head \"This!\" His muscles twitched, lip quivering as he gazed down on it. It was small in his hand, but at his normal size it would have been a pretty decent sized stone. Big enough he'd need both hands to hold it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the stone against his massive shelf of oecs, eyes slowing closing as he felt it nestled against the torn cloth rags of his uniform, third leg rising till it pressed against the stone and started leaking white gold. \"Hah...the things we will do little object if true. So first...\" He pressed his lips together, face turning red as he moved the stone to his lips with bated breath. Eyes shut tight as soft lips pressed against it. His thoughts clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me bigger\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the stone glowed bright before dimming a moment later. A warmth spreading through the 325 cm(10 ft 8) wide behemoth as his body rose higher! His shoulders continue to grow becoming a massive wall into themselves, his cock rose higher until it was now nestled against his expanding chest that continue to expand. He raised his arms up, the feeling intoxicating as he moved one foot. \"Ugh....yes....yes!\" Flexing his perfect calves and hamstring with his arms, his back exploded with mass as his wings stretched out like an ancient bird of prey. The rush of his ever expanding muscles, combined with growing size only made him all the more happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single inch made his cock twitch more, and soon he was ready to-*PLOP* *CRACK*. Kei squinted as he opened his eyes to look down, bending over due to his expanding chest blocking his view. There on the floor were his glasses, too small for his head and now cracked on the ground. Lips that were once open with delight now bent down as he looked on, eye twitching as he raised a foot and *CRACK*. Without a second thought he shattered the now useless item. Looking his hand with the stone held tight, Kei smiled. His body now happily sitting at 350 cm (11 ft. 5)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for improved eyesight.\" In a flash, the blurry vision around him changed. Becoming clear and crisp. \"Heh. No longer need those anymore.\" Yet something felt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah right. My glasses helped make my disdain towards the pipsqueaks and losers even clearer.\" He did love looking down behind the lens to show how little he thought of them. Gripping the stone again he knew what he desired. \"I wish for glasses that grow with me.\" In a flash his free hand now held a case containing a new pair of those same glasses, which he happily put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to leave he realized \"Tch. I can't take the stone with me\" His eyes pierced into the bag owned by Kageyama. \"They know, and it isn't the only one. Hmm...\" He thought for a moment as he put his free hand on a wall, lightly predsing it as it *CRACK* *CRACK* the wall began to break  with the smallest of force. Which gave his already leaking cock a twitch of exictement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I know. Stone I wish for you to come to me when I will it.\" The stone glowed for a moment before the shine dissipated again. Now the stone was his to use when he willed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And once I get home Im going to have you improve this team. But first. Shrink Hinata and Kageya-\" Suddenly his body lurched as his size began to shrink. The stone did not glow as mass disappeared and the world around him grew. Eyes widened as sweat formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Stop I do not want them to shrink.\" His size stopped disappearing, now returned to his former 325 cm. One eye twitched in annoyance, teeth bared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Then first I want the curse to no longer affect me\" Nothing happend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. So there are some things you won't grant no matter what....Very well.\" He put the stone into Tobio bag, nestled exactly where he got it. He accepted he would never be allowed to demean his teammates again, unless they did something really stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he knew there was a world of seven billion+ tinies he could look down on instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved to leave, before turning his thick neck to gaze upon its resting spot as he prepared to bend down \"But tonight we're going to do the things those two are two stupid to realize. Like making clothes fit for me to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Tsukishima set forth with plans. A part of him was thankful to Hinata and Tobio, for thise two, morons they might be, had granted him the chance to grow to his hearts content now that he had a taste for it. Becoming the worlds biggest volleyball player was not only in his sights, but he was the only one who could hope for such grand sights in a world of bu-shrimps. So he headed to the showers and the events played out as seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Present Time====<br>\r\n\"Good. Its still here.\" Tobio Kageyama sighed with relief as the stone was still in his bag. No one took it nor did Hinata get crazy and take two for even more wish granting. Picking his bag up, he headed to leave. The rest of the team, half baked and cocks on the verge of flopping out, all standing tall and stretching as they prepared for their usual jog home. Their thick ling legs carried them faster than riding a bike could, and the police stopped dealing with them after learning they have growth spurts they can't control so the nudity can't be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes!\" Nishinoya ran at top speed with Tanaka, zooming out in a blink. Sugawara and Daichi walked at their own speed, faster than normal folk but still slower than the bikes. Yamaguchi and Tsukishima were moving at a similar speed to their own houses, a creepy grin plastered on Keis face as he left. Unsettling for Tobio personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Kageyama lets go to my house for the night!\" Hinata called to him as he jumped over, the ground rumbled a little as the bigger minigiant looked at him with beaming eyes. His throbbing meat told Kageyama exactly what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't. Have something I need to check.\" Tobio admitted. He was going to see some of the limits of the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked down. \"Fine. But when you want to come over again let me know!\" And with that he zoomed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh....This whole thing has become an ordeal in itself.\" He headed off, hoping to hold off on temptation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once at home, Kageyama spent a few hours testing his stone, trying to understand its power and limitations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe confirmed the stone could materialize matter, after he wished for a watch one appeared in his wrist. Similarly, it could make it disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he checked its power in living beings, wishing a distant sparrow to come to his window, and the bird, under the control of the rock, obeyed. The power of controlling living beings, nullifying their wills, increased Tobio's concerns about what could happen if this magic stone fell in the wrong hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe experimented a bit with it, changing its color and size before reverting all and setting him free, uncomfortable with playing God with animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first failed test was a direct question about the origin of the stone and the nature of the powers. The rock wasn't conscious, so couldn't respond a question even if it was commanded to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext test: \"I wish to be in Paris, close to the Eiffel's tower\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth round of experiments consisted in teletransportation (a success). Some people began to stare at the 8'4\" muscular teen that had appeared in front of them... Tobio didn't pay attention to the little men, none taller than his nipples, and focused on his experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could I do next? Umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant volleyball player looked at the landmark and had the idea of repeating the previous tests, but at a greater scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish everyone in the tower left that place quick. Once it's empty, I want the tower to appear in my hands, as small as a key-chain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, a hundred persons began to leave the tower, quick and nervous without knowing why. The tourists who was already outside, free from the influence of the wish, didn't understand the sudden fleeing of the ones in the tower, or why the tower was sparkling with magic, but assumed the worst: a terrorist attack. The panic spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKageyama never thought his actions could lead to this terrible effect and tried to stop the chaos before someone got hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to stop my previous wish, I wish everyone remained ca- Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone answered to his plea with a painful spark, refusing to obey. In seconds, the Eiffel's Tower shrank and flew to his hands. More chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it...? I wish.. I wish...\" Tobio was getting as nervous as the hysteric crowd.<br>\r\n\"Stop right there, akuma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back and saw a pair of superheroes, a girl dressed with a red jumpsuit with black dots and a blond boy with a Catwoman cosplay, running towards him. None of them were taller than his waist or weighted more than a fraction of his mass... but Kageyama didn't want to start a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iwishtoreturntohome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash! The giant student disappeared in front of the two french superheroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was again at home, in his room which everyday looked more tiny. Kageyama didn't understand why the rock had failed to fulfill his will... he tried again, and this time the magic item obeyed and restored the tower to its original place and scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably the stone can't interrupt a wish. Or I overloaded with too many wishes. I really have to figure it out soon, but I think I've already done too much today.\" And Tobio felt bad for scaring all those Parisians. He wanted to stop thinking in that and relax, so he laid on his bed, lowered his pants and tried a bit of good old masturbation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help himself but think in the new and improved Hinata, surpassing him in all aspects... his bigger muscles under the ripped clothes, that immense flaccid cock, who knows how big it would be now when hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKageyama's dick began to release tons of precum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt envious, he lost a chance of tasting another dose of power and growth, and now for the first time since he grew he felt... ordinary. Even weak.<br>\r\nHe hated it... but a part of him liked the size difference with Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had say yes then, when he asked about sleeping together tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe masturbated faster, angrier, it felt so good... but Tobio couldn't the pleasure he felt match he and Hinata's first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!! How much I wish I were with him tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone, still in his pocket, shone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment he was in his room, the next one he was in Hinata's, with his body over his and his huge hardon left out in frony of the former dwarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kageyama??\" <br>\r\n\"Shiiiit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wasn't naked, but almost. He wasn't wearing a PJ nor shirt (all too small for him now), only an elastic boxer that was stretched to the limit by the giant bulge under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKageyama had materialized on the boy, his legs were open and surrounding Hinata's, his ass on his lap... and could felt his gigantic flaccid trembling under the underwear. His own was reacting to the orange-haired adonis Tobio had in front of him, releasing a bit more of precum over Hinata's abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stone! I accidentally thought about you, and... ahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's started giving him a blowjob without notice. The cloth of his underwear began to rip due to the expansion of his penis, which had reached Kageyama's size and kept growing further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"teleport... mmmmm! me hereAHHH!\" Talking during sex wasn't easy. \"Stop... wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stopped, like a good boy. Kageyama wouldn't mind much if he hadn't obeyed, but there was something he had to do that unfortunately had priority over fucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to put aside the stone before we wish something crazy by accident.\" He got the stone from his pants pocket (which were hanging from his ankles) and put it on the bedside table next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving it there, he was an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish this bedroom was soundproof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call. My sister is sleeping in her room. Now we can do as much room as we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RAS!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underwear finally gave up, and a cock rose a bit over the upper abs of the giant boy. Kageyama put his dick next to his, checking how that monster beat his +30cm (1') phallus in at least 10cm (4\"). Scary thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt?\" Kageyama thought, intimidated. And then, surprisingly, he saw his friends laying face down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for? An invitation?\" Hinata asked, and with no more words, Kageyama jumped over that perfectly muscular ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMMMM!! Harder!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess tight than in their first time in the bathroom thanks to Hinata's growth spurt, but that wasn't a bad thing. Kageyama could (and did) go all the way in, as rough as he wanted, without worrying about hurting his friend. The superhuman anus could withstand all that with zero pain, and sometimes, as a prank, the giant jumper squeezed his buttlocks so tightly not even Kageyama, who had the level of strength of a superhero, could release his cock from his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, the King of the Court cummed. He moved aside to let his friend spin and face him. His cock was dripping cum, but it was still hard. Unlike the other night, anal stimulation hadn't been enough to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKageyama felt obligated to help his unsatisfied friend, first with his mouth, getting a third of it inside his throat (and, in the process, finding out he has the jaw flexibility of a snake).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMmm... Kageyama? Why are you stopping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't fair, Kagemaya concluded, he were the only one who enjoyed anal sex.<br>\r\nAlso, he felt curious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising his body a feet an a half over Hinata's, put the tip of his dong on his ass and tried to sit on that metal pole.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Kageyama and Hinata were having the most savage fun in the latter's bed, Tsukishima was experimenting a different kind around Sendai.<br>\r\nThe giant student didn't care much about bed time or the lack of public safety in some parts of the city at night... No one could harm a titan like him, or force him to do anything he didn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent a lot of time wandering through the most touristic places where there was a lot of nightlife. He attracted a lot of attention, and Kei loved that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then a bunch of girls stopped him to ask him a photo together and he had to squat so he wouldn't appear \"decapitated\" in the  <br>\r\ngroup shot. On the positive side, with Tsukki's long arms they didn't need selfie sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, a woman would give him her number or make some propositions, interested in that big thing he was hiding under his ripped pants... flattering, each flirt fed his ego even more. The blond giant always answered he will think about it, but he knew that sex with any normal human was almost impossible, and while he had his cute and flexible Yamaguchi he needn't anyone else... but he kept the numbers just in case (maybe with 5 or 10 average size women... or men... he could do something in bed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's that one of those giant players?\"<br>\r\n\"I think so. I don't think there are many other 3 meter tall (10') men in this town...\" Tsukki overheard the chitchat of two dudes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3 meter and 25cm\" He corrected them in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, his height attracted a lot of attention, but he had also become pretty popular thanks to his feats as one the giant Karasuno players  (\"the tallest one\", as he liked to remind his fans) that triumphed in the last tournaments. In this timeline, during a night he could end up giving 3 dozens of photos and autographs to complete strangers. He enjoyed all that, but also felt he deserved MORE, that he should be a worldwide celebrity with bank account as big as the size of his di...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething interrupted his inner monologue: A man had tore a purse from a woman's arm and ran. Smirking, Tsukishima started brisk walking towards the thief,  who was running as fast as he could, but the distance between the two became shorter and shorter, until a giant shadow was covering the sweating delinquent and a giant hand came closer to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EH! Let me go!!\" The evildoer made a fuss, kicking in the air, while the giant teen hold him way above the ground like he was a defenseless child. He tried to get free, but he couldn't beat the strong grip of his hands. \"Drop me, you huge faggot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei's carefree face changed a little, knitting his brows a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" He said with wide open eyes, getting his face closer to his prisoner.<br>\r\n\"...ehm...\" Suddenly the thief became speechless.<br>\r\n\"Did you call me faggot?\" His grip grew tighter. A slight smile appeared in his face, a sadistic one...<br>\r\n\"N-No! Of course not, sir!!\" He replied, terrified.<br>\r\n\"It looks like the police is here... are you going to confess all your crimes to them?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\"<br>\r\n\"Good.\" He put the tiny man in the ground in front of the policemen \"But if you try to commit crimes again, I'll find you...\"<br>\r\n*gulp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo policemen proceeded to handcuff him and noticed his pants were wet.<br>\r\nA third policeman showered Tsukishima with compliments for his help today and at the bank robbery the day after, and suggested him to work with the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a body like yours, you'll beat the physical tests eye-closed.\"<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" He guffawed a little. All he said was true, and a job in the police could be fun... but he was aspiring to more.<br>\r\n\"It's past midnight, isn't it a bit too late for a highschooler...?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know... is it?\" He asked with a serious face, crossing arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policeman felt as small and insignificant as the robber did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course, a big guy like you can fend for himself, even at night. Just don't go to bed too late.\"<br>\r\n\"Heh. Of course, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left him alone with his fans. Tsukki spent a little more time outside before calling it the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarther from there, he saw two teams of teenagers like him playing street basketball. He recognized some of them, \"the <i>something</i> of miracles\" he recalled. They're quite popular basketball players, \"or so I heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt again a devilish impulse and went to interrupt their match, provoking and irritating themso they would accept to play against him... the two teams, ten experienced players, against the giant rookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massacre. No one, not even the tall purple haired guy (<i>\"just 208cm / 6'10 tall? pathetic\"</i>) could steal the ball from the giant's hands or intercept his shots, nor the boy who could predict his movements could match his reflex... despite Kei gave them all the advantages he could need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ended up leaving grumpy and humiliated, only Tsukishima was happy. It had been like boringly easy, like stealing a candy from a child, but breaking those pro's pride felt satisfying enough for Kei, who walked home thinking he could be not only the best volleyball player in the world, but the best player in every sport, even without trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fun came to an end once he arrived home. The font door, the biggest in the house, felt so ridiculously small for a 325cm/10'8\" tall boy (<i>\"it's the door's fault for being so small, not mine\"</i>) he had to crawl to pass through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, he tried to stand up but then he hit his head in the ceiling, like 60cm (two feet) lower. He remembered that day's growth spurt, and feared that his house, which was feeling too small and uncomfortable before, was now too tiny for a man of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm just in the hall, which is higher than the rest of the house...\" He thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could it get worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's late, brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei sighed. It was his older brother Akiteru, nicer than his little brother and worse in volleyball too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Tsukishima asked, hiding his irritation the best he could.<br>\r\n\"I had a problem with my flat. I'll have to live here for a while. I wanted to tell you as soon as I arrived, but you've being MIA all day.\"<br>\r\n\"I had volleyball practice. And after that... I stopped a robbery (and other things)\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing too dangerous, I see.\" He replied sarcastically. \"But you better return earlier next time. I'll reheat the dinner, why don't you go to your bedroom and get changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier to say than done: He practically had to walk on his four to his room and squeeze his muscular body through the doorframe. He looked in his wardrove for something comfortable, but he was grossed out when he noticed none of his clothes had expanded like his body and now even his two meter and a half uniform looked like child clothing. And his previous clothes were like a doll's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. Now what I'm going to wear...?\" He grumbled in front of a pile of discarded clothes. \"Yesterday I would have gone nude around the house, there's nothing more comfortable than that, but with Akiteru here I don't want to... wait, the stone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow he could have forgotten the magical stone it had altered their lives so much? He called it, and the stone responded, teleporting right to his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish all my clothes fit me... and that expensive shirt I saw but in my size, and a pair of Adidus size... 45? And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of wishes, his wardrobe was renewed with all kinds of trendy clothes, sport clothing and comfy ones. \"I can't wait to see the others' face when they see me with proper clothes instead of rags and partly ripped uniforms. Smiling, he thought in the next big thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house started trembling, but Akiteru didn't notice it, not even when the room started to expand outwards and upwards and everything inside it except him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe microwave's bell sounded, alerting the food was ready, but the blond office worker couldn't reach it: the countertop was doubled its height and a bit more and it was slightly taller than him. On the top of that, the electrical appliance was all the way to the end, up against the wall. Even on tip tops, his arm couldn't reach it. He tried jumping, climbing, but the surface was too slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need help, just call me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother appeared behind, wearing an elegant dressing gown, and reached the microwave easily.<br>\r\nHe put the dish on the table and wait for his brother to drag one of the new chairs, as tall as him, and sat on it. Even on that high chair, the tall table was at the same level as his shoulders. Eating was going to be a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can bring you a pillow if you want.\"  Tsukishima barely could hide how fun he found that situation.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I had time to get used to this house after mom bought it after we realized how tall you were going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Puzzled by his words, the huge little brother looked at an old photo they had in the wall from when Akiteru was a student in Karasuno and he was just an elementary student... but the photograph had changed and the once tiny kid with thick glasses and big smile had changed and now was head and shoulders over his bigger bro. \"The last growth spurt must have overwritten history... I couldn't have grown so tall in just a year in Karasuno, so I began growing taller long before than.\" Although, if he recalled it right, his growth skyrocketed after joining the crows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, Akiteru had some trouble trying to open the door (the doorknob was too high) until his brother did it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll eventually understand who's the real man in this house.\" He thought, arrogantly, before stretching his body without finding an obstacle \"Gosh, it has been ages since I felt comfortable in a room. And all thanks to the magic stone!\" He picked the mentioned rock from his pocket. \"Time for more domestic improvements!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building stretched upwards with each room, transforming from a house into a block of flats of sorts...</span></div></div>",

A few of the stones were loose and fell, but most of them were firmly glued to each others so the pillar didn't disintegrate while moving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black haired boy waited seconds for a reaction. Then he looked at Hinata disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this was just a joke of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lighting bolt hit a few meters from them, making them fall to the ground.

Not as much as Karasuno, but the the entire team grew by 8 inches (20 cm). Lev, the tallest member at 6'4 (193 cm) now proudly stood at 7'0 (213 cm). The dark haired captain Kuroo stood at 6'9 (205 cm), standing even higher than Tsukishima. Their lean frames now more toned as they fit larger, though clearly still not large enough, uniforms as the team entered. The massive orange haired boy grabbed Tobio's arm. \"Kageyama Nekoma's grown too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah?\" The black haired setter didn't realize what Hinata meant until a moment later \"Oh...Oh! You mean the wish you made right?\" He looked back over at them, Tobio's current memories of both teams always growing due to the Nekomata and Yatagarasu (Which is the same entity) blessings. Kageyama even remembers There was even an incident where both teams tore through their clothes while practicing. Karasuno's newest manager Hitoka Yachi and the dark haired beauty Shimizu freezing up as they saw both sides nude. Worse yet Nishinoya, Tanaka, and Nekoma's Taketora Yamamoto tried to impress Shimizu with their sizes. Naturally, she slapped the three, grabbed her kohai Hitoka's hand, and ran out as fast as possible as both teams coaches pummeled the three on the head as they blushed from the joy of Shimizu hitting them. <i>\"Well that is why they never show up at practice matches anymore. Coach was adamant about when Tanaka and Nishinoya whined.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that aside though, Kageyama focused on the moment at hand. \"Has things really changed?\" Hinata nodded rapidly \"My memories tell me they've always been growing like us. Just not as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go meet that rock guy and give him a piece of my mind later!\" Hinata crossed his arms as he declared his new objective. \"You want to join me when I do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Maybe meeting him will help me keep track of how things we-\" Kageyama stopped as the grey haired Lev siddemly jumped and collided with Hinata, both land into the floor as Kenma walked quietly over \"-re.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Lev!\" Hinata grumbled in frustration \"We were having a conversation just now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! But you did agree I can tackle you if I can catch Karasuno's mighty giant off guard!\" The half-russian smirked, cat slit eyes on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did?\" Turning to Kageyama as Kenma stood next to him. Both boys nodding in response.<i> \"It seems the me everyone remembers is an idiot!\" </i> After Lev got off him, Kenma and Kageyama held out their hands for Hinata to grab. Helping the bigger, beefier player stand up. \"Thanks Kenma! Kageyama!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" The reserved 6'2 (187 cm)  boy calmly replied. Hinata seeing he was visibly toned, while Lev was surprisingly bulky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey before the match can you tell me the trick to beating the one boss? I've been having trouble on him!\" Hinata asked the gamer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the specific boss? I can tell you the key points for doing certain skills pr when to initiate an attack...\" Kenma started to go into depth as Lev listened in. Kageyama stood there and smiled at Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nWhile those four were hanging together the captain of Nekoma had headed over to Tsukishima. \"Hey shorty four eyes!\" Kuroo teased as he looked down at the shorter boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kuroo-san.\" Tsukishima was always respectful to the captain of Nekoma, and as jumbled and confusing as his memories are he remembered even at his tallest and rudest treating him as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you can still beg me for tips later after the match. I may not be able to show as much without Bokuto to bounce off of but. I csn definitely teach you some teamwork improvement.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will Kuroo-san.\" Tsukishima was lucky and got 5 cm (2 in) from his politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can join too freckles!\" Kuroo pointed at Yamaguchi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thanks Kuroo-san!\" Yamaguchi may now be a lot bigger and stronger, but he still had more to learn to keep up with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarasuno's coach Ukai was talking with Nekoma's two coaches, the younger coach and former Nekoma player Manabu Naoi had grown like his team. Though not to the same extent and was equal to formerly 6'7 (202 cm) Tsukishima's. Height. \"Thanks for another match so soon.\" Manabu and Ukai replied to the other, both wanting to face their rivals over taking on another team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarasuno's captain and vice captain were together in a corner. The dark haired Daixhi whispering something in Sugawara's ear and making the gray haired boy blush. Nearby a certain trio of loony Shimizu worshippers lamenting her absence. Asahi was the third(sixth?) wheel sitting between the five. Daichi and Sugawara he had unknowingly discovered were in an intimate relationship, and while he adored Shimizu he wasn't crazy obsessed like those three.

The pain of blocking such a powerful shot incapacitated him for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu, the shortest player but also the quickest, got the ball and sent it back to Yaku, taking advantage he wasn't ready to receive it yet due his numb, reddened hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarasuno scored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cats' performance may have increased thanks to their growth spurt, but the crows had improved and adapted their teamwork and technique to their superior heights, playing much better than their previous match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso the fact they now had two \"Tsukishimas\", 250cm tall players, and the real Tsukki had regained part of his size, wouldn't help Nekoma...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball bounced off on the floor for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, aren't you going to pick it up?\" Tsukishima asked Kuroo, growing impatient.<br>\r\n\"NnnNn...\" He couldn't answer, just moaned softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black headed captain stayed paralyzed by an strange, pleasant sensation... he closed his eyes and hugged himself tightly as his head inched upward, exposing a row of abs which also were becoming more muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs pressed more against the elastic shirt, taking the shape of two red hills and printing the shape of his nipples over the scarlet cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stopped after a few seconds, an increase of 10cm (4\") in height and 3Kg (7Lbs) in muscle. His pants seemed fuller than a few moments ago, like someone had put a snake inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... sorry, I spaced out.\" The biggest captain got his shit together and grabbed the ball. He wasn't aware of his changes, jsut like his other teammates, who had experimented a similar growth spurt (little stronger in tall ones like Lev, slightly weaker for shorties like Kenma and Yaku).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tsukishima noticed something was different thanks to his previous shrinking trauma... the blond player gulped a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Hinata noticed the whole change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaat...\" Hinata was freaking out \"Dude, you're bigger!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe I hit a little growth spurt this week... we have been growing a lot this year...\" Kuroo answered relaxed<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, you had grown a lot just now! Like we did!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about...\" He said raising an eyebrow \"But Karasuno doesn't have the monopoly on growth spurts -fortunately-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the cats laughed, making Hinata feel like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(What was I expecting him to answer? Of course they didn't notice the change, same thing happened during my teammates' growth spurt)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKageyama was looking at the carrot haired giant. He couldn't detect the changes like the others, but he hadn't forgotten his conversation with Hinata... and he somehow felt a menacing aura all over Nekoma's players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much their teamwork had improved. This match was going to be hellishly harder than the previous one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fine?\" Inouka asked to Yaku, who a few moments ago had his hands hit by the crows' cannonball.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" His swollen hands had healed miraculously after the growth spurt. His bigger hands wouldn't get hurt so easily the next time. \"I'm going to make you pay for taking advantage of a fallen player, shorty!\" He shouted as he pointed to Yu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis increased height, now pushing the 190cm (6'4\") barrier, had increased a little his proud and confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cats got ready to serve. Most Karasuno players didn't realize this time they had to gave their all and played calmly, feeling confident that they would win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe again amplified performance of the rival team broke that illusion. Yamamoto saw an opening in their formation and throw a fast shot. They couldn't react on time. A point for Nekoma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They scored... does that mean we're going to get a free growth spurt, like they had when we scored?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden in the shadows, a strange feline smiled at Hinata wishful thinking...</span></div></div>",

With so little cloth for so much body, their t-shirts have to ride out as they keep growing, until their navels and the second row of abs was bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front area of their sporty shorts deformed as their growing cock occupied more space. The shorts descended a few centimeters, pushed by the growing junk, although the more muscular legs and ass didn't let the garment go down further, immobilizing it. Unable to get more room, their cock pressed against the fabric...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTheir feet felt more cramped on their shoes. The tallest players (Lev, Kuroo, Inuoka) had slightly faster growth rates, and ended up busting their trainers with their powerful toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose 3 players' upper-bodies became thick enough to rip a little the t-shirts on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their body expansion finally ended (like 15 secs later), they had added another 15cm (6\") in height (some more, some less). Plus the previous growth spurt, they had gained almost foot since the match started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill recovering from the intense experience, Kuroo walked towards the net. Just behind the net the Karasuno team was staring him silently, uncomfortable. Again, only Hinata noticed the change, but everyone felt something was wrong... dangerously wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 230cm tall, the black haired captain were now taller and buffer than almost every crow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to the other captain. The top of his head was below his nose level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this match is going to be very different from the previous one...\" He said with a cocky smile while he walked back to the center of their field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wondered if he had asked the same growing wish as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he did, he must be conscious of our supernatural growth... does he think we cheated by growing superpowerful? Is he mad at us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he couldn't be sure he was the culprit. He looked at the others cats, looking for a clue, but everyone acted as normal (or as normal as a giant horny teenager could act)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, Lev's huge hand moved slowly and furtively closer to his pants, incomfortabily tight due the huge semihard cock inside... but before he could touch it, Yaku jumped forward and punched his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about doing perv things during a match!!\"<br>\r\n\"I wasn't... Ow! Ouch!\" Yaku kept hitting him in his stomach, without letting him justify himself, because he couldn't reach his head. \"I just wanted to readjust my pants, make them fit better... Ouch!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLev was as childish as always, even at 8' (243 cm). He was almost as tall as Kageyama and Hinata. Another growth spurt and he would be bigger than any of them... and unstoppable. And the other weren't far behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother growth spurt and Nekoma would be the biggest team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was too stupid to think a solution. Luckily for him, Tsukishima and Kageyama were partly conscious of the problem and were trying to find a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharts:<br>\r\nTetsuro Kuroo: 6'9 (205 cm) -&gt; 7'7\" (230cm)<br>\r\nTaketora Yamamoto: 6'5 (195 cm) -&gt; 7'4\" (223cm)<br>\r\nKenma Kozume: 6'2 (187 cm) -&gt;  6'11 (210 cm)<br>\r\nMorisuke Yaku: 6' (180 cm) -&gt; 6'7\" (201cm)<br>\r\nSo Inuoka: 6'9 (195 cm) -&gt;*-&gt; 7'6\" (228cm) (he was a later bloomer :P )<br>\r\nLev Haiba: 7'0 (213 cm) -&gt; 8' (243 cm)</span></div></div>",

When the irresistible force met the immovable object, a shock wave broke all the windows and almost knocked down the smaller and weaker players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball bounced upwards, hitting the ceiling like a cannonball, forming cracks and falling dust, and descended to Nekoma's with equal force.<br>\r\nInuoka diverted it, hurting his arms a bit in the process, to pass it to Yaku who hit it with passion, adding more momentum and a new trajectory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went back to Hinata with more strength than ever and although the giant boy intercepted it its inertia pull his heavy body backwards. He almost left the field, but the almost as big Yu put his body behind Hinata's and between the two were able to stop it, falling between their long feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Score.\" Yaku proclaimed, proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me serve\" Kageyama asked Hinata, who gave him the ball. Whatever move he was planing didn't work, Kenma returned it to him, throwing the smaller player to the ground. \"Dammit.\" Despite being superstrong, he felt the hit and hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other side of the net, Yaku watched Kenma with mixed feelings. \"That shot was faster and stronger than mine. I wish I could do something like that.\" Noticing how he was a (giant) head taller than himself, he unconscious felt a bit of envy for that too. In his life prior the growth spurt he had a great height complex and despite he was now one of the tallest men in the planet part of that complex remained in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way you sum your power to the ball's momentum earlier was amazing, senpai!\" A lower voice called Yaku. It was Lev.

But first you have to do everything I say, and work harder in your training\" Lev nodded with enthusiasm, despite Yaku's words were insincere. He didn't want him to catch up.

The student council room shined as the sparkling light of Rayshifting transported a mysterious mechanical object from an alternate timeline branch, one which was likely culled in the Quantum Time Locks. It was palm size, with its numerous parts sprawled about and resembling something that a human would make. It had a smooth and angelic aesthetic to its design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe true purpose of this device lost through the numerous rayshifts it has gone through from the original reality it emerged in. A weapon made by the Gods during the Age of Gods to combat the Giant of Light who arrived from space to eliminate all life 12,000 years ago, only for its world to fall to the Giant before the wielder of the Holy Sword could defeat her. A weapon to make a human into a Divine Spirit capable of standing against even the mightiest of threats that target Gaia and their Golden Age. A weapon that allows them to defy even the law of physics that the Gods themselves could not fully defy such as the square cube law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would come to serve its purpose in an unconventional manner once brought before a human boy who can wield Projection to Trace it, a process usually not possible by human hands on objects of Divine Origin. It would finally serve the purpose it was made for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===The next day===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was this odd thing you wanted me to check out?\" The red haired Shirou asked his friend Issei Ryudou as he brought him to the Student Council Room. Issei had stopped by earlier to ask him to meet him in the Council Room, Rin nearly entering the classroom caused Shirou to move Issei out of the room through the second door, barely avoiding Issei and Rin having their typical feuding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We came in this morning and saw a weird object in there. We assume the principal left it there for us to deal with, so I was hoping you'd fix it for us.\" The blue haired Council President opened the door, showing hims the object on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou walked over, examining the object and touch it and the smaller parts with his hand, slowly gliding his fingers over its smooth surface. \"Looks like it won't take long. So leave it to me like you usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Shirou. I've got to get going. The school's been having a problem with kids being exhausted and the Coaches want me to find out what's wrong.\" With that Issei left the room, letting Shirou work alone like he always does at Shirou's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All right. Let's find out what's wrong.</i> \"Trace on!\" As Shirou said those words, blue light emerged as lines began to spread across the main object and one of its smaller parts that he was touching. It was different from most objects he messed with, yet still simple enough to figure out with a decent understanding of technology. He used Trace On to fix some flaws with the inside of the device placing the first part into its right side once he finished. It took him a few minutes to figure out what exactly to fix, but once he did the parts fit into the object like they were intended to. Soon there was none left but the object itself, which he noticed had an angelic aesthetic to with two of the parts he attached resembling wings and a built in halo. <i>Weird. Well at least it's-</i> His thoughts stopped as he saw that different red and black lines trailed over the device, turning on and activating to \"bless\" the one who had finally allowed it to serve its purpose: to weaponize humans and ensure the continuation of the Age of Gods no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, it let out a flash of light mixing red and black with its gold and silver....</span></div></div>",

The sun welcoming their reunion as they crossed the brdige that bound them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara!\" Yelled out the first boy who bore brown hair with a smile wide.<br>\r\n\"Sara!\" Called out by a second smiling boy with blue hair and freckles.<br>\r\n\"Sara!\" Repeated by a third happy boy with orange brown hair and glasses.<br>\r\n\"Sarazanmai!\" In unison they called out, right hand on their heads and the left behind them as they stood like statues on the hard wall between the normal rails. A boat traversing the waters below the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree boys, tied by their fate together, united again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done you three, kero!\" A voice called from far away, a thin leg comically stretched kver a mile long l planting it self above the boy in the middle with brown hair, Kazuki Yasaka moved out of position as he looked up to see a pencil thin twig of a leg stretching as boundless elasticity across the blue sky. Soon followed by the other two as a loud *FLING* rumbled, small white body attached to the leg came into view from the horizon. Crashing down on the leg with a *BOING* as it bounced a couple of times, slowly turning around. A white <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">frog</span> Kappa with a yellow disc between leafy hair front now displayed before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great. Can't even have a reunion between the three pf us before Keppi shows up...\" Kazuki tried to sound annoyed, but his lips still curled upwards.<br>\r\n\"Im happy all of us are united for Tooi breaking out of juvie!\" The oranged haired bearing glasses on his visage, Enta Jinnai, mused.<br>\r\n\"Busted out? Wish I thought of that. Could have escaped the joint with you two as my accomplices.\" The blue with freckles, Tooi Kuji, contemplated the bad disguises Enta and Kazuki would wear. <i>Stereotypical thief for Enta and Kazuki would probably dress up as a girl.</i><br>\r\n\"No way. No way.\" Both bounced back in response as they waved a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHEM!\" Keppi let out a cough to get attention. The three jumping down as they got close to the little fr-Kappa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know last time you saw me you likely glimpsed my true visage, kero. Hard to believe its been three years, kero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. True visage?\" Heads tilting as arms joined together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you three didn't see my glorious form as a Kappa prettyboy, kero!? Oh dear I must now show you-wait now isn't the time to make this about me, kero!\" Quickly a front leg dug into pockets that domehow exost on his weird Kappa skin, *RUMBLE* and *SHINGS* were heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Keppi what is this about?\" Enta was puzzled more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must offer my condolences to you three, kero. Despite offering you a Dish of Hope to grant your wishes as compensation, the final battle instead saw you three save history from the otters and only glimpse former future, kero. The last Dish wasted because you were helping me over your own desires leading to life threatening situations, kero.\" *RUMBLES* and *SHINGS* still filled the air with noise as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean we did cause trouble and make things more hectic...\" Kazuki thought back to their fights and using it to save Entas life when Reo shot Enta, shielding Kazuki despite their bickering prior.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We kinda didn't think about the Dishes after all was said and done.\" Enta remembered his jealously that lead to said situation.<br>\r\n\"I would have brought it up if I wa ted aneasy way out of juvie.\" Tooi reminded, getting sent for shooting Yakuza who tried to harm him and his now deceased brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVERTHELESS, kero.\" A loud *PLOP* resonated as he pulled out three gold Dishes of Hope, all three on display wrapped around by tendril like fingers of his bizzare body. \"Me, my sweet angel of a Kappa, Reo, and Mabu worked hard turning things back against Otter Empires tyranny to get you a reward heroes who made it all possible deserve, kero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three dishes of Hope?!\" Mouths agape as he sloppily tossed them in the air. Hair frizzled on their heads as they ran around like headless chickens to grab one each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, kero! We had a fourth but we wished to reclaim the Kappa Kingdom with it from the Otters, kero. Well and four we originally grab but I kept wishing for cucumbers and Sara for me to not be flat as a sheet of paper after an elephant stepped on me kero....Now enjoy your gift as my sweet angel of a wife and our royal guards catch up with us, kero!\" Three Kappas, off in the distance in human form, breathing hard if they ran as fast as possible to get to the fours current destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes glittered in excitement as Enta looked at his Dish. Thoughts of Kazuki. Lewd, perverse desire amplified by being older and hornier than he was three years ago. A desire he would share with no one except Kazuki and Tooi....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP* Kazuki mouth watered. He had becoms infatuated with something deep and intense as him a d Haruka played games all these years, further infatuated by Enta doing sumo wrestling with him when they weren't playing soccer. A desire he could only share with Enta and Tooi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTooi did not let his thoughts show, keep it all to himself save for a mutter under his breath \"Big enough no one could hold me prisoner again....\" A desire he could only share with Kazuki and Enta....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have your wishes in mind, kero?\" The three nod as they raised them in the air, making a wish loud and clear for the world to hear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to the three of us would one day have the biggest dicks in the world!\" Orange brown hair rustled under the wind as green eyes shined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish the three of us would one day be the biggest and strongest creatures in the galaxy!\" Dark brown hair rustled as reddish brown eyes glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that one day the three of us will grow so huge we will be the biggest things in the universe!\" Dark blue hair rustled as blue eyes sparkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree wishes, unified by their connection and desire as friends bonded beyond anything even despair could handle, channeled the powwer of the Dishes as they disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there standing nearby their feef was Keppi. Letting thwir wishes sink in, \"Eh......eh......EEEEEEEHHHHHH KERO!?!?\" eyez bulged out so far in shock they were as long as his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HUFF HUFF HUFF* The exasperated noise of three arrivals signaled the remaining Kappas appearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I arrived just in time *HUFF* my sweet little dish, so how *HUFF* did it go?!\" Sara the Kappa Princess asked her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GOD *HUFF* IM GONNA DIE *HUFF*\" Reo desperately cried out as he collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabu was sweaty but otherwise fine. \"I told you best to stay in shapd Reo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keppi calms down and tries to cope with their unexpected wishes. The three boys laughing about the others wishes as they realized the phrasing meant it would take time for them to come to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. They undergo the first phase insantly! Three ten foot tens so big, thick, and wide they take up the entire width of the bridge! Reality acting as if their changes are normal as they hang out and play the worlds biggest soccer game and sumo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Keppi paases out from shock as Sara congratulates them and Reo wishes HE thought of their wishes for him and Mabu.</span></div></div>",

At that time, Kazuki had already left the team and some of his teammates (the assholes) had taken advantage of this to start bullying him, mostly with pranks and disguised insults. The offenders were a few older students who hated the way the \"golden duo\" used to monopolize the ball at the matches, but there were also a few problematic new members with a sadistic personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this memory/dream, they went to the showers. The shy Enta usually went to a corner to undress himself and then directly to one of the individual showers, but that day he was intercepted by three seniors with an evil smile in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, guy, move...\" He asked them, but they kept blocking his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth bully, a guy a head taller and more muscular (the puberty hit him harder than Enta) approached him from behind and pulled down his soccer pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at his dick! It's so tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediantely Enta covered his junk, but it was too late: Everyone had seen it and started to laught. The jokes continued for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===Real world/Present===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnta writhed on his bed, sweating, trapped in his bad dream... but something else was happening.<br>\r\nThe bulge in his undies was growing is streaching like it was experimenting an erection, but the way it was growing down instead of trying to grow upwards hinted his cock was fully soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expansion stopped when there was no space left under the underwear, his junk compressed to point of pain, molding a mount-like shape in the undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===Dream/Memory===<br>\r\nThe afternoon after the incident the boy meassured his penis. Although its flaccid form was small, like 5cm (2\"), he was a grower and could double its size (and then add a few more centimeters) when it got hard. A normal size for a growing teenager, but it was something he couldn't probe to his bullies without looking like a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, he had started to believe them and feel his cock was tiny, unmanly, unadequate...<br>\r\nAt that moment, with his cock still hard in one hand, he dropped the ruler he was holding in the other and started jerking it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, grow a little more...\" He begged with wet eyes, but his hard cock seemed to have reached its limit \"I don't want them or Kazuki to laught at me when they see it, so please, get a little bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===Real world/Present===<br>\r\nResponding to the imaginary wank, his enlarged cock began to swell, stretching to the border of the undies, curving upwards, creating a tent with the white cloth of his underpants, then it expanded even more, putting so much pressure on the cloth the seams started ripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a natural grower, and the wish had enhaced that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===Dream/Memory===<br>\r\n\"I... I... I WANT TO BE BIGGG!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe siluete of Enta, representing his subconscious, screamed his hidden desire. A flash of the golden dish appeared in his mind, with the words \"HUGE DICK\" written on it, before shattering again.<br>\r\nSome more images. A strange pleasant feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnta didn't notice what happened until he went to the bathroom and saw a huge soft penis hanging from a rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaaa!?\"<br>\r\n\"Enta, what happened?\" His sister tried to enter in the bathroom, but the boy blocked the door before she could see anything.<br>\r\n\"NOTHING! I just stepped in a lego piece!\"<br>\r\n\"Ok. Get ready quick or you'll be late to school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool. Enta get some baggy boxers and tried to fit the snake in them so it wouldn't stand out too much, but even that way anybody who pay attention to his crotch would notice he had the biggest bulge in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving Enta took it off and meassured it quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"14 centimeters (5.5\")\" He muttered without believing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2cm longer than his hard cock was yesterday, and easily two times thicker. Who knows how big it could get.<br>\r\nA part of Enta wanted to check that now, but the voice of his sister gingered him up and left that idea for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The truck traveling safely in the 20th Ward where Anteiku resides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god we didn't get dragged into that mess\" The first investigator said as he drove the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just think if we ran into one of those monsters\". The second grunt shivered along with the first at the thought of facing the One-Eyed Owl, the Chinese fire wielding Tatara, and the creepy yet silent Noro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness we're safe away from the-\" CRASH! The transport truck fell over as a powerful impact rammed into it. The two investigators were knocked out by the crash as they hit their heads, glass shattered around them but relatively safe. A black and red Rinkaku kagune opened the passengers door, its centipede like appearance checking their pulse to make sure they're safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good. They're safe.</i> The attacker sighed in relief at seeing them unharmed. His white hair contrasting his black mask that hides his face. Ken Kaneki, the One-eyed Ghoul, had overheard Aogiri talking of unique quinque with strength boosting properties. Wanting to have the power to never see himself or the people in front of him suffer again, Kaneki saw a perfect opportunity to get said power. He rammed his Rinkaku into the back of the truck, ripping the doors open with his multiple tentacles. Examining the Quinque stored on each side, eight in all, Kaneki wondered what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could eat the kagune originated parts and take them home that way so its easier, or I can carry them as is to Anteiku</i>  Kaneki pondered as investigators no doubt head for the crashed truck.</span></div></div>",

Completed papers strewn across the floor and bed, his arms crossed his arms as smoke spews forth from his ears. The papers before him on the desk barely scribbled on. \"I can't handle math. I wish Mito wasn't making me do this.\" frustration in his speech as he thinks back to how Mito told him to catch up to the years of schoolwork he left behind while he lived as a Hunter and searched for his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon tried to force himself to solve the math problems as quick and accurate as possible to end the nightmare before him. <i>If I don't finish soon I'll eventually have another year of homework to do.</i> Gon shivered in horror at the thought.<i> I wish something will save me from this horrible nightmare.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, a knock on his door had come to answer his prayers. \"Gon. It's your friend Killua. He's on the phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up with joy at a chance for relief he walked over to the door and answered \"Thanks Mito!\" as fast as possible as he headed downstairs to the phone. Mito stood there unsurprised that he sought a chance to get away from his schoolwork. Looking at the mess she sighed. \"At least he's doing it properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs Gon quickly arrived at the phone to talk to Killua Zoldyk. \"Hi Killua! What's going on with you and Alluka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much.\" Killua replied with some joy at talking to Gon \"We just got to Yorknew city. We're planning where to go right now. Palm and the others told me they called and that Mito's been making you do lots of schoolwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I'm bored out of mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good news! Nanika says she wants to help you. She knows how boring being locked away can be\" Gon wasn't sure what Killua was talking about, but he knows that there were \"complicated issues\" concerning their family situation and that Kil wouldn't explain more. \"So we're going make things easier for you \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanika enhance Gon please\" Killuas words were heard by Gon as well as Nanikas \"Aye\" over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly a glow of nen overwhelmed his body. A feeling of warmth filling his being as he felt his mind relax and exhaustion from thinking was gone. The feeling, still feeling him with a warm pleasure, talks on the phone. \"I feel great! More than capable of handling math now. Thank you Killua, Alluka, and Nanika!\" he siaid over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome Gon. Alluka and Nanika are happy it seems to have helped.\" Killua replied as he thought what to say next. \"A month from now Alluka wants you to come here. She wants us to hang out for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling still persisting across his body, Gon replied \"I'll make sure to finish by then and have Mito let me go. Bye Killua!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Gon!\" Killua finished as he hung up on the other side, hanging up the phone, Gon went up the stairs to begin doing his schoolwork again as the warmth still spread. \"I'll get this done in no time!\" Unbeknownst to Gon, his arms that loss their muscle tone from being healed were slowly gaining an inch of definition.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During the following days, a transformation took place, both physical and mental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery passing day studying became easier, his mind could memorize more information in less time and he could concentrate more easily in his tasks. His aunt couldn't be more pleased, although she didn't know the real, unnatural cause of all this... neither was Gon, who was still an absent-minded boy and had already forgotten Alluka's little help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other aspect of the transformation affected subtly his body. Each day he grow almost nothing, like a centimeter. An amount small enough to go unnoticed from one day to another. But after the first week, his shirt and trousers didn't fit him well, exposing his ankles and a band of his plain tummy. He was as tall as his guardian now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're hitting puberty.\" Mito said smiling as she gave him new clothes. He looked at the pile of finished homework he had on his desk and smiled again \"You're also much more mature and responsible...\" her face changed \"...so unlike Gin\" She thought next<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nThe next week his studying performance had improved so much he could finish 5 hours of homework in just one. He used the rest of the time to train his atrophied body and his muscles responded well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter other 7 days, 7cm of height and a few extra pounds of muscle, Gon needed to renew his wardrobe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, today's children do grow up fast\"<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nAt that point, he was already taller than his aunty. He kept training. His musculature already matched Killua's, and it was improving every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the week, he looked older than he really was. His face remained unchanged, but the increased height, wider shoulders and strong build made him look like a young adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did his father grew so fast at his age...?\" Aunty Mito wondered worried after giving him new green clothes.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nThat week Gon decided to train his nen too. His Nen skills had been damaged and blocked after his battle against Neferpitou, and no one believed restoring them was possible... but lately he felt he could archive anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst day, first Nen exercise: he accidentally released an incredible amount of nen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't forget his physical training, and so, two days later, he noticed he almost had outgrown his brand new t-shirt. It wasn\u2019t caused by a new growth spurt, it was too soon, it was because of his muscles developing faster than ever. His pecs had increased their thickness and now were pressing against the fabric, making their shape visible to everyone. His abs became much more prominent, like six hard rocks. His bermuda shorts stretched as his thigh got thicker, and those weren\u2019t the only growing things stretching his pants\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t want to bother his aunt and forcing her to go shopping again (he had to take a boat to get to a clothing shop), so he kept wearing it.<br>\r\nBut after a day, his tshirt were so skintight the shape of his nipples was perfectly visible through the cloth. The sleeves hugged tightly his swollen biceps. His t-shirt started to feel to short, more due to the growing girth of his torso than the few centimeters he grew in half a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother day passed, and his t-shit got even tighter. He hardly could move with it, so he spent a good part of the day shirtless, only putting it on before meeting her auty. Unfortunately, his plan backfired the next day at lunch. When Gon tried to reach the salt, the tensed t-shirt burst, revelating his well defined chest to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll fix it...\u201d he answered hastily and embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hand on the rip and instinctively tried to close it by graving the cloth.<br>\r\nThat tensed again the clothing to the point of creating another burst in the opposite side, over his perfectly V-shaped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap. I better go to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get up from his chair. Then his shorts teared up a little too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHH!\u201d He ran to his room ashamed of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after Mito measured him and shortly afterward she went shopping again for her 6 feet tall nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the biggest size they had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothing fit well for a day. During his training he sensed how it was constricting him again. He lost his cool and teared the front of the shirt up to regain mobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ended up being a good idea. That way no matter how much his pecs grew or his shoulder stretched, his \u201copen shirt\u201d would adapt to the new girth by opening itself more. And during his last days with his aunt he grew plenty more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a month since Killua\u2019s call and it was time to pay him a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw his aunty off, and hugged her affectionately. The height difference was funny.<br>\r\nAt that time he was 185cm tall (like 6\u20192) and a head taller than her. Also his wide, muscular build made her look smaller. When he arrived her home a month ago, she was the one almost a head taller. The time (and magic wishes) changes everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he head for Yorknew city. Even with his enhanced speed, the journey took him a few days during he kept growing a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he arrived the City, he met Killua.</span></div></div>",

The race had begun, and Gon\u2019s new speed had caught Kil by surprise. During those seconds of advantage he had got away so much the white haired boy almost couldn\u2019t sight him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheran in a straight line as fast as he could. His speciality was the speed, but he couldn\u2019t match Gon\u2019s by normal ways. He had to resort to his Godspeed skill to caught him up when he was within a few meters of the goal. Killua made an extra effort, surpassed him and won by mere inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe the killer boy fell to the ground, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, that was fun!\u201d Gon exclaimed very excited \u201cI want the rematch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKil looked at him. \u201cHe isn\u2019t even sweating.

Long time no see!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re... tall?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Cool, right?\u201d Gon was proud of his height.<br>\r\n\u201cCool?? That\u2019s not normal! It could be caused by an illness! You have to go to a hospital!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSome people are naturally huge.\u201d Killua tried to calm him \u201cYou\u2019re as tall as him, my father is a little taller, and that giant from Phantom trouple...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStill, I want to do him some tests to be sure he\u2019s fine\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt about Leorio being a killjoy. Kurapika didn\u2019t say anything, but his eyes had gotten red. He could feel Gon\u2019s power, it was incredible and it was growing\u2026 With that kind of power, he could easily destroy the Phantom Trouple. He was going to investigate Gon\u2019s transformation, but it would do it discreetly, on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were talking, Killua felt a little disconfort in his bones. It ended quick and he forgot it immediately. He was 7cm (3\u2019) taller now, but it went unnoticed next to Gon\u2019s gains. His baggy clothes still fit him well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day Leorio did some basic examinations on the giant boy, but he couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with him. He started to record his height, which was now slightly bigger than his at 195cm tall. He lend him some of his clothes which fit him better than the rags he had been wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua was training alone when he experimented another growth spurt, this time he rose over 10cm.<br>\r\nHis body was trying to catch up Gon, but with big spurts instead of Gon\u2019s slow, constant growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he didn\u2019t notice nothing because he was exercising shirtless, but when he finished and tried to put his tshirt he found out it didn\u2019t covered his navel. His abs looked even more defined than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird\u201d He thought before he went back to the hotel they were staying. Kurapika was there, waiting for the return of Gon and Leo. He noticed the white haired boy was now taller than him, likely 175cm tall, but he didn\u2019t say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother day passed. This time Leorio wanted to get a magnetic resonance imaging of Gon, but in the hospital they find out Gon\u2019s shoulders were so wide he didn\u2019t fit inside of the scan. Other tests only showed how healthy he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeorio observed the boy while he was putting on his lent black shirt. His naked torso looked even more impressive than yesterday, to the point he hardly could button up the buttons over his chest are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnlike Kil, he hasn\u2019t been training lately, but he is packing muscle fast.\u201d He confirmed \u201cIs that another symptom of a hypothetical illness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came back to their hotel. They wanted to dinner in a restaurant, but Killua refused to leave his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happens?\u201d His friends asked him at the other side of his door.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. I don\u2019t feel very well. I\u2019m going to rest a little, and...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYOU DON\u2019T FEEL WELL??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeorio went full on \u201cParamedic mode\u201d and broke down the door to \u201csafe\u201d him. Killua was there, but he wasn\u2019t ill, he was almost completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis t-shirt was ragged, busted by another explosion of height and muscles. His thigh were so thick that his trouser legs were half ripped, and they looked like they would tear completely if Killua took a single step.

It was obvious for him the kids where taller than him (his eye level was now on their nose), but he needed exact data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua went first. He undressed and got on a scale which also had a height rod wearing nothing except his underwear (also lent by Leorio, but it was starting to look too tight for him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rod confirmed he was 198cm (6'6\"), 5cm (2\") taller than Leorio, and he weighed 95Kg (210Lbs), outweighing him with 10 extra kilos of muscle well distributed on his thick legs, arms and torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes you like 2cm taller than Gon...\" Leorio commented after looking over the data of Gon he took two days ago \"A small different, like you had before this 'growth spurt' started.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? He seems as tall as me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't going to repeat the same test on him, but after Kil's commentary he measured him too, and got surprised how he had grown a little during those two days, matching up Killua's height and body mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gon is growing at a stable pace, more or like a centimeter (0.4\") per day and he told me it began a month ago\" He informed Kurapika hours later, worried about their results \"Killua added a foot and a half in about two days and when he caught him up his growth slowed. All data suggest he's going to grow a cm/day too. It's so illogical... What kind of disease could cause two different boys to grow synchronized?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" The androgynous hunter nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside their heights, they look healthy and in top form. There was no signs of health problems, but no one knows what could happen if they keep growing like this. An extra centimeter doesn't look much from one day to another. But if this kept going on it would make a whole foot in a month. 12 feet in a year. The increasing effort of his bigger bodies may damage their hearts, bones and organs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurapika was interested in their transformation, but he didn't share Leorio's concerns. After observing how much stronger and faster they had become, he desired the same thing for him. Even if that growth shortens his life, he was willing to pay that price to kill the trouple. And his young friends were the key for it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were talking, Kill and his sister were in another room. He was about to ask her something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanika, I think we have grown enough. Please, stop our growths.\"<br>\r\n\"Nay\" She sentenced and immediately continued playing with her toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time she rejected a wish from his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Why not?\"<br>\r\n\" 'cause that would contradict the other wish. I couldn't do it until it's done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a rule Killua wasn't aware of. Not even Kil could make her undo an underway wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When... when is my enhancing wish going to finish?\"<br>\r\n\"You asked to be as big as Gon, brother... so when he stops growing, you will stop too.\"<br>\r\n\"When is he going to stop?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't know.\"<br>\r\n\"How could you not knowing? You're the one who granted!\"<br>\r\n\"You asked me to enhance him, but you didn't tell me how much. And after that he desired to keep growing, but he didn't say for so long. I can grant any request, but if you don't specify details, my power takes will fill the holes for its own. Like what I have to 'enhance' or what does 'looking up' actually means. \"<br>\r\n\"Then he... WE... could grow forever?\" Kil was getting more and more uneasy.<br>\r\n\"Nay. He didn't wished for eternal grow. I think it will stop after a while.\"<br>\r\n\"And how long is 'a while' ?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't know. A week?\" His big brother gave a sigh of relief after hearing that. \"Or maybe 10 years?\" That relief disappeared quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanika noticed fast he wasn't happy about her doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but brother, I thought you wanted to be really powerful! I granted your wish in secret because I wanted to make you happy. Did I mess... everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to start crying, but then his brother hugged her and comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Nanika, you did it right. With this new strength I can protect us from our family and all the bad guys in the world. But I'm a little worried to become too big to fit in a house.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, brother! As soon as the first wish ends, you could wish to become small again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he might have to wait years for that.</span></div></div>",

Alluka's  Shrine Maiden clothes obscuring his thicker neck as she held on to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the two siblings, Gon's desires were far greater than either could expect as Killua felt a chill across his body. \"Brr!

Are you okay Big brother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like there's a chill coming over me\" Killua said as his body slowly started to inch higher. Choosing to ignore it, the two began leaving the room as Killua bent down at the doorway, allowing Alluka to open the door and he bends just enough to let Allukas head theough the door. The two leaving to go get ice cream. Killua not realizing the chill was his body inchinding higher as he grew to 6'9 (205 cm) in the past couple of minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get Gon and have him join us!\" Alluka said as they were walking near the room Gon was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I want to know just how much Gon wants to keep growing\" The two soon arrived at Gon's room. Alluka knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" Gon's called out as he headed for his door. As he opened it Killua was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're huge Gon!\" Killua called out as Gon's head was higher than the seven foot door. Even Killua was small enough to go through doorways and didn't pay attention to the size. Gon bent down to exit it, and Killua almost felt like he saw him grow an inch(2.54 cm)  in that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon's big brown eyes beamed down at Killua as he stood up to  his new height of 7'4 (223 cm). His muscles having grown even more in clothes too small and tight for someone his size. Gon had a look of joy \"Just been training! It's had some great results! So Kil you wanna go get some clothes and food? Im starving after training so long\" He stretched an arm that nearly reached the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but what do we tell Leorio and Kurapika? You know he'll wanna test us to see if we're alright after you've grown that big.\" Killua replied, having let himself oogle Gon's sweaty beefy form for only a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's boring being stuck here all day. Let's go have fun the four of us. Ain't that right Alluka?\" Gon went to high five Alluka who happily high fived him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his better judgement seeing the two most important people in his life happy lead Killua to give in. \"All right. We'll let them know later.\" He was worried about just how big they both will get, yet the fact he'll be he only person to rival Gon in size made the silver haired Zoldyck happy. The two walked together with Gon taking the front due to how wide both were, Alluka happily looking forward as she sat on Killua's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When we get big enough Im going to have to make a ton of requests to Nanika so we don't hurt people we care about</i> Killua thought as they walked, the three soon exiting the building as Gon and Killua rose higher and higher, Killua now matching Gon's towering height before the next inevitable burst brought forth by desire.</span></div></div>",

But that didn't stop their plan: The scatterbrain Gon didn\u2019t realized all that attention whereas Killua did but couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir first stop was a clothing shop. It wasn't a really fun place to go, but they wanted to find more fitting clothes ASAP. The ones they were currently wearing were owned by Leorio, and although he was a very tall and buff at 6\u20194 (194cm) they had manage to outgrew them by a foot in height and several pounds in muscle... Unfortunately, in the Hunters World the people as tall as Leorio are a minority and the shop didn\u2019t have clothes as big as their current ones, much less any bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they went to a theme park. They tried a lot of games and eventually went to the roller-coaster. Killua stayed outside, keeping an eye on his sister while she was having fun in the ride, looking for any sign of danger, as the overprotective brother he was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but he also has to watch over his friend, who was sitting beside him, almost sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do the roller-coasters have to have a MAXIMUM height too??

It was weird for the people in the park to see such a huge man crying on the floor, but Kil knew Gon well, and knew it doesn\u2019t matter how big he had become, he was still a sweet innocent boy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we go for some milkshakes once my sister had returned?

It\u2019s the best roller-coaster in the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing his words, Gon started to cry again, kept doing it until he emptied three milkshakes cups. His white-haired friend was still with his first orange juice, and her sister was playing with her ball nearby after finishing hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother one, please.\u201d Gon asked to the waiter with a smile in his face dirty with cocoa, a funny look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, Gon\u2026 Did I ruin everything with my wish? You would have ridden the roller if I hadn\u2019t made Nanika expand you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 right.\u201d He had already forgotten the role of his sister on his body changes. \u201cThat felt bad, but I\u2019m not angry at you or her\u2026 it\u2019s just a fairground ride.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not only that\u2026 buying clothes is going to be harder\u2026 travel by car, bus or plane too\u2026 you have already hit your head against doorframes three times today\u2026 we can\u2019t stand up straight in some low room\u2026 look, we can\u2019t fit our legs under this table.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThose are\u2026 a lot of things, but they\u2019re just small inconveniences...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs we grow up, there will be more and bigger issues. Sooner or later we\u2019ll be too big for everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon became speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought we would have lots of time to fix this, growing a centimeter per day, but this morning we had a 25cm (10\u201d) growth spurt. If it happens more times we\u2019ll become freaks in no time, and it will be my fault.\u201d His face saddened more as he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel guilty for this. Maybe the growth will complicate our lives, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing.

Kuropika and Leo were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProtect her!!\u201d No time for explanations. He looked back, expecting to see one of his brothers after them, but no one was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 They stayed with Gon...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua raced to the park as fast as he could, but his hurt leg didn\u2019t respond well and ended up falling to the ground, wasting valuable seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Gon thanked Nanika for the wish. His new powerful body was the only reason he could put a fight against two killers of the Zoldyck clan. Without his last growth spurt he would probably be already dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike he was now, he could block most of their attacks thanks to his steel-hard skin and his nen aura, but even so, some of the attack manage to hit him, and as the fight progressed he started to accumulate damage. In this state, his best attack, Rock, wasn\u2019t fast enough to reach them (although he could surprise them with scissor once, hurting them)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua\u2019s voice made him look back. His friend was finally back. His eyes looked at him, filled with hope\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then became empty when Illumi\u2019s arm pierced his back, heart and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOO!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua lost his mind and jumped over them with bloodlust and thunder. Maybe he could have been successful where Gon failed\u2026 he was in better shape and had more training\u2026 but before he could do anything, his father appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waked up chained in a dark, cold dungeon. His family was there, lecturing him about family loyalty and rules\u2026 he didn\u2019t listen, he kept yelling and screaming full of rage while trying to break free from those chains, but although they rustled they didn\u2019t broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t break them. No one can. You\u2019ll only be freed once you learnt to behave.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYOU KILLED HIM!!\u201d His words included all his family, but his eyes were fixed on his father.<br>\r\n\u201cYour unhealthy growth was synchronized with his.\u201d He replied \u201cIt might have killed you in the long term\u2026 but if he\u2019s dead, he won\u2019t grow anymore, so as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua lost his mind again and went berserk again, but his chains endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you need some time to clear your thoughts\u2026\u201d They said before closing the door, leaving him in pitch darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat none of the Zoldyck knew was that Gon had actually survived. Kurapika and Leorio found him in the park and brought him to a hospital where Leorio and some medics tried to save his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 hours of surgery later, Leorio left the operating room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is he\u2026?\u201d Kurapika was concerned.<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 he should be dead. His heart was practically ripped up\u2026 but we saw it beating and slowly healing somehow... We sutured it, stopping the bleed, but the damage is so great a normal person, not even a hunter, wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut she\u2019s not a normal person anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeorio was visibly shaken. He lit a cigarette before continuing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe also have a lot of poison in his blood, one so lethal when a medic made contact with a drop of his blood he died instantaneously. We had to wear isolating suits during the operation. We injected some broad-spectrum antidotes, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll survive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon was resting at intensive care unit. It was the biggest bed in the hospital, but it barely could bear his weight and his feet were almost in the border\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon frowned in dreams, and his body expanded slowly, centimeter by centimeter, until his feet stuck out of the bed. His vitals became stronger after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away from there, under Zoldyck\u2019s mansion, Killua was still trying to get rid of his shackles when he experimented the same 13cm (5\u201d) growth spurt. The shackles rustled under his bigger strength, but he still couldn\u2019t break them.</span></div></div>",

His body developing powerful antitoxins to counter the poison to slowly make him immune and resistant to the deadliest of venoms, organs healing and strengthening their cells with an intense yet natural armor of Nen aura surrounded them beyond his conscious control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon wamted to be bigger and his desire made him grow a foot instantly a day before. That the Zoldycks had never taken into account exactly why his body would grow and enhance in every way to his desire had escaped them. He wanted to be strong enough to protect those he cares for and defeat any foe who stood in his way. That lethal attacks that would normally defeat someone normal would work on someone so fundamentally changed by Nanikas wish was their oversight. But then who could expect a human to surpass even a lifeform like the Chimera Ant King Mereum?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon's now 8'6 (256 cm) height rose higher as he dreamed<i> \"More! more! I won't let them hurt Killua! I'll never let them hurt Killua again!\" </i> His intense rage added cm every five minutes. Having felt the loss of Kite and neglecting Killua's own concern for himself, Gon never wanted his friend to feel that way again. Soon his body purified the toxins and his breathing calmed as scars made from his wounds soon vanished just like the injuries..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes would pass before Leorio entered with his intensivs care suit on. \"All right let us check up on  you Gon\". Taking the blanket and bandages off, Leorio moved back in surprise. \"You've got to be shitting me! Gon's body is fully healed!\" He checked over his body and the momitor for his vitals. \"He's not just healthy! The poison is gone! Even the wounds!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving consistently been surprised over the past few days, Leorio accepted that eveb his insides were healed without needing to check. \"Whatever sort of miracle you and Killua have undergone has broken all forms of logic.\" Leorio smiled as he ruffled sleeping Gon's spiky green black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leorio we're coming in\" The voice of Kurapika called as he entered with Alluka. She quickly walked over to Gon's bed tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Gon they hurt you and big brother cause of me!\" Big teardrops fell as Alluka continued to cry., knowing going back home wouldn't mean her big brothers freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurapika's eyes glowed red in anger as he saw what happend to Gon. \"I can't believe the Zoldyks did this.\" Yet unable to do anything due to his nens requirements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon simply slept, having gained another 13cm (5\u201d) to stand at 8'10 (261 cm) as his legs dangled further off the bed. Unknowing of those around him showing concern.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Must get bigger. Must protect Killua!\" </i>Gon's primal desire in his slumber continuing as he inched ever higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======At the Zoldyk Dungeon=====<br>\r\nKillua continued to pull the chains off the wall using all of his strength, his muscles and veins bulging with life as they try to free themselves of the wall. He had realized his own injuries had healed, and could feel the chains digging into his skin ever slowly with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears fell from his face, but they were tears of joy as the white haired boy realized what it meant. \"Gon's alive! If I can escape I can help him\" Checking his body, Killua realized he easily surpassed his father in muscle, and his strength was growing faster with every inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see how strong I get as I try to break these dumb chains. Though maybe it's best to pretend they can still hold me when they start tearing off the wall?\" Flexing his body Killua started practicing to tear the chains off for his growth as he plotted to kick his families butt. Ready to go back Gon and Alluka and Nanika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we ever get big enough I want to squish Illumi under my smallest toe.\" A sinister smile crossing his face thinking about it.</span></div></div>",

While Gon stretched from his run, Killua took the chance to let his eyes run over his muscled form, how his pecs stretched his shirt, and he could see a thin outline of his abs through, not to mention the two beefcakes of arms that were attached to that sheer perfection. Killua had to admit he felt his pants get tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't all, since that was only his upper body. His shorts practically looked painted on too, his ass a sculpted marvel of perfection, while his each leg muscle was perfectly proportioned. The fact is that his front was bulging out, so much so that Killua could see the strain on his zipper and button was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Gon?\"<br>\r\n\"What is it Kil?<br>\r\n\"Uh, have you looked at your clothes lately?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they fit just fi- Ah!~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation was interrupted as Gon gasped, feeling a soreness overtake him, just as he pulsed slightly larger, enough so that his shirt split slightly down the middle, while with a *ping!* his button flew off his pants, exposing the lip of his boxers, and just a tinge of pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-*yawn*\" Gon put his hand to his mouth, seemingly unaware of what just happened. \"man, I'm tired, I'm gonna have to go take a nap...\" He yawned as he walked off, Killua spotting his boxers were showing through a rip in the back of his pants too, leaving his blushing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't, but I have to see this!\" He muttered, even as he grabbed his tent, moaning at the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Gon's room====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon was sleeping, entirely out cold, snoring heavily even as he was unaware of his growth spurt. He was out deep enough that Killua could have barged through his door and not heard anything, while he silently picked the lock and walked in, eyes almost snake like in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked in, eyes on the vast bulge of Gon's, illuminated even in the dark from the moonlight, while Gon snored. Eyes sparking in the darkness, he slowly closed in, gently grabbing his zipper, and pulled it down as stealthily as he could. After that, he grabbed the lip of his boxers, and breathing steadily, pulled it down, and got whacked right in the face with the pole that flopped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon moaned as he unconsciously gripped it, the air arousing him as it lengthened to his full 34.3 cm (13.5 in) length. Killua went wide-eyes, slightly drooling as he undid his own pants, letting his 15.25 cm (6 inch) cock out as he stroked it, gently removing Gon's hand from his as he nuzzled it with his cheek, his saliva slowly lubricating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne eye on Gon, he gently licked his head, moaning at the sweet taste as he assaulted it with his tongue, taking more and more in till he got his whole mouth over it, all the while stroking his own while Gon moaned, unaware yet aware of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKil could feel Gon getting closer and closer, heck, he couldn't last too much longer himself, while his other hand rubbed Gon's massive balls, and just when he felt them tighten, he was about to pull up. At the same moment, several things happened, another spurt kicked in, as Gon grabbed Kil's head with both hands and thrusted him down. So Kil went wide-eyed, deepthroating Gon just as he hit a new growth spurt, and before he knew it his throat was bulging just as it surged to 38 cm, then 46 cm (15, 18 in). And with a shout, Gon blew his load, and fell back asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKil exited the room, stomach slightly bulging from the amount of seed he took in, even as the sweet and salty taste leaked from the side of his mouth. \"Ugh... that was awesome...\" He muttered, even as his stomach gurgled violently. \"Ugh, what's going on...\" He said, as he gripped his stomach, He felt a heat setting in from his stomach and moving in to his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the mirror, he watched wide-eyed as he went back to full hardness, and he came, hard. But this was different, it wasn't stopping as he grabbed it with both hands, each spurt splatting against the wall more and more, and he could use both hands because it was getting bigger, and bigger! Before he knew it, he had 20 cm, then 28, then 40 cm! (8, 11, 16 in). 16 inches of throbbing veiny cock! It looked absolutely monstrous on his small frame. But why didn't he grow everywhere else? He had other things to worry about, like cleaning this mess, and how was he gonna explain this... He heard steps coming down the hall, and cursed, he's gotta run! And so he did.</span></div></div>",

The A-Rank Heroes Stinger, Great Philosopher, and Blue Fire were facing off against a nearly naked man shaped figure. The twelve foot behemoths body bulging with muscle and mass, his form resembling a normal man save for the massive Blender he has for a head and his genitalia replaced with a power cord attaching the two. A mouth lying just beneath the Blender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish heroes! I'm the unstoppable Protein Blenderer! All shall be blended into protein to fuel my growth!\" the cocky Mysterious Being spoke. \"This body was forged from a mere human to a god by consuming too many protein shakes! Now anything I blend becomes protein that makes me grow! Only a S-Class has a chance to stand against me!\" he cockily flexed his biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do? Teamwork or brute force him?\" The dark haired Blue Fire asked the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we brute force him. I need to get back at these mere Tiger level threats after Sea King bested me\" Stinger cockily said as he readied his spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat Philosopher remained silent as he prepared his book, looking through his pages. \"Brute force it is then\" Blue Fire said as the three separated and charged forth from different directions. The buff but elderly Great Philosopher charged forth first as he prepared his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3-Ton Philosophy!\" Great Philosopher yelled as he brought down his book upon Blenderers head, only for nothing to happen except a clear cackle from Protein. \"As if that could stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shi-!\" Great Philosopher yelled as Protein Blenderer grabbed him by his arm and tossed in Blue Fires direction as the dark haired man began to open his sleeves to release his flamethrower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Blue Fire called as he stopped the flames and tried to defend as Great Philosopher flew towards him, the huge man crashing into Blue Fire and sending them into a nearby building. A large hole with small parts of the ruined half of the building falling over time on the two unconscious heroes, laying in rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon I'll make you both into protein to make me even more powerful!\" Protein Blenderer sinisterly grinned. Taking his sights off Stinger who had prepared his attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let your guard down! Gigantic Drill Stinger!\" he yelled as he thrusted the massive speartip foward to prepare its spin, only for Blenderer to nonchalantly grab it on both sides with his hands. He lifted the spear and Stinger with ease. In an instant he repeatedly slammed both down into the ground numerous times, each impact cracking and destroying the concrete below as a large crater continued to grow in size from the impact and cracks spread forth across the cement with each impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Stinger was knocked out from his assault Blenderer let go, dropping him and the spear with a heavy thud. \"Nothing stands against my might!\" Doing a most muscular pose, finishing as he once again lifted Stinger to his head, his Blender Head opening up as he smirked. \"I'll make you all into delicious protein so don't worry. Help me reach my potential!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly two hands grabbed the side of the Blender. \"Cool. I bought some fruits and ice cream on sale and this could make a good milkshake\" the voice said as he effortlessly pulled the head and power cord off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-wait what are you do-?\" Protein Blenderers last words left unfinished as the Blender was quickly put into his killers grocery bag. A few seconds passed before a torrent of blood erupted forth from his head and splattered the area around him. Blenderers body falling down with his butt hanging in the air, releasing the red stained and knocked out Stinger before landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious figured reacted with disgust. \"Ew. I got his blood all over me. Looks like this will have to be washed\" he grabbed his formerly white cape to see it red, rubbing his bald head as well \"And I'll need a bath. But at least he didn't drench any of you\" he held out his grocery bag, its contents., and the newly acquired Blender shiny and free of blood. \"Well since it'll take a but of time I better call Genos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out his cell phone, the Caped Baldy turned it on as he waited for his student to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenos quickly answered \"Do you need my help master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah Genos. Turns out the Blenders were on sale last weak. Though I did manage to get a free one a few minutes ago. Though I'll need you to prepare a bath if that's alright. Had to deal with a monster a minute ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away Master Saitama!\" Genos exlaimed as he hung up. Closing his cell phone, the hero Saitama walked home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait to try the shakes Genos is so proud of\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Military Brigade, in hopes of finding a means to weaponize the Titans that threaten them outside, in the walls, and the greater threat that known as Marley which seeks to take over the island and purge them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this end they had left Hang in charge of overseeing any items relating to Titan-shifting and their capabilities, which she had engrossed herself in for the following three weeks. She had even come across remnants of info revealing how the Ackermans were humans designed with the capabilities of Titans. This info, combined with the serums she had and a few leftover items from Reiss reign had given her the inspiration to create more humans with Titan based capabilities. Thus she had come to Eren, asking for samples of his DNA to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd so appreciate it if I could only use your blood, saliva, spinal fluid, and *ahem* a certain other fluid in my research.\" Hange had asked Eren the first few days after the research. Her face flushed in clear excitement. Eren looked nonpulsed as he gave a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Just make sure I'm sedated because I'm not sure how I'd react to you, uh, collecting certain samples.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Hange replied enthusiastically, only stopping to say something she'd forgotten \"Oh and don't tell Mikasa anything. She'd probably kill me!\" then return to running off to inform the Military . Though she had kept it a secret from Levi due to knowing he might be frustrated she'd try something like this without informing him first. So the next few days Eren had been strapped down and sedated as Hange had her men collect as many samples as she could over the next few days, having told Armin to keep Mikasa as busy as possible as they did so. Drugged still but just cognitive enough to know what was going on in his surroundings, Eren noticed that he had been return to his room with a basket next to him filled with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA note on it that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Thanks for all the research material Eren! I'll make sure not a drop of it was in vain! Here's your reward to have yourself or share with the others. Toodles!</div><br>\r\n <br>\r\nHange then spent the next few days now focused solely on completing her Human-Titan weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new few weeks she had kept to herself in her lab, with the Military haven been requested by her to keep Levi out so he wouldn't interfere with her research project. With enough time she eventually combine several of the serums with a mixture of fluids from Eren. Though in case of Marley or unwanted enemies trying to steal the research she had made sure to keep all knowledge of fluids and their usage as hidden as possible, not even trusting the new Military controlled government with the secret just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the fifteenth day she had finally completed her research.A small vial containing a pale red liquid. \"At last, the tool we had been waiting to even the playing field with the enemy!\" Enthused with herself, she had been thinking of who to best test it on. \"Ah Eren of course! He is the one who helped make this possible afterall.\" With that she headed to leave, only to encounter...</span></div></div>",

I've been asking some questions, and nobody seems to know nothing about your experiments with Eren. Not even Levi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words erased Hange's smile from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit... so he knows I'm doing experiments behind his back...\"<br>\r\n\"When we went to see him we already knew you were up to something, so we were discreet.\" Armin clarified. \"We only asked him if you were working on a project, and he said you weren't. We tell him nothing about your taking samples of Eren because we know how we would react.\"<br>\r\n\"Look, Hange, you're a good guy and I know whatever you're doing is to help us and our nation... but I deserve to know what are you going to do with my fluids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHange took a deep breath, calmer. The last thing he wanted was confronting the strict captain Levi and fortunately she had dodged that bullet (for now). He looked at the intimidated Connie, who hadn't yet said anything and seemed a little lost in that conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why did you come here?\"<br>\r\n\"My squad sent me for the flu shots we asked you for last week... but if you're busy, I could come later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the short soldier with suspicion. They didn't know each other much, bet she knew Connie was a gossip guy and he would tell his teammates all that conversation. Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, I'll tell you everything. All you three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...if she made Connie part of her clandestine experiment, he would keep his mouth shut to avoid be punished like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four soldiers walked into the rustic lab. The scientist soldier leaded to a room with a big written blackboard and several notes and graphics holding on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The goal of my current is simple: To fix the titans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren's eyes got wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean with FIX? To make them human again?\" He never dreamed the thousands of titans outside the walls could become human <br>\r\n\"Not exactly... Although it could be used as one!\" The androgynous woman said with a smile \"It's not a cure, but an improvement of the titan formula!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHange pointed to her illegible notes on the blackboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does the pure titans lose their minds after transforming and the special titans can retain their ones for a time?\" Silence, but it's not like Hange expected an answer from them \"It's a gene! The gene that regulates the transformation from human to titan is defective on the pure titans, so the metamorphosis is too powerful, digesting their nervious systems and minds like it was food! The special titans' allele works better, but the assimilation of his brain still happens, although more slowly. That's why Eren lose his minds if he stays as a titan for too long. I fixed that gene so no titan would grow crazy or hungry! Well, actually I did more than that, I powered the transcription of several human genes on the titan form, made improvements here and there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept talking despite no one understanding her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... If I drink this, I'll have full control of my titan?\" Eren asked.<br>\r\n\"That and more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave them vials of the formula. Eren felt tempted to injest it. Armin, not that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it safe?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure! ...well, it's untested,  so you would be my first test subjects... science always has some risks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren returned the vial politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should make sure it's safe before we drank it...\"<br>\r\n\"I can't! The titan formula doesn't work on animals, so the only way I have to test its effectiveness and safety is with people.... Armin and Eren, you have your titan healing factor, it should be able to fix any damage the drug might cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens were still uncertain. Hange used her last resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eren, this formula will fix the defective gene that will kill you in a few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis life expectancy was something Eren never wanted to think about. It made him feel powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have an alternative...\" She offered him her serum a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I got to lose?\" He thought before put the vial on his mouth. The scientist stopped him.<br>\r\n\"Let's go outside before you drink it.\"</span></div></div>",

Armin still thought that was a bad idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you feel nauseas? Pain? Inner bleedings?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I feel fine... maybe a little more energetic than before, that's all.\"<br>\r\n\"Good. No news is good news.\" Hange took more notes \"Let's try transforming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and bit his fingers. But he didn't feel anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I think it didn't work... guys?\" When he opened his eyes, there was nobody around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him some time to notice the soft voices below... and went he look down, he saw his friends had turned into gnomes. He kneeled down to see and hear them better. Connie, Armin seemed shocked and, for some reason, were blusing a little, whereas Hange couldn't be more excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a titan, but I feel like myself, unlike previous transformations... wait, I can talk!\" He finally noticed. He touched his face and realized he hadn't have his titanic dented mouth, instead he had his usual, capable-of-speaking, mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The experiment made your titan form more human...! more like you!\" Hange yelled as strong as she could.<br>\r\n\"I don't remember Eren BEING like that!!\" The angry voice was Armin's.<br>\r\n\"You meant my muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, although Eren kept his face, his build was the same as the attacking titan's... maybe buffer than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren said as he palpated his prominent pectorals, bigger than even, and flexed his biceps, around 4.5 meters (13.7') of diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He meant another thing.\" Hange said grinding, pointing to his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge piece of meat was hanging from there. Completely soft, and yet was long enough to go down 3/4 of his upper leg. Humongous from Eren's perspective, but for the little humans had seen houses shorter than the penis, as it was 2 times their heights. And better not to talk about its width...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant teenager went red and immediately tried to cover it with both his hands, although it wasn't easy. Since it was too long to simply cover it he had to held the tip and coil his cock like it was a garden hose to be able to hide it under his palms... but while he was doing it, his penis reacted skin contact, its sensitivity had grown as much as its dimensions, resulting in an slowly but unstoppable erection, pushing aside Eren's hands as it rose higher and higher.<br>\r\nIt stopped at his chest level, as big as life itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren wanted to die. He turned his back on his friends so they didn't see it, but worried about someone coming from the other direction he squatted and hugged with his huge arms his long, fat rod, so he could hide most of it by using all his huge body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in that posture, the head of his cock was dangerously close of his face... he felt the compulsion of licking it, but kept it at bay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHange, brimming over with joy and excitement, was taking notes with one hand and cleaning her nosebleed with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seem he's so focus and ashamed by his erection he didn't realize we can see his ball from here.\" A random comment before she went back to her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's clearly having a bad time, why don't you do something to help him?\" Armin protested.<br>\r\n\"It's just embarrassed by this silly thing, he'll survive?\" The woman downplayed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe short blond look back to his other companion, expecting he would back him up, but Connie was completely shocked by the events and didn't react. Although, by the small bulge on his trousers, the sight didn't displease him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmin sighed, and then ran to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eren, don't worry, we're all men here... well, except Hange (I think), but surely she already saw many penis before.\"<br>\r\n\"IamAnIdiotIamAnIdiotIamAnIdiot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmin couldn't made him heard. His voice was too weak and was covered by Eren's murmurs. After a few minutes of futile efforts, Armin came back and asked her for SOMETHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Eren, he was still caught in his anxiety when he felt the earth shook.<br>\r\nHe snaped out of it and turned back, fearing the earthquake could have harmed his friends. Never expected to see a pair of legs towering over him. He was roughly as tall as the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little higher rested a monstrous cock, still asleep, but it could be as long as half of the attacking titan's height... probably longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst the light, the huge titan had to crouch so Eren could see his face clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Armin!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal giant smiled at the shocked smaller titan. Even after kneeling he was taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were freaking out and wouldn't listen to me at my regular size... but I couldn't speak as the colossal titan, so I decided to test the formula. Do I look good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up again with the hands on his hips. Fortunately for him, he didn't look like the Colossal Titan at all. He had all his skin and human proportions like Eren, although he was leaner than him, he had a decent layer of muscle and a handsome, tall frame, similar to a fit basketball player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid I say 'proportional'? Well, that doesn't include his flaccid penis, of course, which hanged near his knee, proportions only dreamed by porn stars.<br>\r\nAlthough Eren could match its proportions, regarding the absolute measures not even his hard cock could compare to that flaccid monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... beautiful...\" Eren thoughts escaped through his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren blushed immediately, embarrassed again. Armin did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren cock's, painfully hard after witnessing Armin's ascension to godhood, ejected some precum, splashing a little on his face. The boy once again tried to hide his hardon, despite not being the only one nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, two huge legs surrounded him. Armin had sat behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one will be able to see your birdie if I hide you between my legs and in my shade.\" Armin's words successfully calmed him down. Although he still felt some embarrassment, he also felt safer in his embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe relaxed enough to let himself lay on a comfortable, warm mattress conveniently behind him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, a mattress...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the 'mattress' started to swell in all directions, hardening, trapping him literally 'between a rock and a hard place' (abs and a giant cock)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Armin was the one embarrassed, and Hange couldn't be happier. She hoped this spectacle would never end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his uncomfortable spot crushed by the titanic dick, Eren felt the same impulse he had when he almost gave himself an autofellatio... and this time he couldn't help himself. He hugged that colossal semi-hard cock, rubbing his own penis and body against it as he held tightly the glans, licking it nonstop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt grew more, elevating the smaller titan, hanging in the air as he tried to do oral to a cock almost as long and thick as his body, and continued, until it exploded with enough cum to form a small pond (Eren contributed with a smaller although still considerable amount of white).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExausted, the two boys laid on the ground and started shrinking to their original forms... although they ended up slightly bigger than before, 180cm and 170cm (6' and 5'7\"). After being 60m and 16m that increase was too small to be noticed by anyone... for now, because their base sizes will probably grow more in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if this lust is a consequence of too long transformations.\" Hange wondered. \"Before, Eren would go crazy after spending too much time as a titan. Maybe instead of fixed it, I accidentally replaced it with a growing lust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the pair, bringing them new clothes (the new transformation ripped them). When she saw them hugging tenderly on the pool of cum, smiling half-conscious, it erased her worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they have won with the trade.\" The scientist affirmed \"Make love, not war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed to Connie, still shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, isn't it? And you could be a titanic superhero like them, experimenting the same, with this small vial.\" She threw him the drug. \"I only ask you not to tell anyone about this, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and walked to his base with the serum in his pocked, still unsure if he was going to drink it or not.</span></div></div>",

Having returned to their small group despite his insistence he was done, Kei was contemplating stopping how they can stop the skilled and lucky Chinese-Americans continued attempt to instigate conflict in Japan to amuse himself. <i>If Sato succeeds at killing the Prime Minister there goes my chances of a happy and ordinary life.</i> He contemplated ways to stop him, while thinking of ways to ditch the country like his mother suggested since she'll prioritize his sister over him. <i>I am immortal afterall. Not that dying doesn't hurt like hell.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi walked over to Kei during his contemplation. \"Kei. Dr. Ogura wishes to talk to you and Kou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Kei grunted as it distracted him from scenarios to ensure he gets through this in the worst case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. Just that he wants you two.\" She shrugged as she left to return to Tosaki's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wonder what he wants.</i> Kei thought as he went to Ikuya Ogura's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he saw the dumb and overly energetic Kou talking to Ogura. Likely about nothing important knowing Kou. Ikuya Ogura was smoking one of his belove Mevius cigarettes as he talked with Kou. \"Glad you're here Kei. Kou, I'll let you know more about releasing ones Black Ghost another time.\" the older nan inhaled a brief tale of his cigarette before exhaling the smoke and continuing, leaving the black and red-browwn haired boys frustrated by the smokes smell. \"So I heard you two flooded the building with IBMs during Sato and his Ajin flunkies assault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Kei said we should do that to take away their sight, but it completely fell apart thanks to that Sato fella!\" Kou Nakano said with enthusiasm. Sato had infiltrated the building as food after intentionally shredding his body apart, bypassing and destroying the vents they used to transport IBM to the rest of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was annoying how he foiled my idea.\" Frustration covering Kei's face as he thought of how they fought so hard yet had to run away at the end despite him and Kou being Ajin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the good news is that I know a way to help you two\" Ogura once again inhaled as he brought his cigarette to his lips, exhaling a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Kou asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In America we tested numerous experiments with the Ajin. It helped one of us was an Ajin himself, though he stood firmly against my theories.\" He took another whiff of his cigarette before continuing \"I had one Ajin that was there test IBM Flooding for us at the time. It wasn't noticeable at first, but several weeks later we saw he had gained an increase in muscle mass and an increase in height. We tested his body and found it was more durable and his body had improved reflex control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way!? So we can get really strong and beat Sato!?\" Kou enthusiastically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds too good to be true.\" Kei responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it wasn't. The changes hadn't been much for the time he spent on it,, but he was a lot stronger. The officials overseeing it worried he might get ideas and ended the project there. They later had him moved to another facility.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want us to release IBMs nonstop and see if we could get the same benefits?\" Kei sighed as finished asking, knowing that Ogura was nodding as he finished his last cigarette. <i>Kou will get bored so easily over the next few weeks he'll drive me mad.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kou grabbed Kei's arm and dragged him out of the room. \"Let's get started Kei!\" Kei with a pissed but resigned look on his face as they left to concetrate on making IBMs.</span></div></div>",

His face turned beet red as he struggled to lift the rubble too big for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu moved to put down the rubble he carried over to the pile as Gray moved to help Romeo. Picking it up in Romeos place as the boy thanked him and Natsu replied \"Yeah but it should be obvious that I'm human afterall. If I was fit to be a dragonKing you'd think I'd be one already\" Natsu gave a smile as he went over and grabbed a large, broken couch with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but if you did you could boss the other Dragonslayers around. including Laxus\" Gray responded, his shirt now gone leaving him shirtless. his toned abs glistening with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu dropped the couch and placed his hands on his head in frustration towards himself \"I didn't think of that! I could have even Erza obey me and be my personal servant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu...\" Romeo embarrassed from how his idol and hero of Fiore acting in such a way, grabbing a small couple of broken bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness for that. You'd run the kingdom into the ground.\" Gray carried over the large rubble and dropped it in the pile with the rest of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" A pissed Natsu responded as he stopped moping, mad at Grays insult. \"You're saying I'd do a shitty job as King?\" Cracking sounds emanated from his fists as he prepaared to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray walked over and shoved his face into Natsu, an aura of animosity surrounded the two as he spoke \"Of course. Any kingdom ruled by you would fall apart in a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make you eat those words Gray!\" Natsu yelled as he prepared a flaming punch as Gray fully undressed and readied his Ice Make magic.A fist fight begun as they started to damage the area around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder when Laxus, Gajeel, and Sting will arrive. They said they'd come help. Laxus can break the fight up easily.</i> Romeo thought as he continued to work as best as he can, ignoring the two as they had their usual spat. Though barely dodging a spike of ice and a fireball released at different points by both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to them, a marking of a dragon bearing a crown upon his head. Though he rejected the title of King as a dragon, the power of Acnologia was fusing into Natsus very being make him worthy of it as a human. Natsu felt energy fush into him as he rams his head into Grays, knocking him back. Power flooding into that felt fueled by his primal emotions.</span></div></div>",

He grinned as he lit hands aflame, charging forward as Gray himself braced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray could feel the heat from Natsu, and he had to admit, even these flames were more intense than he could remember. He brandished his Devil Slayer Magic, even as the black tattoos spread over his face. He ignored the fact that they literally just had a fight to the death earlier, but hey, at least they weren't fighting to the bitter end this time, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked his wrist, instantly freezing the surrounding area. Natsu saw this, and flared his own flames, instantly mellting his half of the area. Gary was surprised at just how quickly Natsu's flames were melting his ice. He had to respond swiftly, especially since Natsu was unfreezing the area faster than he could freeze. \"Ice Devil's Wall!\" He yelled, slapping his hands down on the ground, putting a substantial amount of his magic into making a thick wall between them, even as he jumped back to make some distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu growled at the wall between them, even as he placed a good amount of his magic into his fist. He didn't notice that his hand was almost completely healed. He slammed it into the wall, causing flames to burst forth, nearly engulfing the area. He grunted, planting down as he tried to break through, the tattoo he  was still unaware of glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscles tensed, slowly pulsing larger and larger, his defined biceps already starting to expand, veins starting to extend already over it. His own pecs pushed out more, starting to strain his vest, even as his own six pack tensed even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath, his own legs were expanding, the added strength allowing him to dig into the ground more. His own boxers were getting tighter as well, his ass beginning to fill out more as well, while, while the front was starting to burst at the seams due to other expanding reasons. If it wasn't for his pants being so baggy, people would see quite a bulge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, but surely, the wall cracked, and exploded. Gray crossed his arms, guarding himself from the debris. But he was completely unprepared as Natsu rushed forward. He tried to form his Devil's Ice Bow, but Natsu was faster than he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu slammed into Gray, knocking the air out of him. Gray grunted, trying to form his sword, but Natsu grabbed his hand, and uppercutted him, sending Gray flying. Gray crashed down, barely conscious, even as Natsu marched forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu's eyes were clouded over, for some reason, he had an urge... a violent urge... he was king, but he felt it necessary to spread some authority... Grabbing Gray by his shoulders, who was still disoriented, he brandished his teeth, and leaned forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CHOMP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh! You asshole!\" Gray shouted, as Natsu dug into his neck. The pain was excruciating, but weirdly only for a second. Before long, he felt new energy crossing into him, but he was too confused to register it. He gripped the wound, but oddly, it'd already stopped bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, sorry...\" Natsu grinned, a bit unnerving of a sight, due to the blood coating his face. He was a little lightheaded, and slowly wobbled off, both of them confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu was adjusting his scarf, it being slightly tighter than he remembered having. As a matter of fact, everything seemed tighter. His vest, his pants, even his shoes.... What was going on...</span></div></div>",

Natsu would never stop <br>\r\na fight without outside interference from Erza or an enemy. It was bizarre to say the least. \"Just what came over Natsu?\" Gray turned to the spot where Romeo was working, seeing that the youth had chosen to ignore their outburst as he struggles to grab a large piece of rubble, easily Romeos size in length and girth. Beads of sweat trickling down his face as he tried to do more than he can chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his neck with his left hand where Natsu had bit him, Gray spoke to Romeo as he walked over \"I'll help you with that.\" Standing behind Romeo as he moved both arms to its side, the Ice mage gripped its side to lift it with little struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Gray!\" The boy fell to the ground as he let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really shouldn't try something you can't do yet\" Gray told him as he brought the large rubble to the designated pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu would lift something twice his size!\" The black haired boy earnestly replied, hoping to catch up to his idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu is an idiot.\" Gray replied, noticing some odd numbness start to be felt around the bite on his neck and spreading from it. Yet he ignored it as he viewed helping Magnolia clean up to a bigger deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the insult Romeo looked around to see why Natsu didn't start arguing with Gray. He saw only the two of them. \"Where's Natsu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving towards a large piece of broken furniture, Gray felt like his entire body was becoming tense and fuller, not noticing how his muscles slowly gained more mass and definition, ripped six pack slowly making way for eight, legs thickening, neck stregthening, back widening. Small enough spurts that he could ignore them. \"Walked off in a daze somewhere after biting me.\" He picked up the ruined furniture, grasping it with one arm by gripping a part sticking out, lifting it with ease. <i>Lighter than expected.</i> His lack of clothes leaving him without feeling restricted by his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu bit you?!\" Romeo asked in surprise as he stopped just short of grasping a broken brick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He was acting weird as he walked off with my blood on his face\" Feeling confidant as the numb feeling grew, Gray tossed the heavy furniture rubble towards the pile. It landed with a heavy crash, which made him smirk as he flexed the arm that threw it. <i>I feel great for some reason</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo on the other hand worried about his idol. \"I'm going after Natsu. He sounds like he might be sick.\" He told the Ice Make mage as he prepared to leave. \"Do you know the way he went Gray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Towards his house I think.\" Gray pointed in the direction, getting a thanks from the fire mage as he ran in that direction. \"Watch your guard in case he bites!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Romeo yelled back before he got too far, waving to his guildmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numb feeling continued to fill Grays being. A symbol of a dragon wearing a crown appeared on his neck, slowly giving a desire to dominate anyone who doesn't bear the right to rule like himself and Natsu. The numbness slowly spreading beyond his body creating a permanent aura of cold that felt natural.</span></div></div>",

Just what was going on with that dragonslayer... he was definitely acting unusual. It was very unnerving to see him look so confused, and have his mouth be soaked with his own blood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was unaware of everything that was going on, even less so of the aura that was starting to coat him, ice starting to form everywhere his feet were in contact, mirroring the fiery aura that was slowly engulfing Natsu. Walking down, he came across a mirror, and smirked at how well this war apparently treated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe admired his own appearance, and he'd always been built a bit, but now... he seemed to have gotten a little bit taller. He ran his hand down his chest, feeling how his 6 pack had gotten an upgrade to an 8 pack, while his other hand felt the fuller sphere of his left pec. Moving it back up, he placed it on his bicep, and flexed, admiring the veins that popped up on it, ignoring the ice spreading across the ground near his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gray!\" Came a voice from across the field, as he turned around to face his fellow pupil. Lyon walked over, racing over to see how his old friend had fared, although he had stripped off his own shirt, running over in just his pants and shoes. \"Gr- wow, what happened to you?\" He asked, blinking in surprise at how much Gray had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess I've just been growing a bit. Never noticed over all the chaos.\" Gray grinned, continuing to admire his flexing. Lyon looked around him, looking at his changes till he saw the tattoo on the back of Gray's neck in the shape of a dragon. Gray started to get annoyed that this peasant kept looking at him. Wait, peasant? Where'd that thought come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyon reached out to touch it, somewhat confused that Gray would adopt such a strange tattoo given his rivalry with Natsu. \"What's this Gray?\" He asked. Just as he did though, it glowed red, and Gray seemed to react, smacking Lyon's hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me!\" He shouted, then both of them stared at each other, and blinked in confusion. \"Whoa... where did that come fro-ungh!\" Gray grunted, as the tattoo continued to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lyon's shocked eyes, he watched as Gray shot up in height, leaving Lyon looking at just the tip of his pecs. His muscles slowly pulsed as well, almost happy to unrestricted by barely any clothing. His expanding thighs ripped the legs of his boxers, looking almost painted on his frame as they were dragged down as his ass firmed as well. The front bulged forward as well, not leaving anything to the imagination as the monster within strained the cloth, bits and pieces showing through the stretched cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyon shivered as well, the air having noticeably cooled down. He wasn't sure what it was, but it was as if he was looking at someone superior to him... \"Gray, are you alright?\" He asked, somewhat mistakenly laying his hand on Gray's bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never better!\" He grinned, even as another pulse set him larger, forcing Lyon's hand apart more. The only person he felt could rival him was Natsu, and even then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Natsu was walking down, unaware of the power building within, just as Romeo headed down to talk to him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The chill in the air began to intensify, working its magic even on an Ice Mage used to the cold like Lyon. Removing his hand from Grays bulge, Lyon shivered as he brought his hands to each of his shirtless sides. \"W-w-w-what's g-g-going on!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with you Lyon? Unable to handle a little cold?\" Gray cockily stated as he stared down on the peasa-\"friend\" of his. His body felt perfectly fine even as the mystical cooling of the environment grew, the ground freezing beneath his feet. To him this wasn't anything peculiar. He felt it was natural for one meant to be King. <i>Wait why do I think I'm a King?</i> Gray didn't know why he has started viewing others as peasants or identifying as a ruler, yet with every passing second it seemed...natural. Granted as he gazed upon his sculpted, greek statue physique Gray knew he had a body worthy of a King. A smirk crossed his face as he brought a hand to rub his mighty bulge. Something even statues would weep in jealously of. Even the useless King and his daughter of Fiore would instantly submit to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-it's not a l-l-little cold at a-a-alll!\"  Lyon proclaimed as the chill afflicting him suddenly stopped. Before he could let out a sigh of relief it was replaced with a new feeling of numbness. He'd take that any day over an unbearable cold not even Urs training could help with tolerating. <i>At least I'm not freezing anymore.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tattoo on Grays neck began to work once again as the glow became incandescent, this time on transforming peasant Lyon into the first servant of Grays Subzero Kingdom. Neither of them had known at the moment Lyon surprised Gray and was slapped away, as well as shivering under Grays Eternal Winter Aura of Authority that Lyon had unintentional cowed before his better. With that he was doomed to serve Gray for the rest of his life as the change begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyons skin began to lighten in tone until it become an unnatural pale blue. The Ice Mage immediately noticed and began to panic. \"What is happening to me!\" He looked at Gray with fear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. Though it does suit one meant to serve me.\" Gray responded, leaving Lyon both fearful and and confused as the mage seemed to be growing even more. Lyons head was now as high as the lower half of Grays eight pack. His bulge was dangerously on the verge of tearing. <i>Best deal with that before it falls apart. My subjects are only allowed to see my blessed cock when I want them to see it.</i> Gray brought a hand down to touch his bulge to alter it, the light of the tattoo now transfiguring his boxers to grow and shrink with him, icicle design patterns appearing on the black material. <i>Now back to my little peasant Lyon</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore changes happened to Lyon. His hair gained a stripe of black within the silver as sclera turned an inhuman glowing bright white. This was all the physical changes appearancewise his body had undergone, underneath the surface his body is a different matter. His insides were remade by the cold to be extremely durable and tough, shattering into ice instead of guts upon death, and being able to reform freely from the Winter Aura of his new lord Gray. \"I-why am I like this Gray?\" The Ice Mage asked earnestly in confusion \"And why does it feel not only right to be in this state, but also natural to serve you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray didn't really know the answer to either of those questions. \"No idea. Just accept that you are the first Human Ice Elemental to worship your old frien...God King.\" The human/ Elemental hybrid was the first of his kind. Slowly he gained a cold aura that was an extension of Gray's, to further extend his reign to those not within his reach. Gray sat down, spreading out his muscular legs around his first servat. Raising his right arm, Gray flexed the bicep. A mighty peak rose as the bicep expanded to 28 inches and growng. Veins Trail across the mighty muscles pumping it with his Royal Blood. Lyon was enthralled by the sight \"Now don't worry about anything else but worshipping me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous, he nodded as he got close and began to reach out and touch the might bicep, a visible tent in his boxers as he oogled his friend Gray, no his <b><i>Lord</i></b> Grays body. \"Yes ny lord\" He began to touch and softly caress his new masters arm, pleasing him as cold gentle skin graced his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this I want you to go to Lamia Scale and gather me more followers. In exchange I will turn you your skin back to normal.\" Gray commanded, getting \"Yes ny lord\" in response. That turned Gray on, and he couldn't wait to have more worshipping him. Though he tried to keep his cock under control. He still had decency after all. His thoughts turned to Natsu, the one he believed started all of this now that these weird events were happening, wondering if he was experiencing the same thing. His rival, his equal, and the only one he felt Worthy of both sharing this world with and fighting over it. Touching the former bite mark-now tattoo- on his neck, Gray wouldn't mind a battle that ends with the two in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrays cold aura was slowly expanding all the while, freezing, then shattering, rubble into ice before reforming any ruined home back to the way it was before...</span></div></div>",

Imagine his feelings when he'd heard that Natsu had just saved literally the entire world from extinction. When Gray told him what happened... covered in blood, he really needed to see this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray had pointed him in roughly where to go, which looked like Natsu was heading off back towards his house. Panting somewhat, he ran over, trying to see if he could find him. Once he ran out of breath though, he braced himself next to a piece of giant rubble, gasping for air until he could fill his aching lungs. Once he could, he took a deep breath, and shouted \"Natsu!\" Although he was startled when there was another respective \"Natsu-san!\" Right next to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?!\" both voices shouted, and Romeo took a look over the other side of the rubble, surprised to see Sting! \"What are you doing here!\" Romeo asked, pointing in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for Natsu-san!\" Sting countered. He'd really looked up to Natsu, ever since he was a kid. He was so awe-struck when he used all of their dragon slayer powers to strike Acnologia down, and he never got a chance to thank him for it, since he saved his own life. Just the sheer power he commanded, Sting almost felt his pants get tighter from the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm looking for Natsu!\" Romeo yelled back, sparks flying between their eyes, as they both locked gazes and started running down the street, barely even paying attention to where they were going. \"I'm gonna find him first!\" \"No I am!\" \"Out of my way shortstop!\" \"Out of MY way blondie!\" \"Hey! That's a low bl-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...\" They both muttered at the same time, eyes swirling as they recovered from impacting a wall. Both thoughts were interrupted as they heard a sudden \"AHH!\" They knew where that sound was coming from, and shouted as the exact same time. \"Natsu's House!\" As they booked it to their idol's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Natsu's House, a few minutes earlier====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu had stumbled into his house, still somewhat disoriented at his own thoughts. He could still taste Gray on his lips... 'Ew, that is totally not what I meant...' He idly thought, even as he shut the door, unaware he'd crushed the doorknob. His mind was on other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on? Why did he bite Gray? And why were his pants feeling so tight? That thought was interrupted as he adjusted his scarf, feeling like he was being choked by it. \"Why... is... it... so... hot!\" He yelled, grabbing his pants, and accidentally ripping them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Natsu gasped, finally getting sight of himself in a mirror. His clothes were nearly skin-tight, his unique jacket nearly reaching to his navel, but what really caught his eye was the meat that he was commanding in his boxers. It was definitely beyond human. Before his startled eyes, he watched as his jacket grew tighter and tighter, his muscles bursting the belt on the sleeve, even as his bulging pecs began to rip the center of his vest apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasily shoottng to double his original size, he groaned as he flexed mightily as his vest tore to pieces, his expanding back ripping open to reveal his royal tattoo. It felt so good! He never felt more worthy to rule than he did now! Last but not least, his moans echoed as he felt the tightness move to his draconic sized member, his balls surging in size as his cock began to fill with blood. With a final rip, his boxers tore apart, revealing his impressive endowment, flopping out and whacking him in his mighty pecs. He gripped it, and couldn't resist as a wave of pleasure shot over him. \"AH!\" He shout echoed throughout the town. This was most worthy for a ruler like him. He slowly touched his faithful scarf, as his tattoo remade it as well, a beautiful fire pattern embroidered upon it, able to grow with him, his symbol of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know how long he was stroking, but his self-loving was interuptted at the sudden cry of \"Natsu!\" As Sting and Romeo both burst in, both rendered immediately speechless by the towering form of their idol. Natsu grinned, \"What took you so long. I'm ready for some worship.\" If they did well, well, they might be worthy of being more than just his servants.</span></div></div>",

Hands trailing over thick, tree trunk thighs as he gently caressed the muscles till he moved to the calf as it began to observe Natsus huge feet. Natsu couldn't see Romeo for multiple reasons (Natsus muscles, Romeos short height, etc.). Yet his touch was enough for Natsu to know the yoing fire mage was at work. The boy began to worship the large feet, less than half Romeos height, but easily able to crush him underneath if Natsu wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSting meanwhile brought his hands forward slowly, reveling in the site of Natsu's divine pride. It was nearly as tall and thick as Stings body. Natsu smirked as he saw his first servant embrace his superior form, stiffling a moan as Sting placed his entire body upon it and tightly hold it. The White Dragonslayer began to use his whole body to caress and fondle the mighty penis below him, precum slowly trickling out as it favored the White Dragonslayers touch.  \"Just like that little Sting. No tasting!~\" Natsu chuckled as Sting blushed at Natsus orders, wanting a taste. He uses his body to jerk Natsu off with his hands strongly moving back and forth as he pressed his body into the top side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were sweating as they did their work, the intense heat of Natsus aura heating the room, the objects and furniture in Natsus home burning and reforming from the fiery magical aura. Red hue lightly painting the reformed objects. The sweat began to soak both mages, their outfits slowly getting drenched by the intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo slowly stroked the beefy feet, putting his weight into massaging the big toes, his sweat helping him to barely do a rub that usually requires a good soak of the feet first. He admired the big toes of the fearsome Fire Dragonslayer, wanting to bring his mouth to it and give it a lick as he continues to rub. \"Natsu....\" he murmured as he moved his head forward and kissed the left toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu opened his mouth, baring his sharp teeth as he decides what with his two loyal little guys. He enjoyed the pleasant affection Romeo shows his toes. He knew what he wants for both. \"All right. That's enjoyable, but I have more important things to do before I start getting off my loyal little subjects.\" Instantly both stopped their work. Sting looking up from the cock as Romeo moved his hands and mouth away from the feet, walking to the side so Natsu can see him easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you did well for your first time, and I'll be having you both do more soon <b>but</b> I want to award you both for your first job wel done.\" Natsu said as he grabbed the sweaty Sting, who let go of Natsus cock as he was lifted and placed down on the ground. Sitting up, both locked up to him as he sat up, his cock stil leaking pre and covering his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's our award Natsu!?\" Both.were overjoyed with getting a gift, and hooping to flaunt their personal in the others face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu did not answer. He didn't want to spoil the surprise. Breathing in till his cheeks were puffed with oxygen, dragon tattoo on his back glpwing as his flames turned an intense bluish white. The large dragonslayer then spewed out a mighty gust of white flames \"Fire Dragoons Blessing!\" The flames engulfed both boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth panicked and put their arms up in self defense as the flames engulfed them. An intense heat burning into their bodies. Eyes closed as they began shooting insults at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Punish the jobbing dragonslayer jerk not me Natsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little turd! Natsu should only be burning you and your weird colored flames!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu finished his fire breath as his mouth slowly closed, the last spark of flame spilling out to vanish in the air. The King of Fire then began watching as their bickering got more intense, all the while ignorig the flames transforming their bodies.  He smirked in amusement and held back laughter, neither noticing that they and the house around them was unharmed. <i>They will see in a second. My two little princes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two argued as scales trailed across their hands, black for Romeo and white for Sting, a small baby dragon tattoo emerged upon their backs. Their frames slowly inching upwards as muscle began to fill their outfits. Two dragon princes in fire to serve as King Natsus second in commands.</span></div></div>",

It came to a head as they started to punch each other to finally notice their new changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Romeo gasped, looking at the changes his hands had underwent. His arms were covered in scales up to his forearms, while his hands looked like they had grown claws! \"What's going on?!\" He yelled out, somewhat confused. Sting looked at his own hands, noticing some similarities. 'It almost resembles my Dragon Force...' He thought, but it was different... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomeo continued to feel himself, looking for what else was different, pausing when he reached his ears. His eyes widened, as he felt them. \"My ears! They're pointy!\" Sting looked at Romeo, confirming what he said. Romeo's ears had indeed gotten longer, not like an elf, but almost more draconian. He thought Romeo's clothes seemed tighter, heck, even his own clothes felt tighter, and did his teeth look sharper as well? Even as he felt his own ears to confirm the same change, any other thoughts were interrupted by giant thud as Natsu plopped on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I hope you've enjoyed your gifts my little Princes, but it's time for a little release for me.\" Natsu grinned, eager for more worship, thrusting his pelvis forward to let his massive cock hang forward. \"I can assure you, the first person to make me cum will definitely be well rewarded.\" Natsu's Eternal Summer Aura of Authority spread out, making Romeo and Sting shiver somehow from the intense heat, his house continuing to melt, while they were both strangely unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what did you do to us?\" Sting asked, his curiosity outweighing his desire to submit, his own growing muscles starting to strain his midriff, still unaware to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple, I bestowed a little bit of my authority upon you. A little bit of the Authority of the King.\" Natsu;s eyebrow also rose a little bit. He figured that passing his authority made them a little resistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait so we can grow too?\" Romeo shouted, eyes immediately perking up. He immediately assumed a more flexed stance, sweat running down his brow, as he gritted his teeth, his sweaty muscles bulging with veins. Natsu and Sting both looked on in confusion, wondering what he was doing, until RIP! Both sweatdropped as Romeo panted, the crotch of his pants ripped open, a giant cock and balls hanging from his groin. Sting's eye twitched as Romeo grinned, \"Hehe, it worked!\" The piece of meat has to be at least 15 inches, and looked downright comical on Romeo's smaller frame. \"Awesome!\" He yelled as he held it against his torso to compare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two can play that game!\" Sting yelled, clenching as well, magic flaring while his bulge slowly started expanding as well, his pants baggy enough to avoid bursting, slowly starting to rival Romeo's, even while clothed. His thoughts were interrupted though by a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, Pleasure me!\" Natsu yelled, his cock hanging out, red from lack of attention. \"Aye sir!\" Both yelled, lightning sparking between them. \"I bet I can pleasure Natsu more than you!\" Sting yelled. \"You're on!\" Romeo shouted back as they charged, assaulting Natsu's cock, both vigorously rubbing the tip, licking the sweet pre leaking from it, rubbing their own crotches against it, Romeo's naked one and Sting's own impressive clothes bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu moaned, both doing marvelously at pleasuring him. He flared his Eternal Summer Aura, once again heating the room, and adding to the sweat pouring off of them. Both their eyes widened as they were forced back as Natsu's cock started lengthening again, slowly getting more hunched as his back pressed against the ceiling, and his legs even began touching the opposite walls, his pecs becoming a good resting place for his regal chin, his own scales traveling up his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock began throbbing, his balls rumbling, hinting that he was close, while Sting and Romeo tried harder, Natsu's groans deepening. Romeo grinned as he had a savage idea, and he flung his stinky flames right in front of Sting's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STINKS!\" Sting gasped, falling down, just as Natsu's face twisted in orgasm. Hopping against Natsu's slit, Romeo passionately licked it, just as Natsu released, struggling to drink as much of Natsu's royal seed as he could, his stomach bulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Sting charged Romeo out of the way, just as another spurt came, pretty much splattering Sting against the wall, and coating him with the remaining cum. \"You cheated!\" He yelled from there,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call it being smart.\" Romeo smirked, rubbing his stomach happily, cum leaking from the side of his mouth.</span></div></div>",

The smallest mage rubbed his bloated belly with joy as he answered \"Yes my King.\" He then started climbing Natsus thick pillar legs to get closer to his Kings face, the envy of Sting burning behind him. He stood on his toes as he reached up to hear the now King Dragonslayer speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it King Natsu?\" he happily asked as Natsu torso bent down, his thick pecs bumping into Romeos head for but a sec before Coranbolt repositioned himself so he could have Natsu speak to him. Natsu smirked as he brought his face to Romeos ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Whisper* *Whisper*\" Natsus deeper voice spoke as low as possible so Sting can't learn just yet. Romeo blushed as Natsu informed him he could change his physical characteristics and even make himself older. The secret technique caused him to wrap his still growing but toned arms around Natsus thick, scar wearing neck and give his God King a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll work hard Natsu!\" The envy of Sting still growing from afar as he heard Romeo speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====At Grays location====<br>\r\nWhile the two Princes had fun with their King Natsu, Gray had still been relaxing with Lyon out in the open, the still growing Ice Mage receiving worship from Lyon who was a bit too into it. Once Lyon stopped worshipping the massive arms and then the thighs, the smaller Ice Mage had happily started to worship Grays huge feet. The big toes dazzling in the Silver with Black striped hair mages eyes. Gray had warned Lyon not to stick his dick between his toes to get off, as he tried to hump Grays tree trunk thighs when Gray had been relaxing. Now he was vigilant in watching every move by Lyon since servants were a bit too enthusiastic in servitude..\"Like that huh?\" Gray cockily asked as he pressed his big toe into Lyons face, a nosebleed of silvery blue blood seeping as he resist the urge to lick it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lord Gray!\" He was blushing as he spoke, wanting to give his master countless praise and worship. Only for his joy to be denied as he heard a \"Ugh!\" from Gray. Grays fifteen foot body felt a weird tingling as his form sensed something weird going on elsewhere. A new urge budded within him. That of having a prince. \"Alright Lyon time to stop all worship of my glory.\" Lyon instantly stopped at command and looked towards Grays face, who looked down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing in reverance Lyon spoke \"What is it my liege?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time for you to go forth and convert Lamia Scale. In exchange, I will not only restore your skin to normal, but I will also make you into royalty.\" Grays voice gained an almost hypnotic effect to it, mesmerizing Lyon who after only a bit of worship had easily become the Ice Kings thrall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you I will!\" Lyon Vastia rushed off to where the members in Magnolia were stationed. Once he got the ones currently in the town the rest would be converted with ease, so he could come back and serve Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching with confidence as Lyon ran off, Gray turned his eyes to the envionment around him. The flora, ground, and buildings all around were a pale blue tint to them, the buildings fixed  \"Seems my power changes the world around me.\" Gray viewed the weird abilities that had sprung from Natsus bite as natural at this point, every inch making him more comfortable with the changes as he becomes a cold but gentle god king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his eye to a broken wall a good forty feet away left untouched at the moment as the frozen ground slowly spread forth. Gray preparing his powerful, deep voice as he knew someone was behind there.\"Though a certain someone can come out before I have to get rough.\" A messy, orange haired man in a suit with glasses emerged from his hiding spot without hesistation or fear. He walked forward and into the growing territory of the growing king. \"Loke? Don't you spend all your time in the Celestial Spirit World these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally. Lucy had summoned us to help Magnolia be repaired.\" Loke, also known by his true name Leo, walked up to the relaxed and resting Gray, who eyed him up in a way he saw pervs look at Lucy. \"So what happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing much. Natsu bit me, started growing in size and getting new powers to rule over others.\" Gray liked how his guildmember was not letting this get to him in the slightest. A quality he decies he wants from his first prince. \"How long have you been watching and listening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About when Lyon tried to hump your thighs. An amusing sight I can tell you that.\" The hazel eyed man smirked as he glanced across Grays grown figure with a closer look. \"I felt something weird in two parts of the town so I sent Laxus to the other while I came here. I'd be lying if I said this is really freaking weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems natural to me.\" Gray sat up, nearly twice Lokes height just sitting down and letting Loke see his beefy form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lion Celestial Spirit felt there was no way to run or escape, so he accepted that Gray had his own plans for the smaller mage. \"The magic from you is unbelivably intense. I've never sense magic so powerful before. Yet its kept hidden from mages.\" Gray was happy to learn he can grow without getting into trouble at the moment. At his current size. Juvia would turn into water and cover him every second. He wants to be at least fifty feet before seeing her to avoid that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why didn't you warn the others?\" Gray eyed him suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to, but seeing you like this has made me...\" Loke stopped speaking as he walked over, placing a hand on the black material safely guarding the behemoth cock inside \"decide to experiment\". He was still unchanged despite this, showing his will was unperturbed by Grays freezing power that chills all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexing both his arms as he did a double bicep pose, Gray admired his bulk and  could see why someone might chose this willingly. \"Very well my first prince. Let the strongest of the Twelve Zodiacs be my second in command!\" He brought his right hand down to touch Loke with one finger. The Demonslayer tattoo spread across Grays right half as the dragon tattoo glowed. Thd black demonic essence spreading from Grays massive hand to Lokes body, dying him pitch black as the Leo Zodiac welcomed the power of princehood. Two demonic small horns grew from Loke's head as his muscles started to grow, his suit becoming tight as a small dragon tattoo joined his fairy tail one upon his back....</span></div></div>",

Gray's brow raised slightly even as Loke toyed with his new horns. \"Huh, I didn't expect that, but can't say I don't like it. But now, I think I have other things to attend to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoke took a deep breath, expanding his chest, and that button burst clean off of his suit, even as he adjusted his necktie, considering it was cutting off his circulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray looked at his new prince, even as he took in his new appearance. The demon horns were new, he thought, even as he reached up to adjust his bangs. \"Ow!\" He muttered, seeing a small prick on his finger which he saw quickly healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, forget about those Gray?\" Loke commented, somewhat smiling as he saw Gray sucking on his finger,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Gray shouted, waving his hand, as he dumped a butt load of snow right on top of Loke's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...\" Loke muttered, even as he dug himself out, shaking his head as the snow fell off of his head. \"That's not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy oy, I'm the King here!\" Gray countered, somewhat enjoying how independent Loke could be. Fitting characteristic for a prince of his. Although he did note something was a bit off. \"What's up with your hand?\" He noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That's strange.\" Loke muttered, as he lifted his hand up, which seemed to have a strange golden coating over it. He moved his hand over it, and it felt soft... like fur. \"What the-?!\" He shouted as his hand started spasming violently as he lurched forward, Gray watching curiously, arms crossed, even as his hand reached down to massage his bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRRR!\" Loke growled, his teeth sharpening even as he spasmed violently. Underneath his suit, his bones shifted even as  a small nub popped out of the base of his spine. Underneath his suit, the fur was slowly spreading up, stopping at his bicep. With a grunt, his arm expanded, ripping his suit jacket's sleeve to shreds. Gray could see his muscles rippling underneath his shirt, even as Loke thrashed around on his back, clawed hand reaching up to rip his tie off, even as his muscles forced his button-up apart, buttons flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Loke's feet were changing too, becoming much more bestial as his toes expanding, resembling paw toes much more than human ones, ripping his shoes apart, as the muscle and fur started traveling up, ripping his pant legs apart, stopping short of his thighs..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a particular violent thrust, his spine expanding into the nub, stretching the skin as muscle and bone expanding, slowly becoming as long as his arm as a tuft of hair the same color as his head of hair tipped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part was yet to come, as his other arm followed suit, leaving his only in the tattered remains of his shirt and jacket, and what was left of his pants. That didn't last long though, as a clawed hand slashed the crotch of his pants open, letting his hard lionhood flop free, pawing himself violent as the accompanying growth hit it too, being more than enough to fill two of his giant paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoke was a mix of bestial instinct and raw pleasure at the moment, drool leaking out of the side of his mouth even as his growth stopped just a little bit more than a foot and half of pure masculinity in the paw of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was growling and purring at the same time, as he stroked, body growing larger and larger, even as Gray could hear the churn of his big, furry, balls. Stopping just about one and a half the size of Gray, he finally came, thick, creamy spurts of lion seed shooting out, raining down heavily over Loke's new half human, half lion form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoke's arms fell to his side, even as Gray nodded, trying his best to keep himself soft as he looked over his new prince, Loke gently rubbing his hand over his new bulk, tongue licking his fangs, as he adjusted his specs. Fortunately his ears were just pointed, not like a lion, otherwise he wouldn't be able to keep his specs on, though they were a little tight. Hopefully he could do something about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a thing...\" He sighed, flopping back down, even as his soft malehood hung between his legs.</span></div></div>",

Gray lost the battle with his will as he began too stroke his bulge through the tight material of his boxers as he eyed him. The massive ice kings pillar needy for attention from the moment he changed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down enough to speak as the cold air become nothing around him, he spoke. \"How did your boxers grow with you?\" Loke wanted to preserve his glasses afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple really. I used my new power to make it grow with me. Everything around me is changing after all. My clothes would be no exception unless I decide otherwise.\" Gray believed he was finished before the instinctual knowledge pf his princes abilities came to him. \"You can do it too now that you are my prince. Just will the magic to change it as you see fit. Even changing your appearance is simple for you now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Gray.\" Was that the orange-haired Zodiac spirit brought his hand to his glasses, the clawed finger infused with magic as he transferred it to the object. Soon it began to swell in size and become comfortable to him.<i> \"Now if I want cat ears later I'll just make some. After all I have the ability to change my appearance now and there's no rule that says I can't have four ears.\"</i> Another flux of magic covered his body and the seed that coated him was gone. The perfect means to groom oneself. The cum on the ground meanwhile instantly froze, moving together to fuse into a bizarre living flower of ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith gratitude the lion prince bowed before his King. \"Thank you for this. Now I'm going to award you as you did me!\" Loke confidently licked his lips as a second set of ears emerged on his head. Cute orange furred kitty ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking as that's what Gray wanted. His tight boxers began to change as Gray flooded magic across it, a hole opened as if it was natural that it let his might cock free. The beastly dong being inhumanly big for Grays size as it nestled into the 17 ft. God kings pecs. He had no need for words as the Leo zodiac knew what he wants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoke then jumped, landing with a *THUD* on top of the divine pillar. Gray looked amused as the landing only stimulated it with pleasure, pre gushing onto his massive chest. Soon the lion spirit got on all fours as he tried to wrap his body around it. But it's width was just as monstrous, making hugging it completely impossible at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this Gray?\" He extended his claws, moving them roughly across the skin. The gargantuan cock loved the feeling of it as it instantly released, cum gushing forth as a geyser. Gray had prepared for it as he put his hand down to create an ice wall to shield his face as it emerged from the ground and moved around his thick neck. The ice wall was sturdy enough to take the impact, even as his chest and neck was completely coated White. The white gold drooped to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good my little prince. Now keep doing it! I want to be spent before I descend upon my next target Blue Pegasus.\" With that order Loke happily began to claw at it more, bringing his tongue down to roughly lick it. The pleasure of those sharp claws made Gray cum for a second time, soon followed by a third, etc.</span></div></div>",

Their friends Judar and Hakuryuu had both left to get their allies against the two, but would return soon. The blue haired youth and his king candidate were at an inn in the desert kingdom of Heliohapt that was the closest nation between the current world and the dark continent, where Alibaba's teacher and Sinbads subordinate Sharrkan now rules over due to his half-brother leaving to oversee the Sindria Trading Company as an executive in its headquarters in Parthevia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were eating at a restaurant and enjoying local delicacies in the nation while talking. Aladdin was enjoying a chicken kishk while Alibaba ate a shawarma. \"So what was it you wanted to talk about Aladdin?\" Alibaba asked as he took a bite of his shawarma, enjoying the multiple meats and veggies within. <i>This is pretty good. I should try Heliohapt cuisine more often.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've figured out a means to harness the power of the gods. Ugo once told me about how the Gods exist within a hierarchy, so I've been thinking of how to make use of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you go about using it? I can see Ugo doing it since he's incredibly smart and lives in the Sacred Palace, but we're in the normal world outside it.\" Alibaba naturallly questioned how Aladdin would go about it, since he knew something like that would probably require help from others. \"Besides what would we do with becoming a God? All that responsibility would be too much for me. I'd rather just marry Morgiana\" a perverted looked cross his face to easily inform Aladdin of Alibaba's dirty thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I need to test it first, which is why I need you to watch over me when I perform the spell later Alibaba. When we're done we'll go to the edge of the Great Rift to perform it without anyone interfering.\" Aladdin replied back as he finished his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. So you want me to stop it if something goes wrong?\" Taking another bite after talking to finish half his shawarma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" With a nod from Alibaba, the two finished eating and ordered several drinks before preparing to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several hours to reach the entrance to the vast and expansive Great Rift. The two quickly got to work preparing for the spell Aladdin sought to perform as Aladdin held his  staff with both hands, concentrating on controlling the magoi produced by the rukh. Light began to surround him as the rukh across the area flew towards him to give him the extra power needed. \"You ready Alibaba?\" Aladdin asked as the glow strengthen as he readied to perform it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready!\" Activating his Djinn equip, Alibaba was engulfed in flames as his appearance change. His clothes remade to show off his lean physique as his dagger takes its proper black sword form. The fire halo burning behind him as he stood ready to knock Aladdin out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! <i>Said-Said Rajiballah</i>!\" Aladdin called out, the land around him suddenly engulfed in rukh as it proceeding to rush towards him like a flood, endless birdlike shapes of white rukh swirling around him in a radiant tornado of light. The sky darkening as clouds began to set it and surround above, thunder deafening the land. The earth itself beginning to tremble beneath their feet, pebbles shaking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! I did not expect all this to happen.\" Alibaba said in surprise as he tried to stay steady on the rumbling earth, the small rocks and pebbles slowly levitating off the ground. Alibaba looking a bit surprised.<i> He wanted me to stop this?</i> A nervous look cross his face as more rukh just continue to rush forward towards Aladdins body, and with them and the evergrowing Rukh tornado the wind became strong enough that even his magoi controlled flames were starting to be blown out. <i>Even my halo is on the verge of going out! I don't think I can stop this.</i> Desperate not to fly off as well, he grabbed hold of sturdy tree nearby and held on, stabbing the ground his sword to also stay in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin was in a bliss like state as it all happened, his body filled with a joyous warmth and pleasure as the rukh seemed to dance within him. Yet they kept his body still and in place. His arms, his chest, his eyes, his mind, all filling with the rukh and overwhelmed by their warmth. Yet he was unable to voice any of it. <i> It's strange. This isn't like any spell I've ever perform before, mmm, and yet I don't want it to stop.</i> The light giving Aladdins body pleasure and filling every cell with an intoxicating feeling, leaving him ignorant of the world around him. Not noticing Alibaba as he used his fire magic to send him to a tree farther away as the one he held on to was being engulfed by the rukh tornado, stabbing the one he reached with a burst of fire magic using his sword in order to not let go. Soon a 15 meter tornado swirled around Aladdins body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no clear signs the tornado suddenly stopped, all of the Rukh frozen in place. The strong winds halting and the levitating rocks falling down to the earth. <i>Is it over?</i> Alibaba thought as they quickly rushed into Aladdins body. The massive space they had swallowed all the way to the clouds above quickly shrinking as they entered Aladdins body. The dark clouds soon gone as the sky turned clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlibaba pulled his sword out as he saw it had finished, walking over to where Aladdins body stood.

The recently integrated New Aincraid floating in the sky, the equally massive World Tree branching into the sky. \"Time to go see Klein in Gadan\". He headed for the Salamanders territory that Klein was part of, the wind blowing his soft hair back as Yui held on tightly to the dark strands. As he traversed the skies his skin began to feel flushed, his body feeling like a gentle massage was caressing every part of his body. Every part of his avatar felt sensitive to the strange touch as beneath his black clothes blue veins turned black, feeding his body the stat boost. Triceps, lats, hamstrings, deltoids, etc. grew a little bigger as he gained an inch in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This feels so nice.</i> Kirito closed his eyes as he flew, embracing the pleasant feeling even as other fairies flew by. Soon it began to ebb away, black tainted veins turning blue as it stopped for but a moment. A good 2 inches added to his height as he grew to 5'8, his clothes a little tighter but still loose as a little more muscle grew beneath. \"Yui are there any noticeable changes to my body after drinking the stat boost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me check daddy.\" She began to analyze his body, noticing the beginning of muscle emerging from Kiritos Avatar body and a improvement to stature. As she went in depth to analyze the program her eyes turned from black to blank white, an assortment of \"%#:%%=3222\u00d7\u00f7%%4;#=%=\u00f7\u00f7##==\" flooded the AI's mind, the black ooze that dwelled within the Avatars code was less like a program and more similar to a virus. One advance enough to tamper with Yuis own programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye color returned as her memories and scanning ability were now rewritten, seeing his new appearance as 'normal'. \"Nothing's wrong Daddy! Just a boost to your stats by 1%!\" Which wasn't entirely a lie, his stats received an okay boost, but it'd be correct to say he received one closer to 4% than 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We're almost to Gadan. So let's go down and tell him how the new raid boss in Spriggan territory works!\" Kirito began to lower his altitude as they entered the desert territory ruled by the Salamander race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===During the battle===<br>\r\nKirito swung both blades with all his might as he clashed with the mighty new raid boss added to Alfheim. Svart\u00e1lfar, Forgotten God King of the Dark Elves. A giant cloaked figure with scaled hands and a face obscured save for its eyes that consumed the light around it like a black hole. Three Mystical Spears that he tossed at the melee swordsman who swiftly dodged, black leathery wings of of the boss appearing from his cloak as he took flight, summoning threw more spears that all moved at his will like peojectiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito decided to take on this new raid boss solo in the recently opened it dungeon Shadow Alfheim. It's difficulty surprising him as it allowed even solo players to take it on. Nevertheless he prevailed,  realizing he always changes between flight and land with his attacks, striking in half Svart\u00e1lfar as he deopped the stat booster. A stat booster meant to improve only one stat by a mere .25%, but due to an unforseen error the dark attuned Spriggans gained a permanent status buff enhancing, stats receiving boostsby large amounts beyond the intended use. The forgotten Dark Fae was to be a grinding boss to make way for a new set of bosses based around each race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems they should have experimented more with the beta testers!</span></div></div>",

As the programs shut off and he received a warning about no protection, he opened a small hatch beneath the controls to reveal the USB port. Holding his hand up for the USB Flash Drive, Rinko handed him the object to plug int.  \"Now to save the file and activate it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sww the file \"GRWEXPV8.exe\". He smirked at it being her 8th Version. \"Could have done it by version-OW\" His smartass comment getting a slap in the head. \"Sorry!\" Returning to save the file into the processes outside the Admins reach, going through the search for his Fluctlight in Central Cathedral.

Unbeknownst to him that the second in command and her four subordinates waited for them. \"No matter who we face we'll beat them and save Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Eugeo smiled as the continued upwards, his foot raising to the next step to as he-*FREEZE*. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen eyes began shifting rapidly in his sockets, zigzagging in every direction as lips dripped red from teeth piercing lips. The blonde boys body shivered as he remained frozen in place. All thoughts by the boy silenced. Emotions nulled as the program became a virus, altering that which it was not meant to infect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito moved a few steps upwards, only to look back when his friend did not stsnd side by side \"Eugeo?

I doubt it was to stop their twisted experiments with us or Quintella. *SIGH*\" She manifested a cup of tea to sip before resuming \"I hope Kirito and Eugeo still fare well on the quest to dethrone her.

Eventually they found a suspicious website which advertised some kind of \"magic pills\" to improve strength and handsomeness of the male body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ordered them without thinking, and the day after they received a big box with dozens of bottles of pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect they would send so many for only 5$.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the club room where all the other members were (except Haruhi, who was doing something elsewhere). Some of them had already started training: Mori was lifting weights shirtless with special enthusiasm. Honey wanted to follow his cousin's example, but he couldn't lift the lightest of the weights. Ootori was already bored and tired of running on the treadmill and had stopped to play with his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaoru, Hikaru, good timing... I have got an idea to make the exercise more fun.\" The president explained his plan: A competition between the members to see who can get bigger in one month and the winner would receive a really special prize (he didn't specify).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a bodybuilding contest in a month. We could all participate in it, and we could use the judges' points to decide who win our personal competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot everyone liked Tamaki's idea, but they ended up signing up. Then the twins talked about the pills they had bought and offered them some bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this... some kind of steroid?\" Tamaki wondered suspiciously \"Is it safe?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" One twin said.<br>\r\n\"They aren't steroids, they're... supplements!\" The other continued, although they didn't actually know what they are.<br>\r\n\"It helps to build muscle and gives energy to do more even exercise.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's true... I'm so tired after 10 minutes of treadmill I could make use of one energetic supplement...\"  Ootori said as he took one.<br>\r\n\"Packing muscle isn't easy for tall people like me.\" Mori continued. \"If they could help me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney got another bottle and swallow a pair of them without caring about what was the recommendable dose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end everyone had his own bottle of pills. There were still plenty in the box.<br>\r\nThe label of the bottle didn't say much about the drug and their effects except it helped to become stronger... However, there was an information pamphlet on the bottom of the box, hided by the remaining bottles... that unseen document warned about the danger of consuming more than a pill per month and it wasn't recommended for people younger than 21. Unfortunately, no one noticed that piece of paper...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Each boy had gone to a different exercise machines and equipment bought for the club. Numerous tools for weightlifting neatly gathered together as their own private gym. The truth of this situation is that Kyoya had noticed they were being a bit too gluttonous and he had manipulated Tamaki's ego to get this all set up. As the Shadow King should to keep the club running smoothly<i>. \"Was surprised by Hikaru and Kaoru getting these to help. It shouldn't do much harm if we only use them to get into shape.\"</i> Kyoya mused as he held a bottle in his hand, opening it to take his his own. <i>\"I made sure to prepare before I did this. I have no intention of improper training\".</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Let us train ourselves and become dazzling heavenly bodies for all women to adore!\" Tamaki gallantly sparkled as he talked to the rest, taking out his first pill and ingesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do!\" Honey chirped from Mori's shoulder, sitting there happily as Mori stood there in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were not so satisfied with the idea of working hard, even with the pills \"At least we can win an award if we do well\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoya just smirked as everything was coming together as he schemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all took a pill they went to their individual equipment, some of which had been changed on a whim. Kyoya was doing chin ups, Honey was using an 35 lbs (16 kg) kettleball, Hikaru and Kaoru were both using 15 lbs (6 kg) dumbbells, Mori was near Honey doing bench press with 45 lbs (20 kg) barbells, and Tamaki was completetly reckless doing a Lat pulldown with 150 lbs (60 kg).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru and Kaoru quickly got into theirs doing bicep curls. \"Easier than we thought!\" Both said as each rep seemed easier with each new one. Veins elegantly emerging across their biceps as they slowly got bigger.<br>\r\nHoney was treating his kettleball more as a toy as he lifts it before putting it down. \"This is heavy!\" Never taking into consideration his shorter height and weight wasn't ready for it. Yet after lifting it for a second and third time felt a tad easier and he could hold it just a little longer. His slender arms looking like something was thickening beneath it.<br>\r\nMori and Kyoya had yet to start, as they were doing dynamic stretches to prepare their bodies for the coming training. Mori's eyes on Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki on the other hand had been an idiot. Never learning how to properly do lat pullldowns, nor having weights set to a limit he could handle, meant his face was blistering red as he tried to pull down the bar, his bad grip not even budging the weight as. It sat there as an unmovable object. \"C-c'mon I can do this!\" The blonde whined In frustration as it refused to budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him not to rush and look up everything about it.\" Kyoya mused as he finished his stetches with Mori and the two headed for their planned workouts. Hikaru and Kaoru were doing reps with reckless abandon, each flex making their biceps bulge slightly more beneath their uniform, and bizzarely the rest of their body slowly grew starting from the muscles they were working. Though not as big as their new biceps and growing arms got the most change. It was feeding them with a buzz of energy to keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney shorter frame was definitely bigger as his wider shoulders on his short frame left his uniform tight. He had just been playing with the kettleball, even doing some actual exercises by chance, as his smaller body welcomed the pressure of the heavy object. \"I should get a bigger one to play with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki meanwhile had let out a triumphant sigh of relief \"Aha! I knew things would go my way!\" Instead of receiving an injury from his reckless posture and new tire effort to pull down the bar, he had finally seen the weights rise ever slow slowly. It was clear that his biceps and deltoids were growing stronger, his shoulder muscles bulging as light veins snaked below his clothes. His lats were growing stronger in the back, which began to influence the other muscles in the back as the pill altered the rest of the body to make them as strong as the ones being worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he had finally pulled the bar down to to the top of his chest chest...and then pulled ut down further. The bad posturing only made his body work harder to compensate, growing to feed him mass and power to ease the workload. \"Yes I did it!\" Tamaki triumphantly thought aloud as he just kept the bar in place with his stronger grip. \"I knew I could do it! Now let's do another one.\" With his second the strain became easier, his shirt began to stretch in the front as his pecs started to grow from contact with his thickening muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another! and Another!\" Each rep became easier as his body grew from each one. Bursting in power as the 100 lbs became nothing by his 8th rep! The King of the Host Club felt discomfort as his body needed to be repositioned to pull the weight, the leader getting easily 5 inches (12 cm) in height. The lower set of cobblestone abs peeking at the bottom. \"Since this is getting easier I better put on more weight!\" Tamaki triumphantly mused at how natural this came to him? Not realizing that pills wonderful effects are why he's not in a hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were still doing their own exercises but the lack of strain with the now pitiful weight of their dumbbels and kettleball made it hard for Hikaru, Kaoru, and Honey to notice. Mori was taking his time doing small number of reps sith each set, keeping his body from being damaged in his mind but halting his progress. Kyoya's own body was getting nicely toned as he did his set of reps with each chin up. The boys had all gotten 1-1.5 inches (2- 3 cm) in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the weight up to  300 bs (136 kg) before sitting down. \"Now let's see me get used to this even easier than the first time!\" As he piled on the weight. Repeating the process of frustration, ease, cocky arrogance as he bulged, stretched, pumped, hickened with inhuman power. The leader of the Host Club adding easily 8 inches (20 cm) in height to rise to 7'1 (215 cm) by his 20th rep. His main workout muscles grew the most and the rest of his body grew to keep up. \"I am truly made to be the Host Clubs King!\" Tamaki Suoh cockily released the bar with carelessness as the buzz of energy left him on a power high and he decided to really flex his arms. With that motion a *RRRRIIIIPPPP* sound echoed across the room as his biceps tore through the restrictive clothes, more tears releasing their desperate pleas to end the expanding form of the growing prettyboy behemoth. The weights fell with a thud as 300 lbs came down hard with the bars release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it all eyes turned to Tamaki as he stood tall and proud and looked at the others. \"I need to get bigger!\" The other members stared dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tamaki!?\"</span></div></div>",

The little guy laughed as Tamaki started to spin, transforming himself into a living carousel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stopped spinning, he stayed still face to face with Mori... although this time the \"former tallest club member\" was way below his eye level, roughly a head shorter. He was staring at the president with a serious face, Tamaki suspected he didn't like to be outgrew, or maybe he dislikes how much attention his cousin paid to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his shorter fellow's hair with a little too strength, to annoy him a bit. He really enjoyed his new height, a suitable size for a \"prince\"... or a king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he wasn't as greedy to let his friends fall behind... He encouraged them to keep training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been doing it well, but you neglected the intensity of the exercise. Exercising with an 2KG weight will take you two the double of time than a 4KG weight... the same with one of 8, 16 and 32KG! If you try as hard you think you're going to die, but keep going, you'll eventually get a body as strong as mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others members, encouraged with his words, decided to give their best so they could get a body as impressive as the president. The most fired-up was Mori, his face remained serious and emotionless, but his eyes were filled with fire and determination. He added weights to his own until it matched the 300 Lb (136 kg) Tamaki did lift just before stopping. The headmaster's son had some difficulties with it, so Mori thought if he could lifted it, he would match him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stoicism disappeared when he started to use that weight... he used all his strength, but he only could lift it a few centimeters before dropping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwearing and panting, the tall dark haired boy realized he wouldn't achieve it without an extra help, so  he grabbed his bottle of pills and took another two.<br>\r\nTaking more \"supplements\" could be considered as a cheat in that competition between club members... But he didn't feel guilty. Minutes before he had seen the twins sneakily taking a new dose. And they had begun to benefit of that: They had grown inches in height and width, their t-shirts were straining with their thickening pectorals and couldn't cover their longer torsos, exposing their first row of abs. They were lifting lighter weights than his, but maybe because of that they could finish multiple reps, and the correctly executed exercise benefit their growth rates (Remember: Mori was still on his first rep because it was too heavy for him)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori could have reduced the weight, but he was too pig-headed, he wanted to surpass Tamaki as fast as he could... so he keep trying with the 300Lbs weights, suffering a lot so tbey would rise just 5cm (2 inches)... while he was holding it all his muscles, which were completely and painfully flexed, thickened 2.5 centimeter (1\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorn out, he dropped the weights noisily. He didn't notice his improvements and frustrated, he swallowed another pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't gave up and tried it again, and during the tremendous effort his pectorals and biceps expanded another inch... This time he noticed something, that he could lift it an little higher for one second more than before. He smiled and repeated the exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new rep, the weights went noticeable higher, not only his muscles grew, his whole body stretched taller (not much, roughtly 5cm or 2\").<br>\r\nAnother rep, the weights didn't feel so impossibly heavy anymore. His shoulders grew broader, and with them his deltoids and pecs.<br>\r\nThe third rep caused a little growth spurt in height and muscle mass. Mori wasn't comfortable in the seat, he readjusted his posture to adapt his larger frame. Also...<br>\r\nThe fourth one. And his shoes were killing him. They were becoming more and more tight as he kept exercising... but he was too into it to stop and take his trainers off.<br>\r\nThe fifth one. It was becoming too easy too him, the main difficulty was his clothes... he was doing it shirtless, but his shoes and his pants couldn't adapt to his growing form. The trouser legs receded as his legs grew even longer, got tighter as they gained width... and his crotch grew fuller due to the hormonal chaos caused by the overdose of pills.<br>\r\nSix. His feet burst his trainers. Mori didn't care much (actually, he felt alleviated) and kept going.<br>\r\nSeven. His head rose a few more centimeters. His super wide-shoulders, in contrast with his still pretty narrow waist, gave him an extreme v-shape back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy\" He thought and added more weight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight. Mori moaned a little, but not because of the weight. His cock was growing... or trying to, but his tight trousers didn't let him. The struggle was as uncomfortable as pleasant... He couldn't help getting a hardon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine. An erection (expanding with each rep) can tear trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen. The rest of his trousers (which ended just above his knees) started to rip due to his growing thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleven.<br>\r\nTwelve<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nTwenty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now-considerably big twins stopped chitchatting and stared silently at the colossal teen. They could see the growth happening in front of their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innocent Honey was cheering him as he was taking more and more pills. The little blond didn't trained much in comparison with his friends, but he ate much more pills. They were incredible sweet, and the boy started to think about them like candy. Although he hadn't grown much (a few inches and pounds), the excessive dose would have consequences later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori was about to add more weights, but the exercising machine was at its limit and couldn't increase the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student signed, he didn't expect all that expensive tranning machinery would become outdated in just a session. Although he was quite satisfied with the results, standing at 239cm (7'10\") tall and much muscular (gymnastic build)... but had he got his goal? Was he taller than the president?</span></div></div>",

At this size the girls are more likely to fear the four of them.\" Relieved Honey was still normal for the most part, happily swallowing the last of his sweet pills with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo Tamaki! Lookin nearly as good as Mori!\" The twins simultaneously whistled as they saw him still working at it, both eating three more pills each. Mori stayed silent as he observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"  Tamaki had still been exercising, even if only his muscles were growing slightly now from each rep. Finally putting it down he turned to take in the sight of Mori's new height and the twins physiques that rivaled his own. In the half-french boy sparked a desire to best their once again largest member, while plotting to go beyond the twins again in power. Before Tamaki could speak the four heard Kyoya clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest we rest for the moment. We've all trained enough for the moment.\" He expected the now towering four to agree with him, especially the more lazy twins. Even Honey who was now holding Usa-chan and talking to the doll as he came over. Yet that did not happen to his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? But I haven't even begun to get big!\" Tamaki, Hikaru, Kaoru, and Honey collectively declared as Mori nodded to agree with them. Their bodies were overflowing with energy and a desire to exert it. Even Honey thanks to eating every pill he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoya was taken aback. \"I must admit I am surprised. Normally I would expect all but Mori to dislike this. Especially you three.\" Clearly speaking about the twins and Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but now it's pretty enjoyable! I've gotten so big and it feels great! Ain't that right Kaoru?\" Kaoru insisted as he called Hikaru by his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikaru's right.

Mori nodded as he spoke \"I'll hekp you.\" Mori softly spoke in a much deeper voice, a moan emerging as Honey began to massage his neck. His cock threatening to tear his barsly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I-\" Tamaki stood up as he proudly proclaimed his new objective \"Plan to be the biggest as our clubs King! I won't be beaten by the Shady Twins or Mori!\" The twins smirked at the fact Tamaki felt they could beat him, and both were willing to try. Mori planned on surpassing Tamaki when that happens, but for now helping his smaller cousin grow is his current goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. I will rest for the moment while you all continue. I'll even make a call and have them ship some protein drinks since you lot will all need nourishment when you are done.\" Kyoya was happy seeing them all take this seriously.<i> \"We didn't waste so much money for nothing after all.\" </i>He left the four to go relax by himself as he opened his phone and made a call. \"Haruhi you can go home early today. No don't worry about us. I will cut off 10% based off your original debt so don't worry.\" He heard a cheer from her as he said those words. \"Have a good day.\" Hanging up, he made his next call for protein foods to be shipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other four had split up as their second shortest member rested. Mori was with Honey who happily giggled in Mori's ear. \" let's arm wrestle.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright and sunny day as police officer Hidenori Goto watched the street. There was not much to do due to how peaceful life is in the world now. Crime was almost gone due to Masayoshi saving the world several months ago when the aliens invaded and he defeated Alien Flamenco. The last threat had been the deranged Haiji Sawada, who kidnapped Goto to get to Masayoshi. Masayoshi kept sending the dark haired man texts about their marriage, which was irritating him, as Masayoshi confessed in the heat of the moment butt naked. Not helped by the fact that Masayoshi now knows Goto texts from his girlfriend were just Goto texting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to do today\" he sighed aloud as a couple walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goto!\" came a loud voice from afar. Goto turned to see Masayoshi running towards him with a smile on his face. The light blonde haired man ran towards him in his red Flamenco suit. His helmet was in the youthful models arm as he ran over. Goto noticed the new accessories he added with a gold and silver button on the tip of the helm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>''Speak of the Devil'' </i> amused Goto as he saw Masayoshis big gray blue eyes shining brightly as he slowed down upon reaching him. \"Aren't you supposed to be working on a show right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They had to cancel due to the main actor getting sick! Miss Ishihara said I could take the day off today. None of that matters though. You won't believe what happened to me last night!\" Masayoshi enthusiastically says as he puts on the red helmet on. He was then looking around his suit for something. He his arms before going for the yelllow SF insignia on his chest and heading down to his pants. \"It's not here. But He said it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking for?\" Goto asked as he saw Masayoshi was now trying to check his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two buttons God said he put on my outfit!\" Masayoshi sounded frustrated as he spoke.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n''Can't believe he hadn't checked the obvious spot.'' </i>Sighing Goto pointed out the obvious \"It's right there on the helmet\" He took a picture with his cell phone and showed it to Masayoshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Wait you mean He put it on my helmet? Oh well that makes things simple!\" Seeing the specific button through the photo, Masayoshi pressed the gold button. Then a bright red light engulfed Masayoshi. His cloth made hero suit transforming into a red and dark red armored variation. The helmet likewise transforming as it covered his entire head and created a dark visor to hide his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoto didn't notice it at first, but then he saw that Masayoshi seemed to be.... Growing taller? That can't be right. Masayoshi told him how everything would be normal from then on after his conversation with God. He also wasn't sure due to the armor but was Masayoshi also thicker? His normally lean appearance was hidden beneath the transformed suit, leaving him perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInches slowly came to Masayoshis body as he slowly rose in height, his face obscured beneath the visor. Though he thought he heard a quick moan, so it clearly felt good. If his ears were not playing tricks on him that is. Three minutes passed as Masayoshi's growth ended. His chin was now eye level with Goto's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasayoshi opened the visor to look down at Goto with a bright smile. \"See Goto!? God came to me last night in my dream and gave me this as a wedding gift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Goto was surprised that something like this could happen these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He said the gold one acffects me and the Silver affects someone else. Don't remember who though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nothing about shrinking?\" Goto questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Don't think so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing. Goto knew what kind of disaster this could lead to. He called his partner Totsuka \"Totsuka let them know at the station I have to leave work early. No it is not related to the wedding Masayoshi keeps blabbing about, though it does involve him. Thanks man.\" He hung up after the call to focus on the bigger idiot in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're coming home with me this instant.\" Goto said as he grabbed Masayoshis hand and started to pull. \"We are checking you at the house to see what the will of the universe did to you in full. No getting naked again in public\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Goto!\" Masayoshi replied as he followed.</span></div></div>",

During his absence he had gathered enough courage to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satisfied?\" The top model said slightly blushed as he took off the last piece of clothing, his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Samurai Policeman' smiled and proceeded to check meticulously his body.<br>\r\nThat confirmed his initial suspicions: He was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasayoshi's shoulders had grown a few centimeters broader, giving him a little more V-shaped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs and abs were more emphasized. He probably had gained some muscular (like 2Lbs / 1Kg) with the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was taller, of course. The measure tape revealed that he was 193cm (6'4\") tall now, exactly 10cm (4\") taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor unknown reasons, Masayoshi felt a little embarrassed by having his friend examining his body from so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you becoming hard?\" Goto asked him with a serious tone.<br>\r\n\"WHAT?? Of course not!\" The superhero replied nervous, blushing hard.<br>\r\n\"Not even semihard? Because it looks bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoto had seen his genitals more times than he would have liked, and noticed his 'birdie' had gained some centimeters in length and girth too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSceptical, the kneeling policeman poked the falus with his index finger, only to find his friend was right and it was completely flaccid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goto-san!!\" He protested blushing even more, but before he could separate his private part from him his 'little Masayoshi' reacted crazy fast, having an explosive erection that hit his serious partner's forehead despite not being specially close to the dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policeman rub his forehead as he kept observing the pulsating hard cock. The speed of its erection and the rock-hardness of his cock had taken him by surprise... and not to mention its dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as long as his face, that would mean it was over 20cm (8\") easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoto kept staring in shock until the embarrassed Masayoshi spinned to put it out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" That was all his friend had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe national hero refused to continue the checking and kept turning his back on him to hide his still hard cock (it would take a while to cool down).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Goto paid attention to the magic helmet he had left on the table.<br>\r\nThe examined it from every angle and then noticed there were a dozen of small buttons and switches hidden inside and on the border.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they for?\" He wondered as he kept holding it.<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, God only talked about the gold and silver ones on the exterior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasayoshi sat on the couch next to him to have a closer look, forgetting about the recent embarrassing moments and his still hard cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, this switch here is pointing to a letter... I think it's a C?\" The brown haired man pointed at it.<br>\r\n\"No, I think is a G... The G of Growth! I bet this activates the growth of the Samurai Transformation!\"<br>\r\n\"Do you think so?\"<br>\r\n\"What other thing could a G means? And I bet if we turn it off, you will shrink back to your old size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasayoshi thought maybe his was being a little too bold with this, but his enthusiasm was contagious, so accepted. \"Surely God wouldn't put a dangerous button in my helmet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after changing the position of the switch he put the device on his head and, with his cock still pointing his face, pressed the gold button.</span></div></div>",

The bare feet of his companion grew too, gaining several sizes in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Goto stayed trapped, hold tightly against the other's body, he could notice how his already impressive hard cock began to pulse and extend even more, from the space over the navel to the upper row of his inflating 6-pack (which were becoming an 8 pack). The mere sensation of growing and friction of growing against Goto's body, was enough to ejaculate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white stream get both of them dirty. The growth spur ceased, and the 20 year old manchild recovered his sensed and released his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ah... ah... I think...\" He said as he pants for breath. \"I grew more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenius. He said that with his chin over Goto's head. He was 203cm tall (6'8\"). The blurry letter of the switch they had turned off was the C of 'Clothes'. Switching it off that disabled the materialization of the Samurai Flamenco's uniform, so he simply grew totally naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fucked up with that idea...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's pretty cool.

Like his body was being forced into a position against its will, his eyes fluttering open. Then he saw exactly what was wrong as he eyes grew wide. Four straps of rope tying each limb to a side of the bed. \"Why am I tied up!?\" The answer to that question immediately appeared from above, landing on Tsunas stomach with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciaossu.\" Said Reborn as he talked to his student, a small vial of unknown substance in one hand and his gun in the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I tied up Reborn!?\" the sheepish boy asked as he feebly tried to escape from the ropes, the act useless without his X-Gloves to harness Flames of the Sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to take being the future Neo Vongola Primo seriously. I've been too lax on you. To be honest your lack of physical strength is a ptoblem I've let go for too long and will definitely put you in danger in the future.\" Reborn put the gun on Tsunas flat stomach as he pulled out a unique bullet. He poured the fluid, a golden brown substance, onto it. The bullet absorbing the content that poured upon it. Now shining a golden brown, Reborn put away the vial for a later dose to use on Tsuna. His goal for Tsuna wanting more once he realizes the success of the first dose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will that make me change my mind Reborn?!

Dopamine levels rising as Reborn put away his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets see you take your place by dominating your Guardians.\" Reborn proclaimed as he watched Tsuna be in a blissful daze, releasing the ropes that bind him so Tsuna can grow unrestrained. \"Ryohei Sasagawa, Takeshi Yamamoto, and Hibari Kyoya. Three guardians for you to defeat and conquer and getting the worship of the masses\" Reborn had plan to include Gokudera, but Reborn realized he'd quickly submit and defeat the point of his training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished up as he removed everything save for Tsunas boxers, being the sole clothes that will survive the change. With his work done for now Reborn left the room and heads downstairs. \"I wonder what Nana made for breakfast.\" Reborn mused as he thought up an easy lie about why Tsuna won't be eating breakfast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Really, it was a lovely breakfast Nana made that day. Meanwhile, Tsuna was busy moaning, the power of the Super Soldato coursing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own heart started pumping faster and faster, blood pumping through it at an increasingly fast rate. Sweat poured down his brow, as his body was coated in a light sheen of it. Tsuna's moans increased, as an added consequence of the increased blood flow, as slowly, a tent formed in his boxers, the added pleasure driving him insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a very impressive tent, but as the Soldato formula saturated his body, that was very quickly fixed. Tsuna gripped his sheets tightly as it began to pulse, and slowly, his not as impressive member began to grow, his tent increasing in size, even as his balls bulged underneath it. He thrusted his hips involuntarily, as the sensation overwhelmed him, easily triple the size of what he had formerly, even as the front of his boxers began to be soaked from his pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, his muscles began to pulse as well, bones cracking as they slowly extended. \"Ah!\" Tsuna cried out, as with a violent pulse, the muscles in one arm blew out as it entended violently, easily as long as is his body now. The enlarged veins swiftly traveled over, as one pec ballooned, then the other, followed quickly by his other arms. Slowly but the surely, the growth went south, abs developing when there used to be none, and his legs began to lengthen with a crack, thighs growing as they ripped the legs of his boxers open, calves forming into that beautiful diamond shape. Even his feet became more manly, forming into the perfect base for the god-like soldier he had become, even as the rest of his body got into proportion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned as his length had become large enough to slip out from his dying boxers, slowly scotching over his chest, leaving a thin trail of pre-release over it, one hand reached over to gently grab it, just as his legs reached over his bed. And still he grew, hard as diamond.</span></div></div>",

The discomfort of his body needing to readjust as it was growing size, one arm soon followed and fell down upon the ground as a wide and thickening back filled the bed. The other continued to gently stroke his cock.Tsuna's face showed discomfort even though the formula was not yet finished, the shrinking bed ruining his joytime as his cock nestled at the bottom of his pecs as pre still softly spilled forth. Once his boxers tore and his  legs hit a nearby bookcase his rest would have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... this bed....*Yawn* feels aweful.\" A groggy Tsuna spoke as he slowly sat up. moving his free hand off the floor to rub his tired eyes. As his vision became focused Tsuna caught sight of his body and gasped. \"What the..!?\" He responded quickly to stand up only for his head to collide into the roof, cracks forming his empowered skulls impact, followed by a a loud *Crunch* as his bed collapsed under the weight of the now 7'9 ft. (2.36 m) Behemoth known as Tsuna. \"Whoa!\" Tsuna normally expected to fall in such a situation, but the formulas enhanced control of his bodies reflexes allowed him to land on his feet unharmed. \"That was lucky!\" Tsuna sighed in relief as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna took in the sight of his grown body, his hands traveling across his newly grown muscles, blushing as he felt his new cock that nestled itself on his six pack abs. '<i>'What caused this? That's right! It was Reborn! He shot me with some weird stuff!'' </i>Tsuna thought in frustration. Yet at the same time he was feeling...enthralled by his new physique. A warmth like a flame filling every cell of his form. Telling Tsuna to grow, dominate, rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tsuna's temperament kept it under control. The desires brought on by the formula mingled with his thoughts. Confidence, protective, strong, and prideful. Tsuna felt with his newfound confidence what to do. \"I'll make Reborn tell me why he did this and order him to stop. This is the perfect size\" Tsuna lifted an arm to flex a bicep that would have been twenty inches on a normal sized mans body, amplified by over two feet in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moms, Lambo, and Fuuta are downstairs so I best wear something decent at least.\" He knew his clothes wouldnt fit, but his sheet amongst the crumbled bedframe caughtTsunas eye. \"Perfect.\" A quick toga was made by Tsuna as he opened the door' crouching down to get through. The fact that he was so bed would have worried the old him. But the Super Soldato Tsuna felt great about his new size. He walked down the stairs with a low groan of the world as he descended,  hoping to try his moms cooking as Tsunasgrown body needed nourishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he found the entire table clean and the boys were being read a book by Nana at the couch. The four not noticing Tsunas massive form until his shadow covered them. \"Hey mom do you have anything to eat? I'm starving!\" Tsuna smiled as he rubbed his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Nana called out in surprise. Her son had a very big growth spurt! She normally expects mistakes like that because her son was just no-good. \"No wonder you didn't wake up! I'll go fix you a big breakfast alright!\" She turned to the boys:Lambo who had fallen asleep, Fuuta who was covering his eyes and blushing in embarassment as he saw the massive Tsunayoshi Sawada. Reborn just looked on like nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok mama.\" Fuuta and Reborn reply as she got off the couch, her massive son taking her place as she walked over to the kitchen and put the book on a counter. The couch groaning under his weight as he wrappdd an arm around Reborn and Fuuta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you get so big Tsuna-nii?\" Fuuta asked as he slowly started rubbing the bicep wrapped around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reborn can tell us both Fuuta\" Tsuna said as he moved his arm from around Reborn to ruffle the tiny Fuuta's hair. Making him blush even more. Looking down at Reborn, Tsuna smirked. \"So tell me what little scheme you're up to Reborn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReborn smirked as he saw that Tsuna took to a partial amount ofthe formula better than he expected. Nana cooking in the background as she started fixing a massive meal. \"Well let me tell you about the Super Soldato formula...\"</span></div></div>",

Reborn had asked him to check up on Tsuna and Fuuta had agreed as he was wondering what had taken Tsuna so long to come downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuta opened the door of Tsuna's room and was treated to an amazing sight. It was Tsuna, but instead of the scrawny, adorable big brother he was used to there was a sexy, manly version in his place with big muscles and a big dick. Fuuta stared, entranced by the erotic scene of this new Tsuna as he moaned and groped himself, lost in the bliss of growth. Blushing, Fuuta felt compelled to look into Tsuna's new rankings. Taking out his ranking book, Fuuta approached Tsuna.  An eerie presence encompassed the room as gravity weakened its hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunayoshi Sawada, Vongola Decimo and Neo Vongola Primo. Updated rankings to be added to ranking book. Ranking Star indicates that I will receive better rankings with a more hands on investigation of Tsuna-nii's new body.\" Fuuta's blushing smile became a more perverted grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First new ranking, Tsuna-nii's feet.\" Fuuta began massaging Tsuna's huge feet. \"Tsuna-nii's feet appear to have grown longer by 350% and wider by 250%. His toes appear to have grown longer and his feet in general appear to have grown more muscular and flexible.\" Fuuta gave a long slow lick from Tsuna's toes to his thicker ankles. \"According to the Ranking star Tsuna-nii's feet are the 4th largest in the Vongola Family.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2nd updated ranking, Tsuna-nii's legs.\" Tsuna's legs twitched and flexed showing off their impressive size and power. Fuuta's gropes moved upwards and focused on his calves. They were so big Fuuta's hands couldn't cover around half of it. Various veins were visible, but strangely they didn't detract from the appearance at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thighs were even bigger with Fuuta's whole body failing to reach around them. The muscles were highly defined with practically no body fat. The thighs had blown open the legs of the boxers bulged with power and speed. The difference between the size the boxers was meant for and the reality of the man they were on made them seem hilarious. \"Tsuna-nii has the #1 sexiest male legs in the Mafia World.\" Fuuta proudly ranked. \"Tsuna's legs are the 4th largest and longest in the Vongola as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3rd ranking, Tsuna-nii's cock and balls.\" Tsuna let out a sensual moan as Fuuta grabbed one of Tsuna's huge grapefruit sized balls. His sack was stretched tight over them with his boxers leaving nothing to the imagination. Fuuta gave a little squeeze as he fondled the huge nuts and breathed in Tsuna's erotic musk. Gently he moved on to the masterpiece above them. Tsuna's new cock was enormous with large bulging veins winding themselves all around it. The head leaked pre over Tsuna's 10 pack abs giving them the appearance of being oiled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuta worshipped Tsuna's cock, giving long strokes and licks. He gave the head special attention  and drank down Tsuna's precum like a man dying of thirst. With all his licking and sucking along with the pleasure Tsuna was already feeling it wasn't long before he blew his load all over Fuuta's face. Fuuta drank down what he could but it easily overwhelmed him. \"Tsuna nii has the #1 best tasting dick, cum, and precum in the world. He is also the #1 most virile man in the world.\" He happily ranked. \"At 18 inches long and 10 inches around hard, Tsuna-nii has the 3rd biggest cock in the Vongola.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4th ranking, Tsuna-nii's torso.\" He happily lapped up the precum that spilled all over the defined abs and licked the heavily defined muscles there as well. Tsuna's 10 pack could only be called perfect, both in size and appearance. His amazing v taper went down from a back wider than a doorframe to a tight 33 inch waist. His obliques were highly visible and very lickable as Fuuta found out. Tsuna's pecs were a show all on their own. Super thick, his cleavage could fit his old hand between them. Large dusky nipples pointed downwards as his chest rose and fell with his breaths. Fuuta sucked on these as his arms groped at his bro's huge pecs. They struggled to make an impact on the super dense muscle but he wasn't complaining. His arms were massive, with biceps bigger than his head and constantly flexing as the growth left him in a daze. His powerful forearms were highly muscular and numerous veins webbed though his arms. Fuuta's tongue traced some of the veins before licking Tsuna's deep armpits. \"Tsuna has the 4th largest pecs in the Vongola, but the #1 best looking abs and back. His arms are the 4th largest in the Vongola as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly, Tsuna's overall all ranking. Tsuna is the #1 sexiest mafioso in the Vongola and is one of the most handsome men in the world.\" Fuuta gave his final assessment as the gravity distortion died down and Tsuna started to waken from his growth.</span></div></div>",

He licked his lips, tasting his big brother's seed that was still leaking from his lips. He wiped his mouth with his hand, gathering the white mess on his fingers, and slowly licking them to savor the nice, salty flavor. His mood was interrupted as his stomach suddenly growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped it as it shuddered violently, sweat rolling down his brow. What happened was that the Super Soldato formula which had evolved Tsuna into his new Super New Primo form had not yet finished, still not yet metabolized, and was still in his body, and in his seed, which Futa had just taken a heaping dose and bath in. Now it was busy making him into a messenger worthy of the Vongola boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's... going on? Tsuna-nii?\" Futa asked confused at what was going on, as the heat started concentrating on one area to start. He leaned back against the wall, especially as he started feeling his blood heading south. He looked down as he saw his tent start to pulse and bulge larger. He moaned as his already small pants quickly ran out of room. Before long, he heard a plink as his button shot right off. \"Ah!\" He gasped as he still continued growing, and at that point, he felt the growth hit full on in his balls, and with a sudden burst, their expansion coupled with his rod's growth completely ripped the front to shreds. He looked down as he realized his new size, and instinctively his ranking activated. \"At 15 inches long and 8 inchces around, I have the 5th biggest cock in the Vongola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitantly gripped it in his hand, and found he couldn't even grip half-way. That problem didn't last long as his body heated up, and he's watching as his hand grows double in size, easily able to grip his new member, even as it leaked pre all over the carpet. In a flash, he grunts as his arm shot out in length, becoming easily adult-length in size, his sleeve only coming to his elbow, then the muscle followed, lithe muscle building over, and completely ripping his sleeve to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds his body was shooting up, bones cracking as his height caught up with his arms, his pecs ripping his shirt down the middle, and with a single flex of his new muscles was left completely bare-chested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs followed as his legs ripped his pants legs open, and the rips traveled up his pants to the seat of his pants, the new muscle flexing dramatically. With a flex of his cheeks, he felt his pants give up, even as he moves his hands down to feel his new ass, thrusting his hard dick forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving forward, he walked up to Tsuna's mirror, looking at his new appearance. He blinked in awe, as he realized he looked like his future self Tsuna described once. Although he admired himself as he saw he had about the musculature of a swimmer, but he was hung like a small horse. His face looked a lot older, more mature as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Any thoughts were interrupted as he heard a massive yell coming from Tsuna's bed. He watched as Tsuna's pecs shot up a rank, his 10 pack looking like a cobblestone road, even as his thighs ripped up his boxers, completely up to the elastic. Futa slowly ran his hand down his own cock, enjoying the pleasure as he watched the real life growth porn. *Snap!* Futa watched in awe as the elastic of the cloth fell down, completely leaving Tsuna nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Futa's eyes, he watched as Tsuna continued to grow, while he stroked faster and faster, panting heavily. Tsuna's cock began to pulse, veins throbbing as it began to surge just a bit bigger, 4 or 5 more inches getting added on, even as Tsuna stood up, head almost starting to brush against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hngh!\" Futa grunted, as the sight was too much, as his balls pulsed heavily. Spurt after spurt of cum poured out, the force of his new release driving him crazy, even as Tsuna looked down at him, eyes slowly clearing, almost resembling his Hyper Dying Will mode, as he grinned at Futa.</span></div></div>",

Osomatsu and four of his younger brothers sought to satisfy their insatiable greed. Two brothers, however, had chosen to remain home. Albeit for different reasons that would lead the world to a Matsupocalypse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth youngest brother, Ichimatsu, was hanging out in the brothers smaller rooms with the glass door leading outside open. Ichi was on his knees smiling with the same droopy eyes as he waved a cat wand. A pack of cats were before him, being his reason to show his seldom seen smile. Some were eating the tuna he left before them. Others were swinging their frontpaws towards the wand toy he held before them. \"I wish I could afford to take you all in.\" he said in his usual low voice as he showed the stray cats affection. BBBRRRIIIIINNNGGG! BBBRRRIIIIINNNGGG! The doorbell began to ring for several minutes, worrying Ichimatsu for a second that the cats would flee. Thankfully they ignored it and continued to eat and play. Thank goodness. <i>I'd kill Karamatsu if that thing he was waiting for scaring my cats.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring Ichimatsus time for cat affection, his older brother Karamatsu was at the front door, getting the package he longed for. \"Uh here's your package sir.\" the deliveryman said nervously as he got a look at Kara's outfit. Incredibly small shorts and a glittering blue tank top with Kara's face on it. The embodiment of gaudy. Kara briefly pulled off his sunglasses to look at the man, his normally small eyes now big and wide. \"Thanks my honey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh okay sir. Sign this.\" The man asked as he hoped to get away from this weirdo by pulling out the pen to sign the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Karamatsu proceeded to sign the papers and take the package in. Kicking the door shut with his foot while posing. <i>The power of this concetrated divine kimchi will make me irresistible to all.</i> He smugly smirked as he posed with his hands, dropping the package. Instead of worrying over his mistake he confidently did a second pose before picking it up. <i>Best hide this from the others. I want them all to see and praise me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaramatsu walked over to the room Ichimatsu was in, kicking the door open. \"Meow!\" Instantly the strays began to run off through the glass door. \"No don't go!\" Ichimatsu gloomily called to them as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello <i>brrrottther</i>.\" Karamatsu cheerfully spoke to Ichi as he posed with one hand in front of his face. \"I didn't know you were here\" Kara as he beamed proudfully, moving back towards the door to leave. \"You aren't mad about such a minor thing right brother?\" Ichimatsus body tensed as his body was engulfed in a puff of smoke as grey fur and cat ears appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Die SHITTYMATSU!\" The now cat Ichimatsu yelled as he jumped forward with claws ready at Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ICHIMATSU!\" he yelled as Ichimatsu ripped apart the package with his first claw strike. The contents thst fell upon the floor revealed to be sealed in a fancy gold and blue jar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's this?\" Ichimatsu reached down and examined the jar. \"Is this why Shittymatsu messed up my time with the kittens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not important brother! Just some sweet lotion I bought online.\" Sweat quickly drenched Kara's head and onto his su glasses as he tried to lie, desperate that the brother most sadistic to him wouldn't see through it. His smile, however, broke that facade by dissapating from his face andd replaced with a panicked look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sadistic grin crossed Ichimatsu's feline face as he puffed bacl into his normal appearance. He knew it was important to Karamatsu, which makes using it on himself all the sweeter. He pulled off the lid before holding it over his own head, turning it down to release a golden orange liquid engulf him and his purple sweater. Tossing it across the room once emptied, the bore pointing upwards as it landed on a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! My dreams of being irresistible!\" Karamatsu sobbed in aguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchimatsu's upper half was drenched from the liquid as he gave Karamatsu a death glare. \"Now to make you properly pay\" Cracking his fist as he walked over to Karamatsu who had fallen to the floor. A burning feeling started to well up across his body, which he assumes to be righteous wrath. His sweater slowly began to fill out as muscle began to form underneath. His non-existant biceps now big enough to see when flexed, and his visible thickening neck as veins pumped blood to them....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an unbearably hot, sweaty sunday in the Villa Rosa Sasazuka apartment. The former Demon King lays in his orange shirt and white shorts upon the floor with his eyes closed. Beads of sweat slowly trailing down his head from the heat. <i>''This heat is unbearable''</i> Sadao thought as he tugged at his shirt as sweat started to wet it. <i>Of course it wouldn't be as bad if someone hadn't spend my money on random shit.</i> He turned to where Lucifer, also known Hanzo Urushihara sat surfing the web on his computer. Maou opened his red eyes and glared with lethal intent towards the fallen angel NEET.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel your animosity.\" Lucifer spoke in a bored tone as he continued to look for things to buy with Maou's money. He took a sip of his drink as he bought something that would easily consume most of Maous next paycheck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch.\" Maou turned the other way to look at the table where the wrappings from his MgRonalds lunch remain, some of his works leftovers he tends to take home. Ashiya had left to buy groceries on sale with what little money they had left, his hope of a air conditioner dashed during the heat wave that will haunt them for the next few weeks. <i>''Regardless. I know the perfect way to get back at Lucifer'</i>' He turned towards the door, his plan to mess with Lucifers products as punishment for his actions. All he had to wait for is the item to be dropped off. He got up briefly to open the fridge and get a drink before returning to his spot and sitting at the table. He pushed over the trash to let Ashiya throw it away later as he took off the lid, staring at the door as he took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the black haired demon turned human had underestimated how long it would take, falling asleep after an hour. Maou rested his head between his arms, his orange shirt now drenched from sweat. His dreams overflowing with hope of taking his demon form at any time and putting his lazy general in his place. Then moving onwards to ruling humanity in an efficient and practical manner before retaking Ente Isla and leading his demonic brethren to glory once more.  Emi now forced to work for him at her call center to teach people how to properly praise the glory of Lord Satan, her face beet red and puffed up in eternal frustration. Lucifer forced into eternal paperwork as his demonic salaryman as punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock Knock*! Maou groggily rubbed his eyes as he heard the sound coming from the door, his eyes half-opened as he tried to stay awake. He saw Lucifer getting up and heading for the door, oblivious to Maou being awake. A small rectangular package was handed over from what Maou could see as Lucifer signed the paper as Hanzo, closing the door and heading back to his area in the apartment. An arrogant smirk crossed Hanzo's face as he worked to rip open the package to expose its contents. Maou slowly regained his senses from his tired state as he watched, making sure to not let out a peep to ruin the surprise he has in store for Urushihara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo pulled out the contents from within it. The item looked like a white angel with its twelve wings spread out. It was nude but lacked anything to give it a resemblance to gender. Only a single eye that lays at the center of its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo thought aloud over what he remembered this objects purpose. \"Now if I remember correctly; what I heard about this from the other angels in Ente Isla<br>\r\n I have to make it clear I want power when breaking this repository for magic to absorb it.\" Hanzo was clearly bored by the idea of remembering it, as he found his brethren insufferable with their driven attitudes when he'd rather laze around and do nothing. \"And this worlds near disappearance of magic means it likely has a near bottomless supply of it and I'll make Maou and Ashiya obey me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Maou quickly got up and plucked the statue from the purple haired angels clutches before he could notice his conscious presence \"So this is what you planned to do with something bought with <b>my</b> money!\" A cocky smile cross his face as he looked down at Hanzo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you didn't hear all that did y-you?\" The fallen angel stuttered with nervous fear as he realized that his scheme to be their NEET overlord had been foiled before it could begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the statue in his right hand as he prepared a fist with his left \"I did. So sleep tight.\" with that Maou punched Hanzo in the face, knocking him out as gave him a black eye. The fallen angel fell on his open laptop and a cracking sound could be heard. \"Tsk. Tsk. That laptop better still work as I won't allow you to get another one anytime soon Hanzo.\" With that Maou took the statue over to the other side of the room and near the fridge and front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets put you to good use little statue.\" He held the statue in both hands as he raised them above his head. Following Lucifers words, Satan yelled out \"Grant me your power!\" throwing it at the ground, cracking in two as it split evenly down the middle, a mass of swirling magic, both golden like the angels and black like the demons, swirling together in a small ball as it spout from the crack. <i>''Smaller than expected. Figures Lucifer spent my money on nothi-''</i> The swirling ball surged forth into Sadao's chest and sent him flying backwards into the wall, his body floating in place on the flat surface. Thud! The black and gold force surged forth into his body. Energy rivaling the combined might of all archangels flowing into him with every passing second. Maous senses were overwhelmed by the energy, which despite being very painful, also felt oddly comfortable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours passed before it eventually died down, the ball disappearing as the last drop of enery flew from its former circular shape into the Demon King. With a heavy thud his body dropped to the floor, Maou unconscious.</span></div></div>",

He was still unsuccessful, but he could at least hope that Maou would someday find something... He could hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately noticed something was out of place. First off, he noticed that Urushihara was lying down, on top of his laptop, completely unconscious. He smirked at that. With the luck the blasted thing was broken. So much saved money...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, he noticed some shattered glass near the fridge, muttering under his breath about ungrateful demons and cleaning up their mess. He noticed however, something lying near it, and- \"Your majesty!\" He yelled, noticing Maou, unconscious. He rushed over, and found nothing wrong. He must have just fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he lifted Maou up, slightly thinking that he seemed heavier than he both remembered and thought. He set up Maou's bed, and laid him down, before walking off, although he turned back, thinking something was off. Looking at Maou more intently, eyes traversing into the magical realm, as he looked at Maou's magic. There seemed to be more than he thought, but he supposed Maou hadn't used any for once. He walked off, unaware of what was going on, as he went to bed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Maou woke up, slightly disoriented. He got up, and wandered into the bathroom, vision clearing. He prepared to take a shower, slipping his shirt off, leaving him only in his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he could see clearly, he realized, 'Whoa! Where did that come from?' He thought, eyes opening wide, as he took himself in. He wasn't the fittest guy in the world in his regular form, but now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis base form was fairly unimpressive, but now, he actually had a developing pack of abs now. Even his pecs were starting to gain some definition. 'Is this from the statue?' He wondered, as he lifted his arm up, giving it a light text flex, watching as his bicep surged bigger. Once he stopped, it seemed to stay bigger too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped back, admiring what changes had occured in him, turning every which way, looking at his front, his back, even his legs. He chuckled happily though as he cupped his front. At least it got some gains too! His self-love session was cut short though, when he realized the time. He was gonna be late for work! His eyes widened as he quickly got dressed, his MgRonald's shirt tighter on him than he remembered, but couldn't be helped as he rushed out.</span></div></div>",

Damn it Lucifer!\u201d He yelled, zipping around to dodge a car who hit the brakes just as he crossed in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy! Watch it!\u201d The driver yelled as Sadao cycled past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet human!!\u201d He roared, leaving the driver somewhat confused. Maou blinked as well, somewhat confused at his own language. Usually he kept his cover up pretty well. He shook his head, \u201cMust be stress\u2026\u201d He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was actually moving pretty fast, his muscles under his legs flexing as the pushed him faster and faster. And before long, he arrived at MgRonald\u2019s, Sadao barely even breaking a sweat as his brakes squealed to a stop, arriving with five minutes even to spare. \u201cMan, I feel great!\u201d He said as he got off, giving a small stretch to get the stiffness out of his legs. One girl swooned at the sight of his legs, his pants, already somewhat tight regularly, now looking like they were almost painted on, legs like a cyclist sticking through, not to mention a decent bulge. \u201cAlright! Time to get to work!\u201d He said as he waited for his manager to let him in, since it was almost opening time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Maou-san! Perfect timing!\u201d His manager walked up, who was getting everything ready as well. \u201cUnfortunately, Chiho-san isn\u2019t coming in today, and we\u2019re having a sale today, so it\u2019s going to be just you today at the register.\u201d Maou groaned at the news. That just meant today was going to be even busier\u2026 \u201cHm, Maou-san, have you been working out lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou just looked confused at that. \u201cNot really, I\u2019ve put on a little muscle though.\u201d He didn\u2019t realize how much more muscle he\u2019d put on, almost looking like he was just starting professional swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis manager nodded. \u201cEither way, keep it up, and good luck!\u201d He said as he walked off to open the door. Maou just adjusted his hat, and manned the register. \u201cEmployee of the month bonus, here I come!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====x====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt definitely started off slowly enough, since the lunch chaos had yet to come. \u201cAlright, two Mgronald\u2019s combos and an extra side of fries. Would you like anything else with your order?\u201d He asked, putting his usual cheery smile on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, I wouldn\u2019t like anything else, except maybe a side of you too.\u201d His female customer purred, making Maou blush a little bit. He\u2019d been getting these flirts all day, from both female and male customers. And there seemed to be no end in sight! He licked his lips slightly, as the amount of lust they were giving off was boosting his magic reserves slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe adjusted his waistband, which seemed to be digging slightly into his side. His shirt seemed to be wrapped around his body, his pecs slowly starting to protrude from his chest. His leg muscles were pulling at his pants as well, the lines of his muscles showing through the thin fabric. He wasn\u2019t quite aware of this, even as it wrapped around his nice ass, even as his front bulged heavily as well, giving a smooth hint as to the monster contained within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he did know was that he had just made it, right when someone gave him a nice pinch, right on his ass, making him jump. \u201cOy! Who did that!\u201d He muttered, a nearby table of women giggling as he walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess I grabbed the wrong buns.\u201d The head female giggled as Maou rolled his eyes yet again. Honestly\u2026 people these days\u2026 he thought, as his manager approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Maou-san, thank you for all your effort you\u2019ve been putting in today, but ah, certain things are a bit\u2026 distracting.\u201d He said, making Maou rub his head sheepishly. \u201cSo here,\u201d he pulled out a bit of cash, handing it to Maou. \u201cIf you could please buy some ah, larger clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, but I can\u2019t leave my shift.\u201d Maou said, his clothes slowly getting tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem, we still have a bit before the lunch crowd, so I\u2019ll cover for you. But please be quick.\u201d His manager said. \u201cWe have a spare shirt as well in a larger size. Just use that when you get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou just shrugged as he quickly left the building, heading for the nearby second-hand clothing store. He was walking very fast, so he didn\u2019t even notice as he passed by Emi who was heading off to her own work. \u2018Maou?\u2019 she thought as she walked by. But she dismissed it, she was running late for work herself, although something seemed off about him, but she didn\u2019t have time to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou quickly scanned for a pair of pants to grab, getting one in a larger size after briefly making sure they fit, ignoring the drooling cashier, but he had some trouble when he bent down to pick something up, as the seat of his pants ripped behind him, much to his embarrassment, and delight of the customers behind him. \u201cJust pretend you didn\u2019t see anything\u2026\u201d He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, he was back at MgRonald\u2019s, his manager telling him to hurry as he went to the company restroom to change, while he tried to shield the hole in the back of his pants, showing off his yellow boxers. Finally getting a breather, he pulled his shirt off to change it, turning around as he unbuttoned his ruined pants, and paused. \u201cWhoa, what the heck happened!\u201d He muttered as he looked at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormerly, his body had barely any muscle definition, and even this morning, still was rather lacking. But now, what he had was something any man (or demon) could be proud of, not to mention what he was wielding down below. His bulge starting to hang down from its size, pulling the lip of his boxers down, which had grown tighter around his lower torso and legs. His body still fell short of what he had in his natural demon form, but still, he had pecs now, jutting a little bit out of his chest, while his faint abs had turned into a beautifully defined 6-pack. \u2018Alciel could probably do our laundry on these\u2026\u2019 He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs had gotten a small boost as well, his calves looking like they had a small baseball in them, his thighs getting a similar boost. He turned around and had to admit he had a nice ass too, able to see even through his boxers. He gave a small squeeze, grinning as he felt the resistance there, even as he started moving his hands over his body. Did the statue do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving his pecs a small squeeze as well, the muscle bulging slightly under his hand, he admired himself, eyes starting to cloud over as his hands slowly slid across his abs down towards his enhanced bulge, the fabric starting to tent as well as his body pulsed slightly bigger. \u201cMaou, hurry up!\u201d His manager\u2019s voice rang out as he interrupted Maou from his self-loving session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap! What am I doing, I\u2019ve gotta get back to work!\u201d He said as he quickly pulled on his shirt, although he struggled with his pants, trying to fit his bulge in. \u201cCome on, behave little guy!\u201d He yelled as he finished buttoning them, as he rushed back out to deal with the building lunch crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====x====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou grinned as he took his umpteenth order of the day today. So many people wanted their special today, and with a little bit of magic as well, the people were gorging themselves on their food, and he was getting so much magic from their gluttony! Problem was he was still having clothing problems, but his manager was too busy to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, even he had to realize he was growing, which had to mean Lucifer\u2019s little statue worked. Problem was, the growing was making it hard to work as his clothing got tighter and tighter. He\u2019d already had to adjust his belt twice. And as nice as it was, his bulge was making it hard to move, restricting the space his thighs had to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the thing is, he was getting a lot of lust magic as well, a lot of people treating him like eye candy, and even with his new outfit, it was already starting to get tight. He\u2019d already reached up to scratch the back of his head, and he ripped the sleeve of his shirt, which made more than a few customers pass out with a nosebleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo add on to the problem more, he was having to reach further down when he needed to grab something, which meant he was slowly getting taller too! He\u2019d realized that his pants weren\u2019t covering as much of his ankles as they did, and he was running out of shoe space as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou was trying to figure out what to do, but the new lunch shift came in, \u201cHey Maou, boss wants me to relieve you for lunch. Better make it fast though!\u201d he said as he gave Maou a second look, \u201cHave you been working out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou just rolled his eyes, \u201cA bit. Thanks.\u201d He said, as he let his coworker take over, Maou applying an extra spell of hunger on everyone for an extra measure. He walked towards the breakroom in the back, struggling a bit from the extra space his junk took up, his new clothing starting to grow tight as well. \u2018The more magic I get, the bigger I must grow\u2026\u2019 He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as he reached it there though, he heard his manager say, \u201cCongratulations everyone! You\u2019ve been selected for an extra deal! Anyone who purchases another set of fries in the next 30 min will receive an extra 500 yen off their next purchse! Offer only valid for the next 30 minutes.\u201d At that point, chaos was unleashed as everyone charged towards the cash register, eager to satisfy their new hunger, and save a bit on their wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this now meant the lust, gluttony, and now greed magic flowing in towards Maou. Not as effective as fear, but it still worked. He moaned as he felt himself growing bigger, his belt breaking as his button burst open, exposing his boxers as his shirt ripped up the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was torn between keeping his job, and rubbing one off as he struggled to keep his hard-on down in vain, the foot-long monster poking out the lip of his boxers as his hands dig into the table, his gritted teeth growing sharper canines. If this didn\u2019t stop soon, he's gonna be in trouble...</span></div></div>",

Which only exasperated his situation as his body inched ever upwards and his hard on needed release. <i>It'd be worse if Chiho was here though. She'd be touching me every chance she got.</i> he thought to Chiho who thankfully had today off. Dodging one bullet. So now he was working with someone he didn't know. And it seemed he was just as perverted considering he was trying to grope Maou's body despite the growing fear that seeped from him and made Maou grow even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully their manager entered the front and saw that the taller, strapping, and well hung Maou Sadao was very much a different one from the one who entered Mgronalds earlier. She had dismissed it earlier and had him by closed just to pretend that the changes she saw weren't there. Now, however, the changes were too hard to dismiss. But to see the restaurant filled with way more satisfied customers than normal eating to their hearts content meant he was clearly doing something right. That majestic and mighty beast of a rod would definitely be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Cough* I'll take over for you again Maou. Go to the back and *ahem* handle that as it is clearly frustrating you.\" Her intent was clear from the moment she said it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! If I keep taking breaks I can't-\" Maou's face turned red from embarassment as his unnamed coworker quickly grabbed Maou's hand and pulled him to the locker room before he could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully it's almost nighttime so he can go home and deal with <i>whatever</i> is going on.\" She spoke under her breath, not helped she found him to be pretty attractive as well to her surprise.. The customers let out a resounding *Siiiggghhh* of disappointment as he left and more customers entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===In the changing room===<br>\r\nMaou was still embarrassed as this coworker he didn't even know the name of brought him back here to help him get release. <i>\"So many good things with this magic yet so many downsides as well.\"</i> The might demon lord bemoaned in his own thoughts. <i>\"And I'm desperate enough to get release from someone I don't even know.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to lock the door, Maou watched as his cowroker pulled down his boxers to let out the foot long cock. His lust crazed coworker licked his lips. \"My girlfriend doesn't need to know\" The coworker spoke with a blush as he happily took the cock in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tongue began to lick the bottom happily as his mouth worked to please Maou. Moau moaned as he felt the pleasure rising. Grabbing his unnamed coworkers by the hair he felt him work even harder to staisfy as he began to gently cup and caress the demon lord's balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes human. Just like that. Show your master all your attention\" Maous voice became rougher as he closed his with each word as the pleasure began a metamorphosis of his human form. His clothes began to completely tear as his body start to rise higher. The pleasure sent duch an intense desire through his body and nerves he failed to notice a set of full grown, equal dragon like horns start to emerge from his skull. Tiny nubs at first soon gave way to larger and more impressive horns that he could even use to impale someone who crossed him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall wings erupted from his trapezius as new nerves, muscle, and bone was made to connect the two. They began instinctively flapping off unsightly blood from its emergence against the wall. Slowly they grew more and more with eacgh passing second till both were each as long as Maou's current 7 foot height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange black markings moved moved across his bulging tree trunk thighs down to his feet, an ominous green outline across them as they trailed distinct patterns across both. His arms received the least change so far, his nails becoming sharper and a translucent substance that gently wrapped around both limbs as some kind of protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the growing beast of a demon was nearly the ceiling, his little coworker not noticing amything and struggling to continue lovingly suck the now 2 foot 6 inch monster cock. Maou's magic making sure the person could survive having such a thing in their mouth and a mouth capable of expanding wide enough to receive it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get your girlfriend involved next time and I can make her sqeual for me!\" Maou gruffed with his deep voice as he heard a \"Mmf-~\" from the guy he didn't care to know the name of. Likely a yes since he was working harder than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen like a geyser erupting a massive surging *GUSH* of enchanted semen flowed down his throat, not a single drop falling out. Slowly opening his eyes Maou began to speak \"Nice job but I hope you are ready for round tw-\" And in the mirror was an 8 foot tall massive demon man pumped with more muscle than he's ever had \"Shit\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maou moaned as he struggled with his hard cock, as he hunched over the break table, his muscles and throbbing erection making an already tenuous situation even harder. The amount of magic he was getting from the people was fueling his growth, making him grow even faster. He bit his lip and felt a bit of blood drip down, as he realized his canines had grown sharper, more lethal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Mmm, I need to stop this, but it just feels soo good!\u2019 Maou thought as he finally gave into the temptation, reaching down and giving his throbbing cock the strokes it desired. His pants were now riding up further as they wrapped around his calves, the legs starting to rip as the muscles grew larger and larger. He grunted as he felt the seat of his pants rip open, his boxers pulled tight around his rounded ass, instinctively clenching tight. He was already a couple inches higher, his shirt riddled with tears, his muscle bulging as his pecs slowly protruded more inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready he had another problem as well, his slitted eyes looking down, drool leaking out the side of his mouth as he saw his giant shaft slowly extend further and further with each beat of his heart, slowly forcing his giant hand apart. He added his other hand as he held it up, watching with lust as it slowly inched upwards, reaching past the mid-row of his abs, leaking seed all over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of seed, he moaned as he felt his seed-makers throb, pulsing bigger and bigger as they bulged through his boxers, and within seconds, he grunted as he felt them rip through, the thick balls groaning with seed landing with a thump on the table, already the size of soccer balls and growing fast, his cock reaching his lower pecs now, almost 2 feet long now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe panted as he wrapped both hands around his thick demonhood, leaning down as it grew another 6 inches, tongue reaching down and giving his bulging head a lick, his sharp teeth giving small little nips that sent shivers down his spine. He could feel a brief tickle in his ears as they grew pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that someone looked past the cashier to see Maou in the back and their eyes grew wide, as they said something to the cashier. \u201cOy, is that guy alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier turned around, and his eyes went wide as well, as he looked at his formerly human coworked, \u201cUh, Maou-san?\u201d He said nervously, fear evident in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of all the emotions and desires that can gain magic, fear is the most potent, and fear was starting to spread among the customers now. And it was hitting Maou in full force as he felt his growth accelerating, bones cracking as he felt another surge in his cock, the massive rod shooting up to a full three feet of cock. His biceps were bulging now as his shoulders ripped his sleeves to pieces, the table starting to creek under his beach ball sized balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flex, the rest of his shirt burst open as well, his rippling back muscles fully exposed as the tattered pieces of his shirt fell to the ground, Maou shooting up another foot as his pants were slowly turned into a pair of shorts. His pants ripped open further, the side seems bursting open and exposing his thighs. \u201cMmm, yess, give me more!!\u201d He roared, catching the attention of everyone else as well as they caught notice of the growing demon in their midst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-monster!!\u201d Someone yelled as people took notice. \u201cRun for it!\u201d An older lady cried out as people began running out in a panic, fear overtaking all of them. The fear flooding into him, and he looked down as his right arm pulsed larger, the muscles doubling in size as veins throbbed, blood pumping fiercely through them as his bicep alone reached the size of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed as the growth carried over into his other arm, balancing him out as he gave it a satisfactory flex. His body started glowing with a dark aura as his shoes finally gave up, his massive feet bursting out, digging groves into the ground, growing in spurts. He arched back as his abs grew thicker, a lower row developing to give him a beautiful 8-pack, deep enough to stick a finger in as his pecs burst out, sticking out at least half a foot from his body, two beautiful mountains that somewhat obscured the view of his lower body. Mostly everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was still in view as his cock pulsed larger, nearly as thick as his old torso, sticking straight up as it nestled itself in between his pecs, reaching his chin, then his eye level, then even further as it surpassed his own head, the cock head a furious red as it dribbled pre all over him. The break table underneath him finally gave up as it collapsed from the weight of his balls, now the size of an exercise ball, letting them flop down to bounce against his knees, the skin stretched tight around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple flex exploded the rest of his pants, the seams failing as his thickening waist ripped them apart, his tree trunk-sized thighs tensing as they supported his massive weight. His last remaining article, his boxers were painted on his body, but his thighs, already competing for space with each other and his balls, ripped the legs apart as the rest gradually rode up his muscled ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, yesss, more!\u201d Maou moaned as his body continued growing larger, grunting slightly as the aura surrounding his body grew darker. A small headache hit him as he felt two golden horns burst from his head, one cut off at the base, but the aura thickened around the area as the horn very quickly reformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden pain hit him in the legs as he felt his toes crunching, the individual digits collapsing into a single hard hoof, his stance adjusting to for the new feet. He didn\u2019t have much to register this as tiny tingling sensations tickled him over his legs, a sudden outgrowth of hair, or rather fur covering his legs as they transformed into a bipedal pair of what resembled goat legs, the growth covering up to about mid-thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, his horns were digging into the ceiling as he bent down to make room, his back rubbing against the ceiling. His features grew sharper, his face becoming more stream-lined as it grew more mature as he finished his transformation into Satan Jacob. \u201cMmm, this building is getting too small!\u201d He said as his growth accelerated, one of his legs shooting into the seating area as the ceiling cracked against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going bow-legged as his endowment continued its growth, easily half his size at that point. \u201cMmmm, it\u2019s time to make my big reveal!\u201d Maou grinned as he flexed his muscles, the ceiling collapsing as his massive body crashed through the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople stopped what they were doing as a horned giant literally ripped his way through the building about twice as tall as the collapsed building, wielding a dick half as large as himself. \u201cMmm, I needed a breath of fresh air!\u201d He moaned as he took one step out of the building, the remainder collapsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh, does this mean you\u2019re not coming back tomorrow?\u201d A small voice rang out, ignored by the towering giant as his manager looked around the rubble, wondering if he could get everything fixed for tomorrow\u2019s sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMass panic ensued as people fled from the naked towering giant as fear flowed from over the entire city. \u201cAh, that\u2019s right humans, give me your fear! Satan Jacob is here!\u201d He roared as his body surged up, his arms no longer able to rest by his side, his lats expanding so much, as his back rippled with muscle. He couldn\u2019t help but moan as he felt his endowment expand again, the massive orbs hanging down to his calves, as his cock doubled in size yet again. His cock was so huge it was starting to fill the avenue underneath, flooding the street with his pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power of fear, together with the infinite magic was working to transform Maou into the most powerful demon the world has ever seen. \u201cWhy stop at Earth, or even Ente Isla, when I can completely conquer the entire universe!\u201d He grinned, as he gave his throbbing rob a lustful squeeze, sending another burst of pre to flood the street, his height slowly approaching a small apartment building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaou! I should have guessed you were up to something!\u201d He turned as he focused on a small person standing on a nearby apartment, slightly taller than himself, seeing the lightly armored, white haired form of Emilia, a fierce look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmilia, come to bow to this world\u2019s new master?\u201d He grinned, turning slightly to make his cock smash against the building she was standing on as his height approached it, his glowing orangish-red eyes at her level, as she blushed slightly at his naked appearance, not to mention the enormous cock hanging out of his crotch, veins throbbing all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike hell I\u2019ll let you, mass destruction, and public indecency! I knew you were going to reveal yourself as the demon you were!\u201d Emi yelled, making Maou laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Like what you see then?\u201d He said as he gave his pecs a minor bounce, Emi having to admit he looked hot, the sheer muscle, and power emanating from Maou\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head as she focused on Maou\u2019s head\u2026 er, the one on his shoulders, totally not the one hanging off his crotch. \u201cBrace yourself Maou!\u201d She yelled as she brandished Better Half, unleashing a brilliant barrage of light magic against Maou. But she wasn\u2019t expecting the blt of light to simply be absorbed into his body. \u201cWha-?\u201d She gasped, \u201cWhat the heck happened?\u201d The power of the statuette had given Maou the ability to absorb any kind of magic, either demonic or holy, and  the problem was, the more magic\u2026 the more growth. Maou moaned as his size shot up drastically, now tall as a skyscraper.\u201cOh, please hit me with more Emi, that feels wonderful!\u201d Maou roared as he grabbed the base of his shaft, thrusting his hips forward, doing his best to fuck the street, until he finally reached his limit, until he burst, his massive balls throbbing as he came, flooding the city with his seed. He grinned as he looked down at the mass chaos, only serving to grow him bigger. \"Ready to serve your new master?\" he boomed down happily.</span></div></div>",

The white haired hero landed on a building behind him, damaged but relatively untouched by Maou's gowing body even as a white flood continued to gush forth and turn part of the city into a growing sea of white. She had to look up to gaze upon his vast black hair head as his form used her holy magic to expand, his wide body easily taking up several streets as hooved feet were covered in white. The newly born Demon God savored it too much to notice the mess dirtied his brawny fur-covered legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pray to your new God humans! I am Satan Jacob! The ruler of demonkind and the new master of your puny dirtball!\" Maou roared as he released his cock from his grip, cockily doing a front double bicep pose for the insects down below. God like biceps that peaked above his massive head. The monstrous world-sepent sized dick following his arms, rising to the heavens beyond Maou's head as it released another monstrous flood, white meteors falling across a part of unblemished Tokyo and crushing buildings beneath their weight with a powerful heavy *PLOP*! The sticky substance stopping concrete and rubble from engulfing the crowds and cars on the streets as itswallowed the buildings whole. The bugs who weren't consumed by the seed trying to flee on foot if they weren't <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS-Satan!\"<br>\r\n\"The end of days have come!\" <br>\r\n\"\"Please God save us!\"<br>\r\n\"Satan's last name is Jacob?\"<br>\r\n\"It's Goji-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYells and cries called out around Tokyo, fear pouring forth to nourish Maou's body with a tinge of lust and envy too! A smirk crossing his face as he felt it continue to come forth. The rush making his body grow larger still, but due to his new 1000 ft height it only added a few feet to his physique. Emi was largely safe behind him, witnessing the disaster as he ignored her. Several drops having destroyed nearby buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever caused this drastic transformation must be countered. I best use all my magic this time before he becomes too much of a threat to Earth and Ente Isla!\" Emi channeled most of her magic into her rapier Better Half, the holy sword ready to use the magic infused to strike its masters foe. Emi popping out a bottle of Holy Vitamin B, she consumed it all in several quick gulps. \"I'll regret the side effects later but for now it'll aid me.\" Emi began to take flight, heading for the nape of Maou's beastly neck to stab it as fast as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaou began to move as she did, a hand moving down to give his godly pillar a loving pat. \"The humans of this world truly are worth keeping. Unlike those bugs in Ente Isla. All this <i>desire</i> feels soooo good~\" Maou moved forward slowly as he did, his hooved feet, combined with his weight had compressed the ground beneath his bulk and leaving colossal hooveprints in his wake. The screams of fear roaring even more as the moving behemoth engulfed them beneath his hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmi quickly reached his thick neck, barely keeping up as the demon lord continued to move forth. His muscles bulging from the smallest of gestures. \"Prepare for death Maou!\" She yelled as as she swung the sword towards him. The tiny speck too inconsequential to the world's new master as her magic channeled into Better Half as she stabbed the nape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that's what she hoped for. The blade never even penetrated his skin, much less the sinew beneath it. \"Damn it.\" She cried out in frustration as she felt all her magic instantly leave her, sapped away by just a single touch on Maou's demonic frame. Her silver hair and gold eyes giving way to red and green. She fell back as Maou sucked her dry of all magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff...huff...huff...What have you become Maou?\"  She questioned his new state as she was safely stationed upon his beefy neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer holy magic was just a decent burst to the now 1250 ft. Demon God. Drool seeped from his mouth as the lust, fear, and holy magic was turning him on even more, yet he was not letting loose. \"Not yet! I can't grow too big until I see my little underlings~\" He took several more steps as he started to loom over the tiny apartment he lived with Ashido and Urushihara awaited. \"I gotta let Lucifer see the results~\"</span></div></div>",

Wrapping his hand in bandages before tying his shoes, Gao speeded off downstairs in hopes of reaching school on time. \"Bye mom, dad, and Grandma!\" he called to his family as he sped towards the door and swiftly left, running at full speed to reach Aibo Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you forgot your-\" Suzumi Mikado called to her son too late as he ran off, leaving behind the breakfast she prepared for him. \"There he goes.

A buddyfight card fell from the pocket of the cloaked being as they collided with the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Rubbing the front of his forehead, Gao opened his eyes and saw the person he bumped into. \"Sorry sir! Didn't mean to do that.\" Quickly he picked up the card as the cloaked figure stood up, brushing off the cloak as Gao held the card out to them. \"Here you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr. Gao Mikado, but those cards were intended for you in the first place.\" The obscured monster spoke as he pushed the hand holding the card back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but for what?\" Gao asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a fan of yours and I wanted to give you this card from Dungeon world.\" The veiled Dungeon World monster said with enthsiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I'd really like to know your name to thank you for this card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not important and I know some would use you to find me. So let this be a secret kay?\" He brought a finger to his obscured face as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Thanks for the card then.\" Realizing he's wasted valuable time as he put the card away as Gao attention turned to what sent him running in the first place. \"Oh no I forgot about school! Thanks!\" he waved as he ran off to Aibo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloaked figure waved as he saw Gao turn in the distance before letting out a sigh of relief. \"Finally I got rid of that card. Being hounded by others who want its power has driven me to a kid.\" He had found the card in the depths of one of Dungeon Worlds fiercest dungeons, only to be hunted down by those seeking its power. He'd finally shaked off purseurs who sought the card after going in disguise and discarding his name. He'd heard of a human on earth who had stopped several threats that threatened the worlds. Giving such a powerful item card to Gao Mikado was his best solution to keeping it out of their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good kid like that certainly couldn't cause much trouble with it. That disaster spreading <i>Permanent Blessing Titan Incarnate</i>\". With that the nameless Dungeon World monster opened a portal and left for Hero world to seek a new identity.</span></div></div>",

He reached one hand down as he caressed Akira's cheek with the other, giving Akira's bulge a little caress. \"You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this.\" He smirked, opening up white coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira moaned as he felt his blood flowing down, his rather average cock erecting, but under Ryo's soft caress, his grip on his seat tightened as he felt it surge slightly, his toes curling as his moans started turning into deeper growls, his canines sharpening. Ryo looked up, Akira's cute face twisted with pleasure as bent down, gladly messing with the button before undoing it, biting the zipper as he pulled it down, Akira's tented boxers showing, the smell of his musk hitting Ryo's nose, moaning as he unzipped his own pants, pulling them down and letting his 8 inches hang out, happily stroking it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira moaned again, Ryo's touch making it grow even more, his eyes gaining dark circles under them as he thrust his hips slightly, the fabric of his tight underpants struggling against his throbbing cock, Ryo smirking as he pulled the tight material down, Akira's 11 and growing inches sticking out. It looked almost comical on his small frame, Ryo smirking as he wrapped his hand around the thick member, giving it a nice stroke, Akira moanied his fingers digging groves into his seat as his muscles started tensing, their relatively small stature starting to swell the more Ryo jerked him off, maneuvering himself on top as he saw down on Akira's growing cock, feeling his cheeks spread around the thick rod. \"Mmm, I don't want this to end at all.

The rod growing thicker as it rose higher on Akira's body, spreading wide Ryo's ass. \"Mmmm! Akira....\" Ryo moaned with eyes shut as he looked up. His lithe form seemed to glow etherial white while Akira became shadowy, dark and light mingling as they continued to engage in carnal pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery thrust raised Akira's demonizing rod a half inch higher, and his tense body slowly tried to catch up as the swelling muscle continued to grow thicker, stronger, and powerful. By 18 inches Akira's body was no had very much surpassed the lithe frame of Ryo's own. A new build rivaling a swimmers, cut abs and toned limbs on his bod as he let out moans, his sweet face changed very little even as his neck thickened. He stuck out his tongue for a sec, now permanently green. \"Ryo...huff...this feels....hufff....so good!\" He happily groaned as his muscles swelled larger as his monsted-cock now easily reached 25 inches, his fingers and feet now thickening as he moved two growing paws to caress the sleek body on top. Despite this he had yet to gain any additional height as he thrusted harder and deeper into Rto. His balls were keeping up the easiest, now the size of cantaloupes and churning with a gallon of white spunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Akira. Feeling you transform into your ideal form is the greatest pleasure.\" Despite how much monstrous-cock filled him, Ryo's body accepted it all. No internal bleeding or damage as two growing hands moved to grab his ass. It was like he was inhuman in nature, accepting and craving Akira even should Akira become a divine darkness that surpassed God himself. Now at 35, Akira's body decided to ramp up the growth, and with it, his stamina. Pre began to ooze inside Ryo as Akira ramped up his thrusting, every thrust becoming more forceful as he soon started gaining a inch, nay, two inches of dick per thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both let out deep, primal growls of joy as Akira began to ram into Ryo with as much force as possible. Less than a minute and his cock had surpassed 80 inches! Hard, faster, stronger, deeper! He wanted to fill Ryo with all his love! Muscles bulged as they swelled to beastial size. Legs as the closest becoming thick tree trunks with perfect teardrops, abs hardening and cutiing into an 8 pack like an artisan cutting a perfect figure out of stone. The definition of his muscles easily surpassing the beefy Greek statues despite being only slightly bigger! His abs nearly obscured by thick, bouncing pecs, huge deltoids connected to biceps and triceos that could easily rival a medicine ball with the slightest of flex! Hands so huge that one alone covered all of Ryo's twink ass. Massive feet to walk and stand tall with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys were lost in pleasure as Ryo's own cock began to ooze pre-, his desire tied to Akira's own. He looked down and smiled to see Akira was much larger, even as a 150 inch cock that should not be able to fit inside him! It felt as comfortable and natural as a five inch dick. He soon moved hands onto Akira's wide, bulging body beneath, feeling the muscle and power Akkra awakened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unf! Ryo!\" Akira called out as he opened his eyes, drinking in Ryo's angelic body over his own godly one. \"Please keep touching! It feels so good!\" 250 inch cock still thrusting, massive balls churning with gallons of seed desperate for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyo moved down as he slid his hands closer to Akira's face, trailing gently across Akira's thick neck as the demoizing boys monster pillar was oozing pre- and hungry for release inside Ryo! A smile meanwhile crossed crossing the angelboys face as he placed placed both hands on Akira's still soft cheeks \"Your body has grown so powerful, but you haven't tapped into the full potential of your form Akira. Even now with you inside me and fucking as much as you can, you still are fighting back the urge to awaken fully in fear of hurting me. Nothing you can do could ever hurt me.\" His voice logical and trying to be monotonous, but emotion stilll filling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryo I-\" He tried to respond only for Ryo to kiss him. It was breif, short, and absolutley wonderful as Akira let loose a little more on the tap and the two orgasmed. It was only long spurt from Ryo's own eight inch. Akira's was a different matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 700 inch rod began flooding the inside of Ryo's body as they fucked, Ryo's legs pushed up off the side as Akiras body began growing in every direction. Their kiss halted as Akira's head rapidly moved away and grew larger than Ryo's own body in rapid susccession. Furniture was pushed to the side, crushed and obliterated in Ryo's private home as Akira's feet smashed through the walls like paper! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the less than 5'5 boy had become a living mountain, one that would have destroyed the skyscraper Ryo lived in beneath his bulk even as he eyed the tiny Ryo and wanted another kkss. That is if a mysterious white aura hadn't transported them out of the city and into the forested mountains of Japan. Ryo's body now a tiny doll hanging onto a living mountain hundred+ feet larger. Akira's cock filling him with an endless torrent of cum from his balls as the giant still fit his masskve rod into that small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira tried to look down, but his pecs blocked his view. \"Guess I'm a little big now huh?\" A deep rumbling voice came from him. Ryo down below happily hugging that gigantic body that surpassed even the largest of demons! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.1. 165 feet tall and his 720 = 60 foot dick (Nearly two feet relative to Akira's body!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. 330 feet tall and his 60 foot dick (One foot in length)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

Kuroko had three massive vanilla shakes before him and a blender that had been in use. Creamy vanilla oozing down the inside. A massive container of Vanilla Ice Cream and titantic jug of Milk titled under the mysterious brand \"Behemoth's dose\" that he was closing the lids to and placing what was left in the fridge. A tough battle Kuroko had endured moving them across the now messy kitchen. He'd have to put up the vanilla extract and sugar up once he regained his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Kuroko?\" he dried himself off as he started to dress in some shorts and tank tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to try this shake I made. It tastes wonderful...\" Sipping sounds could be heard over the phone as Kuroko drank his personal shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass. I'd prefer a cheeseburger from Maji Burger over that.\" Kagami told him. He also could have sworn he heard a..moan?.... as he heard sipping noises from Kurokos end. <i>Must be a pretty good shake with how he is acting</i>. Sounding like he loves it, Kagami figured Kuroko would be stubborn and make him take it whether he wants it or not. Reluctantly the red haired player agreed with a heavy \"All right Kuroko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will bring it over soon then. Also, I invited Aomine to your place. Bye\" And with that Kuroko hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! He did that on purpose.\" An annoyed Kagami closed his phone as he dried his hair. \"The fact that he made those shakes personally is what gets me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuroko meanwhile was finishing his shake. Its sweet vanilla filling him with joy. Not noticeable at first, but Kuroko looked a few inches taller and his arms more toned. His famed nature as a shadow due to his frailer physique now dissipating. In truth these changes were not from the shake before him. He had tried a free sample of Behemoths Dose Ice Cream at the market the day before. It's taste miraculous enough to make him ask his father to buy ingedients for his own desire to personally make homemade ones and have Aomine and Kagami taste them.

Whatever manners he normally had were completely gone by now, as he chugged the smoothie, slightly leaking out the side of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long before he finished, fortunately before he ra out of breath, but it wasn't too long before he had finished the second one too. These smoothies really did work, He did a few maneuvers, more quickly then he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was absolutely full of energy, and fortunately for him, his family was out on an outing, although it's very possible they thought he was with him. At least... he hoped they weren't here. Either way, he noted that his shirt was starting to get a little tighter, a shirt meant for someone of a smaller frame, and not something closer to a average sized played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the bathroom, as he prepared to strip off his shirt. Although, just as he was about to take off, he had another idea, and gripping his shirt, ripped it off, exposing his frame with was now filled with some very lithe, defined muscle, at least, for now. He admired his new frame, and decided he needed to test it out, as he flexed, admiring the growth of his bicep, He had some already, from years of basketball, but now it was very much enhanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed out to his small basketball court he used for practice. And practiced heavily, exercising many dribbles, shots, and passes. All the while, he still hadn't finished the growth from the sample he had. He panted, somewhat exhausted, until a sudden burst of energy took him, and with that burst came a bit of growth, as he surged up a couple inches. It was enough that his remaining shorts were much tighter on him, starting to rip from from his enhanced muscles, and certainly from an enhanced member of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't resist, as he took the ball, and dribbling it, rushed towards the net, and jumped up, and slam ducked it so hard the glass of the board shattered.

Vanilla sliding down his cheeks from the cup as he continued to swallow more and more as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first one was once again emptied, Kuroko dropped the cup on the table as he reached for the second one and indulged again, emptying it to finish all three once again. \"Ah~\" A sound Kuroko would normally never make. But something about these Behemoth Dose dairy products brought out a primal desire in Kuroko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe now it's calmed-\" A low growl finished Kurokos thoughts as his body growled in hunger again., slowly rising with each second to become a deep rthymic sound thwt oermeated his families home. \"I need more but it will take too long to make vanilla shakes\". Looking at the fridge where a hakf jug of thst massive bottle of milk remained was all he needed to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale blue haired basketball player opened the door, pulling out the entire jug. His arms slowly growing muscles made dealing with it much easier than he had when he originally made a shake. Popping off the lid Kuroko brought the tip to his mouth as he began to chug down the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gulp* *Gulp* *Gulp*. Each gulp had more of the creamy white liquid pour down his throat at a fast pace The massive jug was starting to empty as Kuroko inched up ever higher, his muscles slowly gaining more mass so they were no longer just the lean physique of a new player at basketball. The growls of his stomach waned as abs slowly forming into a four pack as his pecs pushed out nicely. He'd be able to compare to Kagami and Aomine in the muscle depertment, but his height was starting to surpass theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last bit of milk when down his throat Kuroko let off, only now breathing as a resounding \"Ah~\" came forth as a smile spread his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more.\" Not out of insane hunger, but pure instinct made Kuroko want to finish the BH ice cream he also bought. Taking it out, he went for his families biggest spoon and started to dig in. Eating every bite possible. He was not worried about getting a headache from eating so much cold ice cream so fast, and if he did have one he was enjoying his ice cream with a smile so much it did not bother him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon even that container was completely empty. Rubbing his belly, Kuroko smiled with joy as it extended out. All that he ate had been quite good afterall and he no .onger had that desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remember why he had so much. \"I wonder what I should tell Kagami-kun and Aomine-kun?\"</span></div></div>",

They hoped their mutual friend would save them from the boredom, and he actually did... but in a way they never expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuroko??\" Kagami exclaimed when he saw his shadow friend was now slightly taller than him. Aomine remained speechless, but his wide open eyes showed he had been surprised too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuroko had to bow a little his blue head to pass through the doorframe (now dangerously near his head). His clothes couldn't cover all his new self, part of his toned stomach were exposed. He took off his deteriorated shoes, perforated by a pair of feet several sizes bigger than usual. His whole body had packed several pounds of muscle until matching Aomine and Kagami's  build, and his undersized clothes marked them even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Kagami. Sorry for being so late.

The dark-haired Guts wandered in the forest for severa cold day and nights. By his side glowed the tiny elf Puck with his blue hair likewise shining in the thick mist. The two had entered the forest two days ago, but no exit has been found. Guts hunted what few animals he could find, yet they only appeared conveniently when he needed to sate his hunger. \"We're lost aren't we Guts?\" The fluttering Elf stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems so\" the large man said solemnly as he stopped walking foward. In the two days they have been here in the misty forest and it had not let up. Oddly no malevolent spirits reacted to the Brand of Sacrifice upon his neck since arriving. Something he only saw was the cave near Godo's home. <i>What a weird woods. Perhaps elven influence is strong here?</i> It mattered little to him as long as he could have a good rest, something he has rarely experienced at night for a long time. The cool mist was starting to feel pleasant to Guts as he thought of what to do. <i>It has been a few days yet I shouldn't let my guard down</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will stay here for the night.\" He told his tiny compatriot as he moved to the closest tree, puling his sword from behind him as he started pressing his armored back against the trees side. His tattered cape resting its ends upon the roots beneath Guts. The bark and roots was not as pleasant as a bed, but were oddly more comfortable than when he's slept ike this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Guts! I'll stay up to keep watch for a little.\" his transluscent wings flapped as he laned on Guts head, nestling himself ito the white stripe of hair amidst the black. Guts massive Dragonslayer held close as he prepared to sleep. His sole opened eye beginning to close as sleep came to him. His guard never down despite the trainquil environment that surrounds them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two did not realize they had slipped into a hidden realm of the Astral world. A solemn and gentle land that seeks to ease and bring pleasure to those who enter. It had been thousands of human years since the last visitors, and so the shrouded realm seeks to bless its guests. The mist peered into Guts subconscious, seeing the battles and struggles of the warrior. Of his failure to protect Casca and the desth of his comrades, and the isolation of fighting demonic spirits and/or Apostles every night. Only recently getting a time of peace with his encounters with Schierke and the others.<i> If only I was stronger</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it needed to sense to grant Guts wish, and seeing Puck as part of him, it began to work its influence.</span></div></div>",

He drives through the streets of Hellsalems Lot as a giant monster rampages in the background of the city eating cars and building debris. Demonic gangsters having a car chase shooting at each other just behind him. All of it white noise to the man as he turns, the gangsters crashing into a centipede monster that emerged from a portal to Alterworld and crimson fire and smog erupts from the giant monster speeding through that street. The monster in the distance picking a fight with his coworkers in Libra. Ordinary people and Beyondians living their everyday lives ignored the typical mayhem save for the brief glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The best thing about the Eyes of the Gods is that I dont have to open them to see. Unless the situation requires greater sight from them.\"</i> Leonardo narrates again, though to whom remains a mystery. He was off from his job and Libra today, hoping to get some more money for his next X-Station Triple-X. Only to receive a text from Zapp that a legendary burger joint from the deepest depths of the Netherworld had opened a shop in the city. The chance of trying one of a kind burgers was a very powerful temptation just to see if it could rival mankinds Jack &amp; Rockets. While there was definitely good non-human restaurants in Hellsalems Lot, the number of weird and dangerous ones were far greater in number. He almost didn't go for the burger till Klaus mentioned he regretted not getting one in a past mission in the Alterworld. That was all the incentive Leonardo needed to go chasing after and try one. The polite and gentle red headed man was not the type to play along with Zapp. Though no one at Libra does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If it turns out to be a bust I'll take some of the allowance I give Michella to buy it. Ill pay her more from next time. Because I really want X! X! Triple-X!</i>\" The narrating messy haired young man let his love of games overcome his reasoning for a second. It toom about a couple hours but he soon arrived at the shop of this fabled burger joint: The Titans Grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restuarant sign was stitched together into the flesh of a giant wyrm like creature. It rested its long figure from the hole where it resides. The serpentine beast with its grotesque forehead and twelve eyes had a mouth and teeth that opened and acted in ways biologically possible for earth animals. Its teethserved as counters as employees took orders from countless folk standing in lines, with certain parts of its mouth opening as doors to let the employees enter and leave. \"Looks better than Zapp at least.\" He got off his bike and examined each counter and line, the customers nearly all Beyondian. They were all lines for a singular brand of burger made by Titans Grip, with signs that said what line was for which one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" He examined the signs to get a clue on whicb burger to buy. \"1.The Dragons War: comes with The Souls of humans as condiments? Pass. 3.Masochists Paradise: taste countless flavors through the skin as the burger brutally beats you up? My luck sucks as is. 7. The Seven Days of Paradise:  brings you to heavenly bliss for seven days before a dead girl emerges from nearby TVs to drag you go hell...sheesh they really are masochists in Alterworld.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went through them one by one, declining each one he saw for having some bad side effect Leonardo didn't wish to deal with. That is until no. 28. \"The Ultimate Burger [Incomprehensible] Lets you experience a subconscious desire be made reality for 24 Hours before returning to normal. Sounds good.\" He looked and saw it had one of the shortest lines. \"Looks like I can get through this line real quick. Wonder why so few people want one?\" Leonardo contemplated as he got into line 28, thirty minutes passing by as the line dwindled and he finally arrived at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA three eyed figure with no mouth and five hands spoke to him. \"Price is 10.00 per burger. How many do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is what the sign said true? It grants any desire for 24 Hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing out all the cash on him, betting on this to get all his wishes granted simultaneously. \"I'LL TAKE THIRTY!\" he yelled at the top of his lungs. The ccreature grabbed the three hundred and thirty dollar tax, heading inside the innards of the great beast before returning with two bags of the Ultimate Burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice day.\" it said as it bowed, Leonardo leaving happily with the bags as the next customer ordered some. Getting to his bike, Leonardo happily opened up one burger to take a bite. Its contents looked disgusting and an eye appeared to look at him from within, but the young man ignored it to take a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste was...okay at best. Not the best he's had and not as terrible as some Beyondian attsmpts at making burgers. \" Swallowing, he let out a sigh. \"Expected better to be honest.\"  As he prepared fo take his next bite...</span></div></div>",

He was unsure which, but he saw their missing friend Takayama Sou. The small pessimist was lost in thought as he questioned the white void he had seen that night. Empty, bottomless, and only himself with a gigantic, multi-winged, pure white Seraphim, Takayama. He was unsure what it meant, but he knew what he wanted. <i>\"If I have that dream again, could I find Takayama?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEishi needed to see him again. The teen who changed their lives when Takayama saved them and gave his blood. Transforming them into the winged, black feathered Birdmen. Most important to the short pessimist as he drfited to dreamland <i>\"I want to save him.\"</i> his eyes softly clossing as his desire grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====Whiteout=====<br>\r\nThe black armor like substance surrounded Eishis body as he gained consciouness in a vast white realm. \"Im in the dreamscape again.\" He moved his clawed fingers up to his face as he scratched his cheek. \"I need to inform Adam tomorrow\" He spent only a second thinking of the clone scientist from Eden as he waited for the white Takayama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed as he crossed his legs, five and he was thinking of his fellows Komoda, Rei, and Umino as they had him to be leader with Takayamas disappearance. \"If I find him what will Eden do when we look for him? Thinking of worst case scenarios as he sought to coexist with normal humans. Thirty minutes flew by as his eyes squinted, bearing his gaze into the bottomless clear void as an eye twitched. \"This is taking too long. Last time he appeared instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later his floating body made contact, back and black feathered wings made a soft *bump* as Eishi felt something behind him. He flew a couple feet the opposite direction as he turned to glance what he felt,  only to observe more endless white. \"I bumped into something.\" A clawed hand moved forward to touch the spot, a smirk cross his face as he realized the optical illusion. The texture of their feathers formed from their armor and blood The white outline now visible as he started to see the full scale outline of the six wings hiding Takayama within. Thats when he realized that the figure was more, well <i>vast</i>, than he was even the dream previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takayama is easily ten times his former size in my dream. No wonder I failed to notice.\" He continued to rub the feathers to get the figure to rise up and move his wings. It took a few moments of brushing and rubbing the feather like structures, the smallest smile on Eishis face as he felt a rumble. Swiftly he flew back on instinct as his face flushed red from embarrassment. \"Crap! I was getting into it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEishi returned his attention to the white giant as the rumbling lead the six white wings to slowly open like a flowef, unveiling Takayamas body for Eishi to see. \"What...the....hell.\" Eishi mouth dropped as he saw Takayama Sou entire body. His head was obscured by his Birdman helmet, his personal red markings spread across the vast white armor like skin beneath the wings. What shocked Eishi, however, was the ridiculous size of his muscles! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lean but fit Takayama who did factory work before he vanished was now replaced by a body that was ridiculous in the sheer mass he had. Biceps that could easily go beyond his head with a simple flex, pecs so big they blot out Eishi from the gaze of the behemoth, while Eishi could see his upper body and a neck so thick the helmet working properly even for their shifting powers seemed hard to imagine. \"I don't know what to expect below but....\" Eyes trailed down those mountainous pecs to his hard granite like abs to see that monstrous rod. \"That is a big penis\" His face only flushed deeper red as he saw the armor had encased Takayamas cock and balls. Easily being the size of the upper half of the body combined. The bulge that was only held back by Takayamas desire until he tells the armor to chsnge shape. Those monstrous tree trunks thighs were even fighting his legs for space.Eishis face threatened to explode from how deep the red in his face got, the most bizarre thing thats ever happend to him in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least this is a dream.\" Sighing Eishi as he shaked his head really fast to regain his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be surprised by what can happen.\" A voice smirked from above Eishi, deep and vast as it filled his head, a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takayama? What is going on?\" Eishi called out with his voice and telepathically, the massive white helmet tilted down as the behemoth shifted his body in the void to gaze upon the tiny Eishi beneath the helm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gained a special power\" A colossal, clawed arm moved towards the diminutive Eishi. The titanic hand got closer to him yet mkved slowly, likely to keep Eishi placated as the white armored hand move became all that Eishi saw. He saw the hand close as Takayama pointed at him his clawed middle finger, easily dwarfing Eishing in his size by itself. The finger moved closer and closer as the tip of the finger drew evermore within reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takayama?\" Eishi wanted to move, but he trusted Takayama, and that kept him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got an interesting gift\" Takayama smile grew wider beneath his visor, slowly opening it to reveal his spiky head. \"I wonder what will happen when you find me?\" The tip of the claw glowed red as it was on the verge of touching Eishi, who closed his eyes to embrace it. The sharp edge touched him and instantly stopped moving, the glow only glowing brighter as it all was enguled by red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====Morning=====<br>\r\nEyes opened as the light of dawn descended upon Eishi, the boy eyes slowly fluttering half-open open he let out a mighty *YAWN* \"I need to tell Adam about that dream *YAWN*, it was so odd.\" He stretched his arms, only to feel a massive weight not only keep him from doing so, but dropped him with a huge *THUD* on the floor, blanket keeping his feet clinging on the bed. \"W-what the!?\" Eishis eyes wide as he gazed at the massive right arm before him. The massive arm nearly the size of his enitre short body, attached to his body by delts too comically small for the difference in size. The biceps and triceps were massive, easily big enough to crush his head between them with a small flex. His hand was so ridiculously big for the short boy, his face turned red as he moved the fingers. Each one responded flawlessly to his moving them, but the sheer weight of it kept him from raising the monster of an arm. Only a feeble raise of the limb off the ground for but a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Komoda! Rei!  I need you over at my house now! Get Adam at meet me at my house! I need help!\"</i> He telepathically sent the message as powerfully as possible so no matter who could hear it. \"This is so embarrassing.\" He blushed as he waited for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====Northwestern Asia=====<br>\r\nTakayamas eyes opened as he awakened from his sleep, resting near the tip of a mountain. Clad in black as armor and helm keep him protected from the cold. A smile crossed his face beneath the visor as he felt his body. His left arm enlarged. Not to inhuman extremes, but visibly bigger than his right. \"Come soon Eishi. I'm waiting.\" He spread his wings, taking off in flight as he flew over another Birdman. His size easily surpassing the normal sized one beneath him by a foot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fabled Third Child was in a cold, sterile changing room in the pyramid like Nerv HQ on Sunday. The brown haired youth undressing to put on the plugsuits Evangelion pilots wear. \"So I'm to try this latest Plugsuit?\" the demure boy asked to an empty room. White shirt and pants neatly folded as he had already put on the bulky looking plugsuit before being told too, his lower half already in as he put his arms into the suit. Once he had it fully on he pressed the decompression button to shrink it to the plugsuits usual skintight appearance when worn. It resembled his old one save for thinli esthat trace across the blue and onto the white chest component.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Shinji Ikari. We need to test this suit out before we can start making more of them. I assumed Misato told you this before you arrived.\" the cold, detached voice of Ritsuko Akagi answered over the speaker, the dyed blonde scientist checking his vitals on the machine before her. Four slots with names above each.  \"And before you ask no there is no cameras in the changing room so you don't have to be embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh I wasn't thinking of that at the moment!\" He had not worried as Misato was there due to her own actions, so the perverted older woman was unable to make snide remarks at his expense even if she hadn't been forced to do paperwork she had failed to do the other day and tried to pawn off to Ritsuko. \"All Misato told me was that this was important and test plugsuits were involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <i>Misato</i>\" Ritsuko sighed as she thought of the troubles her friend pushes on to her. \"Due to an unforseen accident the test plugs suffered some damage from the last angel attack. As such we will need to test the suit out next week as well when the repairs are finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so why am I wearing this if we can't test it Miss Ritsuko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be having you wear this 24/7 every day for the next week.\"  Ritsuko bluntly declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>What</b>!? But what about need to ccean myself or use the bathroom? I can't do that in this!\" Shinji was panicking as there were, ahem, other reasons a youth going through puberty wouldn't want to wear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry. These plugsuits are state of the art and have been designed to turn said waste into energy. I could go into detail, but you wouldn't like the specifics.\" <i>\"Though I am not allowed to mention the properties of these new plugsuits in the first place.\"</i> She kept said thought to herself. Though she believed she knew a way to calm him down. \"I can tell you that Touji Suzuhara, Kensuke Aida, and Kaworu Nagisa have likewise agreed to these experiments.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Shinji had mostly calmed down \"They did? I mean I'm not surprised Kensuke did but Kaworu and Touji as well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's our hope to prepare potential and current pilots by testing them with these new plugsuits beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. So what should be done about school? Won't I get in trouble for not being able to wear the uniform?\" Shinji asked as he grabbed his clothes to prepare himself to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not. Tokyo-3 First Municipal has been told the four of you are excused and will be residing in GeoFront for the next week in a vacant area so we can study you all via the suits. Misato wiil take you there and will retireve items you request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Have a good day Ms. Ritsuko.\" Shinji bowed before leaving the room, heading for where he had left Misato at earlier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" She didn't reply back, not being used to dealing with Gendo's son. She looked down at the device, wondering exactly what Gendo is planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was really spacious, like three rooms brought together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third children would have expected a big room beneath the Nerv headquarters would be filled with mechanical pieces, boxes or any other boring stuff\u2026 but much to his surprise there were a big TV connected to a video system and a console, a sofa, several chairs surrounding a table, bookcases, a few plants here and there, a hi-fi system in a corner and an improvised kitchen in the opposite side of the room. From time to time a few employees entered to put new furniture or some electrical appliances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji located his 3 friends in the roomy sofa, wearing the experimental plugsuit like his but in different colors. Misato was in front of them in casual clothes, talking about the facilities which would be their new home for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to them. He was greeted energetically by Touji and Kensuke whereas Kaworu didn\u2019t say anything, he just smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides the living room, you have a private bedroom\u201d She explained as he opened one of the adjacent doors. The inside looked much like Kaworu\u2019s room. \u201cThere are a few more room, like a shared bathroom you won\u2019t need, another room with gym equipment and some unused rooms destined for storage\u2026 if you need anything else, buzz us on this entryphone and we\u2019ll bring it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you let us take off the suits, although it would be only for a while?\u201d Shinji asked shyly.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, the point of the experiment is to analyze how the plugsuit performs after a long period of time\u2026 but I\u2019ll talk to Misato, maybe she will let you take a rest for a few minutes so you can \u2018relax\u2019.\u201d She winked at him, and that wink wasn\u2019t subtle at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left, the boys started to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA week without school, housework or parents! Summer holidays have come early this year\u201d Toji exclaimed as he grabbed the TV remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish this suits were less\u2026 exposing...\u201d Kensuke admited, feeling awkward about how this skintight uniform hinted the details of the most private parts of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of your body, we\u2019re all men here.\u201d He cocky Toji replied \u201cAlso, I\u2019m pretty proud of mine.\u201d He flexed his arm, showing a quite defined biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t a good moment for Shinji to tell them about that strange night when he and Kaworu took a bath and slept together\u2026 That night was weird and confusing for Shinji, although it also felt\u2026 affable. He would have liked to talk about it with anyone, but his friends were a little too immature, he were still annoyed with Misato after the last Nerv crisis, Asuka was too homofobic, Rei too emotionless\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week locked on a room with Kaworu could be a disaster\u2026 or something wonderful\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Commander Gendo Ikari, Fuyutsuki and Ritsuko was watching them with cameras hidden all over the place. 20 screens alternated live broadcast of them with biometric data taken from the sensors of their suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the subjects are wearing the modified plugsuits\u2026 all the suits had the bio-altering modules you  requested...\u201d The Dr. Ritsuko informed. \u201c...although I\u2019m not sure why did we install them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor our old dismantled project, Project Ascension\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko\u2019s eyes opened wide. She didn\u2019t expected Ikari was going to reopen that dangerous project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy, Gendo\u201d Fuyutsuki objected \u201cThat initiative was a complete failure, it killed every single subject who volunteer for that experiment\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe new data suggests it could work in younger males.\u201d He explained as he passed the above mentioned report to Ritsuko \u201cThat\u2019s why I took them for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond woman read fast the key parts of the report before admitting he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure about that. Those kids could die. Your own son, Gendo!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe won\u2019t die. He\u2019ll become the ultimate weapon against angels\u2026 and Seele.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji had a rough night. He wasn\u2019t comfortable with the suit. It felt more tight than usual\u2026 also, every few minutes he could swear it felt a discharge or a jab on his skin, although it was too small he couldn\u2019t be sure it really happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of that, he eventually fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

He were brushing his teeth while he waited for his erection to subdue\u2026 but he stopped when he noticed something strange with his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had wore plugsuits for almost a year and he had got used to his tightness and how \u2018revealing\u2019 it might be. Shinji, with his thin build, he never had much to show. But this morning he looked a little more muscular than he remembered\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoulders were a few centimeters wider than usual in contrast with his tight waist. His deltoides and trapezius seemed more noticeable, although it could be his imagination\u2026<br>\r\nHe was even able to distinguish his pecs. They were still thin, but they were thick enough to push the cloth forwards and be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had also grown a little taller, but he didn\u2019t realize that change until he went to the living room and met the others. It was funny how he was slightly taller than Toji now, at the same height as Kaworu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that was a nice growth spurt. I think you\u2019re the new tallest guy in our class.\u201d Told Kensuke while he recorded the scene with his portable cam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah, I was taller fist, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get another growth spurt and beat you.\u201d Toji replied clearly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe he\u2019ll get even taller.\u201d Kaworu added, enjoying the sight of Shinji to the point the kid became aware of his glaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your dreams!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should keep a record of our heights.\u201d Kensuke suggested as he grabbed a pencil. \u201cLet\u2019s mark our heights next to that door\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope Misato won\u2019t get mad at us for drawing lines in the wall\u201d Shinji thought while his friend was measuring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the rest of the day they acted as usual, playing, reading and watching TV. They didn\u2019t know Gendo was spying them , collecting all kinds of data through their suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe initial test was successful.\u201d Ritsuko declared \u201cYour son had grown 11cm and increased his body mass in 2.2% after just a minimum dose of Herakles energy and the Samson Serum. He must have a great genetic potential. No anomalies detected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I want you to double the dose\u2026 I want the others to receive the same amount plus Shinji's last night\u2019s dose. I don\u2019t want them to be left behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGendo, that\u2019s dangerous. We don\u2019t know if they\u2019d react the same way\u2026 or the mutations a high dose could cause.\u201d The subcommander complained, but Gendo ignored him.<br>\r\n\u201cWe could do this slowly\u2026 reduce the exposition and extend the duration of the experiment so they...\u201d Ritsuko suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. We have to complete Ascension Project as soon as possible. Seele is preparing to end us. We can\u2019t build or repair EVAs without their resources\u2026 but we could build an army of other things as powerful as EVAs...\u201d</span></div></div>",

The usual wood standing stiff beneath his suit. . \"*Yawn* I can't wait to get out of this suit.\" He grumbled as he began to get up. Though he felt he noticed it was bigger than yesterday. \"I guess if the rest of me is growing, then so would it.\" He wished it would at least not be driving him crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to the bathroom for his daily routine and wait his erection out, only to notice a visible change in his form in the mirror just as he had before. His shoulders seemed to have doubled the centimeters it had grown the day before, his deltoids and trapezius muscles were showing enough that Shinji could see a visible growth in them. His pecs gained more mass as they press the plugsuit further out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my entire body grows...\" Shinji muttered as he lifted his left arm and gave it a small flex. A small bicep rose against the plugsuit making Shinji a little proud despite its small size. <i>Maybe Kaworu and Kensuke have experienced it too.</i> He thought as he waited till it finally softened, allowing him to enter the main room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear he had grown taller as well once he entered the main room, the wall that etched yesterdays height of 5'5 (165 cm) was shorter than his current 5'9 (175 cm) self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unlike yesterday it was clear they had all grown today. \"Guess I'm a late bloomer\" Touji chuckled as he showed off a bulging bicep beneath his plugsuit. Yesterdays shortest member had finally grown like the ther three. He was still the shortest, but it seemed his muscles grew more to compensate for his 5'4 (162 cm) stature. Kaworu and Kensuke were both the second tallest at 5'8 (172cm), with them both have clearly less defined physiques compared to Shinji and Touji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ive got you beat in two other areas\" Kensuke gloated. The geeky boy having a very noticeable stiffy in his plugsuit. Unashamed of showing it off. Shinji wanted to hide himself out of embarassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKawrou had been quiet during it all, reading a book before he noticed Shinji entered. Walking over to the now taller brown haired boy his red eyes shined as he moved to Shinji's ear. \"I know a way to help with <i>that</i> so you don't have to wait so long to join us.\" Immediately Shinjis face turned beet red. He didn't know what secret technique Kaworu had, but if it helped he try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy began their daily routine, Touji getting the other three to play sports with him due to all the energy he had. After getting sweaty and tired from Touji getting them to play basketball with him they relaxed and watched a film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====In Gendo's Office====<br>\r\n\"They haven't had as much of a growth spurt as expected. With a double dose. It seems. We must also have them ingest it orally.\" Gendo said as he stared dead eyed at it all while playing shogi with Fuyutsuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no telling what that can do. Their bodies absorbs it through the skin due to the plugsuit. Directly ingesting it was never confirmed to have good results.\" The older man sighed, lamenting putting Yuis son through this. \"Perhaps the body fluids and excrement destroyed by the suit could be slpwing down the suit and keeping it from releasing it periodically?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It matters not the reason. The process is still taking too long.\" Gendou grunted in frustration as he lost to Fuyutsuki in their game.</span></div></div>",

I don't accept more changes in the procedure until we have got more data of the effects of the current dosage. Give me three days at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more day.\" Gendou frowned \"We'll discuss the new course of this experiment tomorrow night\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Dr. Akagi... what are you doing here?\" Fuyutsuki asked with curiosity. \"I could swear we were alone 5 minutes ago\u201d<br>\r\n\"I forgot my purse... and why are you playing shoji in a dark room?\"<br>\r\n\"It creates the perfect dramatic ambient to talk about work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night the kids were much more uncomfortable than the previous nights. They knew the discomfort of the small injections and strange discharges under the suit, but this night also had to put up with growing pains and the built up horniness. They didn't sleep well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Shinji waked up only to find out his penis had awakened earlier and it was waiting for him, bigger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to grab it, but the tight plug suit hold it glued to his abdomen, so he couldn\u2019t put his fingers around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on...\u201d Shinji kept trying, but his fingers kept slipping in the plastic suit. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it anymore...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen do you want my help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaworu was there (\u201cWhat is he doing in my bedroom?\u201d Shinji asked to himself) looking with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat could you do, Kaworu? These suits don\u2019t let us do anything, and we can\u2019t took them off these...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d The pale boy wondered, with his usual mysterious air. \u201cLet me try...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he put himself over Shinji\u2019s body, who was still laying on the bed. His angelic but sat over his friend\u2019s penis, who reacted to the rubbing getting even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-kaworu!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShhh, calm down, I know what I\u2019m doing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his hands over the top of his chest and moved them in circles over his developed chest, caressing his skin and nipples through the thin plastic of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got a really nice body. I\u2019m envious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen didn\u2019t answered, he felt too embarrassed to do it\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t an uncomfortable sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagisa\u2019s hand eventually traveled to his stomach and delighted with his hard abdominals which weren\u2019t so defined the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he bend his body towards Shinji\u2019s face, who was red as a tomato, until both heads were almost touching\u2026 and he whispered to his ear two words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen Sesame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately a metallic sound were heard and their plugsuits opened in the middle, like an unbottoned shirt. Shinji jumped from the bed (accidentally throwing Kaworu to the floor) and hurried up to remove the hateful clothing before it closed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he took it off completely, he could appreciate the new curves of his shape: His pecs seemed thicker without the cloth constricting them. His torso started broad over his shoulders, but it curved until it ended in his tight waist where there were a 6 pack. His longer legs didn\u2019t seem so longer thanks to his thicker thighs and calves increasing his diameter\u2026 but his feet truly felt longer and bigger than yesterday, and when looked down to his feet he couldn\u2019t avoid to see his huge penis tired of being ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice view\u201d Kaworu joked after hugging him from behind \u201cI guess it\u2019s true what they say about men with big feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you do that? Freeing me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a magician.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBe serious.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually I\u2019m a superhero with the power to alter technology.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to ruin the moment with bitter truths, so he changed the subject \u201cI made the same favor to Kenji and Touji and they wanted some privacy to <i>relax</i>. Do you need some privacy for this, Shiiinji?\u201d He whispered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, the teenager stay silent for a few seconds before replying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen light for Kaworu, who started to kiss his crush with passion. Shinji\u2019s head seemed a little higher than the day before for K, a sign he was still winning the growth race, but he could still reach his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaworu\u2019s suit fell to the ground, exposing a body no less hot than his, although it did was a little less muscular and shorter. His cock may be smaller than him, but wasn\u2019t small either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pale hand masturbated both dicks until they finally cummed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now you\u2019re better, let\u2019s put our suits back before Nerv notices...\u201d He said as he started to get up from the bed, but Shinji grabbed him by surprise and brought him back to bed, when they continued to fuck a little longer, this time Shinji put his considerable penis inside his ass kept moving it until they came again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes after...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! Sorry!\u201d Shinji was on the floor, bowing to him as an apology for his excesses. \u201cI lost the control, I don\u2019t know why I...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize\u2026 I had a lot of fun. Maybe you could try to lose the control more often?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they went out they were welcomed by Touji and Kensuke sitting on the coach. They seemed strangely relaxed too. Kensuke\u2019s height was below Shinji\u2019s and similar to Kaworu\u2019s, although he was lankier than both of them on his crotch there was a long bulge, longer than Shinji\u2019s although maybe slimmer too. Touji didn\u2019t change much since the previous day, maybe he was a little buffer but he didn\u2019t have grow an inch unlike his friends and that was starting to annoy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new marks in the wall:<br>\r\nShinji: 188cm (6\u20192\u201d)<br>\r\nKensuke and Kaworu: 182 (6\u2019)<br>\r\nTouji: 162 (5\u20194\u201d)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night the four test subjects were preparing for supper, Shinji happily worked on making meals for the four of them. It initially felt weird to him using utensils while wearing the plugsuit on the first two days, but he got used enough to it to handle it with ease. He had prepared a big meal for the group. Loads of beef, fish, chicken, vegetables, etc all freshly cooked on the table. Despite having prepared enough for easily twice as many people to eat, Shinji didn't really feel as hungry as he should every time he grew, but he felt weird if he didn't eat enough to fill his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouji and Kensuke rubbed their hands together in delight as they had another meal prepped by Shinji. \"Thanks for the food!\" Both spoke as they started digging in. Shinji smiled as he showed gratitude before eating. Kaworu had always eaten the least, but with each new growth spurt even he consumed more than he did before. The silver haired boy would smile at Shinji as he ate, making him blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had spent a few days here with them, Shinji wanted to know. \"Why did you two agree to do this anyways?\" Touji and Kensuke looked up from scarfing their meals and swallowing.<br>\r\n\"They came by the school and offered me loads of model guns and military figures\". The six foot (182 cm) Kensuke stated before taking a bite of his corn.<br>\r\n\"They offered to help with my sister in the hospital.\" Touji admitted as he fercosiously bit into a slab of beef. \"And I wanted to ne taller to get better at sports.\"<br>\r\n\"And he wanted to help you.\" Kensuke added as Touji instantly got an annoyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if Kensuke! I was doing this to improve myself!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure you were.\" Kensuke mused as the two began to argue more and Touji got even more embarrassed. Shinji awkwardly smiled as Touji looked ready to fight with Kensuke before the four heard a door open. \"Ms.Akagi?\" The blonde scientist entered through the entrance door, heading over to the four with a suitcase in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed to the table where they ate, putting the suitcase down and opening it in silence. She brought out four red vials each the size of Shinji's 6'2 foot (188 cm) thumb. Both Shinji and Kaworu eyed the suitcase as she closed it and headed for the fridge. \"Ms. Akagi will you please inform us of what this red liquid is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Ritsuko stopped as she opened the fridge. She began putting bottle after bottle in the fridge, setting a set of 36 on the bottom. Finished she turned her attention towards them. \"This liquid will help induce greater growth in each of you. I brought it noe for you to drink it while eating per the Commanders orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fathers orders?\" Ritsuko nodded as she heard those words, Shinji reaching for two and handed one to Shinji.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Shinji.\" The albino boy smiled as he took it.<br>\r\n\"Hopefully I start getting bigger by drinking this\" Touji mused as he took his own, picking up Kensukes to toss it to him. The now bigger nerd catched it as Touji looked at his with interest. Hoping this will finally help him grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping the lid off, the four began drinking the substance. The bright red liquid travelled down their gullets and the taste was exceptionally aweful. \"Yuck!\" Three boys called out as they finished, Kaworu being the only one not to make noise. Though the frown on his face cdrtainly told how he felt about the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let us see if there's an instant result.\" Ritsuko observing the four as she timed her watch for one hour.</span></div></div>",

Simons, however, was going to get bizarre in this one singular alternate dimsension within the endless worlds born of memories and desires...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun began to shine upon the landscape of Kamina city as morning began. The Temple of the Gods (formerly Parliament Tower) had the morning light shone through its windows into the room where Simon slept. A colossal bed filled the large room, the doors leading in were massive in size and sealed shut as the light cleansed the room of shadow. The large figure in the bed let out a moan as he started to move beneath the sheets, an equally large figure not moving next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh..! That was a good nights rest\" said the figure as he sat up, blankets falling off his torso as his left hand moved to rub his eye. His dark blue hair brightened from the sunlight as it shined upon it and the upper half of his massive, musclebound body. His eyes slowly opening as he finished rubbing, black iris gazing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moan came from the vascular behemoth as he began to stretch his arms. \"Nice sleep with no interruptions from my servant Rossiu\" He spoke as lifted the blankets, planting his feet upon the ground. The figure stood up to an impressive seven feet in height. His body was inhumanly brawny, with bowling ball sized biceps, a perfect v-taper, thick slabs of granite like pecs pushing forward above his eight cobblestone abs, defined to perfection, with a small drill tied on a string wedged between the pecs. Powerful thunder thighs below supporting him with diamond shaped calves and connected to his likewise massive feet. He had nothing on beneath the sheets, revealing his nearly foot long dick flopping down between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure let out his third yawn as he brought a hand to his mouth, turning around afterwards to look at the bed where another large figure lies. He moved his hand to awaken them by pulling off the blanket on their side..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo those who wouldn't realize it at first glance, this transformed figure was Simon himself, reshaped to fit this new reality with the branches where he rules as a literal god king, unknowingly using Spiral Power to make himself and others bigger.

The red haired fairy King sat across from Ban, his face red and laying flat upon the table as a hiccup could be heard from the ruler of fairykind. His own glass mostly full due to being a lightweight. Their short, blond captain Melodias was going through the cabinets to look for more beer for himself after having only three cups, but no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a sec. I need to see if I have any more since you drank most of it.\" Seeing all cabinets were empty, he knew he'd have to get some of the more unpredictable ale they happened upon.a few days ago. Though the weird side affects were...bizarre to say the least. <i>Good thing Gowther is a doll or else his neck would have not been able to stretch so long</i> Merlin took him, Diane, and Elizabeth with her due to Elizabeth getting bunny ears and Diane shrinking to doll size from the strange concoctions that they had drank while the three men fought a monster that attacked that night. A cure she could potentially find with her former assistant. <i>I am a demon and Ban is a mortal so I suppose it should work out with no problems</i> getting up he called to the two drunkards \"Ill be back in a sec.\" Though the two didn't listen as Melodias left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hic* Not fair Ban. No one can *hic* beat you cause you *hic* immortal.\" The drunk fairy complained, having made a bet with him in the hopes of finally besting the silver haired man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the captain can best me\" Conidantly boasting as he finished off what was little was left of his drink. \"Hope the captain finds more booze soon.\" King looked partly annoyed by the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sorry about that! I brought the ale we got two days ago!\" called Melodias as he reentered the room, a black bottle with a sinister aura enveloping it, yet invisible to those who glimpse upon it. He went over to the table and opened the bottle, the second of the ten they had obtained that day, pouring himself a glass in his own mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now mine captain~\" Ban affectionately called to him as he held out his own mug, smiling as Melodias poured the mysterious ale into it. Once full as suds began to pour over the mug he immediately chugged it all down. A taste unknown to Ban, having a peculiar flavor of that tasted both wonderful and ominous \"Ahhh! Just the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now some for you.\" Melodias said as he poured some into Kings cup, the new ale mixing with the normal one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hic* Thanks, but I probably won't have anymore *Hic*\" King said as he brought his trembling hand to grab it and bring it over to his face, taking a small sip as his eyes went wide and he began to start chugging it down like Ban would. \"That's good *Hic* stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder the girls and Gowther drank it while we were busy.\" Melodias replied as he took his sip, having more control than either of his fellow sins who looked ready for more.</span></div></div>",

You have the best drinks! Give me some more!\" He gasped out, his face flushing from this new drink, its strength able to rival that of his immortality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing slammed down his own cup as well, definitely wanting some more, despite being absolutely hammered. His own competitive side was triggered as well. \"*Hic!* Give me some more!\" He shouted, having drained it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeliodas chuckled, not one to be outdone, draining his cup quickly as he refilled all their cups. He wasn't sure what it was about this drink, but it left him feeling... fuller. He couldn't quite explain it, even as they filled their cups and drank through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, they lost a lot of coherency, the night blending together, even as they were aware of themselves. All Ban knew was how good that drink was, even as they continued chugging throughout the night. What he did note was just how weird it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, even as his clothes started feeling tighter. His impressive musculature started to bulge forwards. His pecs began to spread the V of his jacket open, even as his sleeves grew tight. He moaned as he felt the sleeves and legs move upwards, which could only mean one thing. He was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unh...\" He muttered, the unique jacket of his ripping apart, even as his crotch bulged, the pleasure of it driving him insane, the seams ripping as he grew taller and taller. Before long, he felt the front burst open, even as his member flopped forward. He ripped out of his clothes, his fox tattoo showing plain as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis changes continued, unaware of what was happening to the others, even as they had their own changes occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---x---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeliodas groaned, stumbling up from where he had passed out last night. His vision was still too blurry to get his bearings. He reached out to grab a table to get up, although he seemed to grab it a lot earlier than he expected. He stumbled over two other things. 'Must be the others he thought....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gradually found his way to the washroom, rinsing his face off to clear his sight. But when he opened his eyes... \"Wha-?!\" He gasped at his own appearance. He was... bigger? He was actually average height for the first time in three millennia. It must have happened over night..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had ripped out of his shirt, and all he was left in was a very tight pair of pants, which were bulging out quite impressively. He at least kept his musculature, which suited him just fine, somewhat resembling a sculpted statue. He rushed back into the main room and was surprised as he saw a similarly sized King, nearly completely bare, but what caught him by surprise was the giant, nude Ban. He blinked in surprise, eying the empty flask, and wondering if he could reverse this, even as King began to stir. But such thoughts were easily driven out as he felt his own pants begin to tent. Oh what to do...</span></div></div>",

Crouching over the fairy king, the blonde demon started slapping him silly. Which of course worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for!?\" King yelled in surprise to whoever it was that did it, seeing a taller, sculpted captain before him. \"Meliodas!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo King! Looks like that ale worked on us both pretty well don't you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, the red-haired fairy checked out his body. \"What the hell?\" It was true! King, who always had a lithe and short frame befitting a fairy, was now as tall and sculpted as Meliodas. He never had muscles before and flexed an arm on impulse, wiggling his toes on his larger muscular feet. The prescence of both made his larger cock rise to his six pack. King smirked confidently as the two stood a proud 6'11 ft (2.108 m) as Ban used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeliodas himself was admiring King, knowing he was going to indulge himself with the easily messed with fairy. \"Sorry about this King but I'm horny and you look great\" with that the demon prince pressed His lips to Kings. Caught by surprise for only a second, King was oddly accepting of the kiss as he placed his on hand on the back of Meliodas head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile giant beefy Ban filled the other half of the Boar's Hat across from them, lost in his own lusty dreams of both. \"*Hic* That's right Captain work that mouth. Don't *Hic* King my tongue wants ravish you.\" His large tongue hung out as drool seeped in anticipation of wet dreams, his massive cock rising in response and droplets of pre the size of a human head leaked out <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked Fairy and Demon were continuing to make out as they felt each others bodies. Meliodas sloawly moving till his ass was on Kings cock. Pulling away, Meliodas smiled with those bright green eyes as he spoke \"I'll let you go first aince this is your first time. Next time it's you.\" Meliodas did not wait for a response as he had Kings cock penetrate his ass, filling him inside. As a demon he liked it rough and dangerous, he'll prepare some lube for the Sin of Sloth when its his turn. King was too dazed by how quickly it all accelerated as Meliodas rode his cock, not thrusting into him like he wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meliodas I'm not re-\" He was cut off as Meliodas went for a kiss, King losing himself in the pleasure again. The red-haired fairy began to thrust with newfound force into Meliodas. His thrusts got harder and harder as the two kissed, wg0hich only excited Meliodas more. <i>That's right don't worry about me King! I can handle anything you throw at me! </i> the thrusts got rougher with each one till finally both came, a geyser of white filling Meliodas while the blonde demons cock gushed all over the red head. As it seemed to end both their cocks began to harden omce more, signifying they aren't even finished...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBan meanwhile moved his massive body as he dozed, bringing his open mouth right next to the Ale of Chaos.

Whatever it was cause them to grow. King's arms slowly stretched out of his jacket's sleeves. His legs became longer as well. Meliodas' muscles grew. His biceps and triceps stretching his sleeves while his pecs pushed against his shirt. Ban mainly grew in general. His outfit broke off as he grew in both height and muscle. Meliodas woke up to find a huge Ban in front of him. Ban's head would be just shy of the ceiling standing up, and just one of his pecs were twice as big as his head. Meliodas stood up to find that he had grown as well. He looked like some took Howser's muscle mass and compressed into him. He looked over the table to see King who was stretched to Ban's original height. Meliodas quickly thought of if the beer they had earlier and looked at the bottle. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, except that it was full. He could have sworn it was at least a fourth gone before they passed out. Even so, he wondered how they grew differently if they all had the same beer. He concluded that it was the amount they drank.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mob had an odd dream. His wish to be more muscular like the Body Improvement Club had come true. His once lithe body now toned, with defined four pack, sixteen inch biceps, and twenty inch thighs. He was before a mirror in a dark void, happy with his dream based results. \"Tsubomi will definitely be impressed by this.\" Mob said with a soft smile. He had never learned about posing in the club due to their desire just to improve themselves for its own sake, so he remained standing in place lifting a single dumbbell in one hand as he stared into the mirror. He wore the white with red tip short-sleeved shirt, white shoes, and red shorts the rest of the club also wear in this fantasy. \"I hope to get better to even impress everyone else too.\" (32%)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, a rumbling began to fill the endless black void. \"What's going on?\" Not really phased by what was happening. Suddenly a mass of giant feet descended behind him. \"Don't worry Mob. You'll get bigger eventually.\" came a deep, but respectful tone of one of the gigantic figures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMob turned to look, a look of surprise on his face unmatching his gentle tone (45%). \"Musashi Gouda?\" Before him was the Body Improvement Club and former delinquent Tenga, the six of them were colossal not just in their one-hundred feet height but also their muscles. Their clothes were still in place, but were comically stretched over their 30 inch biceps and tree trunk thighs. Thick necks connecting proportionate heads to their titantic forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to join us in our race across Japan Mob? It'll take us a few hours at this size.\" Musashi cheerfully told the tiny Mob as he bent down on one knee to see Mob better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Across <i>Japan</i>? I don't think I'd be able to do that\" Mob said in awestruck horror at trying to run that far at this size when he can barely run at this size. (60%)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mob doesn't need to run that far when I need him to deal with small fry spirits as my assistant\" A booming confidant voice called from the east.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" Mob spoke his surprise in his typical gentle tone as he turned his eyes from the six before him as he looked left. A massive grey suit wearing giant even bigger than the six in front of him, nearly five hundred feet in height, and he was just as cosmically buff as them. Still no shoes for some reason. Mob tried to look at the orange haired Reigens face, but he couldn't see him past his massive shelf pecs, Reigen's purple tie laying atop it like a waterfall dropping from the canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mob. I need you to deal with some spirits. I'm just so <i>big</i> I can't get in there myself. Last couple times I destroyed the building just trying to deal with it. All it took was a simple step.\" Reigen finished as he popped a takoyaki into his mouth, magically appearing from nowhere for him to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shige doesn't need to do work for you.\" called a new voice from the west that Mob knew instantly. It was his younger brother Ritsu! He turned his head right to see a four hundred foot giant version of his brother in his black uniform, just as obscenely buff as the rest and his head obscured from viewed by his mountainous pecs. Only his spiked hair visible. (75%)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ritsu!\" He called to his younger brother, who could hear him like the other giants despite the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shige that Hanazawa guy said he'd be here soon too.\" Ritsu called down to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even Kanazawa. How did you all get so big?\" Mob calmly asked as his towering little brother, who began to kneel down so his massive hand down to let him get on. Ritsus gigantic face filled his view. (85%)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on.\" Ritsu told Mob. His big brother went to do just that, though it took him a sec to grip the nearest finger just right to start climbing it. Each one a living pillar capable of holding him on the tip. Once he got on and headed for the center,  he sat down as Ritsu started to stand, rising gently to make sure his brother doesn't get naseous from moving so high. He could now see his brother and masters faces from this height, but the Body Improvement Club was below. He ignored how his dream representations of them and Reigen were just standing there when not interacting with him. Well actually Reigen was still making giant takoyaki out of nowhere and eating them, massive crumbs sticking to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shige you know what you need to do to get big.\" Mob wasn't sure why his brother ignored his questioned and told him something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. If I did I'd have done it already.\" Mob spoke earnhestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple Kageyama.\" (93%) The voice of Teruki Hanazawa came from the distance, revealing he's arrived like Ritsu mentioned. His height around Ritsu's own and a musclebound behemoth like the rest. He wore his purple with white undershirt uniform, teal and blue green tie, and his...giant blonde wig for some reason. Last Mob knew his hair had grown back. <i>Everyone keeps going shoeless for some reason</i> Mob thought as he saw Teruki walking over, his strong feet shaking the black void ground below. As he arrived, Teru spoke again \"You just have to accept Tsubomi will never love you unless you are huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words sent Mob straight to 99%. On the breaking point, he didn't want to believe what this subconscious realm was stating to be true it to be true. Then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu licked his fingers as he finished his last Takoyaki and both him and Ritsu looked down at the tiny Mob. \"He's right\" <b>100%</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that ??? Went wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the dream was Dimple over a sleeping Mob. The evil green ghost had been sending dark whispers to Mobs head in the hopes of manipulating him, especially of whispering sinister things like Tsubomi never loving him. \"If I do this just right I can shake the very world once I've shaped you into the perfect god to help me take over.\" A sinister grin crossed his face, stopping right at his bright red dimple spots. His plot combined with Mobs dream to bring about a very twisted fantasy within his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he saw it. The white glow of psychic energy surrounding Mob as ??? Emerged and drenched Mob in darkness. \"Did my plan work?\" It surprised him when a shockwave was released from ???, shrinking the already diiinutive form of Dimple even more as it travelled across Salt City. ??? Then went back to dormancy as quickly as it emerged, the white and black replaced with Mobs sleeping form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimple was pissed. \"Damn this didn't work and instead made me <b>even weaker</b>. I'll have to find another way to activate my goals of world domination then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the table were several empty vials, the contents of which had been poured into the glass jar. The smell was both unbelievably disgusting reek, spiciness, and a sweet scent of strawberries. Walking up to the table was Tony, the small grey alien who lived with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait to try this muscle making stuff you brought for me Tony my man!\" The blue eyed blonde turned to look at his diminutive friend in his big red eyes. \"Now he can't call me fat anymore once I get rid of this extra weight.\" America was ignorant of the fact that it was all muscle, not fat with all the exercise he did, and England was merely insulting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will! Use it to humiliate that fucking limey!\" The rude little alien showing his usual irrational disdain for England. America's typical oblivious nature leaving him ignorant of the twos feud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony had left earth for a week to gather the ingredients necessary for a muscle growth formula with extreme popularity across the Galaxy. Except the strawberries, which came from Earth. Mankind must never know the most powerful and easiest way to gain muscle had one of its ingredients on their planet and that aliens have been coming to abduct and mass produce for a 100 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up!\" America cheerfully chugged down the jars contents in several gulps. A mix of spice and strawberry with a third unknown, but pleasant, smell despite the main smell produced. Once emptied, America wiped what pink cream was on his face with his red and blue shirts sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tasted fantastic! Can't wait to try more!\" He gave a thumbs up to Tony. \"So how much of that stuff did you get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough\".

He will come to regret that miscalculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's a good thing I called England to stop by here earlier. He'll be impressed once all the fat's gone.\" As he spoke the cream was slowly spreading through his frame, and with it a warm feeling as his body began to itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get the rest so I can start making more! Can't have enough of a good thing after all\" Hearing that, Tony nodded as he went to his UFO to get the device he stored it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I wonder when England will get here.\"</span></div></div>",

I've found the city I've sought out after months of searching!\" Telepathically spoke the red and black soul with a dragons face and wings spoke as he floated above Death City. Home to Lord Death and his DWMA. The creature tried to smirk to no avail as his face was a mere cosmetic of what he once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wandering for months has lead me to this place, and with it a chance of revenge against that cursed Great Old One of Order.\" This small soul was once an ancient and powerful dragon know only as Samael, his once fearsome powers dimished after being slain by that insufferable Excalibur from Death's legion before Asura ate Vajra. His unique powers over life and growth, capable of growing vast forests in a day, to making even the tiniest of mites into colossal terrors, were a threat. Not helped due to his stubborn refusal to stop spreading his power freely. His soul viewed too dangerous to even feed to a weapon due to his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis defeat did have <i>one</i> lucky thing happen, as his pitiful form ended up buried during his humble cave homes collapse. His soul perserved in to slowly regain power in dormancy. It wasn't till the emergence of Asura thanks to Medusa that he once again saw the light of day, insignificant Clowns spawned of madness releasing him by chance. \"I once had the potential to become a Great Old One myself until those fools slew me. Now I will regain my glory by becoming one with an unsuspecting Weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feebly floated closer to the school at its center below, trying to sense a Weapon with a voracious appetite willing to indulge in a free soul. \"Ah I've found one-ew I sense Death spawned another prpgeny too. Hopefully he'll be easier to deal with than the last.\" Remembering back to the creepy Kishin, he flew towards the room of a certain white haired teen with sharp teeth....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====At Soul and Makas apartment====<br>\r\nSoul was in his bed, his mouth full of sharp teeth open wide as he snoozed. His dreams weren't of anything important. He dreamed happily of a large pile feast of souls rising into the sky before him, the Spartoi was shirtless as he went to work eating numerous tasty light blue orbs before him. His flat stomach was bloated outwards from the delicious souls, his scar likewise stretched across his bloating belly. \"No way you'll best me.\" Soul cockily declared to someone on the other side of the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This -mmf- is nothing!\" The voice was his friend Black Star. The blue haired Ninja was eating souls like Soul was, though he was clearly struggling more than his friend as a small paunch had only began to form. \"You can't hope to match up to me!\" He lied through his teeth as he pushed another human soul down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure man\" Soul chuckled as he ate another. Their contest continuing in the dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soul of Samael took several hours to float down before Souls window. He was blessing his luck that that the window was open. \"Trying to get inside places without limbs is a nightmare.\" He eyed around the room before glimpsing sleeping Souls form, the Demon Weapon he had sensed with a love of souls. \"Not impressed. But he'll do.\" He floated down to Souls mouth, hoping he will move forth and eat him, he doesn't want to choke his vessel afterall!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul slept peacefully, his dream belly bulging enormously as he shoved soul after soul, wanting to become the most powerful in the world, one who could easily challenge the gods, even as Black Star tried to keep up. He licked his lips, drool leaking out of the side of his lips as he enjoyed his dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pitching a decent tent, his dream was erotic enough, as one hand rubbed it unconsciously. Azazel floated around, examining Soul, he was curious enough about his new vessel. Although his eyes were closed, he took a closer look, taking advantage of Soul's shirtless state. He didn't have very much defined musculature, but what he did have he could tell was solid. The only defining characteristics he had were  his white hair, scar across his chest, and curiously sharp teeth. Perhaps he even had a bit of monster blood in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did think the lad wasn't big enough downstairs at least, but he would save that for when he was his vessel. Though some practice wouldn't hurt. His red soul glowed brighter just a little bit, as a red aura settled over Soul's crotch. He couldn't manage too much, as Soul moaned, his hand finding so much more to grab as his pajama's grew tighter. If Azazel could take a deep breath he could. That slightly exhausted him, even though he wasn't too much bigger, but it was enough to put Soul above the curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was still dreaming about eating Soul's, but it was kind of weird, especially since he was trying to eat the souls, but they started whacking him in the face. He'd try to grab one, then it'd whack him in the face, repeating over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy! Let me eat you!\" He shouted, tic mark throbbing on his forward, till he saw one soul pull particularly back. \"Wait, wait, stop!\" He shouted, as it started to rush forward. *THWACK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" Soul gasped awake, \"Damn it! I was liking that dream!!\" He shouted, not yet paying attention to his boner. He blinked as he realized there was something in there with him. \"Huh?\" He muttered, as he realized, there was a red soul as well, bouncing up and down, as if it was trying to get his attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice! Thank you for the meal!\" He clapped his hands together as he grabbed the soul by to eat it. He shuddered, as he could feel so much power flowing into him from the soul. His eyes rolled back into his head it was so sweet. He was barely even aware as he came from the taste, soaking the the front of his pajamas. He wasn't even aware from the extra inch it added up front as he fell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Azazel had a mouth, he would grin, finally so happy he had a  vessel, one to improve. Of course his powers were limited for now, but the more souls that his figure consumed... he took a moment to look through his vessel's memories, Soul, that's an apt name... the more souls Soul consumed, the more growth Azazel could bestow, able to become the perfect Great One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly got to work with what he had, just adding just a bit of muscle now. He could only get so much for now, even if he was a Death Scythe. It wasn't a lot, but it was enough to add the barest hints of definition. Soul wobbled slightly even as this was going on, unaware of what was happening. While Azazel tried to do what he could, other smaller changes happened as well, his pupils becoming just slightly more ovaliod, and his ears just slightly more pointed. Both exhausted, Soul collapsed, while Azazel himself chose to sleep, eager for what other changes he could do.</span></div></div>",

The white haired death scythe ignored the heat that soon warmed his skin as he tried to sleep even through fhe daylight. His body adjusting to the unique soul inside him as it tried to absorb the being inside, yet Azazel Samaels willpower protected him from his host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul drooled as his dreams of souls continued. A flash stormed into the room, seeming to disappear as Soul snoozed on. It didn't last long as a certain ninja was growing bored of watching him sleep, jumping down on Souls bed and causing him to bounce. \"Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyahaha! I caught you by surprise!\" Black Star happily gloated as his friend was completely taken by surprise. Azazel Samael still slumbered despite the noise, pleasantly thinking of a mighty dragon form to reign over all as a Great One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Black Star *yawn* why'd you go and wake me from a perfectly good dream?\" Soul put a hand in his shirt as he scratched his scar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou won't believe this! Lord Death is having shipped to the school: a massive amount of souls from dangerous killers!\" Black Star beamed as he pointed at DWMA out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the world souls and shipped was enough to awaken the red creature from its slumber, he listened with intent as Soul talked to the mysterious blue haired kid he assumed was a loud brat just from sight. \"Lord Death typically has us hunt for souls to get stronger. Wonder why he's having them shipped in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel was having the same thought before attempting an evil grin on his near featureless soul. He cared not for the reason.<i> \"Best use this to my advantage heh heh heh.\"</i> He began to pump an intense craving for souls into Soul's body' slowly reverberating with intensity following every heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants to make it easier for future students to get strong I heard.\" Black Star mentioned to his white haired frienc. \"Right now they should be stationed over at a storage facility before being shipped directly to DWMA tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling hunger, especially one for some sweet souls overtake him, Soul smiled as he touched his left pointed ear. \"Sounds like a light snack to satisfy my breakfast.\" He quickly changed out of his clothes as he continued talking with Black Star. The blue haired boy now standing on his dressure. \"I bet you want to see me eat all those delicious souls.\" A toothy sharps grin crossed his face before continuing \"No eonder Tsubaki isn't here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to bring ber along. But she said i needed to let her do her important business instead. No idea what she meant by that though\" The blue haired ninja shrugged, not worried since he wants to watch Soul stuff himself with murderous souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally dressed Soul smiled \"Well then let's get going. I'm starving for a decent snack\" He patted his stomach as the two walked to the storage area. No guards were on standby when they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if no ones here best not to go through the front entrance. Looks like its up to you.\"  Soul unashamedly jumps into Black Stars arms bridal style, held by the ninjas nicely toned muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away. Yahoo!\" Black Star cried as he jumped over the gate and ran towards the vehicle storing all those tasty souls. Souls that the evil little dragon soul and his host would enjoy.</span></div></div>",

The three happily talking as they walked under the Sakura blossoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a new outfit for Sakura to wear when she's capturing Clear Cards!\" Tomoyo cheerfully told Li as she showed him a picture of it on her phone. A beautiful pink dressed with sakura petal patterns across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very pretty! I think Sakura would look good in it.\" Li said as he saw the dress, Sakura was blushing in embarrassmentas she overheard them talking about another one of the many outfits Tomoyo loves to make her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to stop the two who were fanrasizing her in that dress, Sakura quickly thought of a good idea to distract them. \"Oh look over there! I think I see a Clear Card causing trouble!\" With that she was off and disappeared faster than they could keep track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Sakura!\" Both cried out for her as she disappeared. The two unsure if they could follow since Sakura sometimes faced them in a space isolated on her lonesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Sakura's little attempt to get away from her gushing crush and best friend, a new, never before seen Clear Card was nearby. A green robe hooded figure covered in flowers and vegetation, a single arm hidden beneath its robes. The Grows hooded head was just high enough over the fence to watch Li and Tomoyo. The vegetation near it growing in size. Seeds growing into full size plants while grass grew in all form from tiny specks fo tall, healthy vegetation others would want to mow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt moved across the air as it trailed both within its sights.  The Grows hood completely focused on Li. A small bird flew by as it continued its stalking, growing nearly half its own size in size and healthy muscular mass before it exited its range and kept flying onwards. The Grow had some objective that oddly did not involve Sakura as a vine extended feom its sole arm. Moonflowers cover its vine like limb, radiating moon magix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi paused for a sexond to turn and look in The Grow's direction. \"What's wrong Li?\" Tomoyo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grow had been wise enough to hide behind the wal, unveilings it moon magic brought attention due to the boys affinity with said magic. Luckily Li saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I sensed something. Must be my mistake.\" Li shrugged it off as him and Tomoyo continued walking. He dropped his guard even as he sensed that magic nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up and seeing its chance, The Grow swung its vine at Li. The vine nearly touched him as if it had failed. The white morning glories however tore off the vine to collide with the back of Li's shirt. They turned into a white glow that softly melded with the boy as the vine was pulled back to The Grow, who quickly began to flee the area and leaving a nice trail of flowers blooming as it moved across as batch of seeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" Li wondered what this nice feeling was as the moon magic vanished. He shrugged it off in a second to continue talking with Tomoyo as they head for Sakura's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived Sakura was at the door. Having beat them both she wanted to wait. Seeing the two she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you catch the Clear Card Sakura?\" Tomoyo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura froze up and looked away, guilt clearly getting her. \"N-no.\" She stuttered, not wanting them to figure out the lie. Tomoyo's smile on the other hand made it clear she already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of card was it?\" Li innocently asked, not realizing the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was doing weird things with metal and making metal birds that flew away. Yeah that's it!\" Sakura bluffed, digging herself deeper due to the embarrassment if Li learned the truth at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three continued talking as they entered the Kinomoto household. A trail of grass and weeds began to grow upwards as The Grow looked on from afar, just far enough that Sakura would not sense it. Perhaps it wanted to see the changes to Li?</span></div></div>",

Normally I just narrate what's going on instead. In my head.\"</i> The pink haired, psi-limiter wearing boy asked as he realized what kind of story he was in. <i>\"Well this will be nothing but trouble for me. But as usual I can't escape these kinds of situations. I'll ready myself for playing your game for now writer.</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to his fate as soon as it began, but no less annoyed by it, Saiki turned on the tv to watch something to help soothe his heart before the coming madness. Unfortunately, the writer made sure he caught sight of people he knows in every showed he past and try to ignore with the changing of each Channel. What annoyed him was his parents appearing on a show about about vacation spots in other countries, showing them both enjoying a nice vacation in Hawaii. His father making a fool of himself as usual with his tongue out and being stung by numerous bugs while his mother smiled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Awfully convenient for you isn't it, writer?</i>\" Saiki sacastically commented, realizing exactly how his parents won that free trip to Hawaii for an entire week. He'd assume it was his annoying masochist of an older brother in an attempt to compete with his psychic younger brother. Trying to best Saiki only to lose and be a little <i>too</i> happy losing against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when a convenient knock at the door started. <i>\"Better check to make sure it's no one I know.\"</i> Using telepathy he began to observe the mind outside. Thankfully it was just a delivery man, who tired of waiting for him to answer the door as five minutes passed, just brought over the multiple boxes unknown items before getting back into his vehicle and leaving. Sighing in relief it isn't any of them to make the soon to be disaster worse, Saiki activated his X-Ray vision to see what's inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's-!\" Saikis green tinted glasses started to feel the heat of his vision as Saiki lost control of himself for just a second. In each of those boxes was nothing but coffee jello. The package had his name on it meaning they were all his. His favorite snack for him to indulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash he had teleported all the boxes in front of him, another teleport taking a coffee jello out of the boxwithout opening it. Peeling back thd top as hd telekinetically brought a spoon over from the kitchen, Saiki smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good grief. You may be a pervert but I thank you for this delicious treat!\"</i> Saiki happily thought as he started indulging. A loving smile crossing his face as he enjoyed the sweet taste of the first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is definitely a trap you set up for me. Coffee Jello is just too good to pass up however. I wouldn't do this for any normal sweet.\" </i>He took another bite as a a different but still happily smile crossed it.  <i>\"Okay that's not true. I was a glutton at Saiko Mitori's house when he bought tons of sweets I could eat for free. I have to give people the idea I have standards though.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that was all part of the writers plan as Saiki unknowingly consumed a special superpower formula his brother Saiki Kusuke had tried to make, but finding being all powerful no fun against his brother, threw it all away a day later. Now his younger brother indulged himself in a confectionary filled with said substance that will make his world ending power greater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though once he learned what perverted stuff the box could do was enough to get him to take it home instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====An hour hour====<br>\r\n\"You want to dispose of this?\" Rias had asked the fallen angel. The clubs demon president was perplexed by it. \"Isn't this a legendary power capable of granting any desire?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is. Even the most perverse and lewd of wishes can be made reality.\" The advisor mentioned to the young devil. Unaware Issei was listening in on the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'll make my harem kickstart as soon as possible!\" Issei mused, going through such trouble when he ends up married to at least twenty women and a child with each in the future. Running off to prepare to take it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo naturally he didn't hear the next part. \"The being on the other side of this thing is an Issei level pervert and has some...interesting tastes. So I immediately stopped his wish granting after the first one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Present====<br>\r\nIssei was already out of the school, carrying the box with him as he headed home. \"Can't wait to use you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for him to get home, where he decides to enter from the back so Rias, the other girls, and his parents won't figure out he's home just yet. Making sure to be as quiet as possible as he headed upstairs to his room. Having stealthily arrived in his beedroom without anyone noticing, Issei happily laughed as he put it down on his bed. \"All right! Let's see what this can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered seeing the instructions next to it, but in his haste hadn't thought about reading or grabning them. So began a long process of hitting it with blunt objects, messing with the symbols carved into it, and Issei yelling at it to make his dreams of a harem true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an hour passed Issei had finally become fed up \"Fine! My dream of a boob and harem paradise may not happen but I can still dispose of you!\" He yelled with frustrated tears as he held it above his head, his hands pressing two carved symbols with no meaning in his world at the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whirring began to hum through it as the carvings glowed, instantly bringing to life the box as it began shaking. \"Best put this down.\" Issei beamed with joy as he put it on the floor, rubbing his hands together in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the top open forth as a mesh of tendrils began to emerge forth and place themselves across the floor, a trail of unknown goop that glowed red left behind as they slithered about. \"That's nasty.\" Soon the tendrils began going for his bed \"Ah no not there!\" He quickly tossed them away, which spurred the being beyond to speak forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"__________\" it's voice incomprehensible and even seemd to cause objects around the room to vibrate from it. Seeking to comprehend where it was at, it tapped into Issei's head from the realm beyond. It received the info it sought from Issei's head, remembering which world it's portal was in. Soon the tendrils retreated back to the box<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"________\" Soon gave way to a telepathically sent its thoughts directly to Issei's head. <i>\"Being of the DxD universe, what is your wish?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Issei cheered. \"My wish is to make it easier for me to get my harem! No brainwashing though. I want it to be consensual! And make it so my furture self has more time for all the girls and my kids!\" The greedy hybrid asked for more on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProcessing his wish, a puddle of red ooze erupted from the box and landed on the flood. <i>\"'That's...incredibly boring.\"</i> The being beyond sounded irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with a guy wanting a harem! Ain't that right Ddraig?\" He talked to his sacred gear, Boosted Gear, which the legendary red dragon of Britain was a part of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now you remember me! I figured something like this would happen the moment you got that scheme in your head.\" The green orb on the gear glowing with each word Ddraig spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon man you gotta agree with me in these situations!\" Issei talked back, but the being beyond did not care for their squabble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I care not what you desire. I am an Outer God, a being that abandoned my world. _______, He of World Ending Desire. I will make a wish this day, but it will be one that satisfies me! So prepare yourself as the center of my desire devil\"</i> Scanning his body, he was apparently a human shaped dragon rather than a mere human after Great Red reforged his flesh in the dimensional gap <i>\"dragon man thing! Hehehe\" </i>The box instantly closed and with a puff vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like this at all.\" Issei grumbled as he rubbed his head. \"My floor is even covered in weird red stuff now.\"</span></div></div>",

Gold Lion armor vs Red Dragon armor as they punched and smashed into each other. \"BOOST! BOOST! BOOST!\" The voice emitted from the green orb of the Red Dragon as he pummeled into the stomach of the Lion, cracking the armor as a smirk emerged on the man clad in golds face as blood trickled down his lip. The defeated red haired maiden of the pervert clad  in red watching from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad Issei. But it'll take more than that to beat me!\" The man clad in the Nemean Lion raised his fists and smashed into Isseis back, sending Issei crashing down into thd cloudy earth, a heavy gust borne of the crater sending the clouds away once again. The pervert Issei lay motionless as his foe came down to earth nearby, pieces of golden armor flaking off to expose his pectorals and abs visible through his tight shirt. Walking ever so slowly to his opponent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir audience drink in the sight from the stadium in the Demon World. Their teammates and fans of the Oppai Dragon Eyes glued to the screen. \"Could this be the end of this exciting match ladies and gentlemen!? Has the Strongest Youth bested the Red Dragon Emperor and won?\" The demon annoucer Naud Gamigin said with enthusiasm as he took in the sight with the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah...hah...hah...Sairaorg really knows how to kick ass doesn't he Ddraig?\" Blood dripped down his forehead as part of his helm had broken off to expose his face, Issei moving his left armored hand to wipe the blood away. <br>\r\nThe kids in the stadium cheering as they saw him move \"Oppai Dragon! Oppai Dragon!\" Oblivious to the conversation.<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Did you notice what I did partner?\" The green orb glowed as the dragon spoke from within the Sacred Gear. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. Full power my ass. He's holding back a different trump card than the Nemean Lion.\" The form of Sairaorg drew ever closer to his collapsed opponent.<br>\r\n\"Issei\" Concern was apparent on Rias face as she saw him on the ground, soon struggling to get back up on his feet as Sairaorg was within range of a quick hit if needed.<br>\r\n\"Are you still ready to battle Issei?\" One fist up as Sairaorg Bael prepared to move in.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but first you need to get serious and show the other power you have kept hidden!\" Anger visible as he sprinted right into range to hit Sairaorg in his unprotected chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Sairaog replied as he quickly responded by smashing both arms into each side of Isseis armored ribs, causing an \"Argh!\" to erupt from his perverted opponent as the two continued their brawl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see! You sensed that ability of all things!\" Sairaorg grunted as he kicked Issei into thd ground, only for a charged \"BOOST FANG CANNON!\" cbeam to send him skyward. Isseis wings emerging to reach his foe in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we sensed it. That power you kept hidden is obvious even with you wearing Regulus!\" Issei rellied back as they began to descend into a bralw of nonstop punching in the celestial heaven above. Sairoargs left arm comlletely unprotected as the gold armor covering it was destroyed by the beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sorry! But that power is...well it's not something I can use in ordinary situations.\" Sairaorg grabbed Isseis arm and tossed him down into the ground again, second crater overlapping the first one as he descended down to attack, Issei quickly flying back up as the two punched the other in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shouldn't matter in a match like this! What kind of men would I be if I don't play with Presidents breasts for powerups!?\" Issei spat through a fist covered by fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize Issei Ryodou. I personally asked Master to keep it a secret for only when I'm in my sealed human form.\" The Nemean Lion Regulus spoke as a glowing light on the helm of Sairaorgs forehead. \"But if you want to see the power my master awakened through training his body to the limit don't you dare regret this decision!\" The two rivals distanced themselves as they landed upon solid ground once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the stadium the crowd whispered to themselves what sort of power could it be? \"A technique beyond even his trump the Nemean Lion!? What could the Lion King display for us in this match!\" The anmouncer yelled with glee to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Sairaorg he looked up to where the Lions consciousness resides \"You sure Regulus? You and the rest of the team know about it but its a technique Id rather keep secret till my grave. I mean what if my mom wakes up and sees?\" Sairaorg rubbed his head as he thought of his mother still in her coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do master.p! It's time you showed Issei Hyoudou your full power!\" The Nemean Lion spoke as he began to glow, separating himself from Sairaorg into his mighty lion form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't even waiting to give me a choice eh?\" The lion nodded to Sairaorgs comment. \"Heh. I guess I'll be known as a pervert in my own right for this.\" He smash his fist into his hand before closing his eyes. His body calmly overflowing with energy as he focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei stood there dumbfounded. \"What gives!? Why are you removing Regulus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gold lion was the one to reply back. \"Unfortunately the power you so crave to be unleashed can't be contained within me. We tried once in the past to no avail. Now excuse me but I'm getting miss Gremory as far away from here as possible.\" The glowing Golden Lion didn't even give Issei time to reply back as he zipped past him to grab Rias via his teeth, digging into her shirt as he tossed her on his back and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Issei!\" Rias was confused as the two fled as far as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Rias!!\" Issei looked behind as he called out, only for Ddraig to speak.<br>\r\n\"Focus partner! It seems whatever is going with Sairaorg is about to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch.\" Issei closed his eyes as he turned away from the fleeing lion, opening his eyes to turn his full attention to Sairaorg. The glowing white aura around him becoming a majestic purple as it continued to envelop him and spread out him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaaaaaaahhhhhh.....\" Sairaorg spoke in silence as the aura erupted in a massive aura of power! Shickwaves pushing everything away around him as it started to make Issei lose his footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! Ddraig!\" The Dragon-Devils body was tossed in the air as it was pushed away from the vicinity, forcefully digging his clawed armored hand into the ground.<br>\r\n\"BOOST! BOOST!\" Two mechanical wing like portrusions with sharp ends erupted from his back to stab the ground. Isseis eyes blocked off by the force of wind from seeing the sight before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Boobir Dragon Emperor struggled to keep his place, the Stadiums screens began to suffer static as each screen slowly disappeared. Leaving the audience in the dark.<br>\r\n\"Uh...for the first time in Ratings Games history we seem to be suffering technical difficulties.\" Naud Gamigin said in surprise \"Hopefully its fixed soon so we can see the climax!\"<br>\r\n\"Boo! Fix the magic!\" Cries called out of Devils watching. Wanting the technology and magic used to fix it to be repaired as the battle continued fo escalate.<br>\r\n\"Is Oppai Dragon going to lose!? No way! Oppai Dragon never loses!\" The children cried as their hero was left struggling.<br>\r\n\"Issei...\" Kiba, Gasper, and the girls spoke as they saw him left trying to hold on.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the battle itself the shockwaves soon calmed down, Ddraig auickly retracting the protrusions as Issei dug his hand out of the earth, looking up as his eyes ooened to see what happened to his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSairoarg Baels aura calmed down as he was left in an extremely tight but growing shirt with no other clothes as he...</span></div></div>",

You'd have no chance without us!\" Emma beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it Emma or I might blurt some secrets of yours I've remembered.\" Ray chuckled to himself, piquing Norman's interest while Emma wondered what secrets he knew. And its thanks to him Isabella even got them the required substances, much less the demons believing it all to be harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the three vials they had mixed had finished. \"Nevermind that for the moment. This is almost done.\" They then took turna pouring them together into a singular bottle, the glowing green, dull orange, and dark magenta slowly becoming a dark black sludge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's done but ugh! That smell is rancid.\" Emma said in embarassment as even having to smell of that goo made her want to barf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us pour it in the individual cups then.\" Norman smiled as Ray brought out cups. Ray began pouring an equal amount that filled to the top of each cup as it slowly oozed out. He had a look that could kill to inform the other two he thought it was disgusting too. The contents filled each cup to the brim, with there still being half left over. \"Looks like there's more to drink if we need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids each grabbed a cup, plugging their nose with their free hands as they began chugging down the slow moving black gunk.

He had brought more fertilizer, seeds and tools than they could ever use in an one hour science class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow octopus started talking about the seeds, how they contained a baby plant, an embryo, and nutrients in an area called endosperm. He also mentioned the types of seeds, how are they formed from the flower, how the grow into a plant... too much information for middle school students, but Koro always managed to make his lessons interesting and light for his pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he explained some basics about farming, how they had to be planted and cared to get a healthy vegetable... and gave a demonstration: He carefully planted a few of the thousands of seeds he had bought earlier a watered a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the class and he stayed silently, staring to the plowed soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we'll have to wait for a few weeks before the seeds become grown-up plants...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds more of silence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to stay looking at them during the rest of the hour??\" Terasaka complained, growing bored.<br>\r\n\"I don't think they're going to be able to grow... it's almost winter.\" Karma observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his teacher, getting more and more nervous, made up a shortcut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I could give them a special help to make them grow faster and so, continue the lesson...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook one of his tentacles, which changed its color to green, and then twisted it in an spiral until it released a few droplets of a strange liquid.

He didn't want to admit it, but it was clearly for everyone he had been in the receiving end of a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aggressors weren't unknown either... all Class D was angry by Class E high scores in the last semester exam, much higher than theirs. That had hurt their pride and some of them got revenge by bulling the smallest, Nagisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't defenseless after all those hours training to be a killer, and at first he could avoid, escape or defend himself from his bullies, but days later class D reacted by gathering half of the class to attack him. 13 against 1, he couldn't do anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoro-sensei frowned, dying to do something to stop the bulling, but he wasn't sure what (he couldn't kill the bullies, that was against the rules of the school).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plants kept growing behind him, they were now bigger that the average... that gave Karma an dangerous idea to help his friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the watering can without being noticed, filled a glass with its mixture and offered it to his sore classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" He said with a smile before drinking it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, the plants had become so incredible big they were menacing to crush the class with their weight.

He counted 11 of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think your wallet is nearby... please let's come back.\" Nagisa begged, they hadn't been spotted yet.<br>\r\n\"Those are the ones who were bulling you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes... but I managed to avoid them lately...\" Nagisa noticed a sadistic smile in his friend's face. \"You never lose your wallet, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Those bullies won't stop looking for you every morning to beat you up.\" He continued his speech \"They won't stop until...\" The boy got out of the shadows and waved his hand to them \"...you ask them POLITELY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the bullies bit the bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, aren't those losers from the Class-E...?\" Said one of them, with a sadistic look on his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Mm? You looks familiar...\" The leader of the delinquents recalled the short blue hair boy they beat up two days ago \"Are you the big brother of that smurf?\"<br>\r\n\"No, he's the blue dwarf!\" Karma confessed \"He has hit a growth spurt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagisa wished Karma would shut it down. He didn't want more conflicts but those idiots.<br>\r\nFortunately, they weren't as inclined to hit him as before. They still wanted to look menacing and intimidating, but they were more eaguer to face a weak 159cm kid than two stronger 175cm and 180cm guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing it, Nagisa signed alleviated. \"We won't have to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're the retarded ones who have been hitting my pal, right?\"<br>\r\n\"!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagisa's hopes vanished as his red friend kept talking and the bullies' rage grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful with what you said, E-weirdo.\"<br>\r\n\"Eleven against one, that was so brave... Are you valiant enough to try again against two, or that's too much for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaaand the fight started. The insulted leader and two of his henchmen jumped over Karma. The red boy had confidence he would win thanks to their killer training, although the exhaustion from the PE class slowed him down enough so it wouldn't be fast or easy. He could knock out their boss with a pair of punches, but the other two weren't so easy (when he tried to focus on one, the other attacked him from behind). It took him 15 seconds to make the second idiot fall, and when he was going for the third a flying bully landed over his next victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was be thrown by our tall Nagisa. There were no more villains, the blue boy had already defeated the other 7. Karma couldn't believe he had done it in the same amount of time the devil boy needed to finish two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratched and hurt, the bullies decided to escape pitifully... before leaving one threatened to get revenge, but Karma didn't take it seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens returned to the class building, Nagisa didn't talk to him, angry due to the fight he put him in, but he also felt relief: he wouldn't have to face those guys (or that was what he believed)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma's plan was a complete success:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-He had taught a lesson to those jerks about messing with his friend [CHECK] (only Karma could mess with him)<br>\r\n-He had pranked Nagisa, forcing him to come school with ridiculously small clothes [CHECK, although it ended too fast for his taste]<br>\r\n-He solved Nagisa's height complex [CHECK?] (Actually Karma didn't care much about that, he only wanted action and fun)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...despite all that, he was uneasy. If a point of the mischief was pranking Nagisa, at the end Karma was the one who had lost to him in several areas, and that felt humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if the growth continues the next days?\" Karma hadn't actually think about that possibility before, but after seeing the giant garden again and how some plants kept growing at irregular paces, that fear grew. \"The difference between us would become massive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, Karma knew what he had to do.</span></div></div>",

It was laying almost empty on a table as the other boys were changing his sweated clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... who did...?\" He asked with a thin voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was yours? Sorry, Karma, but we were so thirsty after PE that when we found the water we drink it without a second thought.\" Y\u016bma Isogai, the handsome but poor class representative, apologized \"I'll bought you another later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma didn't answer, just gave him a killing glare<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was hidden in a locked cupboard... this wasn't an easy accident, someone took it on purpose... but does that person know what the mixture does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma looked down to the bottle and made some quick calculous: Assuming his classmates had drunk the same amount, they would have received roughly half dose of the hormones. The remaining amount was a dose a half, maybe a little more, but less than the liquid Nagisa drank the previous days. It should be enough to avoid the others to surpass him, but he wasn't so sure about defeating Nagisa, that would depend of his luck and genetics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I only has to trick Korosensei to give me more mixture.\" He planned as he drank the mixture, without wasting a single drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he decided to change his clothes too (sweated and dirty by the exercise and fight). While he was removing his shirt he noticed Nagisa was nearby. He was half naked, examining his pecs and biceps with a worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Karma... do I look different?\" He asked as he approached \"Like... a little bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma knew what he was talking about. He had watched his body carefully that morning when he arrived, admiring his prank (maybe that hormonal teen had other interests besides that),  and although he was pretty muscular then he seemed to have gained a few pounds of muscle during the last hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs, biceps, thighs were thicker, his shoulders were a little broader, and Karma noticed his head was 5cm higher... That confirmed his worries about the growth continuing time after the last dose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, it wasn't a difference so considerable to be noticed by anyone but the owner of the body and the prank maker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" He lied. \"I think you haven't got used to your new body yet\"<br>\r\n\"I guess so. It has been a hell of a growth spurt\" Nagisa continued undressing, removing his pants, exposing a pair of muscular legs. His undies, still on, were constricted by a distractingly huge bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes they are. And sometimes they last longer than we expect...\" Karma rambled as he did the same, with a eye on his underwear as the boy took it off slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big flaccid cock, easily 14cm long (5.5\"), wriggled in the air. Long, but a little thin, which made him look even longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering about how big would be hard, Karma felt strange, intense sensations when he saw it, but he wasn't sure if they were positive or negative ones. He never expected his considerably big 11cm (4.3\") long soft cock (19cm / 7.5\" hard) could be defeated by anyone outside porn movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe concluded what he was feeling was envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe tomorrow it will be my turn.\" He said with a false nice smile. Inside his soul, he was smiling too, but that smile was dark and evil, at the idea of towering over him and making him feel the same uneasy feeling the blue boy had been making him feel. \"Or everyone's turn.\" He thought, as he remembered everyone had taken a little of the unstable substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day...</span></div></div>",

Eyes half closed as his fondly recalls dreams of towering like a monster over his poor, harmless, for Knight-Sensei, barely trying to match the mighty blows of a horned red haired giant with a villainous smile crossing his face. Supersonic blows of numerous tentacles losing out to one arm of the behemoth as the ground around them was torn apart by the impact of both.. His other handing holding Princess-Nagisa, forced into a frilly pink dress despite his new bulk ripping it in places. Nagisa's face blushing red as Monster Karma cackled above. The awakening Karma's mind stopped drifting off from his previous fantasy as eyes fully opened to stare at his body. A smug smirk crossing his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body had grown, legs dangling off the bed by easily 15 cm (6 in) hanging off the bed, nude save for the tight boxers desperately clinging to his monstrous bulge. \"Looks like I had a big growth spurt~!\" He had grown easily 45 cm (1.5 feet) in height to a whopping 220 cm (7.2 ft.) ! His body musculature had easily surpassed Nagisa's,, giving them a flex that was about 50% larger than Nagisa's the day before and admiring his larger, wider shoulders. Hands soon moving to feel his pecs and give them a nice squeeze. \"Mmmm~ That's the stuff!\" Karma loved it every bit of indulging his new pleasure as he felt more of himself, caressing those thick beautiful thighs carved from living stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like my genetics were perfect for that stuff. It's helped me grow really big. So sad about Nagisa. He took two doses and grew so little. Heheheh....What sort of things can I make him do?\" He stopped his self -worship to jump out of bed, landing with a heavy thud that shook his room. He took a single step to arrive to his drawers and pull from it an outfit that was larger than his original height yet still 10 cm (4 in) smaller than he imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I bought this to wear today.\" Sinister grin plastered all over as he thought of Nagisa being overshadowed by him in every way. It was in his mind only fair after he made Nagisa grow to award Karma by becoming a lackey. \"It'll be just tight enough I can flex out in class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting it on, and not caring it would likely enrage the school, Karma confidantly put on the tight uniform as he began his strode to Kunugigoaka Junior High. His bulk taking up the street as he confidently took each step and made passerbys avoid him. Those dumb enough to walk wifh eyes glued to their phones, bumping into the red haired mini-giant, rescinding their complaints  before  they could even begin blaming Karma once their eyes drank in the glorious sight of the crimson haired god before them.<i> \"That's what I like from ants. Knowing their place.\"</i>. Ominous chuckling followed as he strolled ever onwards to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had taken the longest route possible just for the hell of it, knowing everyone would arrive before him. He didn't want the big surprise spoiled until he greeted them all with a planned surprise attack on Sensei. He soon arrived at the path on the mountain to classroom 3-E. \"Everyone will be shocked by the new me.\" He continued his travel up the path surrounded by foliage and bushes with a cheerful hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes though a large hand reached out and pulled the larger and heavier Karma with ease into the greenery. \"What t-mmhf!\" Karma's surprise got cut off by a thick pair of pecs suddenly pressed into his face, making his eyes widen in shock at just how big and strong these pecs felt, yet soft to his touch. Easily larger than his own as his head was nestled into them. Almost enough to happily sleep on them as a pillow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking that idea off, Karma looked up to a light blue haired boy looking down at him as envy started filling up the genius red head at the sight. \"Nagisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karma! You gotta tell me what you gave me!\"</span></div></div>",

(The girls and staff were too) Everyone in Class E had grown! The shortest were Itona and Kimura at 6\u20193. 4 inches taller than Karasuma. The tallest surprisingly wasn\u2019t Terasaka. It was Sugaya at 6\u201910. Everybody seemed to have shot up a foot in height. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, they were all more or less as muscular as Nagisa was yesterday! Sugino seemed to have the most mass, aside from Nagisa, probably since he played baseball. Nagisa noticed Terasaka with his gang, being the smallest, aside from Hazama of course.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat ever happened to you it seems\u201d Itona answered.<br>\r\n\u201cIs this how it felt Nagisa?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing!\u201d Muramatsu and Yoshida said ecstatic. From what Nagisa could tell, all the guys seemed happy when he grew, if not more so now they have themselves.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you guys get to grow? What about me?\u201d Terasaka shouted angrily as he did not grow and was still 5\u201911, and the only student still shorter than their teacher Karasuma.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re big enough already?\u201d They turned to see Karma walk.. Duck onto the classroom at 7\u20198 and shirtless.

He grew two inches, same height as Karasuma, and his clothes were now a size or two too small as his muscles had grown. Smirking, he left for school. Although it wasn\u2019t a huge change, it was more than Nagisa\u2019s first spurt. Karma had forgotten that the others had drank the mixture until he entered the classroom. He stood there with a fake smile to hide his shock. Terasaka, Muramatsu, Okajima, and Takebayashi all seemed unchanged. If they had, which they did, it was not enough to be shown through their clothes. The others were more notable. Kimura, Yoshida, and Mimura had grown taller as their wrists and part of their forearms were exposed from their sleeves. Sugaya and Chiba\u2018s muscles had grown as their clothes seemed a size too small, like Karma. Karma then saw Nagisa who did not seem unchanged from his last growth spurt.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Nagisa. Did everyone tick off their dry cleaners?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you did too, I think everyone had a similar growth spurt as I had yesterday.\u201d Korosensei came into the room with a sewing machine and tons of fabric.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all that for Korosensei?@ Karma asked. Before he answered, he zoomed around the classroom.<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t have my students in such ill fitting clothes! I sure these with will be suitable for the time being while we figure out the cause.\u201d Korosensei had made exact replicas of guy\u2019s uniforms to accommodate everyone\u2019s new size. Even Nagisa. As well as Itona who was now the same size as Nagisa.<br>\r\n\u201cCould you make some for us?\u201d Korosensei, Nagisa, and Karma turned to see Sugino and Hiroto who had to duck into the classroom sideways. As they were almost as tall as the ceiling and just as wide as the door.<br>\r\n\u201cOf coarse!\u201d Korosensei Said right before he put them on. \u201cNow, I think we will start with PE today as I need to change the classroom to accommodate your new sizes. I\u2019ve taken the liberty to make your workout clothes as well.\u201d With that Korosensei went off again. Upon changing, the guys joined the girls, who were sent outside earlier. Karasuma Was annoyed by the situation. If the rest of the school were to find out what happened to them. He was unaware of what Karma and Nagisa did which rises their suspicions. Irina was flabbergasted as she watched from inside the building.</span></div></div>",

As room after room turned up empty he had finally found his query when he heard the showers in the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting in Karma was terrified to the container completely empty, \"No no no no no no\" Karma muttered as the shower turned off. Turning to face the likely culprit things went from bad to worse as Terasaka sauntered out completely naked, \"OH...um...hey Karma. I thought everyone had left\" Terasaka said clearly embarrassed. \"DID YOU DRINK THIS?\" Karma yelled pointing at the container \"Uh yeah, sorry I didn't realize you were so attached to your water bottle\" Terasaka stammered, \"If you just let me grab a towel real quick I can fill it back up for you.\" \"Don't bother\" Karma chided. \"You want me to stay naked?\" Terasaka asked. \"Ugh no I mean don't fill...whatever. What matters is what you drank wasn't water.\" Terasaka, thinking he'd drank poison or something, abruptly tackled Karma to the ground \"WHAT THE HELL WAS IT!\" Terasaka bellowed. \"Get your dick out of my face and I'll tell you!\" Karma shot back. \"No chance I need answers first.\" \"FINE!\" Karma caved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Karma explained his elaborate \"prank\" on Nagisa (though embellishing somewhat on his jealousy) and how he had no way of knowing just how big Terasaka would get, Terasaka finally stood up off of Karma \"Shit man, that's insane.

Also if my clothes would just tear anyway I don't really think I should bother putting them.\" \"DUDE WTF\" Karma shouted \"I can already see you're boning up, you could at least get a tow-\" \"I seem to remember something poking my leg when I pinned you so why do you care.\" Terasaka interjected. \"I DON'T\" Karma sputtered turning away so Terasaka wouldn't see his face go as red as his hair, \"I'll just text Nagisa if you're <i>so</i> concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was just about to set as Nagisa raced up the hill.

Medicinal substances placed upon three scars penetrating into his flesh as a short teenage girl wrapped the injuries in bandages, small cups with the medicine nestled next to her and the fire in their tent. His right arm and left leg having similar bandages already tightly wrapped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were very lucky that time Sugimoto. To take on three wen kamuy at once and survive is a miracle.\" Asirpa still chastising him as she pulled the bandages as tightly as possible earning another \"Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Asirpa-san, but -OUCH- if I didn't act those bears would have eaten the skins.\" He recalled to them finding three bears at the tent, all of them had partaken in killing and eating human flesh, even killing nearby bears that hadn't, earning their name as evil gods (wen kamuy). They had left the skins leading to the Ainu treasure temporarily in the tent while they hunt for food. Their companions Tanigaki, Ogata and Shiraishi having headed out in the other direction for a distraction when several 7th Division flunkies nearly stumbled upon them. Ogata aiming to kill the soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left them with a nice stack of deer meat and fish now cooking around the heat of the fire as Asirpa finished patching him up. \"You still nearly got killed. Why if the third one hadn't missed your head you'd be dead right now!\" The biggest and angriest of the three had tried to bite his head, getting her fangs into his right arm instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I did turn it around and stabbed her in the head repeatedly a second later so it all worked out Asirpa-san!\" Sugimoto reminisced as he shot the first, used the first bears claws on the second as he stabbed it, and repeatedly stabbed the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you died....\" Asirpa lowered her head, eyes obscured from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asirpa-san....\" The messy haired mans face brightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for her face to rise up with eyes sparkling as drool dribbled \"Where would I get more osoma?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately a frown crossed Sugimotos face as color left it. \"You were worried about not being able to eat miso soup?\" Ever since he introduced it to her Asirpa still could not wrap her head around the fact Miso is not osoma (Poop) despite loving the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a deep *GRRROOOOWWWLLLL* emanated through the tent as their stomachs finished the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the deer meat doesn't fill us up lets eat the bear meat outside!\" Sugimoto chuckled as Asirpa looked famished at the thought of enjoying more delicious food. Finishing and putting up their medical supplies, the two happily worked to cook the food while waiting for the other three to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if I should tell Asirpa about the voices I heard as well</i> Sugimoto thought to himself as he cut up the deer meat, Asirpa humming Hinna Hinna to herself as she grilled the fish. <i>Nah Ill tell her another time.</i> The scarred, fit man continued chopping as the worked together and daydreamed of delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====An hour earlier====<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Sugimoto! I'll get you inside!\" The small girl declared as she dragged his body across the snow, mutilated corpses of two bears nearby and the third mostly intact and father away from their campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSugimoto was in a delirious state, half lost to unconsciousness as he bleed out, turning the snow beneath red. \"A...sir...pa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Excuse me! Can a mister 'Sugimoto Saichi' receive this message?\"</i> A mysterious voice from nowhere filled Sugimotos head, keeping him from knocking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes?</i> Sugimoto had no idea who this was, but he needed something to keep him struggling with his numerous injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah good. You need not know who I am, but you are accompanying an Ainu seeking to retrieve the gold, yes?\"</i> Sugimoto was about to respond only for the voice to continue. <i>\"Normally I would not interfere in the realm of man, but the other Kamuy want me to do something for once for fear of the gold becoming cursed. Not sure why, so what if humans turn into a dragon from cursed gold due to human greed? *Sigh* So I shall bestow upon you a blessing to ensure the young Asirpas success.\" </i>A wisp of pale white descended from the sky, unseen by Asirpa as she nearly reached the tent with his body, the small orb quietly flew into the semi-conscious Sugimotos ear. Unseen and almost forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Present Time=====<br>\r\nThe two were happily eating, delicious cooked deer, grilled fish, some small bits of bear, and some <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">osoma</span> miso. \"Nah there's no way that was real.\" Sugimoto smentioned aloud between bites with Asirpa ignorant as she flushed red from fulfillment at the miso soup. The two happily ate while they awaited their companions return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, who'd believe a Kamuy blessed him to help Asirpa?</span></div></div>",

The corpse falling with a thud as blood spread out across the ground and onto pink frilly magical girl clothes. The weapons pink haired wielder moving forth to bludgeon a green demon next with his Magic Wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby a pile of grotesque, mutilated, pink-green demon corpses gathered together. A long black haired man dressed in frilly blue magical girl clothes tossing with his strong arms the recent dead demon beaten by his best friend and crush, Saki Uno, into the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy *CRUNCH* the man dressed in frilly pink stained in demon blood crushed the last demons head in, its black eyes crying in fear as it struggled to live. A sigh emerging from Saki as a second *CRUNCH* was heard moments later as the demon clung to life from the first impact. Its head all gone now. \"That's the last one....\" Saki sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired Sakuyo Mikage gave Saki a thumbs up as he gripped the green monster and swung it into the pile, shaking the mass of dead as a few fell down. \"Nice job Saki.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But I'm too used to this. It doesn't even traumatize me anymore.\"  The girl turned boy lamented how much the contract with Kokoro-san and trauma involved left her facing the harsh reality of being a Magical Girl in this world. \"To think we stopped them before they could even try to locate and kidnap Mohiro.\" Normally the demons had already taken Saki's crush hostage. Thankfully for once they avoided him as a damsel.<br>\r\n\"Want to go hear my brother sing?\" Sakuyo asked as he poibted in the direction towards a concert Mohiro and his idol partner Hyoue were singing free for kids. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. We need to revert back to normal first.\" Saki glimpsed around. Nothing in this park vicinity but trees and fresh demon corpses. Yet when they started there was...\"Where's Kokoro-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scarred, glasses-wearing, Yakuza fairy was nowhere nearby. Especially odd as he was giving Saki crap just before he sensed the demons....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he under the demon pile?\" Sakuyo went over and casually pulled one out , flies buzzing around the destroyed head.<br>\r\nSaki waved his hand \"No way. He would be letting out ORAAAAS~ while flailing about helplessly.\" The imagine his deep voice filled with the Yakuza tone as he yelled at a rapidly bowing Saki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no answers the two walked towards the concert asking \"So where is he?\" Only for a text to vibrate their phones as Mohiro was walking by....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====Meanwhile in Tokyo Bay====<br>\r\nA white suited fairy mascot flew about, his phone sending him a weird emergency message during the battle. Now he had to flap his tiny fairy wings in his \"cute\" fairy form to the largest bay. \"Dammit. Said here its an emergency and for all fairies to come immediately. Have ta'call Saki and Sakuyo later.\" Grumbled Kokoro as he tried to figure out who sent this message. The sender was labelled Manager, which meant nothing since all Fairies basically managed their Magical Girls. He lolked around and saw nothing but people walking by on this small part of the massive bay. \"Where the hell is the emergency dammit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke those words, a massive storm emerged across the sky. Thunder erupting as it darkened the entire Bay. \"Ta'hell is this dammit. Like it happend on cue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly a portal emerged forth in the dark clouds above, demons falling down with cutesy \"Meeewwws\" and \"Chhhhiiiiiis\" as they fell into the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn this was a trap wasn't it!?\" The scarred fairy yelled as he saw it from afar. \"Gotta send a message to the two\" He began texting his two contractees as the water began to convulse, sickly pink and green energy beneath the waters suddenly coalesced and erupted into a giant monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet over here dammit and kick this demons ass Saki. - Kokoro<br>\r\nWhere are you Manager!? - Saki<br>\r\nDoesn't matter dammit! Chizillas returned in Tokyo Bay. - Kokoro<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Chizilla! The monster born from an a staff member of the cyborg Fujimoto brothers anime that became the vessel of numerous demons. Only for Saki and Sakuyo to Inazuma Kick it in one hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut gone was the body made of storyboarding and papers, now its body covered in armor like paiper-mache and its teeth made of blades. \"SRRROOONNNKKKK.....\" The beast roared as it sent out a beam of cutesy green and pink that blew up a chunk of the Bay that is part of Chiba Prefecture. The wr_tin_ be_om_ _o__e fro_ t_e bla_t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yakuza fairy was annoyed. \"The damn cheap Godzilla knockoff came back and even got a cheap version of Godzillas roar. Its powerlevel is nearly five times Saki and Sakuyos together! Better contact fairy world and see if we have the means to kick its ass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a beam of light crashed down nearby. The ground cracking as two girls turned men clad in magical girl clothes arrived. \"We're ready to fight Kokoro-san!\" Saki and Sakuyo cried out in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them was Mohiro, who ended up teleported by complete chance. The normally silent male Idol confused with a look of airheadedness to him as he sees his crush Ore (Saki) before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Akira and Yarai had collapsed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRion, Akira's best friend and his potential romantic interest, went across the corridors of the strange laboratory they were exploring, looking for the other students. It didn't take long before finding Mariya, the genius of their group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the plague it had been infecting the others!\" He exclaimed after examining the unconscious boys \"The myxomycete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had entered that abandoned building, they hoped to find some useful information about where they were, why there were dinosaurs and human ruins but no people, and they pretty much succeeded in that regard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, unfortunately, they also came upon the same plague which killed all the humans who lived there, a fungus which could grew on the skin of who touched it, causing fever, weakness and pain as it was extending until it killed its victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose teenagers had found a treatment to cure it by rubbing salt against the affected skin until the myxomycete was wiped.<br>\r\nMariya undressed the pair to repeat the treatment, but then he realized it wouldn't be so easy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe affected skin, which could be tell apart from the healthy one due to his strange color, was bruised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be... Had the pathogen invaded their insides??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the myxomycete was starting spreading by the blood stream, the salt treatment wouldn't be enough.<br>\r\nBoth teens searched that room and the adjacent ones, looking for something they could use to destroy the myxomycete.<br>\r\nEventually they went inside a room that looked like a laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found several antibiotics!\" Rion announced filled with hope.<br>\r\n\"They won't work! The myxomycete is a fungus, so they need antifungal drugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there weren't any. Rion was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! Where could I find something that kills antifungal...? Think, Mariya, think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the short nerd laid his eyes on certain shelf loaded with little bottles. He moved closer it and read their label.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rion! Help me to take all these bottles to their room!!\" He shouted as he grabbed as many as he could.<br>\r\n\"What are they?? Antifungals??\" He asked as they left the lab.<br>\r\n\"They're ADN samples from the dinosaurs they were cloning. They're suspended in a solution to preserve them... a mixture of antibiotics and antifungal.\" He explained with a smile in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they proceeded to inject them a dose of every bottle. When they finished, they stared at the immobile and pale bodies of Akira and Yarai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will... will it work?\" The girl felt even more anxious now they couldn't do anything but wait.<br>\r\n\"I don't know... but it's the only shot we have.\"<br>\r\n\"Could it hurt them?\"<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't. I read the ingredients of the bottles, the samples are inactive nucleotides, harmless, and the preservative solution are made of drugs that could be used in hospitals... but if the dose is excessive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes passes, and became hours and to their great relief they started to get better. Akira was the first one to wake up and thanked them for saving their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were chatting, Mariya's hand bumped with something. It was a pair of empty bottles a little different of the other ones.<br>\r\nThe two students were so in a hurry they hadn't noticed they had a different tag...<br>\r\nMariya's face grew palee when he finally read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Mariya?\" Akira asked, noticing the change.<br>\r\n\"N-no. Don't worry, just rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 bottles had gene editing therapy, something called BG-13. The kid searched between the lab documentation until he found what that meant.<br>\r\nIt seemed one of those scientists had discovered a shared gene between different large dinosaurs which was responsible of their great sizes.<br>\r\nThat unknown geneticist had been experimenting with that gene, injecting it to livestocks to increase their mass. The results of the experiments were extremely positive, registering and increase of skeleton and muscle mass. A few of the cows subjects grew to the size of a diplodocus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis experiment could have ended the world hunger, but the myxomycete outbreak ended his experiments (and his life) before it could be concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe BG-13 didn't seem dangerous (some results indicated it improved the health and livespan of the subjects), but that didn't calm Mariya down much...<br>\r\nA drug could have good effects on certain animals and be mortal for others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned to the room where his friends were, he hadn't decided if he should tell them (admitting his terrible mistake) or not.<br>\r\nThe only thing he was clear about is that he had to watch them carefully.</span></div></div>",

When Akira opened his eyes, he felt filled with energy, despise his almost dying the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill laying on his bed, he looked at his right and saw Junichi Mutou examining Yarai. As a physiotherapist, Junichi was the closer thing to a doctor in the island (excluding certain psycho pharmaceutical)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason Akira stayed silent and watched his friend's checkup. The blond student was sitting shirtless in front of the doctor. Dr. Junichi wasn't small, but his figure couldn't eclipse the bigger body of the teenager behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of being the same age, he towered over all the adults at 190cm tall (6'4), with a build which was already muscular before getting stuck in the wild and having to run and fight to survive. Compared to him, Akira was a weakling, slim and barely 151cm tall (5').<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Junichi's stethoscope pressed against Yarai's considerable pecs (a feature Akira lacked), how the instrument sank on them, hypnotized the smaller boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't took long before Yarai, whose head towered over his doctor, noticed his peeking schoolmate. As soon as they made eye contact, Akira moved away his head, a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor repeated the checks on Akira, and the boy was as healthy as his tall friend. With his limiting equipment and knowledge, Junichi had no way to know their bodies were filled with the genetic agent BG-13, which were invading every cell to add a special gene... sowing the seeds of their future metamorphosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariya, the only one who knew, was outside the tent, waiting for the chance of talking to them. He got surprised after seeing them walking out so soon after their accident, but their good health also made him feel a little relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't look different, so he hastily concluded the growth therapy had no effect and there was no need to tell them about his shameful mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of the camp gather to welcome Akira. He had many friends and people who respected him, and everyone had been worried sick. The short leader was grateful for that, and heard with interest the shocking discoveries they had done in the abandoned lab, but after a while he got tired of so much attention. Eventually he slipped away and sneaked out to the nearby woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went for a walk during a quarter of an hour until he found someone far away. It was Yarai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large teen didn't notice the smaller one's presence and started undressing. It seemed he had hide in the forest for the same unspeakable reason as Akira's... to relieve his urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were too many people and too little privacy in the camp to do it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was completely naked, Yarai sat on the grass and begin to jerk his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis biceps tensed repetitively as he squeezed his flaccid penis, which started to grow until it reached his navel, 20cm (8\") long and considerably fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he leaned back, getting comfortable as he continued to masturbate compulsively. His left hand sometimes helped the right one massaging the lower part of the big cock, but it was more common to see it caressing his balls or his nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira, hiding behind a tree, couldn't help but watching every single detail, bunding it on his memory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow his pectorals and abs flexed a little every time he changed slightly his posture...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the toes of his large feet shook and move, responding to the increasing pleasure from his cock...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis long, muscular half flexed legs... he could distinguish every single muscle in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYarai biting softly his inferior lip erotically as he was approaching the end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira instinctively grabbed his hard 12cm dick and imitated Yarai, leaning the weight of his body against the tree he was hiding behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the first time he had seen a naked men (family, teammates in the locker room...) but this time felt very different, much more arousing than the any hentai or porn he had watched, to the point he was seriously questioning his sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that was because there weren't many men like Yarai. His messy blond hair, his handsome sharp eyes... His muscular body, his never-ending shoulders, huge feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had the majesty of a tiger and its threatening nature... (and his long tail)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnhg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful stream of white was shot from Yarai's reddened cock, rising a foot (30cm) before landing on his pecs. Smaller ejaculations dirtied his hands and his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNNNGH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA louder moan leaved Akira's mouth when he reached the climax seconds later, releasing not less cum in a sequence of quicker but shorter ejaculations against the trunk of his hideout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stayed quiet, recovering, and all the frenzy erotic thoughts were replaced with scarier ones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of steps coming closer to his location confirmed his fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped to a near brush and prayed not to be detected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall, nude teenager walked to his tree, observed it for a moment... and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira sighed with relieved, but he didn't dare to get out his last hideout until half an hour had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I thinking...? I acted like a stalker, a dirty perv...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the little leader came back to the camp, he actively tried to avoid his blond friend... although that made him look even more suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never going to do that again.\"</span></div></div>",

The rest of their group either sleeping or standing guard against any predatory prehistoric animals that may come outside. The intensity the nerd staring at their resting patients who slumbered peacefully was unnerving Rion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right?\" She asked as she looked at the short teen.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" He lied as he pushed his glasses up and brought out his laptop. \"Just making sure the ADN are still effective against the myxomycete in case we need to scavenge for more to fight it.\" Which wasn't completely a lie. Though he'd prefer not using more of the gene altering pills on them.<br>\r\n\"Hopefully they'll be back to normal soon.\" Rion smiled. <br>\r\n\"You best go rest. I'll report any changes. It'd be bad if Sengoku got sick worrying about you immediately after waking up\". He needed a good reason to get her to leave<br>\r\n\"I guess, but it feels like you want me away for some reason Mariya.\" Rion obliged his reasoning, but she could tell he was disturbed about something. She waved before leaving the makeshift house of sticks, leaves, and vines the two lay under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her gone, Mariya closed his laptop and  turned his eyes full force to them as he theorized. \"The prehistoric animals they cloned were always non-saurian in nature. They did clone reptiles and the dinosaurs avian descendants, yet not them when their species dominated. Even animals that lived before the dinosaurs had been cloned. Could they have been using the other experiments to test it out before fully cloning the dinosaurs? If this gene altering was part of their end goal, then were they trying to fully harness their DNA for it? If so could that could be to help people...\" Mariya came up with more and more theories based on his personal thoughts for their reasoning, attention disconnected from the two before him despite eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan could be heard from slumbering dark haired Sengoku as he grimaced, clenching his hand into the dirt and digging into it with greater ease than should be possible for Sengoku. Yarai showed visible discomfort as well, yet even in this vulnerable state kept himself restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir clothes seemed to be tightening as Sengokus groans got a little deeper. Shoulders broadening as their frames seemed to get bigger. Another groan, legs thickened. Another groan, shoes restricting enlarging feet. Another groan, hands growing into head crushing palms. Another groan, a bulge visibly growing as it slithered down his pants. Each groan followed Sengoku's body get bigger, and with each one it seemed to pick up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Sengoku let out an especially intense *Groan!* that shook Mariya out of his mental tangent. His eyes widened as he saw Sengoku and Yarai were acting up odd and seemed... different. Moving over to quickly observe via contact with Sengoku's body, the answer came to him. \"It's the worse case scenario. The pills are making them grow as it warned.\" He heard the sounds of stretching and tearing from Yarai, whose clothes showing signs first as his shoulders pushed wide for freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*TEAR* The loud noise of Kouichi Yarai's white undershirt tore in the middle to show his now visible six pack. \"They are both growing but Yarai's growing more muscular faster! Is it the result of having a superhuman strong body before taking it!? Mariya was starting to panic inside, but was keeping himself restrained due to knowing the fear that could spread. He needed to come up with a plan now! \"M-Mariya.\" Called the voice of the blonde as he let out a new groan. His sleeves visibly tearing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You're awake Yarai! Don't worry I'll figure something out!\" Mariya tried to reassure as he thought of what to do, coming to the logical conclusion.<br>\r\n\"That's right. Destroy our... clothes before... they choke us.\" Half-conscious Yarai finished his thoughts for Mariya, having an analytical mind and intellect beyond his grade too despite his infamy as a delinquent.<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Looking for a sharp rock or anything nearby even someone weak like him could use,, Mariya got lucky and found one. Quickly retrieving it to start tearing at their clothes. The sounds of ripping and stretching filling the air as he tore apart their clothes. His face  red as he felt the hard muscle beneath their clothes as he tore into it. Especially when feeling Akira and his body, caressing and touching the firm strong muscles as he tore it apart. Soon they were down to their undergarments that were losing the battle as well.<i> \"Never imagined this would be a personal fetish.\" </i> An experience Mariya would never have normally.<br>\r\n\"Leave?\" Mariya asked. Yarai nodded as he felt another wave of groaning pain come. His solemn expression changing to...a smile? Only to revert to a face of discomfort. Sengoku himself wore it reverse. Discomfort becoming pleasurable smile as his body balloomed bigger.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell the others to move away from here at the moment so as not disturb you two. Hopefully we'll desensitize them to your current state before it causes a panic.\" Mariya got up, observing both one more time before heading to speak to Rion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYarai barely conscious had already come to realize the drugs they were likely given to survive likely caused this. His growing body spreading further out across the ground as he reached for Sengoku's hand and held it tight. Sengoku holding Yarai's hand in equal tightness in his slumbering state. Sengoku still dreaming on as Yarai returned to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them growing ever larger as Mariya convinces the ones on guard duty to put some distance between them at the moment. Hoping to keep panic down to the bare minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariya returned as he  kept his gaze following his talk with the group on them all night. By the next morning.

He turned his gaze back to him \"Do you think I should greet him?\"<br>\r\n\"Mmm....\" He crossed his arms as he thought for a moment, only for \"<i>What did you say</i>!?\" from Misaki to determine the answer. \"Yes. At this rate Misaki <i>might</i> send him to the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAichi gulped at the thought as he nervously skirted over to speak. \"I-i m-might be the one you're looking for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't leave this shop I will-Aichi!\" Misaki blurted out his name as she turned towards him mid-threat. The masked man likewise turning to gaze upon the boy. He peered into the boys eyes from beneath the mask. Not a word emerged as he caught sight for a second of a galaxy emanating into the windows of Aichis soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you are indeed the one I was looking for!\" He bowed to Aichi taking the bow by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm s-sorry but please don't bow!\" surprised by the figures respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive my rudeness to the shop owners. I am Stigma and I-\" He bent up slightly as pulled from his suits pocket a booster pack of cards \"-Have come bearing a gift for the enemy of the Void\" Grabbing one of Aichis hands, he placed it gently into the boys palm. It had no brand or any form of series on it. Only silver wrapping holding cards within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cards within can be kept to yourself or shared with others. Now my role is now over. Farewell.\" Faster than Aichi could reply two fingers moved to the sound of a *SNAP* as the figure disappeared before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me-huh?\" Aichi was confused as all traces of the figure vanished from memory. Looking at the pack of cards and turning to Misaki \"Was someone just here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. You are the first to arrive Aichi.\" Misaki voiced with a glint of fury within her eyes, like she recalled speaking to someone who annoyed her greatly. \"Do you want to play a match while you wait for Kai and Miwa to arrive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I got a new I want to open first.\" He beamed as the pack was held tightly in his hands, moving to settle at a table. Getting comfortable he tore open the pack to reveal the cards beneath. \"Huh?\" His eyes widened  as he saw each card was blank. The clan, artwork, grade, effects, Power, Critical, etc. did not exist. Save for a space at the bottom where the Design and Illustrator would be. In its place was two words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Desire\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...better ask Kai if I was tricked into buying fake cards\". His face luffed red as he tried to hide it, not yet knowing what powers the card has. Especially as it acted on his desire to be stronger to impress Kain a way Aichi would not expect. His clothes filling just slightly as the first card in his grasp, its background, started to shift.</span></div></div>",

Of course the wealthy deity would want him to pay for something as minor as that. \"How much you talking?\"<br>\r\n\"Well since you do many minor jobs for me I'll go easy on you and say....about 200 yen.\"<br>\r\nOf course it'd be way higher than needed for info so minor. \"Alright\" Yato grumbled as he pulled out money to grant the wish. Forty jobs worth of yen spent as he handed over the cash, the priestly robed god placing it in his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your generous donation.\" The condescending tone pissing Yato off \"I know of two means of blessing a Regalia to grow. The first is a blessing from a fertility god such as the serpentine Uta-Jin, lucky god Benzaiten, Inari Okami, and Ukemochi. There's also Shinda, but the Ainu gods have secluded themselves from the world since the Ainu as a culture have disappeared and the people have mostly become one with Japan.

Just in time as Yato had descended into the room through the window, falling face first as icnoming impure thoughts from Yukine stung him like a swarm of ravenous Japanese hornets out to feed on a Japanese Beehive with little defense. \"Ooof! That hurt! I knew this would likely back...\" He opened his eyes to see the giant figure covered very little by the blanket \"fire. Shit. That damn Tajikarao screwing with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm?\" Yukine new physique amplified his senses, and he heard the thud and Yato's whining as he looked over and saw the track suit wearing god. Half-lidded eyes wanting to return to dreamland as his head began to feel nauseous like he was adjusting to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yato?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yukine! Boy do I have a surprise for you!\"</span></div></div>",

He took 10 seconds to notice something doesn't fit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yato, are you kneeling or something...?\"  He instinctively said pointing at his face, a little below his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head with an amused smile. That was a silly question, Yukine only had to look down to see he was standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did an enemy shrink you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYato shook again and put his hand on the regalia's broad and tall shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pleas had been heard and granted by the greatest of the gods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, looking for the great god Yato was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm talking about ME, airhead! I granted your wish! You're tall now!\"<br>\r\n\"Ehhhh??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat revelation cleared his head up at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukine, this time, finally noticed how all the room seemed smaller and how small and ripped his clothes were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran to the bathroom, but the top of his forehead hit the doorframe of its door... but after the hit he didn't complained, his face showed even more excitation instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside he shut the door behind and proceeded to examinate his new body in front of the mirror. At his new height, his head was cut off by the mirror. He took a good look of the reflexion of his long, broad, muscular upperbody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short boy didn't even dream he could get so big when he was alive. He didn't know man as big as himself existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his body, admiring how big his flexed arms got, his V-shaped back and front, caressed his abs (it was tickly) and when he looked below stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a huge bulge inside his deteriorated underpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrilled (and a little scared by so many changes), he slowly took down his shorts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you call me, my faithful Regalia?\" His meddling master bursted into the bath only to found the teenager with a huge flaccid cock hanging from his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed to the point of blushing, Yato went backwards a few steps and left him alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I went too far with his wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond regalia went out seconds later with what remained of his clothes, clearly too ashamed to do anything more lewd with his new body. Together they pretended clumsily nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yato...\"<br>\r\n\"Yukine... sorry, I think the wish didn't work as...\"<br>\r\n\"...THANK YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid hugged the fortune god so tightly he almost couldn't breath. Yato's feet shook in the air, unable to touch the floor as the tall regalia lifted his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As your lead shinki, I'll swear I'll use my new strengh to protect you, and I'll work to get even stronger...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had already broken his oath, as his master was suffocating under his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped in his grasp, with his head pressing his muscular shoulder, he couldn't do anything but feel his warm touch... the soft skin of his hard muscles... and his strangely sweet aroma...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, he was starting to get hard, so he demanded loudly to be set free.<br>\r\nThe jubilant Yukine, unaware of Yato's reaction, obeyed him immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I got swept up. This is amazing! I'm not just big, also I've never feel so strong! How could you do this?\"<br>\r\n\"Professional secret!\" Yato answered cryptically as he didn't wanted to let his down by confessing it was another god's doing.<br>\r\n\"This is great, but... I think I need bigger clothes... I don't want Hiyori and other regalias to see me this way\" He say pointing at his damaged pijama pants which were about to rip in any moment.<br>\r\n\"I have the solution to that problem too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYato's solution to every problem: mooching another guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair ran down the streets (the god got surprised when noticed how fast Yukine had become, he hardly could keep his pace) until they reached their destination...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYato rang the doorbell of the house and waited until the large figure of Daikoku went out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Ya...? ...!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKofuku's regalia muted when he saw the equally huge body of Yukine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kid had a growth spurt, and I'm afraid no one sells clothes this big... so I was wondering if you could lend him some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yato, what will you do to him?? Don't tell bullshit, regalias don't age!!\"<br>\r\n\"Me? Nothing...\" He said holding his smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he calmed down, he agreed reluctantly to give him one of his shirts and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't give you more, custom made aren't cheap and my goddess can't spare much money.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, regarding Kofuku, where is she?\"<br>\r\n\"No idea. She said something about having to do a favor to a friend and left.\"<br>\r\n\"Surely she's trying to seduce a future homeless.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't mock my goddess!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they argued, Yukine finished buttoning Daikoku's shirt. It fit great. The blond regalia always envied the scary-looking man a little, for being so big and strong... but now he could look into his eyes directly, he didn't look so intimidatingly strong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what I can do with my body\" He said as he closed his punch.</span></div></div>",

She happily hummed as she walked down the street, wallet in one hand and food in the other as she headed to make an offering. Copied photos of Yukine in her purse ehile her bento box had the most expensive meats and veggies she could find for it as she headed to make the request to Japans second most popular deity. Bested only by Tenjin in popularity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired goddess soon arrived at the local shrine, two Kitsune statues standing prodly in front of the rows of Torii leading deeper inside. She skipped happily through the vermillion gates to pass two more Inari statues at the end. A large crowd of humans gathered around the saisen to offer money and pray. A plain looking, fox-eared, one-tailed man dressed in shrine priest robes sitting next to a group of Shinki wearing fox masks and dressed in shrine uniforms. Thankfully the Gods of the Far Shore are not noticeable unless seeking attention from the crowds, allowing them to reside in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKofuku headed up to the lesser god watching over this Inari shrine. \"Hello Mr. fox! I'd like to make a request to Oi-kun!\" She asked cheerfully, holding up thr fresh bento box made with expensive meat before him as part of the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing miss\" He eyed her up to uncover her identity, eyebrow raised as he realized what God it was \"Mrs. Binbougami. I'll contact them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kofuku Ebisu please!\" She corrected him as she offered the box, the lesser deity bowing before taking. With knowledge of which Binbougami stood before him. He closed his eyes as the bento disappeared, teleported to Inari's residence. His eyes closed for several minutes before opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Inari has approved of listening to your request. For such a fine meal something will be granted even if the full wish cannot be made reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Tell Inny I want my Yatty's Shinki to grow bigger!\" <br>\r\nHe figured out she meant the disaster god. \" Does he plan to benefit from this?\" He questioned if she, or Yato, knew such blessings ending up affecting the God as well. Though not to the same extent.<br>\r\n\"Nope! His Shinki Yukky wants to bigger since he won't grow older. Yatty wanted to grant his wish. Don't see how he'd benefit from it since it only works on Shinki.\" She tilted her head for a sec. As she thought to be sure she was certain.<br>\r\nRelieved, he responded \"Very well. I shall inform my lord.\" He closed his eyes as he spoke to the great Uka-no-Mitama telepathically. A moment passed before he spoke \"Your wish for Yato's Shinki shall be granted.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much!\" Kofuku was about to run off but stopped. \"Oh right. Need a photo right?\" She brought out a photo Yato gave her of Yukine, handing it over. She then waved before cheerfully ran off to ask the next god Benzaiten, hoping to really make Yukines wish a huge surprise.  After all a few blessings shouldn't have a big impact right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Inari has enough servants to locate him, but this will speed it up.\" He anused as he sent it to him as she left through the vermillion torii, the honcho of the small shrine returned to relaxing before the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nUka-no-Mitama meanwhile was scarfing down the bento with joy, almost all of the Bento Box nearly gone. Fox.ears twitched as they finished, putting the chopsticks down on a table before them. Quiet and mysterious, the fox deity grasped the photo as it materialized in its hands. With a snap of its free hands fingers, its blessing now rained down upon Yukine to help him grow more.</span></div></div>",

Yato was looking up at him. Yukine must had been around the same height as Daikoku. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would make him taller than me\u201d he thought. Examining him further, Yukine also had gained some muscle. Skinner than Daikoku though.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Yukine asked, still groggy while getting dressed.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?

I\u2019ve never seen his normal appearance.\u201d Yato couldn\u2019t believe it.

Did you do anything?\u201d She thought for a sec after Yato released his hand.<br>\r\n\u201cI did tell one god that you were looking for a favor.\u201d Yato sighed.<br>\r\n\u201cThat must had been it. Now I need to figure out to reverse it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI would have been fine if he was taller than me.

The day soon turned to twilight as the suns light began to vanish over the horizon. Invisible cat not found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! I should have asked for Vanessas help. Maybe her string cat could find it!?\" He was stumped but still running about until.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUD* Astas face bumped headfirst into the thick thigh held secure in its cloth prison beneath. Falling backwards he he stopped his head from heading the ground by sturdying himself. A smiled crossed the figure he crashed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help Asta?\" A deepvoice said, but oddly familiar as Asta looked up, and up to see....Yuno!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsta shook his as he looked up. His foster brother, rival, and friend stood before him but something was different. Not that Asta was sure as he assumed he was still 177 cm(5'7 ft). Yetvthe person before him was easily 213 cm(7 ft). Not that said part was noticed as the amber eyed titan positioned one arm like something was resting on it, stroking the air around it with his free arm. To the 155 cm( 5'1 ft) Asta what was immediately noticeable was those <i>muscles</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes, somehow still fitting Yunos body just fine, clung tightly to his impressive musculature. His thicker thighs wrapped tight in brown pants, black shirt rising slightly to see the outline of a lower six pack. Above them was forming a shelf of pecs nestled beneath the Golden Dawn robe he wore. Visibly higher up so the lower half of his black-clothed pecs visible. His arms were visibly thicker, easily a 45 cm (18 in) in proportion with his body, at least if he was his original height. The bicep was much bigger now due to the additonal growth. Even the dark haired boys neck was thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'VE GOT MUSCLES!\" Astas pupils filled with stars. as shock nearly had his mind break. The gears of his mind nearly grinding to a halt from this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's a long story.\" Yuno bent down as his left hand continued scratching the above his right, until the visible coloration of a creatures eyes was visible to Asta. \"I heard you were looking for this fellow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment to process that in his hands was the feline!\"Y-yeah!\" Asta pulled out his grimoore, reaching into it to grasp the Demon-slayer sword. With a tap of the heavy broadsword, the cats fur transitioned into orange and stripes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning his sword back to it, Asta welcomed the kitty into his arms.  A smile crossing his face as he looked up, the tension of this odd...situation finally laxed for him. \"Thanks Yuno. Im gonna get another star for doing this for the Wizard King. But how did you get so....\"<br>\r\n\"Big?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" The cat, though clearly not happy to leave Yunos arms, accepted it even as it gave a deathglare to Asta.<br>\r\n\"Well we were dealing with an acient mystical weapon the other day when Sylph showed me a new spell in my grimoire. ''Blessing of Raging Wind Incarmate:Become the Storm.'' It did..this\" He flexed his right arm, bicep rising with the flex past Astas head. He let out a *Sigh* \"Good thing my clothes grew too or Id be in trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"So what happend to the weapon?\"<br>\r\n\"I punched it, which made a tornado send it flying off into the distance.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't believe something so cool happend in the five days I hadm't seem you!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah well the Wizard King was particularly impressive. He wants me to show off the last day of the weekend.\"<br>\r\nAt those words Astas star filled pupils widen more. \"I want to watch you show off too!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. That's why I came looking for you and learned about your mission from the king.\" Yunos words made Asta tilt his head in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I told the king only if my rival got to come, cause my rival would never find a way to get big either and I can show off how much bigger I am than you.\"<br>\r\n\"OH YEAH!\" Asta gritted his teeth as he prepared to engage in competition with Yuno. \"I'll totally find a sword that will let me get huge and make the Wizard King praise me for getting so much bigger! Just you wait! I'll see you there \" Asta immediately ran off the sound of *HISSING* and *RIP* as he clearly forgot about the cat he was carrying to the Kings castle where his majesty amd the Wizard Emperor were at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuno stood there watchimg with a blank look. Devoid of even stoicness before a warm smile crossed his face. \"Can't wait to see how you'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======Back to the Present=======<br>\r\n\"ARGH! I can't let Yuno show me up before the Wizard King! I've gotta show everyone what I can do and beat Yunos butt!\" He rolled across the ground before he let out *OUCHOUCHOUCH* as he rolled over pieces of the shattered rocks before stopping next to his grimoire. The black five leaf clover emblem upon the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one day left. There's totally a way to do it! I know there is!\" Asta stood up as he made hia delcaration to the empty surroundings. The demon resodomg in his sword amused by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you want to show off so badly I know just the sword in this grimoire.</i> The black shadows wild hair flew about as he grinned. Astas Grimoire begam to leave his clothes,  gllwing as it opened its pages as they began fying wildly to Astas attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the? Has my prayers been answered!?\" Soon it  shifted till it landed upon a page near the end. Ink appearing amd flowing forth across the page as words and images appear to the glow of the demons call. Soon a massive, sleek looking sword easily three times the size of the demon-slaying sword emerged! The grimoire had a hard time trying to spit the behemoth out, easily chucking like it was trying to throw it up due to its sheer size before it landed with a heavy *THUD* on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Black with the appearance of two mighty bull horns engraved upon its hilt. The swords edge emblazoned with silver symbols undecipherable on the pitch black blade. Asta moved forth to touch the blades hilt, which due to its girth would need him to lift with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just didn't expect the sword to be so light!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird. Its so big but its the lightest sword I've ever grasped. But it must do what Im seeking. So c'mon sword make me big. Even if its just my muscles make me huge enough to show Yuno up!\" As Asta called to the blade hoping for an answer he got it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he still didn't notice Noelle in the bushes!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The short, stout Hinomaru was getting his clothes on in Odachi Highs Dojo. The black and crimson red haired teens scarred tanned body was on display as he was taking of off his mawashi belt to be folded and placed in his bag, pulling out his school his form to wear and cover his stocky frame. Next to him was a set of dumbells, likely used by him only a few moments ago. \"Goerta meet with cpatain and Kirihito. Don't want to miss out on the buffet!\" He patted his stomach as crimson eyes gleamed with joy. The rest of the team had left for the newest buffet to stuff themselves on the all-you-can-eat challenges and menus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We keep getting banned for some reason.\" Oblivious that it was his, Gojou's, and Yuuma's attitude in front of the owners antagonizing them and leading to bans of all sumo students. Getting his things together, he left the empty dojo and headed for the schools entrance. \"Hmm?\" He was puzzled as he saw other students still there, leaving one at a time as a man in a suit was standing with bodyguards, asking questions from the looks of things. Thr guards letting them leave after presumably answering the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs three students left Hinomaru had reached the entrance, moving close by so his ears pick up the conversation with two other students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've heard nothing about a candidate to be one of the National Treasures(Tenka-Goken)?\" The man in the suit was surpsinlgy tall. Yet his frame was rail thin and could probably collapse from a strong breeze. Eyes hidden by glasses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man we don't even know what those are.\" The lead of the two male students replied before heading to leave. The man grimacing as his search continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"National Treasures?\" Hinomaru pondered \"Wonder what he needs to know about them.\" The short red head moved towards the the tall man. \"Excuse me sir! What do you know about the National Treasures?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the unkempt hair and scar on his cheek, the man in the suit spoke. \"I'm looking for one of the High School candidates sought after to be a Yokozona and bear the title of a Treasure. One Hinomaru Ushio.\" His voice softer than Hinomaru expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking for me?\" Hearing thst from Hinomaru took the man aback, he was informed Hinomaru had a fierce look, but his ststure....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*AHEM*\" He coughed to get himself back on track. \"Everyone else may leave. We found the person we sought.\" The other students were let free of school grounds as the man returned his attention to Hinomaru while the clattering of footsteps across the background \"Indeed mister Ushio. I have with me-\" The man made a gesture to one of his men, causing a guard to bring out<br>\r\na long, thin ornamental case \"A treasure from none other than thr Imperial Household Agency.\" He opened it to unveil a tachi. The sword instantly recognizable to the studious Hinomaru and history buff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! It's the legendary Onimaru Kunitsuna! The sword said to get its name from slaying an Oni!\" He was blushing from joy at seeing something like it in person. \"Wait but why am I allowed to glimpse it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me. The Grand Chamberlain and the Emperor had requested the current candidate for the future Yokozuna be allowed to touch the blade they will be named for. The reasons I know not, but thry pulled a number of strings to see it made for reality, including the ones not in our possession.\" He pulled the tachi from its sheathe and showed the blades visage before Hinomarus eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat beaded down his brow as he gulped \"I can really touch it?\" The man nodded in response. The teens hand reached out to touch the sharp side of the blade. In that moment, the flame of passion that burned in Hinomarus eyes for sumo consumed all in the windows to his soul to become temporary kindling, with the visage of a Oni being beheaded in the reflection of the blade. The Last Oni, who haunted the dreams of the man who forged the Blade, which said sword would protect and strikd down to be named after Onikind. The Onis blood and the blade long dormant until now: the promised time. They desired only one thing, the birth of a new Oni who would beget a new generation of Oni across the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames in his eyes quickly died down as Hinomarus crimson red eyes glowed, removing his fingers from the blade, his middle trickling blood due to its sharpness. None of the men could see the supernatural influence, or bizarrely the blood from Hinomarus finger upon the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinomaru himself just felt a powerful and warm presence in his body, his time to fully be born as the King of Oni was not yet here. He smiled as he bowed \"Thank you for the chance to touch a National Treasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man and his bodyguards smiled \"No need Mr. Ushio. We were only doing our jobs. Thank the Emperor and his aide for giving the opportunity.\" he quickly shesthed the blade and placed it back in its case, returned to the guard who kept it. \"Now that our job here is done, we have festivities to prepare all across Japan. Have a good day Mr. Ushio\". The man and his guards soon left, leaving Hinomaru alone at the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen. Hinomarus phone rang as he received a text from Kirihito about the Buffet \"Oh crap!\" He gasped as he quickly charged off while reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group has already started eating despite me urging Kunisaki to wait. Hurry before Kunisaki says something he shouldn't and we get kicked out - Kirihito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran as fast as possible to reach the new buffet, and his legs carried him with greater speed thsn usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bight light of the sun shone across New York, descending into a large public library. Few resided at the long tables, save for a blonde haired teen. The beauty of his angelic face as his head rested peacefully on the table, letter opened up beneath his fair golden hair where specks of blood tinted white paper a dull red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA library staff member walked near him to awaken Ash, but smiled as she saw how happy he looked before walking away, a different patron asking for aid, ignorant the fair youth she assumed slumbered was dying from a stab wound gotten not too long ago. The youth, Ash Lynx, choosing not to receive medical treatment even after reading Eijis heartfelt words. Letting death take him instead as the light of the sun shined doen upon him. The sweet embrace of death soon to take.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny decided to rear itself, a different Library patron walked by in front of Ash resting head, catching sight of the dull red blood on the letter beneath his head. Clad in plain black clothes, Thick rimmed glasses hiding eyes, hair obscured by a thick black cap, face mask . The man held several books  he placed them on the table as he quickly moved to the other side. \"Ere ith mthing ung ith em.\" Words muffled by the mask as he moved his fingers under the jacket and black sweater to feel the pulse on angelic skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a heartbeat far too low for his age, the man pulled his mask down. \"He won't last long enough to reach the hospital, the fact he shows no signs of struggling tells me he plans to die like this. Sorry but\" moving a hand to a zipped pocket, unzipping as he pulled out a bottle \"Im not kind enough to grant ones death wish\". Popping off the lid, he quickly lifted the unconscious blondes up, using himself as a cushion as he took out a yellow like pill he put in his mouth. Closing his mouth shut as the pill quickly started to dissolve from the touch of liquid and travelled down his throat. He knew the experimental drug wouldn't be enough, reaching for another one to repeat the process. Opening mouth, closing, dissolving, rinse and repeat. The eyes of fellow patrons walking back gazing at the situation with misplaced thoughts on what was going down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ive gone through thirteen of these. I don't know much these body enhancers will help this death seeking fool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff member from before soon came up, drawn by patrons who informed her what was going down. \"Sir please leave that poor fellow alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't miss. See he's-\" opening the jacket he showed the blood on Ashs sweater \"on the verge of death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I-I thought he was sleeping!\" She quickly rushed to their side. \"Can I provide any aid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes call my hospitals ambulance with this number and tell them Dr. Atlas gave it to you. I'm-\" He dropped another pill down Ash throat, quickly moving to pull a cell phone out of his pocket to give her, quickly typing the number in the emergency call. \"-trying to keep him alive.\" Returning to give him the medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes! She nodded as she took it in hand to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two did their best, the experimental drug the doctor had been using began to affect Ash failing body. Though the process was slow as the loss of blood increased, the chemical compound began to affect the cells it came into contact with: gums, throat, stomach, intestines, bloodstream, etc. The process altering and mutate every fiber of his body as it moved about.  If he had only taken one, this would not save the gang leader, but the doctor knew this as he gave him nearly the entire bottle. Soon his heartbeat began to slowly speed up to normal, new cells forming at a rapid pace to take the position of former cells where the injury was inflicted, the injury from the blade soon began to heal over as cognitive function returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue eyes dimly unveiled from the darkness as his ability to remain conscious returned. \"Ei...ji...\" was all he could muster before returning to his slumber. The doctor sighed in relief as his bottle had finished. Not a single one remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do next?\" The librarian asked as she finished her task and retutned the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him some water to drink. He'll need fluids if he wakes before they arrive.\" With that she was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. I tested the Yellow Leviathan on an unwilling test subject. Ill get in trouble for this.\" He positioned Ash to rest his head on the table again. Returning to his books as the librarian brought the water and checked out his books in exchane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======Three Hours Later======<br>\r\n*Lub Dub* *Lub Dub* *Lub Dub* *Lub Dub* rhythmically filled the silence of the room. Small lights of machines showing heartbeat as a Drip was put into the vein of one Ash Lynx. The blonde resting as his body lay in a hospital room. Clad in a long hospital gown beneath a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Lub Dub* *Lub Dub* *BABUMP* *BABUMP* *BABUMP* The machine reading the rapid change in heartbeat \"Eiji!\" Ash nearly jumped out of the bed as he shot up, eyes wide as his longing crept into his dreamless slumber. He paused for a few seconds as he took in his surroundings as he realized whats going on. \"I'm alive?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>it is a Hospital again. I know the process. Probably some creepy bastard plans on using me for science or assaulting me. Tsk. Fate won't let me rest in peace even when Dino and all the creepy fucks are finally arrested.</i> The realization his attempt to accept death had been foiled, he pulled the blanket off as he recklessly tugged the Drips from his veins. Paying little attention as his body prevented vein collapse with rapid healig, or ignorant his noticeably thicker arms wrapped in his angel smooth skin. The new mounds of muscle easily softball size with a flex. Getting up with a surprisingly heavy *THUD* Ash looked around the room for his things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is!\" He saw a table hidden behind the machines where his possessions and non blood-stained clothes lay. He moved over to grab his phone, shifting through contacts. <i>Who to call? Sing? Nah I push enough on him for aid as is. Best call Blanca and Alex to get the gang to free me!</i> As he pressed to message both, the sound of *SQUEAK* SQUEAK* *SQUEAK* drew his attention to those walking this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. I don't have anything to defend myself with. He quickly moved to the bed to appear harmless, stabbing the drips poorly into his veins, yet suffered no repercussions from mishandling it. Next tossing the blanket over himself to wait for his chance, the blanket messily covering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Atlas entered the room to the sound of *CREAK* as the wooden door moved forward,noise filling the sterile environment. He wore a surgical cap over his hair as well as the mask, his black spectacles still on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you're awake!\" Smiling as he moved to Ash, he held out his hand. \"Hello Mister-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash Lynx'\" Ash replied. No hand meeting Atlas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Ash Lynx\" he moved his hand back as he brought over a hospital sheelchair to sit in. \"I'm sure you have questions and Ill be happy to inform you of anything you might knkw after I found you in the local Library-\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Ash wasted no time.<br>\r\n\"Ah I wish to apologized to you. To save your life, I did an illegal act and used a drug to repair your body after you obtained that stab wound.\"<br>\r\n<i>Thought so</i>. \"Do you plan on keeping me here as a guinea pig? I will make your life a living hell if you try to.\"<br>\r\n\"Goodness no Mr. Lynx. You are free to go, but due to my actions we at Zhenren Hospital will do what we can to pay you back so long as this doesn't get taken to court.\"<br>\r\nA smile crossed Ash face at those words, especially relief at not being part of a mad science experiment. \"Pay me back for keeping quiet? Well then I want you....\" </span></div></div>",

Black haired men dressed in plain white shirts with the words \"Cell\" written on them standing around buildings. Men and women dressed in red uniforms carried boxes and crates filled with food through the streets and tunnels, moving to drop off some to each plain shirt male before continuinig on the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby a base with an open area for training, men clad in black uniforms wearing caps that say \"KILL\" running laps as a glasses-wearing man drank tea given by his assistant. The two watched from indoors behind a nice desk and nearby bookshelves. He took a sip as she moved to her own desk. In the field though....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you T-Cell maggots! What do we do!?\" A blonde man lead the field of men clad in black, all of them smaller and of similar build save for one larger than all of them and his sleeves ripped off.<br>\r\n\"Kill Cells and Viruses!\" They yelled in unison, sweat beading down their heads as they continued running laps.<br>\r\n\"That's right!

She noticed a package in pure white wrapping paper and a letter. Taking it she read the signature \"This is....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later they group had fonished the lap, standing in line to wait their Squad Leaders command. The largest member was oddly missing, having disappeared at the gesture pf Regulatory T Cell to emeet her. At least until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! You got a present!\" The massive Effector T Cell had in his hands the white gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll sense of professionalism disappeared instantly. \"A-a-a present for m-me?\" Lips quivering, body shivering, eyes wide as Killer T Cell was handed the box. Big wide smile and blushing red as he held it with shaking hands. His men amused him showing his softer side again after the last present incident shdn a virus performed a prank on him. He pulled open the paper attach to see the signature:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry about joining rhinovirus in pranking you. Hope this makes up for it just a little.<br>\r\nSigned, Regular Cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. To think a mere Cell would be apologizing to me.\" He barely straightened up to regain composure, an occassional twitch before rapidly tearing open the wrapping, ripping apart tape to get to thr contents he crsved. There in the box was free nutients: meats, veggies, fruits. But the color was odd. Purple tinted like veins spread across them like a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks delicious!\" Killer T Cell took some of the meat out \"Thanks for the food~\" teeth bared as he digged into the red meat, juicy purple fluid oozed down his lips as he chewed aggressively, his men looking on both happy for their Squad Leader, bored, and annoyed at how he won't share any with them. Watching as he sat on the ground to devour it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame Killer T Cell had no idea what was in the foods he was scarfing down greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======Abovd the T Cell base======<br>\r\nWatching from the balcony of a normal cell apartment was the dark haired Regular Cell, looking down at the T-Cell dots that he views as always arrogant towards the normal cells. The fun they once had after Rhinovirus had stopped, his copy had left his home, and Lactic Acid Bacteria was too big to take care of anymore and had gone to live with the rest of his gigantic cuddly kind to help the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand pressed into his chin, a *SIGH* escaped his lips as he looked down on the type of White Blood Cell base. Next to him was a box with the same odd purple veined nutrients. \"I hope giving him a treat will get them to have fun with me again. I won't get to make another copy for months.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a small piece of a purple veined broccoli, contemplating eating it. \"I wonder where the Red Blood Cell got these from?\" He thought to the his delivery girl with thr sole bright red hair and the ahoge. \"Oh well.\" He happily took a bite of his nutrients for the day. A few bites as drool began to flood, eyes widening as hr chewed and swallowed. A small lick of the lips. \"Pretty good!\"</span></div></div>",

The second in command of Sakuragi's gang eyeing a box the delinquent had next to him as they enjoyed food at a burger joint. Their other friends currently dealing with some thugs too dumb to realize they weren't even a challenge only a block nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakuragi just made \"heehee\" and small laughter as he chowed down, Yoheis interest in the box was rising \"So what's in the box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my trump card to show Rukawa how he definitely can't beat me anymore!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyebrow rose in response as Yohei returned to sipping, seeing his friend finish his food. The redhead gripped the taped flaps of the box as he pulled, causing the tape and falp to release a *RIP* as its contents saw the light of day, pulling out a small vial. The happy player showing a sickly green....something that was sloshing about as Sakuragi twirled it inbetween fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing enjoying the taste of his cola, Yohei asked \"Does it give him permanent constipation or some other illness?\" he didn't really think Sakuragi would poison him, but the liquid just looked so slimy and gross as it moved about it was the only thing he could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope~\" Popping off the cap holding the green sludge within, bringing it close to his face. \"It's going to make me taller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taller?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!

The dark haired nap lover had even put on easily ten more pounds of muscld in the process. Making his frame slightly bigger. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You sure it won't make you vomit everywhere instead?\" Yohei interrupted, knowing a fantasy in Sakuragi's head was about to spawn about how pathetic Rukawa is and Akagi become a genuine gorilla. So he'd easily spend a few minutes lost in daydream before returning to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah just watch!\" Without a second thought the redhead downed the entire gunky mass in one swallow. Too lost in his dreams of staying taller like he was originally, being 190cm (6'2) to Rukawas original 187cm(6'1)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until the taste caught up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URK!\" He dropped the plastic vial, quickly covering his mouth as his face turned green. He couldn't even properly describe the taste. Let alone the smell. The SMELL that only hit him after he swallowed. A smell that didn't exist beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Regret visibly showing  as Yohei smirked at his friends typical crazy acts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bathrooms that way\" Pointing to the right, the basketball player shook his head and kept it down. A loud *GULP* resounding at their table. Forcing that nasty vomit to stay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuragi wasn't going to let something as bad as a repulsive taste keep him from beating Rukawa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===Meanwhile===<br>\r\nIn the schools bathroom, a face was being scrubbed as ink disappeared from soap and water with paper towels wiping upon skin. Forehead veins throbbing as a dark haired teen, Rukawa Kaede, grumbled in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot!\" He said aloud about that loud redhead he considered a rival. He moved for his pocket, pulling out both a plastic vial with some green slime and a bottle of gatorade. Pouring juuusssttt a smidge of the slime into it. He'd wouldn't put more than that in it. Not after last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to humiliate the loud redhead in the best way possible: towering over him.</span></div></div>",

Tall, more than impressively muscular... and not very nimble.  His bulky frame was powerful, but difficult to maneuver... Link, however, was lithe, quick on his feet.  His lean muscles made him strong, but flexible, quick to strike and quicker to dodge...  Well, Ganondorf could fix that.  He just had to give Link a body fitting of a real hero... a big, bulky, muscular frame to rival his own, or even exceed it.

No need to get mad about it.\" He cheerfully replied. \"Tell you what.

Said it was made to level up a pokemon signficiantly. Like think 25 levels in one go!\" He shook the box before placing it on on the ground. \"More if you give them them multiples.\" He sends out his Machamp from the pokeball, having him rip open the tape with a Cross Chop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Machamp!\" He said as he sent him back, grabbing one of the bottles from in it. \"The guy also said it was possible for humans to eat these too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... ... ...?\" Puzzled Red more. He'd never heard of people eating rare candy, but he'd also never heard of any ill effects as a result either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently it was a worry that some people might try to eat Rare Candies to see what would happen.

Mine apparently won't arrive for a few days. The Delibird delivering mine turned around because one of those Ultra Beasts attacked it. I heard it was the one dubbed Blaster and it attacked him over Ula'Ula Island.\" Green explained as Red unwrapped the ones he handed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.

He didn't have to wait long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle warmth started from his stomach and quickly spread throughout his body. Red closed his eyes and basked in the feeling. The warmth changed into a feeling of strength and power, like he could do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother feeling replaced that, but it wasn't internal. This feeling was one of his clothes tightening around him. Red opened his eyes and looked down to see that the  Rare Candy was changing his body. He was physically fit, a lifetime of running around and hiking had left him with a nice athletic physique. The Rare Candy seemed to be enhancing it, his muscles were growing and his shirt seemed to be barely holding the growing muscles in. Soon his clothes weren't even doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with his collar. The red ring was torn open by his growing neck and shoulders. His sleeves were next. His growing arms were practically being strangled by the too small openings. He flexed his arms and his bulging biceps split the seams, letting his thick muscular arms breathe. Red decided to get it over with and simply tore off his red and white  t-shirt. It seems either the warmth or the stress of the transformation had left him sweaty, giving his muscles a shiny, sexy glow on his pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs had grown thick and wide, jutting a few inches away from his chest while his perky pink nipples stood at attention. Below them a set of hard, deep cut 8 pack abs led a trail down into his thin waist. He couldn't see it, but his back was also very muscular. The striations giving it the appearance of wings. A treasure trail formed led from his belly button down into jeans where Red's \"super rod\" was trying to break free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed's waist didn't grow bigger, but became incredibly defined. His hips stood out and his pants stayed on although the had trouble dealing with the extra height and muscle. The cuffs of his jeans were almost to his knees, making it look like he was wearing shorts. His growing thighs pushed the material past the breaking point and was visible through the sides. They were heavily defined, the skin tightly molded to the muscle. His calves were on full display, majestically big and very thick. His shoes weren't able to hold on at all and had been split open by his growing feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Red smiled on seeing his incredible new body. His body was ok before, but now the rare candy had changed him into a ripped hunk. And if just one could do that what could the others do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Blue said, in awe of Red's muscular new look. He began to eye the Rare Candy, wanting some of the muscle Red had gotten. While Red was distracted by his new look, Blue took a few from the crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

''I know I shouldn't take them since they're Reds', but that experience looks unbelievable! I have to experience it.'' Before he could he swallow them Blue noticed a shadow spread around him. Blue turned to see Red looking down at him, annoyed when he caught a glimpse of  Blue while admiring himself. At least Blue thinks he is. His much bigger pecs were blocking his face to an exten,t. Regardless, Blue looked up apologetically \"I'm sorry Red! What I saw happen to you looked so good I wanted to experience it myself! I'll let you have some of mine when they arrive so please let me try a couple!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed saw that Blue was sincere in his apology. \".....\" Red sighed as he allowed Blue to try a few. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue smiled \"Thanks Red!\" As he prepared to eat them till Red stopped him. \"Wait why's you stop me?\" Red pointed towards the people at the Battle Tower, who hadn't noticed what went down. \"Oh you think they might notice if both of us change in public? That's fair. Let's go into the Poni Meadow then.\"  Nodding, Red easily picked up the box contains his Candy as his massive bicep bulged, making him smile Blue grabbed the scraps of Reds shirt with his femoty as they headed in secret to the meadow, tossing Reds shirt into a nearby patch of tall grass they walked through the coast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue tried to keep up with Reds walking speed as they spent the next ten minutes heading to the dark meadow, but Reds now herculean body made him run a bit to just to keep up with Reds stride. Once they arrived Red out the box of Rare Candy down near a tree, looking over at Blue. \"... ... ...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have told me you wanted me to eat them on the way here then! \" Blue replied in annoyance when Red revealed he thought Blue wouldn't wait to eat the new Rare Candy. \"Ah well here goes!\" Blue said with delight as he ate the two candies at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the two Blue had been the more lean and slightly shorter compared to Red pre-Candy, being slightly thicker and taller in comparison, but that soon changed as Blue felt a warmth that felt  power flow inside him. He smiled as he felt his body stretch, inches added as it grew. Muscles began to thicken and grow with each inch added, his black buttoned shirt rising as both his pecs pushed out, tearing as his neck and biceps bulged with growing muscle,  buttons popping off his shirt as his growing body stretched the shirt more. Blues sweat giving his body a flawless sheen as his clothes became soaked. His back thickening as it gained a V-shape. Blue chuckles as he pulled off and tossed his glasses, noticing they weren't fitting on his head like before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the strap was getting tight faster than the short, Blue cockily ripped it off his chest with one arm, ripping the shirt off along with it as the scraps of cloth fell to the ground. \"Whoops.\" Blue chuckled as he showed his massive back to Red. His abs, which had gone from nonexistent to 8 pack as his shirt rose were now on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis growing thighs were making quick work of his tight shorts as they slowly became as thick as tree trunks as the shorts ride up, and the bulge in his green boxers was pushing the now clinging shorts to their last limits until Blue decided they were in the way and starting to hurt, ripping both off as he reached seven feet in height and kept growing. His strong, thickening feet quickly tore apart his shoes without Blue noticing, too absorbed in the rest of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue watches as his muscles had stopped growing once he reached 7 ft 2, but were staying in proportion as he grew larger. ''Huh. Figured my bod would keep getting buff like Reds did. Maybe I need to eat more candy for that to happen.\" Blue thought as his body stood in the nude as it finally stopped growing at his  new height of 7 ft 10. The smooth, shiny muscular behemoth turning towards Red. \"So what so you think? Hottest rival you've ever had right\" Blue flexes his left arm, watching the massive bicep rise before the large, but shorter Red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed kept his thoughts to himself as he witnessed the transformation. Red came over from the tree, noticing heis head reaches the height of Blues massive pecs. \"... ... ...\" Red said aloud how big he thought Greem was, comparing their sizes and noticing Blue easily beat him in muscle even if they were the same height. With both hands he reached upward and gently touched Blues  massive pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red what are you mmmf\" Blue couldn't finish his thoughts as Red gently began to massage his pecs. It was quick and brief, as Red stopped himself. \"Red don't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed ignored him as he...</span></div></div>",

He enjoyed his new size, but he felt bad since it was meant for Red. \"Eh hehe, sorry about that Red.\" He said, admiring himself as he rubbed his hand slowly over his chest, feeling the abs donning it. He tensed, feeling the powerful strength behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fit of narcissism, he flexed his other arm, watching as his bicep expanded, then realized Red was glaring. He rubbed the back of his head in embarrassment, unwittingly showing off more. He stepped back, slightly unnerved by the stare of his talkative friend. Red reached down, and grabbed the pill bottle, shaking it so another two fell out. While Blue gulped. If two pills made him this big...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed took them, and gulped. \".....\" He moaned, as the warmth surrounded him again. With a crack, Blue watched as Red's body shot up, and he hesitantly reached out to touch Red's chest, blushing heavily as he felt the muscle tense tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention turned quickly to Red's pants, the sound of ripping denim catching his attention as his expanding thighs finally ripped them open. He watched open eyed they quickly turned into a pair of short shorts, and failed after that, leaving him in just a pair of tight boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose met their maker next, as with a significant pulse, Red's own rod flopped out, having bypassed ultra, and been upgraded straight to master rod, complete with a set of master balls. Blue was slack-jawed, the impressive size hanging down to his knees, and he hand't even used harden yet, an impressive treasure trail leading up to his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue noticed that the balance they had had been restored, as Red was once again the larger and more muscled of them, and Red looked down, \".....\" indicating he was very well pleased with his new size.</span></div></div>",

It was Blue's one annoying trait, that he could never say no to him, and he took all three candies and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue grinned happily, \"I know you couldn't say no!\" He hugged Red, enjoying the feeling of the strength Red had beneath him. He couldn't wait to see what would happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed was decently surprised as a heat settled in all of his limbs, making him feel like he had been in a sauna. Blue thrust against him, teasing his aching member that was straining his pants. \"... ... ...\" He moaned, the heat getting too much as he realized that his clothes were getting tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue realized his arms were slowly getting forced apart as he looked down and saw Red was expanding! \"Yes, it works!\" He shouted, his grin growing impossibly wide. He placed his hands against Red's pecs, groping them as he felt them growing. *RIP* Before his eyes, he watched as their growth began ripping his shirt's collar down the middle. *rip* *rip* He watched as the bulging biceps and and thickening torso began ripping the seams apart as well. Red gripped the bench underneath him harder, his expanding strength easily fracturing it into splinters as his hand popped larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't see it, but Red's legs were also growing bigger, his calves looking like a baseball had been shoved in them as his pants rode up, coming only to mid-calf, while above, his pants looked painted on, the defined teardrop of his quadriceps showing through them, even as the seams were barely hung, showing the Red's creamy, delicious skin underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue licked his lips as he realized Red's head was starting to tower over him, even as he watched the shirt rip all the way down  to his chest, revealing the chiseled 8-pack underneath. He slipped his hands underneath the shirt's remains to continue groping Red's pecs, slowly teasing his nipples as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ping* Blue felt Red's button hit him in the chest as he looked down to see Red's waist overwhelming his waistband, but that wasn't all that was growing. Red's smaller red was growing too, and Blue watched as his pillar grew and grew. He maneuvered himself so he was on top and he watched as it grew beyond arm-length (for him). He could see the throbbing veins sticking out from what he could exposed from under what cloth was left. Even as he felt Red's chest grow farther and farther from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Red's shirt and pants failed completely, leaving him in only heavily strained boxers. Blue thrust forward heavily, doing what he can to pleasure Red's giant cock. \"... ... ...\" Looking at Blue, Red finally decided to stand up, his faithful hat falling from his head due to his head becoming to big for it, revealing his luscious hair. Blue gripped on to Red's chest like he was rock climbing, due to the sudden height difference, as he realized that Red was at least three times his size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed thrust his hips forward, the growth too much for him there, as with a rip, his throbbing dick growing even more, making it even harder for Blue to stand, as the extending flesh forced him to continuously readjust himself, perched precariously as he was on Red'd even older \"friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed flexed, actually enjoying his new size as he felt his growth starting to peter out, as he looked down at Blue. By his estimates, he was probably about five times as large as Blue was, looking over as he tested his new strength, adjusting his legs, flexing his biceps, even bouncing his new pecs which jutted out impressively from his chest. He even reached down and felt his chiseled ass, even the two gropable spheres which were just begging to be grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing so involuntarily made him thrust forward, showing his member which was at completely attention. He grinned as he looked down, watching Blue struggling to stay up, eventually slipping and having to grip it, sending a small tingle through Red as he looked down, seeing it was just a little bigger than Blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed grinned. Oh, the potential for some revenge.</span></div></div>",

Reds body flushed red as he closed his eyes, his smile becoming a lustful daze as he looked upwards to the sky. \"...!\" A deep moan emanated from within the dark haired giant. His body brgan to inch higher to the heavens as the grass beneath his robust feet spread out across the grass. Soon they would even push into the forests around them at the current pace. Red squeezed his perfect muscular rump with both hands with as much strength as possible, his body enjoying the more senstive posterior as his entire frame became sensitive to his own touch and growing power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue looked on blushing bright red as his friend continued to grow, Reds fertile pillar beneath Blues body growing in juntion with the rest. \"Can't believe Red's still growing? Does this mean people evolve when they eat a certain amount of candy?\" His contemplated thoughts were said aloud, ignored by his titan as Red enjoyed his body, moving from his ass to caressing his herculean thighs. More room became available for Blue to relax upon the warhammer phallus as it soon dwarfed his size. Though Blue was more surprised by the amount of growing his friend was undergoing. Looking at the glistening body, Blue wanted to move over and have a taste of the salty liquid coating Reds skin. <i>Best to go over there when its done. Don't want to fall to my doom after all!</i> Blue knew better than to take risks in a precarious situation like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed had reached more than Ten times Blues original size, with him growing still more until he eventually evens out at fifteen times. Though that still had a ways to go, \"...\" Reds smirking continued as he went to touch his sharp cobblestone eight pack abs. He knew Blue was beneath his hands and staring up, smart enough not to move and trusted Red to remain as is. Not that Red would tire from standing. His thick pecs meanwhile were starting to block his peripheral vision of objects down below, but as his eyes were closed he remained blissfully unaware.  Nor was that the only thing he was unaware of as his feet pushed into the thick grass surrounding the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr the Battle Tower. Participants and clerks observing the growing giant from afar as he became gigantic in front of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that an animatronic made for Pokestar Studios?\" One of the observers questioned as he took pictires with his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah they use special effects for all their movies.\" A clerk mentioned as she oogled the massive beefy titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the legendary trainer Red!?\" A trainer heading for the Battle Tree from Poni Gaintlet said in surprise, admiring the powerful trainer. A tent in their pants emerging as they oogled his sculpted ass and v taper from below, greedily growing all they can till he reached destined height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wild pokemon around. Battle Tower sensed a powerful being in the area, wary of rivals and potential danger, they scampered from the environment like they would when staying away from a person covered in Repel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the growth came to an end as he ended up in the range of 80- 90 ft. (24-27 m). Red felt the intense heat once again leaving him, his tense soaked form relaxing as the pleasurable burn faded. Red opened his eyes and looked down below. A cocky smirk crossed his face as he realized his muscles had grown even more with his height. The lower half of his penis was blocked by his mountainous pecs, Blue obscured from his sight. Though he knew his cocky friend was enjoying the show. He flexed his arm, impressed by its peak rising nearly to his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue was wondering if he should indulge himself at this moment, as the surface no longer shifting and spreading out beneath him. He wanted to feel every part of his friends colossal body. Touching caressing, tasting every part his small body could touch. And Red was big enough that he could do it for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed had his own plans, which would entertain both, just not in the way blue was thinking of at the moment the moment....</span></div></div>",

He tried to rub across everything he could, kissing, licking, wondering if it was doing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed wasn't focusing on that currently, as his hand slowly reached down, his hand more than capable of fitting 20 Blue's in its mighty grip. \"Eh?!\" Blue gasped as he saw the sky grow dark. \"But its still day!\" He shouted, until he looked up. He screamed (very manly, and not high pitched and girly, he had more dignity than that! Right! Right....), as Red's hand gingerly picked him up somehow by the back of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue gulped as he saw Red's giant eyes staring at him, the eyes of a literal Pokemon god. \"... ... ...\" He said, as Blue slowly grew more and more pale, considering the sly grin Red had in full force. Especially as Red lifted him slowly up and up, up above his head, smiling almost sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait Red! Don't do this! We have so much history together! Don't you remember Kanto? Lavender Town? When you fucked me! Oh wait, that was yesterday.\" Red's mouth slowly started to open and he let go. \"GGYYYYAAAAA!\" Blue shouted, as Red's mouth clamped around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue remained caught in a fetal position as Red swabbed his tongue around, Blue kind of tasted familiar, almost like Blueberries? He shrugeed even as he got a better idea, grabbing his thick pole with one hand even as he gave the trainers in the Battle Tower quite the show, other hand teasing his hole. After all, what was blueberries without a little bit of cream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an earth shattering crash, he plopped to the ground, thick, muscled ass crushing the ground underneath him. \"Oy! What's going on out ther-ack!\" Blue shouted, as Red's tongue full on licked him, leaving him sopping wet. Outside, Red grabbed his cock, thick enough that he needed both hands to wrap around it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted it up, his thick pecs providing a nice rest for it as he leaned forward, the 50 ft cock the perfect length for him as he ran his tongue across his head, the shudders enough to send miniature earthquakes for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening wider, he wrapped his mouth around his cock slit, tongue teasing it, even as Blue was caught between the two, getting soaked in pre and spit. Slowly but surely though, he found he was having more space to move, while could only mean one thing, Red was still growing!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the people in the Bsttle Tower had lost all restraint, pants gone on members of both sexes as they watched their god self-pleasure himself, even as Red surged larger and larger, legs and ass toppling larger and larger amounts of the forest. With a particular surge, quite a few of them came as they saw one pulse seize his balls, and with a dual tremor, they could feel their impact, all the way in the tower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pushed Red over the edge, just as he hit 120 ft. The first spurt filled his mouth completely, together with Blue. It was enough for his cock to flop out. \"... ... ...!\" He moaned, as he shot load after load, with spurts large enough to blot out the sun,  painting the landscape white, as each thrust of his hips sent tremors throughout the earth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Red had his fun Blue tumbled about in the dark haired giant's mouth as his tongue played with Blue, thankfully dodging his molars as he was moved about. <i>\"Red that jerk! When I get out of here I'll eat as many of those candies as possible and make him look up at me as I toy with him!\"</i> Blue thought in anger as his body and clothes were soaking wet from saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when the pre and cum came gushing in he was no covered in sticky seed. <i>Yup I will eat every candy possible to get back at him.</i> Blue grumbled, humiliated further by this act. The moans of pleasure and contentment from the outside only stirred the boiling pot further. Strangely, his body began to absorb via the skin the cum in Red's mouth. While plenty went down Red's gargantuan  throat, any that so much as touched Blue for less than a second disappeared into his flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when Blue experienced something strange. \"<i>Feels strange. Kinda good! Mmm~ Red!</i>\" His clothes began to tighten on his  body, tearing sounds desperate to be heard as there was now room in the vacant mouth as the cock released a white flood outside for those in the Battle Tree to enjoy. Moved into the left side of the mouth and pressed into his gums, Blue felt a rthymic <i>hum hum hum</i> permeate his body as his clothes started to tear, he took one look of his body and smiled as his saw his sleeker and more lithe  frame compared to his more lightly toned friend  Red was now a powerful body of imposing strength and muscle. His was disappointed he didn't get to enjoy it more as he saw biceps that could crush rocks with a simple flex were taken away feom him by the monumental tongue that still pressed into them, but much gentler than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue looked down ar His cock, an impressive eight inches originally, soon began to rise up to his perfect shelf pecs, trying to nestle in between both and the giant  mouths gums. <i>\"I wonder if I have grown bigger as well?\"</i> Blue smirked as he felt the tongue starting to playfully tease his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed the light brown haired man's body had grown considerably, enough that even Red outside could feel his size expanding, and as he inched ever higher to ten feet Red decided it was enough. Holding both his palms out, Red spat the growing but diminutive Blue into his hands. Spit splattering his open palms as Blue landed with a thud. Blue's body was thankfully durable enough that it did no major damage, far luckier than if he had been normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly standing up, Blue mentally sighed that he could now speak openly as he shook his body and his hair to get the saliva out, moving his hands theough his beown hair to get it back to its normal position. With that done the now 15 foot Blue pointed at Red \"Red you jerk! That was uncalled for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed took in Blues now beefy form before smiling \"...\" Red declared him to be cute as he was growing in soze, which caused Blue to turn another shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point! I wanted to have some fun with you as partners and you blew it.\" Putting his arms together he looked away from him. Red looked down unsure if Blue was just playing hard to get or if he did expect him to pay back for that stunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue finally spoke after two minutes. \"In exchange I <i>want</i> to get as big as you and get to fuck you as much as <i>I</i> want.\" There was clear anger in his tone, so Red knew he couldn't tease him about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired giant closed his eyes for a minute to ponder what to do. Of course he was only messing with him, but he sidn't take into consideration how much that hurt Blue. So his feelings were justified. Plus Blue almost never wants to fuck him and sometimes Red really wants it. After three minutes of thinking it over, he looked down and spoke \"....\" He will agree to all those terms! But he wants at least two  things as compensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... .... .... .... .....\" He wanted the now twenty foot Blue to find the candies,. Then find their pokemon, transfer them all to the  PC,, and have them sent  to Professor Oak for safety. No matter how big of a God he'll be to Alola, Red would <i>never</i> seek to hurt his, Blue's, or anyone else pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are terms I can agree with\" Sighing with relief, he's happy Red was still in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile as the two converse, the thick seed that permeated the landscape caused vegetation to grow unexpected. What little landed in the sea seemed to be having a effect on the earth and causing...more of it to form from where it landed? Hardening and become fertile soil for new land.  Yet what few pokemon who didn't flee in time and or were hit in the ocean  that had the white goop land on them were completely unchanged. Though their levels had gone up a tad!  Truly these new  Rare Candies have brought out pokemon attuned abilities in the living giant Red.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ike was located in the thick forests between Gallia and Crimea, just near the border between both lands. The Hero class mercenary was some ways from the rest of Greils Mercenaries. Only the green haired warrior Boyd and their non-mercenary comrade, the light blue cat Laguz, Ranulf were with him. Ike wielded his blade and clashed with Boyds axe. The two muscular warriors training as the sound of metal rang through their ears. Ranulf for part of their match had been lying down in a feline position as he watched, blue cat ears perked up as he heard the clash of sword and axe. Ranulf had already spent some time training with Ike just before this, the dark blue haired Ike sought to dodge Ranulfs cat forms claws to better prepare for facing  less seen laguz foes. They never found the man who turned the shapeshifting laguz feral with drugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more clashes, with Ike dodging Boyds axe and it getting stuck in a tree immediately afterwards, the two called for a rest. Sweat trickled down their faces from a long day of training. Boyd collapsed down next to the tree impaled by his axe, happy it was over. \"I know you wanted to get stronger I didn't expect you'd call me!\" Boyd typically trained under Ike's second in command Titania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has to practice with actual opponents if he wants to get better\" Ranulf stretched, his tail standing up as the catboy stood up. Ike stood proud even as sweat soaked his makeshift clothes done by his sister, using a little force to pull Boyds axe from the tree and giving it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I'm real thankful to the both of you for this. Normally I just train by myself, but I need to get faster while hitting hard.\" Ike had a look of gratitude as his stomach let out a growl for nourishment. \"Now I hope Soren gets back soon. Im starving\" The scowling, lithe tactician of the mercenaries had left just before the match between Ike and Boyd began to get food to feed them, knowing they'd be too tired to walk back to camp immediately afterwards. Mostly just for Ike. Neither Boyd or Ranulf expected anything more than a single piece of anything while Ike would get a mountainful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well while you two were busy I found something interesting half buried in dirt earlier.\" The heterchromia eyed catboy spoke as he stuck a hand in the bush near him. Ranulf pulled out a crate. He had seen something shiny and decided to see what it was during the first half of the twos match, though it just being a crate that was shining didn't interest him. Opening it, he saw had seen a bunch of Icon statues much like Ashera's, but these ones depict a child. A young girl of unknown origin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never seen such icons in my life.\" Ranulf mentuoned as he began grabbing two, then tossed one to Ike and Boyd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they work like a normal Ashera Icon and boosts our natural born luck?\" Boyd asked, eager to get more lucky strikes against foes to protect his brothers and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't know until we try.\" Ike said to make it clear he'll be the first to try it. With that Ike gripped it in his right arm, bicep bulging as he applied pressure to the fragile pbject to break it and absorb its power. The sound of cracking could be heard as a red and black aura seeped forth from the new cracks in the statue. They slowly began to trail across Ikes body, visible for Ranulf and Boyd to also see.The cat and warrior moving closer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This looks like the stuff produced by the Dark God.\" </i>Ike thought, but quickly dismissed as impossoble. Soon a new feeling emerged as his clothes pbegan to tighten. Muscles thickening as his body inched upwards by 3 or 4. The pump of his tightening clothes and power rushing his body made Ike feel really good. The blue haired man closed his eyes and let out a soft moan to Boyd and Ranulfs surprise. \"Feels...nice\" The power that was rushing through him told him it wanted a release, and his pants tightened as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Looking down at the one in his hand, Boyd wasn't sure to use it or not. Ranulf on the other hand felt something dangerous abou this after that power was released. Like pure chaos energy spilled forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIke meanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Look for whatever treasures remain that can help us!\" The toned, black haired Dread Fighter with dark skin ordered a group of Zofian soldiers before him. The low ranked members of the Deliverance were picking through the riches and resources hoarded by Desaix in his Fortress after they bested him and his Rigelian allies that guarded the fortress. They defeated both armies and freed Clives love Matilda who had been kept hostage for an execution during the battle. Thankfully Faye had used Rescue to bring her to safety, allowing Alm, Gray, and the rest to wipe out their forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man though I'm not cut out for this kind of job. Don't we have anyone else whose good with numbers and keeping track of supplies? Oh what am I saying of course we don't. Maybe if Alm recruited that mage from the village we went by, but he refused to stop until we saved Matilda.\" Gray grumbled as he helped write down and keep track of the money and, weapons, and food stored within by Desaix as men brought it from the storage and treasury rooms. Desaix was a man who overindulged in all he could. Gray sighed as he sat down. <i>Bet Tobin is trying to flirt with Clair. Poor guy doesn't know he doesn't have a chance.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young man indulged his thoughts, one Zofian soldier brought forth two containers to Gray. \"Sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartling Gray, he replied in surprise \"Ah! What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two containers with the unknown magic spells shielding the lids will not open.\" The helmet wearing soldier placed both containers before him. One contained a symbol of the Earth Mother Mila the patron deity of their country Zofia while the other bore the symbol of the War Father Duma, patron god of their southern neighbors and current foe Rigel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not have our Priesttesses, Clerics, and Mages analyze it?\" Gray asked. Magic is their forte afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did sir. We sent it over to them to see if it will open. Er..you do remember ordering me to do that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray was surprised. <i>Crap. Was I so bored out of my mind I didn't pay attention to what was going on around me?</i> Gray kept himself from showing it. Dont want people to think he's slacking. \"R-right. Why'd you bring it back to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The magic users stated only those of great strength can break them open. We brought them before Lord Alm and Sir Clive. Both said these were to be gifts to you in honor of all your hard work slaying Terrors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well uh Ill let them know personally how thankful I am for these gifts.\"  The soldier saluted before returning to his duties. Looking down at both the Dread Fighter  began contemplating. <i>They didn't have to give me these. Though I am thankful for such gifts, I just never expect to be rewarded for slaying so many Terrors in the former shrines of Mother Mila</i> Gray had slain so many of them in those dungeons, sometimes solely consisting of himself and Alm, becoming more powerful then the other members of the Deliverance. He became powerful enough to become a Dread Fighter after Mila's Servant blessed him. He even managed to beat the imposter Desaix at Zofia Castle who wielded a Dracoshield! <i>I suppose it's no surprise they we will reward me for such merits.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the lids of both, he used his max strength to pull them off, the mystical seals binding them vanished once they approve of his level of strength. \"Easier than I thought.\" Pulling out the contents of both, it was two radiant gems that brimmed with unknown power. Each bestowed with power of the Sibling Gods. Though Gray had no idea of that at the moment. \"I wonder what they do. Maybe I should try...\" He pressed the two together, rubbing them softly for a response. The friction of the divide gods power coming together sought an outlet for their feud, even as mindless stones. A vessel worthy of them was holding them, and so light flowed from them and into Gray. The former villager none the wiser as the power was unseeable to human eyes. His clothes slowly getting tight while his pants rode up his thickening legs...</span></div></div>",

It came with a letter that said ''Here is a gift to soothe your soul for only getting into Smash Brothers as part of a Final Smash'' but I have no idea what it is talking about.\" Robin picked one up, which Chrom noticed was the blue of his hair and marked with white and silver. \"These seals won't even glow when I touch or try to use them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is bizarre. Mind if I see one?\" Chrom asked as Robin turned his attention to figuring them out, nodding in silence. Chrom grabbed one and instantly light flashed within it as it started to right up. \"By the Gods!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin turned towards the Exalt and his eyes widened as a divine light glowed around the mastery seal and Chrom as it prepared to class change. Piecing it together lead Robin to the truth \"Then that means this was for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that a flash of light engulfed Chrom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep in the murky depths of Valla's castle Gyges, the maddened masked dragon Anankos head and neck lay buried. The Silent Dragon was lost in thoughts, all alone. \"Destroying both Kingdoms would be easy if I only had my dragonstone. That accursed object I discarded in the astral plane after it failed to curb my madness. Only that fragment remains in that songstress grasp. No matter. My revenge will come. Then the paradise I desire shall be reality.\" He had waited for an age, a little longer would not change much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Anankos was not keen to was that his alternate counterparts had all discarded their stones the same way. Millions, nay, billions of dragonstones floating aimlessly in the astral realm. Eventually a plentiful amount of the now ownlerless rocks would collide, the impact of these same stones would merge them. The power of the stone amplified twofold with each new contact, and with it a new greater stone would be born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such dragonstone, easily the size of Garon's Blight Dragon form, floated aimlessly in the deeprealms. It had wandered for a time until it reached just the right spot, gravity taking hold as it fell down into the territory known as My Castle, where it fell with a heavy *CRASH!* as it tore through Corrin's private quarters like it was paper. The young lord awoke from his bed chambers with a startled \"We're under attack!\" as he swiftly grabbed the nearby Yato to see what inader had attacked so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead before his sight lay a massive stone that filled most of the room, narrowly avoiding his bed. The table, chairs, chandliers all smashed beneath its bulk. Pieces that were less fortunate sent with enough force to pierce the wall or crack it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the Gods name is this?\" As he left the bed, the sleek ebon and ivory armor with black tights that  naturally tight clinged to his skin. The nimble and lithe lord moved out of his bed, grabbing his cape with his free hand. Elegantly putting the sapphire cape on with a swift movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel an aura of intense power permeating from the large object. \"It resembles a dragonstone. But there's nothing big enough that could carry it save for a dragon I think\". He gently caressed the godly stone with his right hand, expecting it to be inert like his stone save for when activating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead a rush of power flowed out of it as it seized his palm. Petrifying the arm in place as power coursed out and into the half-dragon. \"A-ah!\" The yell he released was feeble and sounded oddly...aroused. Intense heat filled his body as a tent start to form in his tights. Bubbles began to emerge from the ground as the enchanted water of their draconic breed flowed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin could feel it pour into him. A vast ocean trying to contain itself in a small cup, the small frame of the cup bulging out as it tries to contain it. Then Corrin his right arm started feeling weird as he heard a hum like Azuras song, but deep ancient and primal. Soon his armor and tights began to bulge out as his arm instantly grew twice its size, including in mass! It was swift and almost hilarious as he felt his sinew, bone, and veins grow beneath it. It did it again and again until the entire arm was bigger than the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-gotta control it! I won't let it rip me apart!\" Corrin yelled as he willed the power to spread out. The power of the Silent Dragonstone began to react to his will, slowly shrinking the arm as all of Corrins skin bubbled beneath the armor. The armor slowly spread out as his body started to hulk out. \"C'mon! Bend to my will!\" Corrin gritted his teeth as his neck bulges with strong muscle, his antlers appeared on his head as he grew in height. Soon his arm started to become 'normal' relative to Corrins new size as he bent down, his right now equal in size, only gaining a bit of mass before shrinking as the stone continued to feed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow seven and a half feet tall and easily the size of an amateur bodybuilder, and a throbbing cock that was obscene in its size tucked away. Corrin growled \"Let. Me Go.\" At its new master request the stone calmed down as it shut its tap, letting free the arm as a burst of water flowed out of the hole it made and into the sky. With a burst it gushed forth and flooded My Castle for only an instant before the wispy water and bubbles evaporated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah....Hah...hah...\" It had taken everything from Corrin to end it there. Like an intense workout that had gone overboard. Corrin's eyes began to glow crimson red with a deep entrancing intensity. \"That was weird.\" That's when he realized something odd was going on. \"Wait...Jakob and Felicia should have already burst in here freaking out, not to mention my personal assistant. Why has no one questioned this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to stand up properly, but his legs were numb. Their new thickness as the thighs press together. \"Can anyone help me!?\" Corrin called out. Strangely someone did enter the room, and the voice left him perplexed. \"Papa! What happened here?\" the voice had to belong to his child Kana. But she sounded different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa was just practicing with his dragonstone and tired himself out. It's nothing to worry about. Come help Papa get up\". He held up his massive right hand, the black tight covered hands hiding azure markings that were emerging upon the hidden skin and accentuating the veins beneath the engorged armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure papa!\" Kana ran up to stand before Corrin, and he knew in an instant this wasn't his daughter. Spiky hair and boyish face compared to his girls sweet features and bun styled hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Papa? It's me Kana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power that he had unleashed had rewrote My Castle as he knew. Rather, it had placed the young warrior in a new reality. One different from his own in slight and noticeable ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the fact his kid was now male. And maybe much larger in size than he's supposed to be. Bizzare dragon magic and genetics will do that!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was night at Tokyo's Juvenile Hall, the leader of the Phantom Thieves of Heart, Joker aka Ren Amamiya, was resting in his cell. Not much for him to do except wait for his release and Shido being convicted since the former Prime Minister and the God of Control Yaldabaoth behind him were both defeated. He had little contact with his friends on the outside, and the Trickster wanted something to make the days go easier since he was visited two days ago by Igor and Lavenza as they finish their contract with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder how Ryuji is doing.</i> His first thought that night was to his cheerful blonde friend. The first to join him in the Metaverse as they challenged Kamoshida in his Palace of Lust, and together with Ann and the incarnation of hope Morgana faced off against. He'd worried about all his friends and Confidants, but tonight he decided to focus on his kind but not the brightest, friend. He worried about Morgana just as much, if only because the shapeshifting feline disappeared with the Metaverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wonder if he's still mentioning he's a Phantom Thief of Heart.</i> The thought amused him as light shined through his small window, as Ryuji always loved being boiterous and speaking before thinking. But that's just one of his charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. A desire to see your blonde companion.\" As an ominous voice rang out Ren instantly got up and prepared for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax kid. Just happened to stumble upon you and heard your thoughts.\" The voice, which sounded both similar to his own, yet also sounded like Shido's, filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;* Who are you?<br>\r\n* What's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax kid. No reason to have a heart attack over meeting a God.\" The room filled with an eerie green light as a lanky figure whose frame reached the ceiling of his cell appeared before him. Armor with a wood like appearance, a cape split in two, gold, a fake red beard around the helmet, with the intense green eyes of the skeleton that wore it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Dagda. Father of the Tuatha De Danaan and son of Danu, mother of the Tuatha de. I stumbled across this universe after leaving my own for a bit\" The skeleton now known as Dagda stated as he mystically spawned a massive floating bowl next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;*Not interested<br>\r\n*I don't like where this heading<br>\r\n*He sounds so edgy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Not even interested before I can give you a chance to make things easier on you. I like that from a human, especially one who has become a Godslayer. Though you're mutually cooperation is not needed for what I want\" The skeletal Celtic God informed the mortal before him. \"I was seeking to dispose of this Dundry of mine after asking my daughter Brighid for it. A place where my accursed mother will never find it. Lucky for me this universe is hidden from her wretched sight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;*Still don't want involved<br>\r\n*Sounds like you have mommy issues.<br>\r\n*Don't pawn off your junk on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you will. Now that the original Grail the people wished for is gone, the masses indolent desires will seek to make a new one that will serve the same purpose, even if the number of folks who wish for it are small. Do you get my meaning?\" Dagdas words put Ren on alert as he became wary of this info. A reborn Yaldabaoth is possible. \"Now you're getting it kid. However, my Dundry can perform the same miracles as the Holy Grail. Angels have desired it for their accursed God for that reason. But if a singular human claims ownership before the masses do well....\" He let the implications  of avoiding Yaldys return come to Ren himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I don't trust you.<br>\r\n&gt;*I'll take your word on this. How do I stop it?<br>\r\n*No thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you asked kid. Use my Dundry to grant a wish. It can be small, it can be huge, it can be so inconsequential it changes nothing. Once you do the Dundry will obey you as I've long given up ownership of it. It cannot grant my wish. A wish unimportant to you or your world.\" He warned softly as he put to sleep the guard starting to walk by before continuing \"Now best be wary. Once one is brought into the supernatural it becomes a permanent part of your life. My appearance here is just a sign of your future. Heh. Good luck boy.\"  With a chuckle the bony deity vanished in a flash of green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Dundry before him Ren knew better than to wish for his release. He'd get out on his own time. So the leader of the Phantom Thieves made a wish to see Ryuji. In a flash an \"Oof!\" Came out of the blonde blur that fell onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up Ryuji to see a small rooms door he wondered what was going on. \"Where the eff am i?\" Looking around only to see his friend. \"Dude! It's good to see ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Likewise Ryuji<br>\r\n*Nice of you to drop in<br>\r\n&gt;*Sorry about that Ryuji<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Ryuji asked as his leader informed him of what happened. \"So some shady skeleton gave you this to avoid that asshole Yaldabaoth resurrectin'? Sounds too good to be true. But uh if it can will ya have it get us outta here? Don't wanna be stuck in this cell when the fuards come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Ren wished for them both to be in  the Cafe Leblanc. Making a secondary wish as soon as they were in his apartment for a dummy that is mistaken by all guards in Juvenile Hall for himself. At least for now while the two catch up.</span></div></div>",

The brown haired, toga wearing angels wings glimmered with light from the power of flight blessed upon him. He flew threw a bizarre set of stone rings held together by gold energy, which glowed for but a sec to send the angel to another part of the great sea that connects the galaxy. \"Okay Lady Palutena that was the fifth ring on the map. What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let me see...\"</i> The voice of the green haired goddess was looking at a mystical hologram map before her, trying to figure out where to go next. Most of it was simple to understand, a line trailing through a 3D view of the Galactic Sea and the five teleporting rings. Each part of it only appearing after one set was complet, yet now it spread out in all directions with no clear destination. \"<i>I told you Pit. You should have thought about learning more about this legendary Hot Spring and how the map worked before you sprinted off to look for it. This map has now decided to screw with us at this point</i> \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Lady Palutena it was legendary<b> Hot Springs</b> said to grant any wish! There was no way I could pass this up after the humans gave me the map as thanks when I slew those monsters during an attack on their village\". He flew around observing his celestial surroundings for clues, with no mass of land to rest should his time expire in sight. He still had four minutes and a half left of flight time, so he was not panicking just yet. Plus Palutenas teleportation magic would get him in time.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Right. It's not because it was a hot spring they mentiined. Nope. Definily not that at all.\"</i> Palutena reluctantly sighed as she tried to mess with the holographic projections, only for it to remain the same, not wishing to leave him stranded. As soon as her power had been charged to give him flight again Pit had jumped off Angel Land without thinking. The green haired Goddess of Light had to give him flight to save him, which Pit then used an opportunity to go fly off to space to find the treasure he craved. Suddenly a tiny Centurion flew in, bringing news tochis goddess from the humans below. <i>\"Wait seriously? No wonder it wasn't working. Either the map wasn't replicated properly or they destroyed the planet it was located on.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Lady Palutena?!\" Hearing what sounded like bad news, the angel began to worry as two minutes remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The Centurion I sent to investigate informed me the villagers found the map in the wreckage of a ruined Aurum vessel that crashed when we fought them off.\"</i> Pit did not like the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I screwed myself over didn't I?\" One minute thirty seconds remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't worry I'll rescue you from there with my Power of Teleportation.\" </i> 45 seconds passed before she spoke again.<i> \"And my powers aren't teleporting you out of there. Nor are any of my others powers. Just the ones that were active when you arrived there, and it seems it won't let me reinforce your flight. So make peace with me and I'll see you in your next life\".</i> Palutena began preparing his funeral rites as 15 seconds remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you giving up on me a little fast?!\" The power of flight began to fade as he started losing flight. \"Nooooo! Me and Pittoo are too young to die!\" The power faded as he started tumbling out of the sky and down into the starry sea below to his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs what fate would normally have happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead the heroic champion of Palutena fell through a hidden, mystical portal that opened up, dropping him with a heavy splash into a large hot sping big enough to serve as a big lake. Golden waters shimmering brightly as Pit struggled for air by the surprise and swam desperately upwards to the surface. Upon breaking the surface, water dripping down his face as he took a fresh breath of joy. \"I'm alive! I'm alive!\" He opened his eyes in joy as he yelled out in excitement, seeing the large lake of steamy, golden water that lay before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I found the Legendary Hot Springs too! Did you hear that Lady Palutena!?\" No response. \"Lady Palutena? Oh no I can't quip with myself! I learned that the last time I tried it.\" Swimming slowly, he saw some land a good couple hundred feet away, which seemed to have silvery leafy flora growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit began to swim to nearby land. \"This place must be why her powers weren't working. I'll have to find a way to communicate with her when I get to land.\" Though he about it for a second. He could enjoy these springs before reporting to her, it wouldn't take long to enjoy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah once I enjoy these springs for a bit I'll find a means to contact her. Not everyday one gets to enjoy legendary Hot Springs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aurum, who had poorly replicated the map, had failed to obtain and thus not replicate the special guidelines that warned of what to do and not to do in this hidden realm of blessed Springs. Namely that males were not allowed for the...<b>interesting</b> side effects it had on them and weird power bestowing. Of which Pit would soon feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough at least his toga will grow with him!</span></div></div>",

I knew I should have actually gotten the laser eye surgery for my All-Seeing Eye of Palutena..'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pinched her brow in annoyance. Pit and his hotsprings, if it weren't for the fact he was so passionate about this stuff, she'd be mad, but he was just too adorable about it. She laughed as she walked away from her magic pool. She wasn't going to mention that Pit was missing to Pittoo. The less he knew, the better. \"Now, how am I going to find Pit... One of these days I'll have to promote him; keep him busier that way.\" She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====With Pit====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit meanwhile was having the time of his life, gently backstroking through the Ultimate Hotsprings, enjoying the feeling of soaking in the hot water, feeling it surround him, enjoying it loosening his tense muscles. \"Ah, gotta love soaking the sacred buns~\" He cheerfully admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as much as he wanted to enjoy, he needed to contact Lady Palutena first. He quickly swam towards the shore, still unaware of any effects of the springs. It would still be a bit before that kicked in. \"Aw, but it's such a good spring, but Lady Palutena... but Hot Spring! But Lady Palutena...\" He kept carrying this internal debate on, idly swimming towards the shore all the while. \"Hot Sprints... Lady Palutena...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BONK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" He rubbed his head, realizing he had bonked his head on the shoreline in his absentmindedness. \"Lady Palutena.\" He said, as if it were some sage wisdom, and not the end result of 3 minutes of his life he'd wasted on a pointless debate. Shaking himself almost like a dog, he flicked his wings off, trying to get the wetness out of them. \"All this water better not make me shed any more feathers...\" He muttered as he walked onto the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, he looked at the vast expanse of hot spring behind him. \"HOT SPRING!\" He shouted, eyes shining with stars, before an imaginary caricature of Palutena whacked him on his head. \"Lady Palutena... right.\" He looked around, trying to get his bearings. Near the shore were some very unique looking plants, glowing silver in the golden light of the hot springs, there seemed to be some kind of fruit growing on them as well. At least he wouldn't go hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Palutena! Hello! Can you hear me!!\" He shouted mentally, trying to see if he could reach her. He tapped his laurel, \"Is this thing working! Hello!\" After a few minutes of trying, he sighed in frustration. \"Agh! Come on... what am I supposed to do...\" He crossed in arms in deep thought, before he looked over at the hot spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like she'll know.\" He said slyly. He was supposed to follow the Angel Code, but he shouldn't let all his clothes get wet. Plus it's not like she'd see it. Grabbing his belt, he undid it and his clasp, letting his toga and scarf loose, which he carefully hung to dry, leaving him only in his navy blue tights. Stripping off his gold rings, gauntlets, and sandals off, the last thing to go was his laurels, before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOHOO!\" He shouted, diving into the hot spring, clad only in his tights. No shame there. He savored that hot spring, enjoying the heat, the feeling, the swishy-swoshy of water. Hey, it's not like he was a poet or something. He can't even read! Although Palutena was working on that at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned at the sensations. \"This hot spring is amazing!\" He yelled, feeling such a unique feeling as though his very muscles were saturated by it. In truth, they were. One legend had it that Heracles, who Palutena told many stories about, found his strength from a hot spring just like this one. Although no one knew they were one and the same. In truth, it was just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out, he stretched, letting his limber limbs relax, and one could see the changes start. His tights were not a lot tighter on him. If one didn't know Pit, they might think he was just starting professional swimming, his arms and legs lithe with slowly developing muscle, just slowly becoming apparent and his pecs and abs developed enough to show just a faint outline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his own face looked just slightly more mature, not by too much, but a closer look would show things were off. Other things were more mature as well if his front was any indication.  He stretched back, showing how much tighter his sacred buns clenched as well. Nobody could resist not grabbing a piece of them, even as more pale skin showed on his thighs, the former tan line no longer able to be covered by his tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis toga might still fit, but everything else is gonna need to be resized for sure!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*GROWL* A primal noise emitted from Pit's stomach as he happily swam through the hot Springs. \"Stupid hunger. Ruining hot spring time.\" Pit grumbled in annoyance as he turned aeound and began to swim towards the shore where his clothes lay. It took him a few minutes to return, his body enhanced slightly more as his angelic buns were shown off to the endless springs as he stood up and walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill leave my clothes there for now. No point in putting them back on when i'm just having a snack.\" Pit thought aloud as he wasn't entirely able to get over his love of talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoooking over to a short silver leafed tree, drool seeped from his mouth in anticipation as he saw a group pf silver looking apples dangle before him practically begging to ne eaten. \"These look delicious\" Pit happily ran over, plucking the silver fruits one by one until he had made a mid sized pile of them to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the last one in his hands, Pit smiled \"The Gods have those golden apples they adore sp much, so silver apple's must be just as good!\" and with that he took a might bite of the fruit. The taste was fantastic! Sweetened to the right amount of perfection. Juice seeped from the bitten apple down his cheek, dripping onto the sand. Every bite made him crave more! Soon nothing remained of the first fruit save for its steme and core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! That helped a little\" Pit happily patted his toned tummy, looking over at the pile he made. \"I still have a lot more to eat until I'm satisfied. When I get back I might even share some with Pittoo!\" And with thwt he began to munch into his next fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while he failed to noticed how his tights were getting tighter, covering less pf his growing body as visible bicep even Pit would notice started to develop. The fruits had the same effect as the hot springs only even stronger. And if a number are eaten simultaneously perhaps even their affects would be magnified!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough even Pit noticed some changes as he paused eating his fifth fruit \"My tights are weirdly tight around the front of my thighs...oh well I'll worry about that after finishing these lovely treats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Meanwhile in Angel Land====<br>\r\n\"Still nothing...\" Palutena was wearing an odd set of antenna and standing on the roof  of her home temple, trying to get some kind of signal. \"Well this isn't working.\" Tossing the antenna away and landing with a *CRUNCH* as they collided with the ground, Palutena thought of her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I better contact Pittoo and see if he can help. He'd also help me know Pit truly is okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sent out her telepathy while moaning like a ghost \"Pittoo... Pittoo... Pittoo~...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop with the moaning and tell me what you want.\" The serious black feathered angel replied in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good! Pits still alive then.\" She sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that was enough to get Pittoo on alert \"What trouble did you get him into now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me. He found a map to Legendary Hot Springs and you know Pit when it comes to those.\" She chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical.\" The black haired angel sighed that his other half got himself into trouble over Hot Springs. \"You want me to go find him don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo. Ill use my power to give you flight. Will it be alright with Viridi if you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares what that brat thinks. I need to go anyways, as she won't be happy when she learns what I did to her forces over her last penny reason for trying to exterminate Humanity.\" Pittoo sou ded coxky over whatever he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since I haven't heard anything about this I will assume you nipped it in the bud before it became a problem. So lets get you pver here and ready to help!\" Palutena activated her teleporting magic and sent him over to Angel Lamd, where the dark angel will be lesd to the same lamd as his other half.</span></div></div>",

His growth was still fairly slow, despite his swim and the apples, but it was slowly growing more and more apparent. His height had gained several inches as well, his spandex now only covering to mid-thigh now, the paler flesh easily apparent, although it seemed to be gaining a nice tan together with the rest of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wings gave a light flap as he finished his stretch, bending down, the spandex stretching tight around his butt, his sacred buns slowly growing firmer and rounder. He finally opened his eyes and looked down, wiggling his toes. He did think something was off though. 'Were they always that big?' He thought, as his eyes ran up his legs too, a minor twitch making his calf flex. 'When did that happen I wonder...' Pit thought, as he enjoyed maneuvering his legs to watch his muscles flexing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis looks gradually moved up to his upper body, his blue eyes sparkling with amazement. \"Whoa, this is awesome!\" He said in joy, running a slightly larger hand over his arm and forearm, slowly feeling as he placed his hand on his bicep, lifting his arm up as he flexed, feeling as the muscle underneath grew larger and firmer, not anything overly impressive, but to someone who's spent most of his immortal life a thinly built angel, it was everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit looked around nervously, knowing he was breaking quite a few Angel Laws, but it's not like anyone was going to catch him, right? \"I wonder... It wouldn't hurt to take a peak...\" He muttered, grabbing one strap of his spandex as he pulled it down, gently pulling his wing out as well, before following the process with the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't pull it all the way down, stopping at his waist, at least trying to keep his modesty, as Pit looked down, and he was speechless. \"Sweet Lady Palutena... I have abs... and pecs!\" He gawked, as he ran his hand over his chest. He looked like he'd been doing sit-ups for a few months instead of just shoving whatever food Palutena left for him for healing down his throat, a very faint trace of a 6-pack present, able to feel the light bumps of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little bit harder to observe them though, as he had to bend down a bit further than usual because of his pecs. Again, nothing too impressive, really only sticking out an inch or two. \"I always wondered what these felt like...\" He muttered, testing their firmness. Considered he'd always been flatter than Viridi in that regard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd marveled at that for a while before feeling like he was going to get caught, although he didn't want to, wanting to continue looking at himself, but he had just knew he'd get caught. That is, he'd feel like that if this was some cheesily written story, \"But that's just ridiculous!\" He laughed as he put his spandex back on, giving his wings another flap, a few wings fluttering down, as he wondered if they looked bigger, but he had other things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's causing this...\" He wondered, getting in his usual thinking pose. He definitely wasn't this buff before he tried searching for the Legendary Hot Springs... \"What would Lady Palutena do...\" He thought. Last time he asked her something about something similar,  she'd started talking about the Monoeyes and the Miks, something he really didn't want to get into again. Mainly because he couldn't read it, and the pictures were weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran through the check list of everything that could have been going on, and he really couldn't work anything out. \"Hmmm, wait a minute,\" Pit muttered, an idea coming to him. \"Lady Palutena said I'd only grow iff I ate healthy...\" He looked at the apples, \"If these are hot spring apples, nothing could be healthier than that!\" He shouted, \"I better eat more!\" He yipped as he got to apple-picking, running around with more energy then before, somewhat ignoring some other needs he didn't quite notice yet, his spandex pulled quite tight around his front on the lower end, and like the rest of his body, still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Up above as well====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it you crazy goddess, where the heck did you learn to drive!\" Dark Pit yelled, avoiding yet another floating rock as he tried to avoid dying yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I never actually got my license. The Divine Motor Department was always too slow. That's what we get for manning it with sloths!\" Palutena said, currently dressed like a WWII-era fighter pilot as she steered Dark Pit on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Pittoo yelled. \"You better know the way at least! You flew Pit-stain this way! And I told you, it's DARK PIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Palutena didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember the way, do you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why I'm a solo angel...\" Pitto-Dark Pit muttered, face-palming and wondering why every deity had to be so insane.</span></div></div>",

Two Centurions had taken it away to be locked up, but without Pit to be their brains they forgot where that was and had been circling her temple for hours mindlessly. \"Note to self. Find a a way to marginally increase their intelligence.\" With map in hand she unraveled the parchment, it's holographic projection of the Galactic Sea laid before her. The path Pit had rushed through flooding back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news for you Pittoo! I found the map.\" Palutena sounded proud of herself despite making such a huge oversight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. We wasted some time wandering this starry blue eyesore cause of you.\" Dark Pit grumbled, worried about Pit as they they had wasted more than half the time limit on nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena waved her finger in the air as she heard those words. \"Tsk tsk! Pittoo you need my power to fly after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who asked me for help. Also it's Dark Pit!\" He grumbled knowing the battle of names is eternal with this teasing Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go through these rings and it will lead you to his location\" Palutena intentionally ignored his rebuttal as the black feathered angel flew across the sea that connects the galaxy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang Gods ignoring an angel when it's convenient\" Grumbled Pitt-er Dark Pit as he flew amongst the heavens, passing through the first ring and heading for the next. Palutena was increasing his speed as much as possible as she eyed something...odd. There was something off about Dark Pits body. His body was more curved? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No that wasn't the right word.\" </i>She thought as that'd describe herself far better. She could definitely see more skin exposed than normal peeking out from his tights. His rings and sandals were abnormally tight, pushing into...visible muscle Palutena definitely knew neither he nor Pit had<i>. \"Those toes stretching past the sandal are cute too.\" </i>She mused to herself as she them wiggle a little. Now moving to check those nice lean thighs that were starting to be exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passed the second ring Dark Pit had enough of the silent goddess. Her thoughts as clear as day. \"Stop perving on me or I'll have the Goddess of Vengeance deliver retribution\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Pit would never have noticed!\" She had been taken offguard by his keen insight.<br>\r\n\"Cause he is an idiot.\" Dark Pit grumbled.<br>\r\n\"So do you know why I was observing you?\"<br>\r\n\"My clothes right? Yeah I noticed the changes already. It's annoying and most likely related to whatever that idiot's up to.\" He touched his chest, feeling his chest push out a little more. He smirked at the thought of flaunting a bigger physique a beefy chest in front of that brat of a goddess. \"Maybe they'll even get big enough to make Palutena jealous...\" He smirked as he passed the third ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that~\" Palutena cooed to him. Amused by the absurd idea of Pittoo or Pit ever being that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't care if you did. Now lets find that fool and give him a talking too.\" He flapped his wings harder as he headed for the fourth and final rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====Legendary Hot Springs====<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" Pit had finished his second pile of apples, having plucked and snacked down on as many as possible. He was really excited by this land that offered him everything he desired \"No matter how many I eat I still want more. A paradise of food and hot springs I'll never tire of~\" He tossed his finished apple into the pile with the rest. The brown haired angel adjusted his tightening tights a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though maybe I should stop and relax for now. If I keep eating I might bust out of this\" He felt his belly push out a little, the nice definition of his first abs coming in as he gave it a pat. The food he ate also expanded his belly a little. Yet it was not even close to as big as it should be from more than three dozen apples plucked from two silver leafed trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again I'm sure there's more fruits for me partake in.\" He saw in the distance pineapples growing to his right, while the left grew bannanas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to choose...\"</span></div></div>",

The old wizard had left with his apprentic Mickey for the moment to find mystical tools for the battle against the Xehanorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens were relaxing as they waited, Riku reading a book made by Yen Sid for tools that could turn things around. \"Hey Riku?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" The silver haired boy asked as he moved his eyes up to look at the relaxing Sora, who was tossing a small ball in the air to keep himself entertained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think we'll find anything that can make a difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure if someone actually helped me look.\" Riku knew Sora had gone through a couple books, but Sora isn't the brightest tool in the shed and likely missed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be easier if Donald and Goofy were here.\" Sora pouted as he still tosed the ball. \"Okay maybe if Donald was.\" Goofy was pretty insightful, but he wasn't a mage for a reason. The brown haired boy accidentally tossed the small ball higher than normal as it ended up hitting the roof. \"Dang it! The ball!\" it began bouncing away and into a shelf, hitting a small vase next to a set of books and knocking them over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunk resounded through the room as the books fell on the floor. The vase was thankfully safe as it slowly roll down upon the floor in a position that prevented it from shattering. \"Whoops!\" Swiftly Sora ushered forth to clean up the mess, picking up the vase and books, save for one that fell down as he picked them up and started to organize them back. The fallen book opened wide. Falling upon just the right page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku who heard the commotion just smirked as he closed the book that had nothing of import. Standing up and going to pick the last book as Sora put away the rest, Riku began reading the open page. Blue eyes trailing across the page as he drank in the knowledge written down. \"Hmm...seems you found something for us to use afterall.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sora had no idea what Riku meant till he turned around and saw Riku standing behind him.  He moved next to Riku as his blue eyes shined as he started looking at what Riku was reading. Riku saw locations inscribed and long details Sora wouldn't be interested in.

Maybe even stronger!\" Sora was enthused with that choice. He tried to imagine flexing a muscle as big as Hercules on his skinny arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next is a legendary trident in the depths of Atlantica said to make a merman who can travel the very stars themselves like he's in the depths of the sea.\" This one showed a Trident very different from King Tritons weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Monstro?\" Sora was amused by his merman form being as massive as Monstro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku flipped the page to continue reading \"The last is...a Paopu Fruit grown in the Realm of Darkness, able to bless resistance of the dark to its chosen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do need to become reslient to the dark like you. So I won't fall under Xehanorts sway again.\" Sora admitted as he remembered their scheme to make him the 13th Vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading over to Yen Sids desk, the silver haired blue eyed keyblade wielder grabbed a bookmark to mark the page, closing the book. \"The exact locations are inscribed in as well. So what one do you prefer Sora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....\" And Sora began to think.</span></div></div>",

He and Riku had just finished trying to save Kingdom Hearts, but what put Sora at risk the most, especially with Xehanort, was his weakness to the darkness. Riku was immune because of his familiarity with darkness. But the Paopu was also the most dangerous to get, since it was in the Realm of Darkness itself. That's a lot of darkness... \"I think we should go after the Paopu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku nodded. That was Sora's greatest weakness, so becoming immune to darkness' influence would be their greatest aid, and derail Xehanort's plan. \"That's probably the best choice... but the most dangerous. We need to be ready.\" Riku said, as he started walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are you going?\" Sora said, as Riku threw a familiar black coat in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me in just a bit outside, make sure to wear that.\" Riku said, carrying his own as well. \"I'm going to gather some supplies. Try to gather some of your own.\" And with that, he walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gather your own... blah.\" Sora mocked, as he headed off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====x====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Sora, wearing the Black Coat, was waiting outside Yen Sid's house, as Riku finally showed up. Sora huffing. \"Took you long enough. Did you get lost, why do I need to wear this anyway?\" He didn't like being dressed in it. Too much like Organization XIII for his tastes, looking at Riku dressed in his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Realm of Darkness takes a while to get to, unless we use this.\" Riku said, holding his hand out, and before Sora's eyes, a Portal of Darkness opened up. \"These make for fast travel, but you need to wear these, otherwise you might be effected by the darkness.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Sora muttered sheepishly. He had forgotten about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Riku continued, his keyblade appearing in his hand. \"Let's go.\" Sora nodding, the Kingdom Key in his own hand as they both walked through, Sora shivering as they did. He hated the feeling of the darkness. Once they got through, the sickly purple swirls of the Realm in full view, Riku looked at the page he'd ripped out of the book, and pointed on one path, brimming with Heartless and the occasional Nobody. \"There we go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Sora said, as he gripped the Keyblade tighter, and with that, he and Riku went charging, taking down countless enemies as they carried on their hazardous search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horde of heartless, and a few scratches, healing spells or potions, and close calls later, they'd finally arrived at a beach, Sora recognizing it as the one they'd left not too long ago. \"Can't believe we were that close to it...\" Sora muttered, looking around for it. \"Where is it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku looked as well, seeing a lone palm tree in the distance, like what he and Sora were used to on the Destiny Islands. \"Over there!\" He pointed, Sora smiling at that as they both ran over to it, running as fast as they could before anything could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was almost anticlimactic...\" Sora muttered. \"Normally we'd get at least some kind of boss before we finished.\" He noted before Riku punched him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't jynx it...\" Riku chided, as he looked around, worried that something massive would come out. Once he was convinced it was safe, he looked up and saw a familiar shaped star-fruit, which he quickly climbed up and got, \"Sora! Catch!\" He called from up above, Sora looking up as he saw the fruit coming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Sora muttered, struggling to catch it, the fruit bouncing around in his hands before he managed to get it, looking at the fruit, which was a much fainter color than the ones he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooff!\" Riku grunted as he plopped to the bottom, panting slightly. \"What are you waiting for?\" He said, as he looked at Sora who was looking at it, who looked at Riku, then back to the fruit, before leaning in to take a bite.</span></div></div>",

Sparks of colorful light appeared around the boy as his whole body became light as a feather and rose slowly from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you flying? How can you do it outside Neverland??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash of light almost blinded Riku, making it clear what was happening was completely different to a mere reactivation of an old power...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora, now feet above the ground, shined like the sun. His friend grew worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora! Talk to me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiky haired boy couldn't reply... his mind was miles away, in the far past... Somehow, he was witnessing the memories of the paoru tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///Once upon a time , a lone seed fell to the realm of darkness, a land of nothingness where nothing can born or grow///<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///The seed didn't give up, and sprouted in the sterile soil despite the lack of water and sun. It grew, resisting the toxic energy of the darkness. The heartless stepped on the tiny plant, but it managed to heal and came up again... and eventually grow into a beautiful tree by his tremendous will to live.///<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///But nothing is eternal, and over the years the tree began to whitter.///<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///He lived alone his whole life, so his final wish was to meet someone... someone as noble, brave and stubborn as him. He wanted a friend.///<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///He spent his remained nutrients to grow a fruit, a gift for that longed friend, filled with immense light, his own lifeforce and whatever magic make him grow in that hell...///<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///Because after growing in the world of the heartless he understood how important it was to forge a hero strong enough to stop them.//// <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights faded. The kid slowly descend to the ground near Riku. The trance broke and his eyes opened. The first thing he did when he waked up was running to the hill Riku got the star fruit, but the only thing he found was a whithered trunk surrounded by twigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora could not help but cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's dead... *sob*\"<br>\r\n\"It's just a plant, Sora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, but still it took him minutes to stop crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n\"I feel... stronger! Like I was supercharged or something.\" He made a few superjumps and noticed he got much higher than before. \"I didn't expect an anti-darkness magic would make me physically stronger.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it worked.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ms. Paopu Tree!\" He bowed in front of the dead plant. Riku smiled at his overreaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that jubilous vanished quickly when the ground started to shake and heavy steps and roars were heard nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" Riku casted a portal to the realm of light. Sora jumped to it without the slightest doubt. His taller friend looked back one last time to the rest of the tree and said softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he crossed the corridor of Darkness and returned to Destiny Island before the heartless could catch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was an adventure. I'm beat.\" Sora had been waiting for him lying on the sand.<br>\r\n\"But you were so energetic just two minutes ago!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't know why I'm so sleepy... *yawn* now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku took him to his home. Once in his room alone Sora took a look to his pocket. He still had a small piece of the Paopu, the transformation had hit him before he could finish it. He put it away in a drawer, just in case Riku changed his mind and wanted some protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he went to the bed, laid down and fell asleep almost instantly.</span></div></div>",

They had grown a lot since then, specially stronger, and could take a marathon like it was a sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Riku felt quite impress by Sora performance, who eventually overtook him without showing a minimum exhaustion (even Riku was getting a bit tired after all the sparring and running).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy reached the finish line in record time, but his tremendous momentum didn't let him stop before falling by the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora!!\"<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAhhm fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora had been punched by giant heartless, burned by gods and worse.

They swam and played for half an hour before returning to the land. Soaked, their wet clothes felt so heavy they removed most of them on the beach. It was strange to see the start of a 6-pack in the previously skinny body of Sora. It wasn't the only change: His noodle arms were getting as thick as Riku and his flat chest had gained volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing extraordinary, but Riku found strange he hadn't notice these long-run changes until now \"...and he can't have grown this much in just a day... can he?\"<br>\r\nHe had to stop looking at Sora's body after his friend noticed his inquisitive looks. \"I don't want this situation to get weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora kept oblivious to his body changes, but not to his lowing body temperature after their plunge. \"Brrr! I need a towel and dry clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't any, as they hadn't planned the swimming training. They went to their homes, but since Sora had lost his home keys when he dived into the ocean, they both went to Riku's house. The parents of neither of them were in town, so the spiky haired boy was free to spent the night at Riku's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku lent him one of his new pijamas, which on him looked a bit tighter than he expected, and both friends relaxed in front of the TV, sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSide by side so closely, his friend got distracted again with the other's proportion, this time his feet.<br>\r\nSora had always stood out due to his big feet, several sizes longer than Riku's (which were quite big even for adults). That was the reason he had to wear those ridiculous yellow clown shoes instead of regular ones... but today the difference between them seemed more exaggerated than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, the tips of Riku's toes were aligned with the base of Sora's toes... but now, they barely reached the \"ball of his foot\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can his usual shoes... or any shoes... capable of fitting those beasts?\" RIku thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora, growing sleepy, stretched his back and limbs.

Despite being pretty short, he wears shoes that dwarfs my father's.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe his feet grow first and later the rest of his body catch up with it.

By chance?\" <br>\r\n\"Of course I haven't!\" Kairi shouted, embarrassed \"He's just my friend!\"<br>\r\n\"Haha, shame, I would like to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku moved away from the pair to avoid being detected and forced to answer the Selfie's lewd question. After spending so much time together, swimming, sometimes sleeping in the same room he had the chance to see him nude. And Selfie was right, Sora's was huge down there, almost three times Riku's. His ridiculously baggy knee-long Bell Bottoms helped hiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream turned bizarre when Riku met Sora. Riku grabbed an apple and bit it, but when he blinked the apple turned into a bitten Paopu fruit hold by Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our destinies are intertwined, Riku.\" KH1 Sora turned into KH2.<br>\r\n\"I'll protect you forever, Sora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his eyes closed, Riku moved his lips closer to the shorter teen... but when he opened his eyes saw he had missed and reached his collar bone. Sora had magically become a head taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you protect me, Riku?\" The spiky haired boy asked with a strangely sad look.<br>\r\n\"I can. I'll be on your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReacting to his words, the boy grew taller and thicker, a muscular build way beyond Riku's formed in his body as he broke the 3 meter tall (10') barrier, his abs in front of the other's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, Sora...\" But Sora added over 30cm (1') more in height, now his giant crotch was at Riku's eye level. The ripped clothes releaed the beast, a long, fat, tanned soft cock hanging close to his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth trembled as the muscular giant inched upwards. Instintively, as his more-than-a-friend's face got out his reach, Riku hugged the giant penis in front of him to regain stability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sora's legs lengthened a lot suddenly, soon Riku was hanging in the air, meters from the ground, gripping a phallus turning thicker with each second, and harder to kept hold of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora! Don't let me behind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the 10m (33ft) boy didn't seem to hear his screams. \"Mmm...\" All he said was a soft moan escaping his lips. Soon Riku found out why. It wasn't the growth, despite gaining more and more meters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hugging the giant 's penis was more arousing he estimated and went hard quick. Soon it was pointing upwards, and was so long it touched the lower part of his abs.  Very opportune for Riku, who was desperate for reach Sora's face, but the task was bcoming increasingly harder with the now 18m/60ft tall Sora. He tried to climb his hill-like pecs, but they were slippery and almost fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora!!\"<br>\r\n\"This island is too small. Mmmmm...\" Sora grew 20ft more, his pecs thickened a lot more, looking bigger than a bodybuilder's, and almost impossible to pass by by Riku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, the world will be too...\" Another shiver of growth. He was as big as an Olympic titan. His humongous feet ran from end to end of the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora, I'm here!\" Riku finally reached Sora's collar bone, close enough to his face to be heard.<br>\r\n\"You can't protect me from the darkness, Riku.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku awakened in his bed, with his PJs wet with the sweat from the nightmare, and his undies wet with the results of the erotic aspect of the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What fucked up dream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku looked down on the left side of his bed. Sora was still sleeping on a futon next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could he grow so big so fast? It's weird...\" He thought as he stared as the shape his pecs printed on his tshirt, and at his newfound abs that the PJs wasn't long enough to cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was his morning wood, peeking from his pants. It wasn't as long as in his dream, but it was surrealisticly big, which his head resting on the upper row of abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long is that, a foot? More? Wait a sec...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was longer than it looked... because Sora's body was longer too, as his more stretched clothes hinted, with some rips that wasn't there when they went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora, wake up! Get up now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleepy, the boy obeyed and stood up slowly... and then they both found out he had grew another foot (30cm) overnight.<br>\r\nRiku's head, 180cm/6', was aligned with the base of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool?? People don't grow 30cm in one night, and even less after growing 20cm the night before! Sora, this is serious, something is happening to you!\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, I understand these growth spurts could be problematic it continues.\" The boy said rubbing his head, that moments ago had softly hit the overhead light.<br>\r\n\"Dangerous. It must be the Paopu from the realm of darkness you ate. We must see Master Yensid as soon as possible!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay... ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora wasn't used to being a 7 footer...

I don't need it to reject Ansem, I can do it alone since Chain of Memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Barely)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but this fruit can help you... make you free from your regrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku didn't understand the meaning of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In KH1 you made a mistake...\"<br>\r\n\"I accepted to be Maleficent's apprentice, tried to humiliate you, became Ansem's vessel. I fell into the darkness. That's much more than a mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! That's what I wanted to say. You messed it up ONCE, and you're being feeling remorse since. No matter how much you try to make up for it, you're always thinking you're the worst, that you might get corrupt again at any moment!\"<br>\r\n\"That's not exactly...\"<br>\r\n\"The hell it isn't! I know you, I know what you feels. You protected me while I was sleeping in KH CoM... in 358/2 you tried to fix me bringing me Roxas, almost giving up to soul to Ansem... during KH2 you kept protecting me from the shadows despite having much bigger concerns keeping Ansem at bay... in KH DDD you saved me so many times...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid stopped for a moment. He needed a break after breaking the 4th wall so many times...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point is, you can't stop feeling guilty, feeling Ansem might take you the first time you're less than the perfect hero.\"<br>\r\n\"Those principles stopping Xehanort from possessing me.\"<br>\r\n\"But now we have a better alternative. Take part of this, and you'll never worry about Ansem anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know. If you eat less than the whole thing it will be less effective...\"<br>\r\n\"Take half of it, or I won't eat any.\"<br>\r\n\"You're so balky... I'll take a fourth.\"<br>\r\n\"No, half of it!\"<br>\r\n\"...third?\"<br>\r\n\"Riku...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arguing for minutes they came to terms. They divided the paopu and eat it fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds went by before it began to affect them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey felt a warm sensation in their insides as their bodies began to float in the air. Sparks of magic lighted up the surroundings while they floated between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no pain, just a sensation they couldn't describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fruit filled them up with so much light it leaked by the pores of their skins, giving them a shining aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hugged, as that warm, undefined feeling grew stronger and their eyes wetter for no reason.<br>\r\nFor a minute, the Realm of Darkness had a sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it began, it ended. The two heroes tried to recover from the experience...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they couldn't relax: the ground started to shake and heavy steps and roars were heard nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" Riku said as he prepared to open a portal, but nothing happened. The light had purged that dark power from his body. \"Crap\"</span></div></div>",

That way you are kept safe-\" Both boys eyes gained a glint of determination. The warm light that now flowed within sensed danger was coming and rushing fast to their destination. Keyblades flashed in brilliant light into their grips as Sora brought out Kingdom Key and Riku Way to Dawn. Prepped for battle, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh it's my normal keyblade!\" Sora said in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Mines my usual too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerplexed they had no time to wait as easily a hundred pureblood Shadows slide across the ground in their intangible state.

Thundaga!\" He swung his keyblade as he chanted the spells name. But righteous lightning did not descend as the Shadows slowly moved closer. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having trouble?\" Riku was ready to strike, but Sora wanted to show off after eating the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird.\" Sora tapped the tip of the keyblade with his free hand a few times. \"Well if that doesn't work then Blizzaga!\" No chilling ice crystals.<br>\r\n\"Firaga!\" No burst of flame charged forth.<br>\r\n\"Fine. If magic doesn't work then Salvation!\" There was no spinning or columns of light to purify the dark.<br>\r\n\"Hey Riku...did that Paopu reset all my power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. I didn't expect that either.\" He sighed, knowing the outcome would be the same if he tried. <i>Looks like this Paopu was more trouble than its worth. Even if I regain my power I don't have any contol of darkness anymore. My Dark Firaga and other skills powered by the dark may either be gone for good or I lost it for now</i> Setting his thoughts aside, Riku knew what he had to do. \"If our powers are gone we just have to get them back the old fashioned way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smIrked. \"Yeah!\" Soras lost his abilities twice before. Getting them back again is simple. \"Whoever beats the most has to buy the other ice cream!\" Sora rushed off after making that bet, hacking away with ease into the swarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReacting to Sora charging forth bg jumping over and hacking down two of the tiny yellow eye mooks, Riku responded \"You're on Sora!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got a rush of adrenaline that seemed to get stronger with each passing second. The new light inside gIving them a rush to blindly fIght as the two dodge and swipe at the horde. Shadows vanishing by the dozen in dark puffs of smoke. But every three striked down by their divinely blessed might was negligible to the the ten that spawned as reinforcements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Sora swung again and again as Riku yelled \"take this!\".

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>10 years ago, a general who had read too many comic-books had the idea of making their own super-soldiers. His proposal was received with moderate interest from his superiors and the Ministry of Defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next years some experiments were made with volunteer soldiers, with limited success and many failures, most of the time implying death.<br>\r\nBut due to the rising international tensions and armed warfare over the world, the potential of the idea, an army of super-strong and bulletproof soldiers, was enough to ensure its funding, which only increased over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 years ago, with dumber politicians in power, someone decided this inhumane project (which had accumulated a thousand demises, only a dozen of men turned into just a Peak human status, and a hundred of unaffected subjects) could help their Olympic teams to break their bad streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some people, 5 minutes of international fame was more important than human lives. And there was a lot of money in the sports world to be bribed into their pockets\u2026 and so, another priority was added to Titanomachy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 years ago, the project, under the direction of a new but talented scientist called Richards Fox, made an important breakthrough: He identified several keys for the Titanomachy\u2019s success or lack of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Age: Young subjects in development had bodies more malleable and responded much better to the treatment. Male in their early twenties or late teen were the optimum, and anyone over 30s would get little to none improvements and higher risk of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Genetics: There was several gene linked to a greater or lower response to their experiments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Environmental factors: Constant and extreme stress, like most soldiers experimented in war,  or a really aggressive personality could be very detrimental for the experiment. A more peaceful environment caused better results, sport level exercise seemed to improve it a little further\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese ruled out almost all the army for one reason or another, and the ones in charge were considering shutting the project down when Dr Richard gave them a perverse alternative:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t turn soldiers into supersoldiers, but we still can turn civilians into supermen and then into our desired supersoldiers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, they had to gather genetic profiles from all the population and select the most promising candidates (they could be easily thousands, if they cherry-picked the ones with more genetic potential, if not, millions). After than, they would have to invite them to their facilities, a false highschool and college with dormitory, under the promise of paid education and/or top-notch training in whatever sports they were into\u2026 keep them there under their surveillance, subjected them to their growth treatments and subtly brainwashing, and one or two years the first battalion of titans would be formed and ready for deploy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if some of them found out the plan\u2026 or their own changes\u2026 and tries to escape?\u201d A general asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI have several ideas so they would spend months growing without them noticing\u2026  but even if that happen, our security would caught them before they escape and put them in our underground lab under the academy. There will be no reason to be subtle there, so we\u2019ll subject our prisoners to our most extreme growth treatments. I trusts I could get the best results that were, albeit with some causalities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went in motion: Thanks to their growing funds, the Atlas Academy were completed in just a year and advertising campaigns made a name for itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, any youngster into sports and modest students who couldn\u2019t pay their college started to long for getting one of their  full-paid scholarships. Even semi-pro sportsmen wouldn\u2019t reject an opportunity of improving their skills there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a part of the promotion campaign, the academy performed the first undercover, pilot experiments over a few candidates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose guys, who were merely average rookies when they entered, got graduated (released) as superfit  200cm tall (6\u20197\u201d) athletes that triumph in that year tournaments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only increased their considerable fame. The real experiments, with all their experiments, would start the next year, when they received thousands of applications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could have just limited to choose those willing candidates, but Richard was overambitious and used the genetic database to find the best possible subjects in the whole country, including those who wasn\u2019t interested in the Atlas Academy or sports, and sent them admission letters to convince them to join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the real fun would start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Dr. Fox was the leader of the project, once the Academy was build his superiors forced him to share the decision-making power with other two \u201cteachers\u201d, who can make their own experiments under a third of the students, besides the common treatments shared by all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard Fox took that like a defiance, a way to prove he was better than any other by getting the biggest giants. The truth is that he was an arrogant bastard who only cared about recognition, so he tried to make the life impossible to the other \u201cteachers\u201d. The ones who had worked with him agreed  he was too obsessed with The Project, to the point his motivations seemed almost\u2026 kinky. He got the biggest and tallest candidates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to name his group of students as \u201cRed giant\u201d, as a dying sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other board member was Dr. Thomas Tame, a silent guy, younger (in his 20s), and smaller and thinner than most (5\u20196\u201d). He was serious and hard-worker, and that\u2019s how he gained his position.<br>\r\nMost of his students were average size or shorter than average (a fact Fox loved using to mock him) but he didn\u2019t mind as long as they had a considerable genetic potential to grow giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe formed a group of students known as \u201cHidden sword\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third member of the board was a goth-looking man named Corvus. Fox and Tame didn\u2019t know who he had ended up there, as he didn\u2019t look like a scientist at all\u2026 but the ones in power knew Corvus very well. He was a man capable of getting anything done by the right price, by using mysterious ways. Some people said he was a mage. They weren\u2019t completely wrong.<br>\r\nThe Titanomachy Project had caught his interest and asked to lead it. The one who objected disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis was the \u201cHouse of darkness\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Atlas Academy opened his doors, for real this time\u2026 and nothing will be the same.</span></div></div>",

It had fallen with a massive impact, miraculously survived the fall. It rested in the same spot for over millions of ages before it would be enveloped in the Cloud Sea brought forth by of the Architect. Forgotten, fallen, and lost in the sea. Nestled away for an eternity in the land of Alrest eithout ever changing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an eternity in silence a hook perced the ground next to it. A Salvager dressed in blue feet landed upon the ground right next to it. Through his helmet the figure observed the item before him. Adding the inglatable device to it, it soon rose off the ground as it floated through thd water like cloud. The Salvager gripped it tight as it floated to the depth probe. Attaching it to the probe, the Salverger moved up to press the button and bring himself and the treasure up to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the Salvager and his latest treasure breached the surface of clouds, light of the sun basking both as the Titan Azurda stands proud. With the object placed gently on the white and green giants body, he jumped dwon off the probe. Getting upon his gramps, the salvager known as Rex pulled off his helmet. The white giant turned his head to speak \"Did you get a good catch Rex? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRexs golden eyes reflected the suns light as he looked up at Azurda. \"I think so!  Both the probe and ping worked better than usual. We might be able to make use of them a tad longer.\" Rex grabbed a tool and worked to forcing open the sealed lid. With a bit of force it soon popped off, falling with a thud as its contents gushed out and over Rex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-!\" The salvager boy was surprised as it engulfed him and knocked him down. The slime like substance was blue and heavier than it appeared as he was sent under it. The boy struggling to get out of the slime due to its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all right Rex?\" Seeing a hand reach up and swipe away some of the strange slime from his mouth to make an \"Mf pfay\" as he ingests some of it by mistake. Seeing him struggle with something that look relatively harmless \"That took me by surprise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex began to stand up as the slime stuff lay across the ground. A look of annoyance as his body and clothes were drenched in it. \"I can't sell this stuff to Argentum! I don't even know what it is. Much less getting it out of me and my clothes\" The brown haired boy was frustrated by this failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurda sought to cheer Rex up\" The container looks in decent shape. You could scrap it for a few bucks in its place.\" Rex was trying to rub the stuff out of his skin, but it was now refusing to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but what should I do with this stuff now?\" He was still rubbing it at his clothes and skin, none still coming off. \"Eat it? I mean the little I swallowed actually tasted okay. Kinda bland to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd advise against that. Eating a little might already have some unknown affects on you. I'd be sad if you couldn't see your dream of visiting Elysium and solving the land problem as we Titans die never got off the ground.\" Azurda assured the boy he helped raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then better clean up whats on the ground since the stuff on me made my skin blue and won't come off.\" Rex turned to see the slime was gone, and his gramps had been so concerned with him Azurda failed fo notice it. \"Well if it's gone it probably it ain't a problem for us. Now I best get this out so we can go to Argentum for a meal.\" Azurda turned his head forward as he started to move for the Trade Guild.</span></div></div>",

What a wonderful day to explore the ship!\" The cheerful blonde knight spoke as he looked out towards the endless sky as the Grandcypher sailed across the Phantagrande skydom. He was waring his normal attire rather than his knight uniform. A plain white shirt that showcased his fit frame. Vane had joined Gran and his crew temporarily to help with something important, as him and Lancelot often came to Gran's aid just as he does them, Perceval, and Siegfried. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing worth exploring\" Perceval mentiomed. The red haired knight dressed fully in his burning red armor and who has accompanied Gran for quite awhile longer than his fellow knight. \"The ships been perfectly tuned as Gran's informed me. Though him and Rackam are thinking of switching over to one of the other three airships they also own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Percy you really do love to complain when people are happy!\" The gray eyed knight chirped as he turned to see Rackam was steering the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1. Don't call me Percy. 2. I actually came over here to you for a reason.\" Perceval silently put a hand through his perfect red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what you've got in store for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me. The captain. He wants to give you a gift in his quarters.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy! Can't wait to find out what it is! Thanks Percy!\" And with that the excited knight was off to Gran's cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly. How Lancelot deals with him as his second in command I'll never know.\" Perceval sighed before heading down to the lower quarters to face the counter attacking Ayer for training his fire attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVane had gone to the side of the deck where the door to Grans cabin was, happily giving a big knock to the captains cabin door. \"Yo captain!\" Here for whatever gift you want to give me!\" Vane then heard quick movement as the brown haired, brown eyed captain answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good you're here Vane. I've got the perfect thing for you!\" Gran had in his hands a necklace with an emblem of a Shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling as he took the necklace in his hand, Vane put it on as he spoke \"Thanks captain! Not often I get free gifts!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all.\" Gran crossed his arms before Vane could go show it to Perceval. \"This has a special power meant to make your Soul Eruption even stronger and let you shield us with Reflect like you used too. At least if the old lady I bought it from is right.\" He left out he had to hold it on himself for the next three days for it to work, since he let superstition guide his actions. But against powwr Primal Beasts like Ifrit or Colossus and Twin Elements such strength is needed to quell the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? Man so I can get even better at fighting and beating monsters!\" Vane was enthused with that. That meant he could better help train the new recruits like Arthur and Mordrded. He moved over and gave his captain a hug \"When we reach the next island lets eat together! My treat!\" Vane didn't realize he had essentially asked Gran om a date before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really wanted to practice with his skills as he prepared to go to his quarters to grab his spear. The supernatural charm of the necklace would show itself soon enough as it made him into the ultimate defensive warrior, and with it the strongest offensive fighter.</span></div></div>",

His body stretched upwards as his shirt pushed out thanks to his growing pecs, abs coming into being on his formerly flat stomach. Biceps and Triceps bulging with each breath he took. Pumping up bigger with each one. His neck thickened as his neck muscles lovingly grew. His feet peeked out from beneath the blamket,  Big powerful feet and enlarging toes on display as he moved his legs ever so slightly to miss the sleeping Jibanyan nestled comfortably at the end of his bed even as they pushed onwards and off the bed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his current clothes were expanding just fine, the Yokai Watch itself on the other hand was not so lucky. The small device was struggling against the thick muscle of the growing boys wrist. The power within Nates arm was threatening to break it with the simplest of movements as he pumped up taller and wider. The brown haired boy having a pleasant dream all the while, showing off herculean feats to his friends as he ripped homes out of the ground with his bare hands. The very ground ruptured as his power tore into the cement and earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...I hope you guys like this!\" Nate cockily proclaimed as he gripped it with one hand.

Dream Nate's ego growing bigger than even his new growing size, while his new size finally tapped out at 6'5 (192 cm). The boy snoring in joy as they began toworship his muscles in his tight clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs dawn approached and the light of dawn shone through the window drapes and the ceiling window. Whisper woke from his slumber. \"Ah what a lovely day to be a butler~\" The ghost Yokai mused as he stretched his ghostly limbs. He looked at the bed with his eyes closed as he slowly opened them \"Rise and shine master Nate-\" He stared at the beefy giant still snoring soundly, Jibanyan nestled safely between thighs that were any bigger could crush the cat Yokai like its nothing. \"Ah silly me~ I'm clearly still sleeping. There's no way he's become so huge...\" As he flew next to Nate's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter waking up the dream version of him will be a piece of cake!\" He then began to poke Nate's face, Nate's face grimacing in annoyance. \"Ah! Good morning Na-\" and with that a huge fist collided with him and sent Whisper into wall.<br>\r\n\"Let me sleep a few *Aaah!* more minutes\" The growing Nate was drained from his bodies transformation.<br>\r\nWhisper, now crushed into the wall barely worded his reply \"Clearthly noth sweepin' afer fall\" crumpling down on top of Nates pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be another hour before Nate or Jibanyan wake up. The feline stretching as Nate slowly sat up, rubbing his eyes. \"*Ah* Morning.\" The sleepy giant spoke as crumpled Whisper fell from his pecs and onto his calf.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the first week following Makoto becoming the new Hopes Peak Academies headmaster.  Kirigiri had revealed herself to be alive after they had settle in, the new school to bring hope to a world that suffered under the madness of Junko and her Ultimate Despairs. All of whom were now dead, cured of their brainwashing, or launched themselves into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto was in his office as night set in, finishing signing files for when the next generation would attend the academy. Kirigiri and Asahina were attending to other Academy matters as he dealt with this particular need. The light that shone from outside dissipating as the sun descended on the horizon, leaving only the light of the office. \"I've got quite a bit to still finish. Gotta persevere!\" Makoto convinced himself as he moved from his finished stack of papers to the next. A process that would go on for four more hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yaaaaawwwnn*\" The sound rumbled from Makoto's mouth as he finished his twentieth stack of papers. \"Only thirty more to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding* The sound of his phone receiving a message helped keep Makoto awake as he looked down on it.<br>\r\n<i>You can rest for now Makoto. I've finished more than half of my work with Asahina's aid. Hopefully we'll see you tomorrow.</i><br>\r\nMakoto smiled as he entered his password to reply back. <i>Thanks Kirigiri. I'll see you soon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her consent Makoto stetched his arms and began to move the current finished stack over so he could snooze at his desk. The peaceful embrace of slumber falling over him. What he as a human was unable to see was a ghostly .woman. She was dressed in an elegant peplos, bearing a Cornucopia overflowing with fruits in one hand, and wore a mask that cover the top half of her face. Her body glowing a pale white as she touched the dreaming Makoto's head. Her fingers slipping into his head, connecting their consciousness together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Where am I?\" The dreaming Ultimate Hope spoke aloud as his initial dream of all his classmates alive and happy vanished for a white void of emptiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My first champion, Makoto Naegi.\" A soothung female voice reverberated across the white realm.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Makoto called out, unable to see the person calling him.<br>\r\n\"I am Elpis. Goddess of Hope. Another ancient empires name for me was Spes. To the tribes who worshipped a single God I was Ramiel the Angel of Hope.\"<br>\r\n\"The Goddess of Hope? There's someone like that?\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed there is my little mortal. I have been locked away within Pandora's Box since time immemorial, but the actions of Junko and her despair released me from the box, destroying both my prison and the ruins it was stored in during their rampage across the world.\"<br>\r\n\"I-this it's a lot to take in. I must be dreaming something odd.\"<br>\r\n\"This is no dream my champion. You know little of the mythologies of which I belong after all.\"<br>\r\n\"True. But I could be making this up.\"<br>\r\n\"Heh\" A gentle giggle emerged from her. \"Things don't need to be complicated my mighty champion. I have come to warn you of impending disaster\".<br>\r\n\"What is supposed to happen? If the Goddess of Hope is truly here then it must be related to despair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is.\" With those words a miniature form of the world came into being before Makoto Small enough that he could hold it with both hands and crush it like a ball. \"Soon despair will overrun the world. Junko and her despairs were merely the prelude to the real show.\" Slowly the miniscule earth began to erupt as a massive hole pierced both sides of the world, soon followed by an eruption across the surface of the planet as a white liquid erupted forth until the planet was nothing but dirt, white goo, and magma quickly hardening from the extreme temperatures of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear came over Makoto's face as he saw this happened. \"What must we do to stop this?\" Determination began to shine within in his eyes as he readied himself to take whatever danger thqt caused this on. Hope will guide their way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merely accept become a true Avatar of Hope and the power that comes with it.\" a ghostly hand appeared before the brown haired man's eyes, welcoming one of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Makoto held the hand, instantly getting embarrassed as she began to lock fingers with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then become Hope Incarnate and shake the very foundations of the world!\" The formerly soft voice gained a sinister tone as power began to erupt forth to fill Makoto's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh!\" Makoto yelled as his mind went blank. Intense overwhelming feeling of intoxication enveloped him as boh his mental self and physical body glowed a white blue. Slowly the aura melted away as Elpis finished the transfer. Leaving both his physical and kind in a deep pleasurable sleep that stained the front of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand left Makoto Naegi's head as a smirk crossed her face. \"Heh heh heh. One down. Now to transfer the other half of my power to Hajime Hinata. The world will soon realize why Hope was sealed away in the depths of Pandora's Box.\" The ghostly masked Elpis walked through the wall to leave, allowing Makoto's body to transform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto Naegi would undergo the change of his body for the next twelve hours as he became the disaster that would threaten the world.</span></div></div>",

For Gwen, it had been a fascinating tour and a welcome break from constant alien fighting, for Ben it was one of the most boring things he had ever done. He stared blankly at the tour guide, not taking in a word she was saying about X-rays and surgery. Finally he groaned out loud and said, \"Man! When is this thing going to end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stomped on his foot and said, \"Shh! Stop acting like a kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grabbed his injured foot, jumping up and down on the spot for awhile before muttering, \"But I am just a kid! And so are you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen just ignored him, crossing her arms and focusing on the tour. Ben made a face at her back then grudgingly continued following at a slight distance. Just as the tour group was turning a corner, they passed by a window looking into a laboratory. Ben glanced inside and was shocked to see what appeared to be some kind of ray gun. He pressed his hands against the glass, leaning in close. Two scientists were inside walking around the machine, pressing buttons, writing notes on clipboards, and looking like they were preparing it for something. Ben turned to ask the tour guide what was going on in there, but saw the group had already disappeared down another hallway. He was about to run after them when he remembered how unbelievably boring the tour was. At least with this machine there was a chance that something exciting might happen. So Ben stayed put and kept watching. A few minutes later, the scientists both ripped something off of their clipboards and exited to another room. Ben looked around and made sure no one was nearby before swiftly opening the door to the laboratory and slipping inside. He walked up to the ray and looked it over, amazement in his face. What use could this thing possibly have? Was it some kind of alien technology? No...if that were the case, it would look a lot weirder and there would be tighter security. But then what did it do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out!\" Ben said, walking over to the control panel. Even though the console was covered in buttons, switches, and dials, Ben knew exactly which one to press. He searched out the biggest one and pressed it. Instantly a mechanical hum filled the room. A gauge on the machine showed a bar that was rising from red, to yellow, and finally to green. The machine swiveled around, searching for organic life, and focused on Ben. Ben froze for a second, which proved a second too long, and was zapped by a beam of green energy. Ben didn't feel like he was getting electrocuted or that he was getting hurt in any way. In fact, the feeling was rather pleasant. He felt his muscles stretching and refiguring themselves, his bones stretching, his clothes tightening slightly. When the ray finished firing Ben turned to look at himself in the mirror and was surprised by what he saw. He wasn't freakishly huge, but his muscles were a bit more defined. His biceps pushed against his tight sleeves, his pecs were much more visible, his flat stomach and the faintest hint of a six pack and his legs, though the change was not easily seen through his pants and he wasn't about to take those off, were thicker. Ben wiggled his toes feeling his socks stretched over his larger feet, pressing against the sides of his shoes. He had grown at least half a foot taller as well. Noise from the other room brought Ben back to his senses. Letting his shirt fall back over his bigger body, he ran as fast as he could from the room. Little did he know, the machine was an experimental medical machine that, in theory, was going to be used to increase muscle in those with muscular dystrophy and other such diseases as well as increase bone size and mass for those born with height deficencies. Ben had been blasted by the highest setting on the machine, and with it still being in the testing stages, there was no telling how large he would eventually grow.</span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes as he became ready for any pain about to come his way. None did though and as he opened his eyes he was stunned by what he saw. His biceps were bulging as they filled with power. The growth had not stopped there. Ben's pecs had also continued their transformation toward solid shelves of muscle. His abs had become a well defined six pack as the growth continued. Ben's thighs grew as they changed to powerful thighs that a bodybuilder would be envious of. His calves became pillars of powerful muscle. His pants had become extremely revealing shorts as the material ripped. Last but not least the growth reached his feet. In seconds Ben's sneakers shot from his feet as they (his feet) tripled in size. His socks became shreds of cloth on the ground near by. As the growth ended his shirt shredded from Ben's breaking free now hung loosely along his well muscled shoulders. When the growth ended Ben looked toward the floor beneath him. The floor seemed farther away and that could only mean one thing. Not only had he gotten enormous muscles but he had grown taller as well. Looking around Ben guessed he was probably ten or twelve feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen flexed some of  his biceps and as he saw it bulge and then disappear. He continued to admire himself as he looked himself over. Once a lab tech had come down the hall way Ben was in. when he saw Ben he ran away quickly. To him Ben must have looked quite impressive. After that Ben decided he had better go back to the tour group. the hall ways were twenty feet tall so Ben had no trouble walking through them. As Ben walked carefully his giant feet left impressions and cracks in the floor below him. After Ben had made a few wrong turns he finally was close behind the tour group. The tour guide who was looking ahead of her didn't even notice as the enormous Ben came up behind Gwen and Grandpa. \"Grandpa... Gwen..\" he said trying his very best to whisper; a very difficult task when your voice is loud and deep. Both Gwen and Grandpa turned around and as soon as they saw him their facial expressions looked very alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly they both pushed him away into an empty room which had nothing but a desk in the far corner that looked to have been out of use for decades. \"Ben! What did you do?\" Gwen shouted at him; her voice overflowing with anger. She began pacing back and forth as she tried to figure out what to do. Instead of anger Grandpa looked at Ben with concern. Ben still didn't want to tell them what he did. \"Come on Ben...\" Grandpa asked pleadingly. Ben looked at both of them. He decided it would be better if he just explained what he had done. Then he explained to Gwen and Grandpa exactly what he done. Both Gwen and Grandpa listened intently to every word. After he finished Gwen summoned a magic blast and hit Ben on the head. \"Oww...\" Ben said as a reflex. Truthfully it didn't hurt him but he didn't want her to hit him with more magic.\"How could you be so stupid?\" she yelled at him as her temperament turned back to anger. Just then....</span></div></div>",

Luckily, the group had left the area, but Ben didn't want to alert anyone else who might be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally reached the room, Grandpa looked around the machine, trying to see if there was anything he could use to reverse the machine.

It was an experimental chemical I was working on to help those with muscular and height problems. He's  probably gonna keep growing...\" Reed explained and as he did their attention turned back to Johnny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched as It started with his Pecs seemed to grow in solid shelves of muscle. His biceps and for arms soon followed suit as they grow to a width that would be any bodybuilder to shame. Everyone became slightly alarmed when they heard the ripping. Reed's suit might be made to stretch but Johnny's wasn't... As his arms grew they had begun to rip his suit at the seems. His thighs grew even wider as they swelled up with power. Last but not least the growth reached his feet which exploded from his suit. After only a few minutes of growth he was now close to ten feet tall and he had the muscles that any bodybuilder would lust. The growth continued though as his arms,chest and legs expanded and grew even more. His suit was now just a loin cloth over his magnificent muscular figure which was now close to twenty feet tall. Luckily the ceilings of the lab have been built to thirty feet and Johnny's growth seemed to have come to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny grinned as he flexed his biceps and watched them bulge. \"Thanks Reed.\" he said as he tried taking a few steps forward. The floor creaked under the weight of his enormous body but still held. He flexed his biceps admiringly again before heading towards the door. He tried walking through the door way but it was only ten feet tall and wasn't meant to expand to when some one enormous or a giant had to leave or come in. After turning himself and running into the problem of bumping his pecs he stood up and pushed through the door frame. the metal and bricks could not stand that much force being put on them and they fell through making a giant hole where the door to the lab used to be. \"I'm going out.\" he shouted back to them. his voice was so loud they quickly covered their ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Wait! Johnny!\" Reed shouted after him. Johnny shouldn't be going out in public like that. The general public would go into a frenzy if they saw a twenty foot man walking through the streets. \"He's gonna get himself caught and studied in a lab by a bunch of scientists.\" Reed shouted to Ben and Susan as he grabbed his coat black jacket and put it on. they both looked at Reed as if to say \"Like you don't want study him...\" before they hurried out behind him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a hot day. Ash was walking around with Pikachu on his shoulder, wondering what he should do. Ash had taken off his jacket and left it, hoping no one would pick it up later. Ash continued walking around, almost fainting from the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu, we have to find some shade soon! I don't think I can last much longer in this sun.\" Ash barely managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi..ka...\" replied the pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh quickly found what he was looking for and collapsed to the ground. He closed his eyes for a few minutes, allowing himself to relax and calm down so he could realize where he was. Ash after relaxing got up, still hot, but cooled enough so that he could get a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some buildings that had various things in them, businesses, housing, and the like. However, there was something nearby that looked interesting enough, and no one else seemed to have noticed it. Ash walked up closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object was only a pillar, about 3 feet high and had an alcove where a large hook that was attached to who-knows-what sat inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, 'Pull and Buff'?\" thought Ash. \"I suppose I'll try, and hope it is what I think it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gave the hook a good quick jerk, but as soon as he did so, it yanked him forward and he couldn't let go of the hook. Ash suddenly felt bigger, and indeed he was, quite rapidly growing large and muscular. He saw his biceps explode with power as it grew well beyond it's normal size. The muscles fighting for space on the once tiny arm with the biceps unflexed as big as Ash's head. Also, although he hadn't noticed it, his pecs were growing as well making anything in front of him, much harder to see. His torso had morphed into that perfect V-taper as his shirt was stretched at the top, yet relatively normal sized at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting so....BIG!\" yelled Ash to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was finished growing the hook unlatched his hand and the first thing he did was flex his incredible biceps where thick snake veins pumped blood to his super-sized muscle. Ash hadn't even noticed that he wasn't finished growing. Ash only continued to flex his super biceps watching as his growth hit the 2nd stage.<br>\r\nAsh only briefly glanced at his pecs seeing them flood out in front of him under his shirt, which briefly made him wonder how long it might hold out. He was to soon find out. Ash grunted as he felt the power increase once more through his body causing him to start sweating from the intensity, and not the blazing heat. His biceps continued to grow, pulsating with new raw power as the snake veins continued to multiply feeding the monsters that were his arms. His mighty pec shelf greatly expanded, making his poor shirt, very tight, and losing the war that was space. And it did lose, as his shirt began to get too tight and Ash heard the shirt finally give way in several places with a satisfying RRIIIPPPP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh only now took a good long look at his body beneath him, what he could see anyways. He looked at his mighty pecs which blocked most of his view, and felt what he could of his torso, with the abs so deep and cut that they were practically mini-pecs themselves. His favorite was his arms with the biceps so big that were the size of most bodybuilder's legs. Although he couldn't see or feel them, he knew his back and traps made his small waist look even smaller with so much muscle up top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there was only one thing Ash wanted to do, and that was \"Pull and Buff\" again!</span></div></div>",

He, Brock, and Misty met a scientist who was researching the physical structure of Pokemon. Particularly \u201cFighting\u201d types. He was trying to figure out why some of them seemed to wear clothing and the benefits of doing so. Misty didn\u2019t really find it all that interesting, unless he was talking about Poliwrath.<br>\r\n\u201cSo Ash\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... um..\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMacho. Call me Macho. I have here a Machamp belt. I was able to get it from one before it passed away. I was hoping that you\u2019d be willing to help with my research on it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBy wearing it of course! It is a belt, and can be worn by humans it seems. I need you to wear it for a while and return to see it\u2019s effects. If any at all.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Ash took off his current belt and replaced it with the Machamp\u2019s belt. Interestingly, it didn\u2019t look any different from his regular belt aside from the \u201cP\u201d on it.<br>\r\n\u201cIt apparently changes shape to fit the wearer. Fascinating..\u201d He said writing notes.<br>\r\n\u201cBye Mr.Macho!\u201d Ash said as he left with his friends. Ash felt great, like he could do anything! They stopped to have lunch where Ash had eaten almost all of what Brock made.<br>\r\n\u201cSlow down Ash, you\u2019re eating too much.\u201d Misty said with annoyance and concern.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Misty. I\u2019m just really hungry!\u201d After they ate, they met up with Ash\u2019s other traveling companions at Saffron City. They were Misty, May, Dawn, Mallow, Lillie, Iris, Lana and Shauna. The guys were Brock, Cilan, Clemont, Kiawe, Gary and Gladion. After conversing for a while they headed to the Pokemon Center for the night. Ash bunked with Brock, Cilan, and Kiawe. Ash went to seep without taking off his clothes as he was too tired. His grogginess making him forget that he had Machamp belt. As Ash woke up, he felt a tightness with his clothes and noticed something different.</span></div></div>",

Standing up, he noticed his shirt and pants didn\u2019t cover his abs and ankles. His jacket wrapped around his large back and thick(ish) neck with the sleeves tight around his large broad shoulders. Ash then noticed that his friends, still groggy, had grown as well. Brock\u2019s muscle were more defined, stretching his vest. Cilan\u2019s shirt was skin tight while his vest\u2019s buttons were holding on for dear life. Kiawe was like Brock, but since he was shirtless, his clothes suffered the least.<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, look at yourselves!\u201d Ash proclaimed. The boys look at themselves with shock. Although their muscles masses looked similar, Ash and Cilan seemed to have grown the most due to the tightness of their clothes. They were more or less the same size of Brock and Kiawe, who\u2019s muscles were already noticeable, now they were just more pronounced. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ash asked Brock with a bit of exited curiosity. Brock took a double take. Ash was more or less his height. If the rest grew in height, it was unnoticeable amount.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Ash, but I think we\u2019ll need some new clothes.\u201d Brock replied.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask my mom. She be able to make exact replicas of our clothes in bigger sizes.\u201d The four then went to the Center\u2019s restaurant where the others were. They noticed the change as soon as the Boys entered. Misty Lillie, and Gary examed Ash. May, Clemont and Dawn Looked at Brock. Sophocles and Iris at Cilan, and Mallow and Lana at Kiawe. They explained their predicament over breakfast. Pikachu and the other Pok\u00e9mon adapted to the change pretty quickly while the others were still curious about the cause but could find no immediate answers. Ash called his mom who could get the clothes ready and have them sent and arrived in the morning. They then decide to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1) Explore Saffron City.</b><br>\r\nGary is jealous of Ash. Chili and Cress arrive to see their brother Cilan. Clemont investigates the cause. Misty is not sure how to fell about Ash. And Iris finds Cilan more annoying somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2) They stay at the Center.</b><br>\r\nBecause of their new weight and can\u2019t be on the top bucks now bunks, Ash and Cilan now bunk with Gary &amp; Clemont while Brock and Kiawe bunk with Sophocles. (Ash, Cilan, Gary, and Clemont grow larger than Brock and Kiawe) Cause is <i>still</i> unknown.</span></div></div>",

Brock, Kiawe, Iris, and Misty came as they heard the noise. To their surprise, Ash and Cilan had grown again. Not only that, so did Gary and Clemont. Upon helping Ash up, Brock saw that he only came up to Ash\u2019s shoulders. The same went for Gary, Cilan, and Clemont. The girls and Sophocles came up to below their chests. Thankfully, Ash\u2019s mom had sent clothing for all the guys in much larger sizes. But they were still tight. As if their height wasn\u2019t enough, their muscles had grown as well. Ash\u2019s jacket only covered his pecs, while his shirt revealed his abs. Gary\u2019s black shirt did the same. Cilan currently had the largest muscles and had to scrap his white shirt, leaving only his black vest and green tie. Clemont couldn\u2019t get his jumpsuit to get around his back, so he left it open. Although happy he was bigger, Gary was still annoyed that Ash seemed to be a few inches taller than him. He\u2019s also jealous of Cilan\u2019s muscle mass. About 7 feet tall, Ash and Gary had to duck to get out of the room. Cilan and Clemont didn\u2019t need to, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan had forgotten that his brothers Chili and Cress were coming. Cress was concern for his triplet brother, but Chili just thought it was awesome! (He was worried about his brother too of course)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could this be happening?\u201d Misty asked the girls.<br>\r\n\u201cNo idea.\u201d Dawn replied.

They then agreed and the three of them set off to find Proff Juniper. \u201cCome on Sophocles!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I have to go?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe need someone who knows the way.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right. You just want me to come along since I have a PokeNAV.\u201d Mallow grinned as his statement was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary and Ash were in the Center\u2019s weight room to practice getting used to their new bodies. Brock and Kiawe went outside to find something to do. It wouldn\u2019t be that hard since they were slightly closer to their original sizes. And Chili wouldn\u2019t stop bugging Cilan. After returning, the girls explained to the others that Mallow, Lana, Lillie and Sophocles went to find Proff Juniper. Nurse Joy allowed the boys to sleep in the weight room.

The current residence where Ash resided as he lived in Alola to attend Pokemon School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kanto trainer with dark hair sat next to the dark skinned fire trainer with red and black hair. The two enjoying a friendly conversation as the TV shows Detective Laki played, distracting Rotom as he wore the wig of the detective and repeated word for word the dialogue from a rerun. Pikachu was snuggled in a bed next to Lycanroc as the two dreamed happily. Meltan was happily eating some scraps of metal, his eye in the middle of the nut perk up with joy as he consumed it into his steely slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think the professor called us to let us test anything League related!?\" Ash eyes sparkled at the thought, the League currently constructed, underway towards completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. Whatever trainers we might get to fight would help us get better when we face off!\" Kiawe mused, having Ash as a hotblooded competitive trainer like himself pushed the two to greater heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby the aquarium containing Luvdisc happily swam about to the door opening. Coming in was Professor Kukui, the man who wore no shirt and allowed his chest to be shown off beneath his jacket. He was carrying some pokeballs and an unknown device in a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Ash jumped up \"What's in the box Professor!?\" His eyes pierced straight into the crate as he waited an answer. \"It is league related!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda. At the moment preparing for the league is our more pressing concern\" Putting the box at the table, he plucked out a couple pokeballs as the pokemon continued to mind their own business, tossing one to each boy without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiawe caught his instantly, while Ash let out a \"Whoa!\" As it nearly missed his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if it's not related to the League, why are you giving us normal pokeballs?\" Kiawe turned the ball around to observe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of an experiment with Professor Magnolia of Galar\" He brought out two bracelet like objects, tossing them again to he boys. Ash caught it easily this time and stood triumphantly as Kiawe looked amused by the reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to experiment with a special kind of pokemon battle in that region, so we could one day have them as part of the League, the Trials, and battles with Kahunas.\" Next to be removed from the box was the device, resembling a shield with a sword embedded in the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's eyes beamed with joy as Kiawe asked\"What kind of pokemon battles?\" The two put on the bracelets during it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A unique kind of battle called Dynamax. It's a secret at the moment so don't tell anyone else kay?\" Kukui prepped the strange device, putting into it several different Z Crystal, adorning the Sword and Shield in glamor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Professor! I want to know what Dynamax battles are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ash, soon you'll see it first hand. Though the three of us will have to exit my lab before I let you try so it\" Picking up the object as he flicked up a couple switches, each Z Crystal embedded innthe object were turning a shining pink as energy crackled about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued by the secret battles Kukuo unveiled, both boys quickly exited out of the lab faster than Kukui could count to five, the two waiting, eagerness sparkling in their eyes at whatever surprise he had in store. He moved a good several hundred feet away from the lab, both following in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man plopped the object down, flicking a switch to a light *Whiiiiiirrrrrr....* as he looked to both, adjust his cap on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whst's Dynamax!?\"<br>\r\n\"What is Dynamax professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand in his pocket, he smiled as he explained \"Galar has special areas that allow Pokemon to grow to giant size. Such battles are found across the region, including wild Dynamax pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giant Pokemon!?\" Both yelled simultaneously, even Kiawe the, mostly, calmer one when his blood was burning with passion or anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. It's quite a sight. I've been communicating with Magnolia as part of a side project, to see if we could replicate it in other regions using Z Crystals.\" He pat the pink Sword&amp;Shield affectionately as it cackled with pink energy \" Must say I've spent nearly as much time on it as trying to get the League made into a reality here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool so I can have Pikachu fight as a giant! Hey PIKA-\" Ash was cut off by Kiawe grasping his arm, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah Ash, if you could do it with pokemon that don't reside in pokeballs I don't think we'd be given these balls\" Pointing to the balls in their hand, Ash noticed they had pink lines across them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Is it true professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so. These balls are special prototypes we've made to work outside Galar when we attempt to induce Dynamaxing in Alola. Magnolia tested them on her end, now we need to see them work overhere.\" Despite being dekected, Ash perked up as he realized what they'd be doing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we already have ones that Dynamax!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah right! Can't wait to see what pokemon is in my ball and beat you in a battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'll definitely win Kiawe!\" The two were ready to battle before a loud *AHEM* came from the professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes having you two battle with those pokemon in the balls is the plan, but you have to let me finish. Dynamax pokemon shrink after awhile, unlike wild Dynamax Pokemon. So when you activate your Dynamax Bands\" He pointed to their wrists where they wore them on their wrists \"Prepare for when you want them to Dynamax during the perfect opportunity. You both even need to know how to pose to activate it, got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. It's pretty simple to activate. Return your pokemon to their ball, the energy of the Band will activate, making the ball massive. Then you toss it to bring out the Dyanamax mons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Professor!\" Both said simultaneously for the instruction, turning back towards each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get ready to lose Ash! I'm not going easy on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you! I gotta face Hau  and Gladio in Dynamax battles after I beat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth tossed the balls to let out the pokemon, only for the balls to grow huge mid toss, crashing with a heavy *THUD* in the ground as a surge of *CRACKLE* erupted with pink energy treading across the ground before the energy shot forth and went in the direction it was thrown, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-!?\" Neither had time to react as energy zapped both in the chest, with an loud *BOOM* as it sent them flying back wards and into the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dynamax inducing device was working as intended, but it seemed the balls were not yet ready for trial with experiments in Alola...</span></div></div>",

Ben's efforts only brought sweat to his thin limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's room was like a private gym, with weights and workout benches, but no treadmill. Kevin craved the feeling of a hard pump in his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes became even greener than its usual shade as he watched Kevin, with his pecs tightening and contracting repeatedly through his black shirt as he pumped his muscles hard. When Kevin was finally done for the day, and noticed Ben's workout had hardly begun, he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, what's the matter, Tennyson?\" Asked Kevin in a baby voice aimed to mock Ben. \"Can't handle a little weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why I have to do this,\" said Ben, irritated. \"I could go fourarms or humungasaur if I gotta do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of these days that little watch might not work,\" said Kevin, flexing his muscles casually and effortlessly as he spoke. \"You gotta be ready for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen's eyes widened, as if Kevin's huge bicep couldn't fit in his sight. But then, he hadn't accounted for Kevin's wide lats or 60 inch chest to join the flexing party. Ben's face turned almost as green as the omnitrix when Kevin showed off his muscular glutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Dude, warn a guy!\" Ben yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, these guns fire without warning.\" Kevin laughed at his own joke while his one-man-audience just scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen knew he could beat Kevin, and then he grabbed the bar and pulled it as hard as he could. It went all the way down to Ben's lap, and just when he thought it would pull itself and him back up, Ben's watch started to glow brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Ben was caught off guard as the glow brightened, and finally faded. As the light faded to its orginal dull color, Ben felt a relaxing tingle and released the bar with a <b>THUD!!!</b> as his muscles grew to an enormous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis watch had many unpredictable abilities, but this one really took the BEEFcake. Ben's chest rivaled Kevin's 60 inch wide chest before growing to 90. Ben smiled as his huge chest housed two perfect pecs, divided perfectly in the middle by deep cleavage. Ben's biceps and forearms expanded as well, along with his tree trunk-like thighs, and his calves which looked like they were carrying soccor balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen's new size put a cocky grin on his face, until finally, he felt the tingle in his glutes. In the end he was incredibly muscular, and was now looking down on Kevin from his new 20 foot height. Kevin stared up in shock before grew jealous of Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, what's the matter, Levin?\" Ben asked in that same baby tone as Kevin had used before. \"I think its time to...\"</span></div></div>",

It's a special suit that can change size and appearance to match the user's taste. Some larger aliens use this instead of using limited resources.\" Ben held it up and it changed to his normal clothes. Black t shirt, jeans, his shoes and his green jacket. He put them on and was a perfect fit. So perfect that it looked like it was hugging his body.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Kev!\" Ben said before scooping Kevin up and putting him on his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" A shocked Kevin asked.<br>\r\n\"What do mean? You wanted to come and see me show my body off.\" Ben said with a cocky smile. With Ben 20 feet tall, Kevin was roughly the same size as Ben's whole head. The two, or rather Ben, left Kevin's house and headed into the city. Kevin texted Gwen to get to the city so she could see what the \"big\" problem was.

A Shield Nanite that keeps them from leaving his body or mechanical creations, and a bottomless pit that absorbs <i>any and every nanite</i> into his body by his will. Two within his chest where the suit contacted his skin began to transform, the normal nanite shapes transfiguring as they became pitch black with the dull green tron lines of the omnitrix. Soon other nanites following the process as over two thirds were transformed into Upgrade-infused Nanites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let kick this failures butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly turning himself around, Rex looked down at Alpha Omega as he continued roaring beneath in frustration, ripping apart buildings around him and tossed them, never reaching their height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex began his descent down, the speed of their fall escalating as they readied themselves to crash into Alpha-Omega. The renegade nanite released a crimson red beam to a *VROOOM* as it attempted to disintegrate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex easily dodged to the side, the massive beam narrowly missing them as they continued to gain speed until they *CRASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had collided into the red flames of the fiend.

Nothing will stop me from embracing my destiny to destroy everything father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was triumphant far too soon, as the red suddenly began to shift, turning green as a sickly feeling began to overtake the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urk! What i-is happening!?\" Alpha-Omega willed his arm to restore itself, but nothing happened. He grasped his chest as he felt illness overtake, only his left arm began to contort, hand twisting as it collapsed into itself, shrinking within a few minutes as his arm vanished within his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This cannot be!\" He grasped for the joint where his arm once connected, only for his right to began twisting itself. Soon falling the same cycle as it disappeared. The green flames growing brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My destiny!\" His front left leg and his back right began to dissolve, nanites dissolving as a whirlpool formed where they resided as they spin into the lower half of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of two of his essential limbs caused the monster to once again collapse, crashing into the ruins he made with another *CRASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! Nonononononononono!\" Alpha-Omega yelled out as his body shrank. The gigantic form shrinking as his remaining legs repeated the process of receding into him. Even his flames began to recede as the face that was held within the fire shrank with them. Soon he was just a head surrounded in flames, no bigger than a tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father help me! Father!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called out for Rex's brother, his creator. Cries that fell on deaf ears as even his head vanished within the green flame. The Alpha and Omega Nanites absorbed, the mind of Alpha being deleted by the consciousness of the two within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" His mind finally ended as the flame soon disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the place of the fire was Rex clad innthe suit, and he was looking a bit heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp!

It was only a few days until the SFIT Showcase to show off his invention. \"Tadashi there's a...different invention I want to show you.\" His messy blacked haired brother hesitated for a moment. Clearly up to no good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right knucklehead what exactly is this other invention? I've only seen the one.\" He crossed his arms as he looked at his younger bro with suspicion. \"Which you've spent a long time making a lot of I might add\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro slowly walked backwards in the space between the containers and the left side of the garage till he arrived at the red chair in the far back. \"First promise you won't tell Aunt Cass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not going to make promises I can't keep bonehead.\" Tadashi Hamada smirked as he looked at his worrying little bro. \"Besides with the way you acted I can already tell there's something behind the chair. Hiro giving an embarassed smile was enough to confirm his suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you can tell her about my secret spot for storing things.\" Knowing this battle was lost before it even begun, Hiro grabbed the red chair armrest and pulled it. It took him a minute due to his thin frame and short height. Hiro let out a huff as he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised we've never seen this before with how long that took you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny. Now wait while I get it out.\" Hiro began to tap on the wood wall for a few seconds, finding the spot he need to push. With one tap into it the wood next to it was pushed forward, showing a small makeshit drawer. In it was a secret stash of sugary wrapped treats that Aunt Cass forbade him from having large amounts of, and he'd likely be punished for it later if his invention does not impress Tadashi. Moving his hand into the candy, the Hiro pulled out a small toygun with an unrealistic laser pointer at the tip. Pushing the secret wooden drawer back, Hiro came forward to show his second invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a toy.\" Tadashi wasn't impressed with it visually, but he knew Hiro's inventions were always more than they seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know back when you took me to the nerd lab?\" Tadashi nodded to his brothers question as he put his arms on his sides. \"Well Fred had mentioned his desire for a shrink ray and Wasabi said it was impossible.\" Hiro's eyes pointed downwards as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah because that's not science. Just Fred wanting to be a monster. He brought up shapeshifting into a kaiju too remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro's eyes move upwards as they got wide, the gap in his teeth showing before he looked away. \"Well I may have been testing an idea several months for a... growth ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi looked surprised that his brother would talk about actually stating  pseudoscience as being real. He walked over to his small bro, examing it before shaking his head. \"Hiro it's fiction. You can't grow something as that would fundamentally break the laws of physics to be even probable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I may have found a loophole Tadashi\" Earnestly he began to mess with the toygun smooth flat left side, opening a small hatch on the side with buttons within. Pressing the on button it slowly came to life as it shined a mysterious silver and purple hue along the laser tip. \"I did those illegal bot fights in part to get money for this. Then you took me to the nerd lab and showed me a chance to join SFIT, giving me funds to produce microbots and I <i>might</i> have had enough to get the last part I needed to complete this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro was serious about this, which was worrying him. What if he did succeed, what if a means to competely change mankinds understanding of the universe was in the palm of his trouble making but well meaning knucklehead of a brothers hands? \"Sorry Hiro but if this does what you say it does I best take it from you.\" He began to reach for it as Hiro turned it towards him, causing hesitation. \"Are you really going to test that on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It already works. I tested it on a strawberry in the nearest park. I left it there for the animals to eat.\" Pressing a button that activated the amount of mass increase, Hiro readied it as a smile crossed his face. \"I figured this would be agood way to reward you for always being there for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiro-!\" Tadashi was unable to finish as a the silver and purple changing light from the toy hit him, a grimace crossing his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had arranged a meeting with a dozen tech investors who were interested in his work. He was planning to show them his finished robot. If the meeting went well, he wouldn't have to wait for the <b>San Fransokyo Tech Showcase</b> to get a dream job in a hi-tech lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything must be perfect.\" He repeated to himself as he put on his best suit. It felt a little tight on him, but he chose to ignore that and got himself ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiro, I'm going. Bye!\" Tadashi said loudly enough to be heard from any corner of their home, but his little brother didn't answered. \"He's still sulking after his toy thing. Sometimes he can be so childish!\" He thought as he went through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab van was parked in front of the house, with Baymax and everything he could need already inside.<br>\r\nWhen he got in, he noticed something weird with the car: The mirrors weren't in the right angle and there wasn't much space for his legs either, which were much more bent than he usually had to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like someone shorter had used the car recently and adjusted the seat to his size, but he was the last one who drove it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Aunt Cass didn't took it, she had her own car... Maybe Hiro?\" Tadashi frowned as he readjusted the seat \"If that's true, he'll get the biggest scolding ever when I come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drove for 20 minutes until he arrived his destination. Honey was waiting for him. She wasn't going to participate in the exposition, she was there only to provide moral support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got out of the car, he stood up speechless in front of his friend. He was nervous for this night's meeting, anxious enough not to perceive he had to look down to the tall, heels-lover scientist. He was like 10cm (4\") taller than her on high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to do it right.\" She comforted him smiling. \"We had rehearsed this one hundred times, the speech is great, Baymax is fully operational, you look...\" Honey looked up and down his friend \"...fine?\"<br>\r\n\"What, is there something wrong with my...?\" He inspected his suit and noted how part of his ankles and wrists were exposed \"Shit.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's hardly noticeable\" His friend tried to calm him down.<br>\r\n\"It must have shrunk in the washer. Now the suit feels tight everywhere...\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe you got a little bigger... did you start working out?\" She said pointing to his pecs, now quite noticeable under the constricting cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger...?\" Tadashi thought about Hiro's last invention \"No, that's impossible... My clothes simply shrank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the last preparations Tadashi received the investors and proceeded to start the speech on the stage. He felt so uncomfortable there, with his tighter-than-ever clothing, but he managed to keep it together and do a decent exposition about all the features of his healthcare-providing robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaymax has more than 200 adaptive protocols for each possible emergency. The...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*rip*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that sound?\u201d Tadashi thought, but he didn\u2019t let that stop his discourse. A minute after that, he went to the controls of Baymax\u2019s platform to activate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed much lower than he remembered. He bent his torso to reach a switch, and then he heard that sound again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his back, between his broad shoulders, a tear had been created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe\u2026 The Baymax can also...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*boing* A button of his shirt flied out because of his increased pectorals. The clothing was immobilizing him, any attempt of to move it was caused new tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe college student remained still as he looked again to his audience. They were staring at him, all quiet. \u201cDid they noticed that? Or they\u2019re just paying attention to my exposition?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUGG\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi felt a strong spasm which got him to his knees. All his muscles blew up at once, ripping his expensive suit on dozens of places. He could feel his bones breaking and elongating. The sleeves and his trouser legs couldn\u2019t cover his expanding arms and legs, exposing almost all his muscular forearms and calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi couldn\u2019t get up, his body didn\u2019t respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother spasm, and his muscles expanded again like they were in certain Shonen Manga. His uncovered navel was surrounded by incredibly shaped abs. His painful tight shoes burst, exposing his toes and after another growth spurt half of foot was sticking out... And while all that happened, his soft cock grew in fast spurts, adding 2.5 cm (1\u201d) in length and 1cm (0.4\u201d) in diameter with each spurt, which happened every second, until it doubled its original dimensions\u2026 then, after a break of seconds, it doubled its size again! The pleasure of growing so fast was so overwhelming Tadashi cumned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone call an ambulance!\u201d One guy shouted.<br>\r\n\u201cI-have-already-made-an-emergency-call\u201d A soft, calm voice answered his petition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaymax had been activated a moment before Tadashi\u2019s collapse and had spent a few seconds analyzing his illness. Usually he would ask the patient about that, but his time it was obvious he couldn\u2019t speak and during a potential life-endangering situation there was no time to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRising-blood-pressure, swelling, high-heart-rate... Most-likely-diagnostic: atypical-acute-allergic-reaction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, the robot had grabbed the patient to give him first aid and then move him outside, where the ambulance would eventually pick him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHistamine.\u201d Baymax said as he injected that to his creator. \u201cSmall-dose-of-adrenaline.\u201d Another puncture. \u201cNow-I-will-move-you-outside, where-the-ambulance-will-pick-you-up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently Tadashi had installed some mechanisms to transport patients fast and securely, no matter how heavy they are. That\u2019s why Baymax was able to carry his owner, who at that moment weighted more than 140Kg (308lbs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe investors were left behind. No one knew if what they had seen was real or staged\u2026 either war, they were impressed with Baymax\u2019s flawless actions and when the initial surprise faded they started to applaud Tadashi\u2019s robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaymax\u2026 *ugnh*\u2026 stop. It\u2019s an order from Admin-Tadashi. Pass:14fA\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaymax stopped right there and released Tadashi, who could move again. Honey was there too, she had witnessed everything\u2026 The tall blonde, who was almost as tall as his 193cm (6\u20193\u201d) tall friend Wasabi (with her giant heels, of course), was at Tadashi\u2019s chest level. He was probably over 230cm tall (7\u20196\u201d) now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTadashi\u2026 what\u2026.? What happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHiro hit me with his experimental growth ray.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA growth ray? Isn\u2019t that science fiction\u2026?\u201d Immediately Honey realized that was a silly question after watching him grow like 60cm (2 feet) in seconds. \u201cLook, you have to go to a hospital\u2026 this transformation could have damage your health. They could help you...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt they have a protocol for people hit by magical growth rays. And there\u2019s no time for that. Hiro was hit too. Twice! Whatever medical attention you think I need, he needs two times more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi opened the door of the van and tried to get in there\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t easy. He was so big that not only his head was touching the ceiling, his shoulders almost could touch it too. He had to bend his torso a lot to fit in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I should drive...\u201d Honey suggested while her friend was having a hard time fitting his legs in the vehicle. Even after moving the driver seat all the way back, his long bent legs almost couldn\u2019t fit in there. His knees were higher than the steering wheel. He looked like the typical clown in a comically small car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry, I got this.\u201d He lied. \u201cI need you to do me a favour\u2026 talk to the investors. I can\u2019t face them like this. Tell them some calming lie. And phone the team and tell them to go to the lab. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re the only ones who can fix this mess...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned on the engine and drove as fast as he can. He was scared of what could happen to his little brother. He was also angry with him for testing dangerous inventions with him, but he also felt terribly guilty to shot him with the ray the second time. \u201cI should have believed him. Or at least I shouldn\u2019t have mocked his invention. I\u2019m the big brother, I have to be better than this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was near their house, he started to feel strange again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 Nonono no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis upper body rose even more, his shoulders reached the top of the car. He felt his upper back rubbing the ceiling, creating a dent\u2026 His legs increased their length and girth until they lost any little mobility they had in that cramped space. And his package swelled more, tearing the fabric and releasing a cock which was well near the two foot mark, and it was only semi-hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscle mass increased again, and his loved suit, who already felt like he had got it from Hiro\u2019s wardrobe, couldn\u2019t resisted and ripped completely, becoming rags\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t enough space to move the wheel. At this point a crash looked inevitable\u2026 but he was saved by his growing feet, who had become big enough to press all the pedals at once, stalling the car in the middle of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dizzy giant driver got out of the car. Thankfully, this growth spurt had been weaker than the first one, but still he almost couldn\u2019t stay up\u2026 he didn\u2019t catch his breath and ran.<br>\r\nOnce he arrived home (he had to bend a lot to go through the front door) he shouted Hiro\u2019s name.</span></div></div>",

However his sulking soon ended as he noticed the sleeve of his long shirt was riding up his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly his toothy grin crossed his face as his smile returned. \"I knew it worked! It must have taken longer since humans are different from fruit flies and strawberries. Or maybe it's in relation to size! Big things take longer to grow compared to smaller lifeforms.\" Hiro's mind was wrapped up in possible explanations as his pants and shirt sleeve started to cover less skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better get out of these and put on some of Tadashis clothes. His will last longer.\" Heading for his brothers clothes, Hiro was too enamored with what was happening to hear Tadashi saying goodbye, nor the fact that that his body wasn't growing in general, rather it was growing taller. As if being hit by the growth ray twice was causing him to age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fished through it until he found an old red shirt and pants to wear. Quickly changing clothes, Hiro looked embarassingly small in Tadashis clothes even as his body stretched higher. \"As awesome as it would be to tear through clothes, it'd be annoying dealing with the strain. I mean I'd still be a skinny.\" Hiro thought aloud, not knowing yet the full effects of his world changing device. The boy made sure to go barefoot as henfelt socks and shoes would be an annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, Hiro hiked up Tadashis pants and went downstairs to fix himself some food, his legs, arms, torso, lengthening all the while. Aunt Cass having been called away for the next couple days and leaving Tadashi in charge. Hiro simply snatched some food from the Cafe part of the store to eat, much like Aunt Cass did whenever she stress eats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I recall right the flies tended to be hungry after their growth. So I best keep my body up by eating as much as possible.\" Munching down on multiple donuts and bagels at a table, Hiro's body welcomed the nourishment as it stretched higher. Hiro easily adjusted to his changing position in the seat and Tadashi's clothes, but was oblivious as his face began to age. His cute face becoming more of a prettboy as he started to look Tadashi's age, Tadashi's clothes almost filling out as his aging body stopped this form of growth. He was slightly shorter than Tadashi at 5'9 (172 cm) to Tadashi's 6' (182 cm) but was also now around the same biological age as his beloved big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro, still oblivious to his newfound older look that would make girls swoon, still ate in carefree abandon, happy that Tadashi's clothes now fit. <i>I bet Tadashi is causing a riot at the SFTS</i> Hiro thought in amusement as he took another bite of a bagle, unaware his brother had much bigger trouble thanks to his growth ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up Hiro gave his stomach a loving pat as he moved to get up, his eyes catching sight of himself in a glass window. For 15 seconds the former kid genius looked at himself in surprise before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...me?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And cool! And athletic!\" He rolled up his sleeves, expecting to see a nice biceps, but he only found a skinny arm \"Well, maybe not very athletic, but it's better than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept checking in the mirror, with increasing hedonism. He also realized he wasn't as tall as Tadashi, as his brother's clothes were still a little too big for him, but he stayed positive. \"I'm not short either, so it's ok. The so-called adults won't treat me like a kid when I arrive to the uni, that's more than enough for me.\" He took another look to his reflection and smiled \"Maybe I'm not the most impartial guy to judge it... but I think I ended up with the best nose of us two, Tadashi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enlarged boy's steps could be heard in any part of his house as he raced again to his lab, sat on his swivel chair so fast he spun two times before halting in front of the monitor of his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha.\" He said after executing a new simulation of the effects of the ray on humans. \"It looks like the G-rays have an unexpected side effect on young subjects like me... they interact with their immature cells and make them mature... the effect seems to stop then...\" He sighed with relief \"Good, I wouldn't like to keep aging until I become an old man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange shivering ran across his spine, followed for an as bizarre flushing sensation. It broke his coolness and made him ran to the mirror again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff, I didn't became an elder... I didn't change. That thing I thought I felt must be my imagina-- wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes didn't fit so well anymore. The previous baggy ones were now a little too short and a little too tight... He moved his sleeve again and this time he saw a decent biceps and triceps there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited about the discover, he went to another point of the house where Hiro and his brother marked their heights on the wall (a tradition Tadashi stopped after he turned 18, he didn't grow much afterwards, but Hiro kept doing it). He made a new mark and got amazed when he saw it was noticeable higher than the last from Tadashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"188cm tall (6'2\"). So AWESOME! Forget what I said, it's great to be the <i>big </i>brother for once. That must be the final effects of the growth energy before disappearing of my body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro didn't know there were still a lot of energy stored in his body, getting ready to manifest their effect.</span></div></div>",

Once he recovers, he realized his clothes (well, Tadashi's clothes) were again too small for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen ran again to the wall with height marks and made another higher than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh... 200cm even! (6'7\") I'm like a basketball player! I can't wait Tadashi to see me... he must be a whole head shorter or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off the undersized clothing and took another look to his reflection in the big mirror of the bedroom. He was now too tall for his reflection to fit in there, his head was cut off, but his new body was the thing he wanted to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was buff, much more muscular than the last time, with Tadashi's shorts he looked like a underwear top model, one with a extremely big package. Then he took off his underwear and delighted with his huge snake, hanging from his crotch. He shook it to get it hard and then measure it with a rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"24cm hard... (9.5\") This really is a ladykiller. As I scientist, I should test the results of my experiment right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but first things first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had ordered 2 extra large pizzas, Hiro went back to his bedroom, sat on the bed and start jerking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goshhhh... it feels SO good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy let his upperbody fall relaxed over some pillows as he continued strocking his dick even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning with pleasure, his toes flexing rhythmically... but then he began to have problems to surround his fat cock with his hand, his head started to inch upwards, his feet seemed to be moving farther, the knees of his half flexed legs rose higher, his muscles thicker... his body was growing again, but he didn't notice, his mind was miles away focused in his swollen rod, now 30cm long (1'), too large for a single hand so it had to be stroked with both...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when the doorbell sounded, his cock shot a great stream of jizz which reached the other wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I thought I would have more time...\" Hiro rushed to put his underpants again, but after the growth spurt they started to seem more like a slip. The pants and tshirt he had lent from Tadashi didn't fit anymore, they were like children's clothes, the continuous ring of the doorbell made him lose patience, stop looking for clothes and go meet the deliveryman wearing just a pair of shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza guy didn't expect to be welcomed for someone so much taller than the door he couldn't see his face, and broad enough to have problems to cross it... his own head didn't reach Hiro's incredible developed pecs. If he looked a little below, he could see on his short shorts a giant snake-like bulge, bigger soft than the hardons of the biggest porn actors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's 25$...\" he stutter, clearly intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy ran away as soon as he was paid. Hiro didn't understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird... I didn't know Pizza Dom has delivery guys so short...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't notice yet his last growth, and the smell of the hot pizzas made him forget the little guy and focus on calming his hunger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gobbled up an amount of pizza for 6 persons, he didn't felt satisfied until the last piece entered in his mouth. With a smile in his face he patted his muscular stomach (a little bloated due to all the food he had eaten).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that's feel good... now I finally full, I should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro couldn't finish the phrase, he collapsed on the ground and have something similar to an epileptic attack. His body didn't respond him anymore, it just moved in continuous spasms, as he felt how all his muscles swollen at once, making bodybuilders look scrawny by his side. This continuous muscular growth reached a point he couldn't breath anymore... but then the excessive pressure of his colossal muscles caused all his bones to break apart painfully and make use of the cracks to elongate, so his muscles would have more room to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was agonishly, it only lasted two minutes but it seemed an eternity for him.<br>\r\nOnce it ended, Hiro got up very slowly, trembling and weak like he was ill, covered with cold sweat... His head bumped against the ceiling of the kitchen. Logically, the doorframe was even lower, but he could pass through walking on his knees. The hall ceiling was higher, so he could stand up and walk normally to the corner with the height marks one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mark he had made 20 minutes ago seemed so low now he had hit the 240cm barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't fun anymore. I'm becoming a freak.\" Hiro's concerns were growing like his body. \"And I can't guarantee my body can stand any more growth. I need to stop this, I need... the growth ray! Maybe another hit with the opposite polarity would stop the growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he ran to his personal laboratory located in the garage, and as he ran his now 22cm soft cock moved freely like a pendulum (his underpants had disintegrated after the last growth spurt). He searched for all the room, but couldn't find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, where is it? Did Tadashi take it? Well, I still have all my tools, maybe I could build another ray with my 3D printer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on his chair: it whined under his weight, his butt barely fit on it, his legs were so ridiculous long they didn't fit under the computer table either and he had to bend his back a lot to face the monitor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to type printing orders in the keyboard, but suddenly the growth came back like a sweet revenge, starting with his fingers, which became too big to type without accidentally hitting several keys. Seconds later it spread to the rest of his body and Hiro leant back the seat, unable to move as his body expanded in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair couldn't bear it anymore and broke, throwing Hiro to the floor. His penis started to get hard again, and even after reaching his max size at 45cm (1'6\") his body kept pumping blood into it, making it grow further centimeter by centimeter, no matter how painfully this transformation was for his owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro couldn't move his muscles, they had become too big to be functional, until his bones elongated again, distributing the excess of muscle mass over a new whole foot of height, restoring his mobility once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I have to get out and get help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a great effort to get up. His hair was brushing in the garage ceiling (which it was quite taller than the kitchen's) but seconds later another wave of pain hit him, and his head started to rise up again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran to the door, but even after kneeling he couldn't pass, he wasn't just much taller, he had gotten wider than the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get on all fours and twist his upperbody to be able to go through. He felt a little growth spurt hitting him while he was passing, which thickened his muscles enough to make his press both sides of the doorframe... but he finally got through. Another growth spurt, a big one, hit him again in the hall... and everything went back for the muscular colossus.</span></div></div>",

First he was blinded by the white light, but eventually his eyes got used to it and could see a familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tadashi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped over his big brother, who was wearing some kind of white towel, to hug him, and then noticed something curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taller than you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Tadashi's head was at the same level than Hiro's chest. Something that made Hiro smile, but Tadashi was still dead serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we had bigger problems now. One really big\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro couldn't deny that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney, Gogo, Wasabi and Fred entered in the room. They seemed so small for Hiro, like half of his size, but the boy didn't have time to ask about their size. Honey headed to the pair of brothers, talking to them as he was reading some documents she brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tadashi, I have the results of your last bioscan. It still shows elevated levels of... AAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney had stopped reading the report and look at them... and when she saw Hiro she blushed and hid his face under the papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you act like that...?\" Hiro self-answered his question when he looked down and saw he had been wearing the same towel than his brother, but when he got up the towel had untied and fallen to the floor in front of his brother's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGogo was the only one who didn't seem disturbed, she was kept looking at Hiro's birdie stoically as she chewed a gum. It was hard to see due her bubblegum, but she was smiling slightly. Hiro hurried up and put the towel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh... sorry...\" Said the embarrased boy. \"What are you doing here, guys?<br>\r\n\"I called them.\" Tadashi explained frowning \"They're the only ones who can fix your mess.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey! I don't think this is a 'mess'. My growing ray is a respectable invention, and as I can see, my experiment is a great success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi rubbed his eyes. After that crazy day he didn't have enough energy to deal with his imprudent brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiro... when I found you you had passed out... If you had absorbed more 'G-rays', your heart might not be able to endure the tension... you could have died. As far as we know, our lives are still in danger... thanks to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, none of this would have happened if you hadn't mocked about my invention!\"<br>\r\n\"Is that your answer? Seriously? Because I doubted about it, I deserved to be hit by an non-tested, possibly dangerous ray??\" Tadashi's voice began gaining volume, and at his current size it was strong enough to hurt everyone else's ears.<br>\r\n\"It wasn't untested, I used it on... strawberries... before.\" A poor excuse. <br>\r\n\"Hiro, of all the mistakes you have ever made, this is the worst! Look at us, and tell me how I'm going to go to class tomorrow... or what I'm going to wear... or what we're going to say to aunt Cass when she sees us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can fix it. I need the growth ray. Theoretically, a inverted ray could undo the changes... and everyone will go back to normal\"<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that? Did you try that idea?\"<br>\r\n\"...no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi didn't want to continue talking with his brother. He sat on a huge metal box and looked to the ground (There weren't many things in the lab or outside that could withstand his increased weight). His little brother said nothing else either, he didn't like Tadashi's tone but he couldn't deny he was right, he had messed everything up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else felt the tension between them and didn't know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ahem!*\" Honey finally got enough courage to say something. \"Tadashi, I have the last results.\" She brought him the documents, but the uni student wasn't much interested on them, so he left them on his lap. \"I think you're bodies are recovering well from your... growth spurts. No deformities, no anomalies in the blood analyses...\"<br>\r\n\"But of course there are always bad news...\"<br>\r\n\"...eh... we detected an accumulation of strange energies in your bodies... we think it's the same energy of Hiro's ray.\"<br>\r\n\"So we could grow even more anytime... Wonderful.\" Tadashi's face couldn't look more grim than then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, Wasabi...\" The younger brother got closer to the afroamerican scientific, once the tallest of the group now he barely reached his upper abs. \"How big did we got?<br>\r\n\"After two growth spurts, Tadashi dwarfed NBA players at 245cm tall (8'). And you broke every record and became the tallest man ever at 291cm tall (9'6\").\"<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n\"If you still need a test subject for your experiment, I'm here, pal.\" Fred commented, the growth ray was his idea after all.</span></div></div>",

I'm going back to finish my own invention.\" Gogo spoke as she blew a bubble with her gum, leaving the lab the Shimada's are staying at as they shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to go too. I don't want to be here if...<i>ahem</i> you two get a little too big in here.\" Wasabi looking at their covered bulges making it clear he was more afraid of death by bulge than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll run some more tests on your blood while taking Fred out to eat.\" Honey spoke as she shuffled through her purse, which instantly cheered up Fred at the chance of a free meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing too. i'm starving!\" Freds mind got away from the growth as he contemplated what to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you set it up so they'll send food here from the cafetaria too Honeylemon? I don't know how me and the big knucklehead here would act to a need for food.\" Tadashi had asked, but it was clear from patting his hardened eight pack that he was starting to feel famished. Hiro himself didn't feel hungry, but he knew Tadashi was right to get food as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do!\" She cheerfully waved as her and Fred leave, both brothers waving as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their friends now gone Tadashi turned back towards Hiro, a look of impressiveness as he looked him over. \"You know you look older Hiro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarassed at his full changes only now being noticed Hiro pipdd up \"Yeah. I was saddened at first when the G-Rays only made me taller and older at first. Then it made me big in every way.\" Hiro impressively flexed a massive bicep, not wanting to admit of his own fears of how big he's become as he spoke in a joyful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing his arms, Tadashi wasn't impressed. \"Yeah and all it takes is nearly dying to achieve it. Thankfully though we have Baymax\" He pointed behind him where the soft marshmallow white outside Baymax was on turned off and kept in his case \"For when it happens again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much Tadashi just enjoy our new sizes\" Hiro stopped trying to make Tadashi try to see the silver lining, as soon he could only grunt from feeling an intense pain come over him again. Instantly followed by his sitting older brother as Hiro fell to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntense pain began to fill every bone of their bodies as their muscles began to bulge out , engulfing them in muscle that engulfed their very heads. <i>\"This is even worse than before\"</i> Tadashi was thinking as he fell backwards. His massive muscles preventing him from harm. Their towels helpless falling off as their muscles and rods pushed it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummf!\" Hiro could barely groan out that noise of pain over the muscles covering his face. Both of their mighty serpents grew even bigger, desperate for room between the muscles. Soon their body began to elongate to allow for mobility, the two brothers growing higher and higher as every inch made the muscles bulge out, only for more height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro's 2 (60 cm) rod soon reach 2'6 (75 cm) while Tadashi's own smaller snake at '15 (38 cm) grew to 2'2 (66 cm).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir heights had gotten a masssive boost as Hiro rose to 14'6 (441 cm). A five foot increase in height as his muscles stopped ridiculously expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis big brother was no different. Five feet boosted Tadashi's 8' (243: cm) a way to 13 (396 cm). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their radical growth spurts came to an end, both brothers felt relief as the pain ebbed away. \"Huff...huff...hufff...huff..\" Both of them able to find joy in it ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to get worse isn't it?\" Tadashi asked as he used his arms to sit up, rising up to his feet close to the twenty foot season. Hiro slowly rose up off his knees as as he stood higher still than his big brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope. But uh I feel ashamed about this.\" Hiro blushed with his prettyboy face as Tadashi realize Hiro was actually turned on by it. His wood rising stiff to his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's why you don't have as big of a problem as I do with this.\" He tried to cross his arms, but they were visibly thicker and made it harder. It would be impossible to be a scientist with this much mass even if he was normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep *GROWL* emanated from the two behemoths as well. Making two things the older Hiro needed to satisfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope lunch arrives soon.\" Hiro gave a toothy grin.</span></div></div>",

His brother stopped him.<br>\r\n\"Wait, he can't see us like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi made him look down, and the genious kid remembered he was naked: The huge towels they had wrapped around their waist now weren't big enough to cover his bigger bodies... but the towels didn't fell to the floor after the growth spurt, they ended up hanging from their giants hardons like they were coat stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiight...Mister, could you please leave the food in front of the door?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh?

Yes, just a little dizzy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro divided the food in three parts and gave him two.

He tried to phone his friends to ask them to bring them more meals, but his huge fingers were now too big for the phone keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it wouldn't be enough...\" Hiro recalled, although he was happy his brother's face wasn't pale anymore \"I think there is a vending machine in the east wing corridor...\"<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?

Turning towards his giant younger brother Tadashi prepared his hand as he went for Hiro's hand and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to activate him Tadashi?\" Hiro didn't really feel it. His muscles and skin altered to be much more durable and tougher than he had been as a normal boy. Not even a red mark from him holding for a decent five minutes.

To think there's be such a difference in strength and durability between us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to test that theory, Hiro grabbed Tadashi's own hand with his massive paw and squeezed with as much force as possible. It had yet to make a noticeable difference \"Does it hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Hmmm... seems both our bodies are built for superhuman durability despite our difference in stature.\" Looking at Baymax a new idea came to Tadashi. \"I know of another idea\". With that Tadashi prepared his throat as he let out a deep \"AAAAHHHH!\" The yell vibrated across the lab as his deep voice would cause pain for a normal person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound did as intended as the red case around Baymax moved back as he inflated to full stature in his marshmallowly robot appearance. The black eyes blinked as he waved and spoke \"Hello. I am Baymax. Your personal healthcare companion. I was alerted to your presence when I heard ''Aaaah!''.\" He scanned both their bodies. \"You both are in exceptional health, despite abnormal alterations to your physiology. However, I detect signs of intense hunger and a need for nutrients, as well as a form of radiation permeating in every cell of your body. I have zero known means to help with the unknown radiation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Baymax we are trying to deal with that ourselves. Right now we need your help with getting food to sate our bodies need for nutrients.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood. How may I be of service?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi walked over to a table, trying to look through for any cards for currency or money. He got on his knees and had to sturrgle to move his mighty rod out of the way, pushing the towel that covered it down. It took longer than he wanted before going through most of the drawers. \"Dang there's nothing here that can be used for spending.\" The last one on the other hand contained a laser tool for creating holes. \"This will work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tadashi won't you get in trouble for that?\" Hiro asled as he saw Tadashi hand over the device to Baymax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other students have done it to vending machines before. As long as you have an invention to make up for it or a legitimate reason they'll let it pass.\" He informed his larger younger brother before turning to Baymax. \"Use this to open a hole in the east wing Vending Machines glass around room E4. Get all the high protein snacks and drinks from it. Then bring it back to us. We are currently in the West Wing in room W23.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood. i will return with nutrients to help.\"  Baymax then waddled out of the lab and headed for his destination in the east to help his creator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully it goes well.\" Tadashi sighed. He was tired of this, and the worse part was that he really wanted to beat off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Baymax. I have no doubt he'll do it right since he's your invention.\" Hiro tried to cheer his brother up. Having the same desire as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully. After we eat I'm informing the gang we'll need to be moved out of the city. That last growth spurt was too big and too fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having people look up as my feet take up the entire street is kinda fun idea I've had Tadashi! I'd do without the intense growth spurts though.\" Tadashi stood on his toes to reach and ruffle his brothers hair in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thry'd be calling you a Kaiju and sending the military after you bonehead.\"</span></div></div>",

Tadashi will be surprised when he sees the new me.\" Moving to remove the borrowed clothes, Hiro pulled off the shrinking red shirt and caught a glimpse of his physique thickening even more, his pecs pushing forward into a perfect shelf and his deltoids enlarging. \"It's good to know the G-Rays do enhance my muscles to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro collapsed on all fours with a flash, feeling the pants that were still on tightening and *RIIIPP* tearing to thickening calves. His bones started to crack as they elongated and grew with the rest of him. The former boys face flushed red as he felt his body spasm. \"I-it hurts so much! Yet it feels so goood!\" Unlike his brother, perhaps because it received nutrients to help with the process or the freedom most of his body has, Hiro's growth was not as painful. He even liked it, as it informed him that with his new age he'd no longer be a little kid anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was a surprise was the tightness especially in the front of his pants. He never thought of measuring his penis before, even with his growth spurt. Now, however, Hiro got to experience the joy of a large dong threatening to tear his pants as it quickly reached 13 in. (33 cm). \"G-good thing I d-didn't put on any of his underwear\" Hiro chuckled as he tried to move his thickening arm for the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll g-get this off and it'll m-make it easier!\" Hiro thought aloud as he reached for the pants with his left arm, and with as much force as possible, tore it off. His 22 in (55 cm) bicep flexed as he ripped the pants apart, allowing his body to be completely nude. Thankfully being the only one in his home meant others couldn't see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the growth subsided, Hiro began to rise to his feet, his head rising near the ceiling. \"What a rush! I can't wait to teach the world what my Growth Ray can do.\" Looking at the wall, Hiro saw just how far below his former height 6'2 (188cm) was. \"Tadashi told me the ceiling in this part of the house was eight feet\" Looking up for a second to see his head was a few inches away \"I must be around 7'3-6 (220-228 cm). So far no sign of health problems just like there were none with my test subjects either. Tadashi will definitely have to apologize for not understanding how great it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on that, Hiro remembered he shot his brother too to give him a reward, but Tadashi refused to believe. \"Well I don't think he'll be as big at least. But I can show him the ropes as the 'big brother'.\" Hiro chuckled at the thought of towering over Tadashi and making jokes like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange feeling of growth began to return again, and Hiro was filled with jubilation as he felt his body continue to expand, thickening, widening, stretching higher. Thinking fast Hiro bent down before his head hit the ceiling.  \"Best not destroy the place or Aunt Cass will talk my ears off\" He thought of the biggest room in the Cafe and immediately went to the Cafe. On all fours Hiro began to crawl towards it as his body became too wide for the doorways and he had to get up and move as gently as possible through it, though chunks of it still broke off where a massive hand or shoulder with superhuman strong deltoids bushed against them. Growing beyond 8'9 (267 cm)  as he grew into 9 feet (274 cm) and greater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard deep, powerful voice of someone he knew all too well in the Cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIRO you knucklehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Hiro stopped. \"It can't be him. He shouldn't have a voice that deep unless...the first shot of the ray made me older! I see... it only grows people once they've reached the adequate age range for it. So we should both be around the same size relative to when the growh kicked in for us both.\" Hiro whispered in as quiet a voice as a 9'5 (289 cm) giant could as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he can't hide this from Tadashi, Hiro did the wise thing and heading for the Cafe that he planned from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat greeted the massive 9'9  (297 cm) Hiro was a slightly more massive 10 foot (304 cm)  Tadashi. The older brothers was a look of worry and anger was quickly replaced with shock as he saw the prettboy that was the same age as him and resembled his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you Hiro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing a thick arm to the back of his head (and bumping into a ceiling fan by accident) Hiro let out a small laugh \"Had a bit of a growth spurt while you were gone. Guess I'm still the little bro\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He just walked past him at normal height before eating.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think something\u2019s still bothering you.\u201d Hiro said as he put away the dishes.<br>\r\n\u201cHow tall are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow tall are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs tall as you. If not taller.\u201d Tadashi stood in disbelief. How is this possible?<br>\r\n\u201cHiro?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you actually create that gun?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d ask that!\u201d He said with a grin. \u201cThe stuff that happened yesterday, technically did happen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the gun? Shooting you was just so you could be aware of the changes that would take place.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cChanges?\u201d Tadash asked as he slowly raised his head. Hiro grew taller before his eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that \u201c\u201dstrawberry\u201d\u201d I \u201c\u201dtested\u201d\u201d was me. I created a formula that allowed to change not only my physical appearance, and anyone. As long as they are a guy. It won\u2019t work on girls for some reason. The gun I made had a bit of the formula to cause anyone it hit to become aware of the changes. I\u2019m not sure if it changes reality along with people\u2019s memories yet.\u201d Tadashi stood there in disbelief. How was this possible. \u201cTadashi?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you accomplish this?\u201d Tadashi shouted.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. I was just trying to make a growth formula like Fred was going on about.\u201d He said as he shrank back to normal. \u201cFor now, we are the only ones who are aware of this.\u201d Hiro then went back to their rooms. Tadashi thought this was insane as he followed Hiro.<br>\r\n\u201cHiro, this is an elaborate prank. Right?\u201d Tadashi\u2019s clothes felt tight as he now had muscles trying to escape.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Hiro said with a smirk as Tadashi went back to normal. \u201cI told you what I can do now. Just accept it.\u201d He said as he grew a head taller than Tadashi. He looked like he grew his muscles too. \u201cNow come on, you said we were going to meet the gang at the lab, right?\u201d The two then left.</span></div></div>",

He walked behind Hiro on the way to the University. Stareing up at Hiro\u2019s back strangely made him happy. He was still his younger brother. His brief moment of relief turned into more confusion as Hiro began growing. His frame grew as his jacket\u2019s sleavs became tighter around Hiro\u2019s muscular arms. The same with his legs. Judging from his silhouette, Tadashi felt that Hiro\u2019s frame was similar to Wasabi\u2019s. But larger. Hiro began to gain height. If Tadashi came to Hiro\u2019s chin before, be now barely came to abs. Hiro speed had increased, causing Tadashi to start running. Losing breath, he fell. Hiro had caught him, and placed him on his shoulders.<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying the view bro?\u201d He was indeed enjoying it. Tadashi couldn\u2019t explain his feeling.

Wha-?\" He stammered out, somewhat confused as the light died down, but nothing significant happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro pouted as he lowered his gun down, \"Wha- what happened? I wanted to help... It works... I know it does...\" He really wanted to show off for his brother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. Hiro really could get ahead of himself at times. \"It's alright Hiro, but go ahead and give me the gu- huh?!\" His sentence was interrupted as a soreness gripped his entire body. He bent down as the discomfort forced his to grab the nearest table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's... going... on...\" He grunted, feeling the soreness intensify. Hiro watched as Tadashi's already lithe body started to pulse. His eyes widened in pure admiration as his clothes slowly started to fill out even more, despite their tightness on him already. Slowly, his shirt rode slightly up, revealing just the bottom of an incredibly defined set of abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi looked down in shock as his pecs pushed out, slightly diminishing his lower peripheral view. He bit his lip, cutting off a moan as his grip tightened, leaving a firm imprint of it in the metal table. The top two buttons of his cardigan popped off as well, indicating how much he'd gotten thicker. He was actually speechless. Hiro actually figured this stuff out... But... Tadashi's brow furrowed as Hiro looked sheepish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiro...\" Tadashi took that tone he used when he caught Hiro at his robot games. \"Give me the gun...\" Tadashi ordered. This was not going to work out well if he had to explain this to everyone else. Hiro held it away, clutching like it was his precious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's mine...\" He almost whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiro, now.\" Tadashi took a stricter tone, as he marched over, while Hiro stepped back, and tripped back onto a chair, while Tadashi grabbed the gun. \"Hiro, give me the gun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Hiro pulled back, at a disadvantage because of the rolling chair's wheels, but he noticed something that made him blush, but also might give him an advantage. \"Do you mind getting your gun out of my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Tadashi looked down, and realized what Hiro was talking about. All the exertion and the experience was starting to give him a hard-on, and his pants were already tight, which meant he had one hell of a tent, and it was only getting bigger. Blushing brighter than a tomato, he quickly covered himself, letting go of the gun, blushing furiously at Hiro's smug look. \"Wel'' talk later.\" He muttered shortly, as he quickly ran to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Tadashi's Room====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi quickly plopped down on his chair, ripping his tight shirt off, well, not literally because it was his favorite, but he needed to deal with this. Unbuttoning took him a bit, because it was so tight... The ray must have given him some enhancements there too... He was wide-eyed as he pulled his pants down, and he flopped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was around 6\" initially, but what he held was bigger than that... He held his forearm close to it, and he was speechless as he realized it was bigger than his forearm! Grabbing his ruler, he was bigger than that too, but not by much... he figured he was arounnd 13\" now... and his girth was just as thick as his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping it, he leaned back as his sensitivity had moved up as well. His face flushed, his hand began to move up and down, taking the pre leaking out, rubbing over to lube it up. With his other hand he rubbed his head, having more than enough room for both big hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tight feeling started developing in his lower abdomen, indicating he was close as he stroked faster and faster, enjoying the length he could stroke now. With one final tease, it all tightened up, as he leaned back, \"Ah!\" He gasped, as he hit release, each spurt sending him ecstatic, in his revelry, it felt like his grip was forced open, feeling like his girth and length increased slightly as well. Five in all, he panted heavily, sweat rolling down his brow as he tried to gain his bearings until a beeping caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning over, he was somewhat embarassed as the red container opened nearby, and a familiar hiss of air inflated the white robot within, as in stepped out of the containter, and waddled towards him. \"Hello, I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion, I was alerted to the need for medical attention by your cry of 'Ah!' On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your pain?\" Baymax asked as the screen flashed to life on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi sighed. He's probably gonna have to reprogram Baymax not to activate when someone orgasms... to be fair, he hadn't counted on this situation, nearly naked on his chair, hefty dick hanging out in front of it... but he's gonna have to talk to Hiro... why did it feel like he grew suddenly?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shiro was in a lab room with Pidge, the young tech expert was observing his Galra built arm as he moved it back and forth. \"Do you see anything wrong?\" His arm had been acting funny the last couple weeks. Sometimes the arm would stop functioning completely. Shiro had ignored it, viewing it as nothing important until the day before. During supper his arm stopped functioning while he was holding a plate of food with that hand, causing it to fall to the ground as it fell lifelessly next to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't see anything physically wrong with it Shiro.\" The green lion pilot responded earnestly as she brought her hands across its metallic surface. \"I'd have to take it apart to find out what's wrong, but as I am not an expert in those Galran druids tech I honestly can't say I'd be able to fix it properly\". Pidge had only reprogrammed the Galra robot Rover, and even the Altean tech her and Hunk had yet to figure out properly. Though Hunk was currently busy distracting Keith, who would no doubt panic if he knew something was wrong with Shiro. \"Plus that is connected to your brain, we could end up damaging the control you have\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you still try something so that I don't have to worry about this arm failing me at the worst moment?\" Shiro's worst fear was his arm malfunctioning during a battle, putting everyone's lives at risk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try, but if we notice anything wrong we'l take you to Allura.\" Pulling out some tools, she began to tinker with the forearm plating to open it. Looking around, she observed a smaller area to open. She could tell that most parts were operating as normal, but this small space was clearly shut off. \"This might be the problem.\" She spent several minutes carefully opening it to keep whatever was inside from being damaged. Once she had popped off the lid, the Green Lion pilot noticed the part was not broken like she believed, but was turned off instead. <i>This looks like it may have never been activated in the first place.</i> She began to work, causing a small light at the center of it to glow the usual Galra purple as it began working with the whole. Believing this was enough for now, she closed both the small hatch and the forearm plating to seal them tight. \"There!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his arm and the mechanical fingers, Shiro felt it was working as it had for ages. \"Thanks Pidge. What was wrong with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. I just turned on a part that wasn't activating with the rest. It could be the guys who made your arm had more planned for it.\" Shiro could believe that, since it was Ulaz who freed him before they had finished their plans for Shiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black with white stripe haired man smiled in gratitude \"Well it seems to have eased up the problems it was having. So thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure to stop by each day so I can be sure I haven't doomed you. Now excuse me I need to help Lance with something he wants\" She began putting away the tools, hoping she might not need to experiment with vital technology she had no experience x_n again, but that is wishful thinking on her part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to stop by. For now I'm going to go see what Keith and Hunk are up to. Promised I'd train with Keith.\" With that the two Paladins left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to both the small compotent had been an AI, its purpose meant to operate a number of other processes to make the champion into a weapon of Galra. Though its orders to control Shiro was not programmed into it, it still retained the operative goal built into its core programming: make its user stronger and more powerful. Slowly it began to produce droplets of a purple glowing substance similar to Quintessence from the small light, slowly mixing into the rest of the arm and eventually the organic body of Shiro. Transforming and rebuilding him into a sentient weapon.</span></div></div>",

Keith always went all out against his opponents, even in mere trainings, even against his best friend and fatherly figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Shiro usually matched his skill, so he never felt he should contain himself... that's why Keith were surprised when Shiro got one of his hits and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth is a sudden pain coming from his arm had distracted him and made him an easy target. The sensation didn't stop once he was on the floor, although it changed, expanding for all his body as it became less painful and more pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bones creaked, his muscles bloated slowly in warm, like an inflammation, until the shape of his big pecs, biceps and other muscles were printed on his black elastic uniform. He moaned louder than he would want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation was gone, so as the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes... my arm is giving me trouble.\" He rose slowly and faced his protegee. He had to look down lower than usual, his chin was at the same leven than the top of his head, but it wasn't such a big difference to be noticed. His muscle gains were more significant, but if Keith noticed them he chose not to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept fighting, first Keith tried to go somewhat easy on him, worried about his health... but when he discovered the astronaut kept blocking all his shots with increased speed and landing his own, his garah instincts kicked in and once again started to fight like a berseker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mnng!\" Shiro grunted, not because of the only punch his friend could land but for the feeling another growth spurt, rising a few centimeters and gaining almost a Kg of muscle. His shirt was getting so tight it was beggining to limite his movements, but the extra strenght and speed compensate that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis advantage grew slowly with his body, as Keith grew fustrated. Eventually, the boy ended up inmovilized on the floor by the leader of the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over.\"<br>\r\n\"No, it isn't!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith refused to accept his defeat and tried to release himself from his grip, but after a minute of being unable to lift Shiro's heavy body, he changed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. You won. Whatever.\" He surrendered, clearly pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then Shiro released him. He extended his hand to help him to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen you move like that.\" Keith admited he never had a chance.<br>\r\n\"I guess I had luck.\" Shiro answered, slightly worry about what was going on with his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Clap* *Clap* *Clap* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn applause interrupted their conversation. Lance was at the door, watching their match and had enjoyed much seeing his rival getting his ass kicked by Shiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were amazing, Shiro!\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, thanks, Lance.\" The black paladin felt uncomfortable with his praises.<br>\r\n\"I mean it, you went all *ZAS!* *BUM!* and knocked him down in record time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith furrowing his brow, looked away, waiting for Lance to go away so he could spend more time with Shiro alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect otherwise, because you're our leader, and also you're getting so buff lately. Just look at those pecs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had got so big the elastic cloth had stretched enough to become slightly transparent. They could see the shape of his nipples pressing against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance put his hand over his pectoral and got amazed when he found out they were thick enough to sink his fingers in the meat several centimeters/inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, they're crazy thick! You're crazy thick!\"<br>\r\n\"Lance! What are you doing!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith went mad. He couldn't believe Lance dared to take the liberties of touching Shiro... although, deep inside, he agreed with him about how amazingly muscular he had got and also felt slightly tempted to touch his pecs himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the contrary Shiro didn't get angry, although he wasn't comfortable either with his touchings. Blushing a little, he moved away to stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I got some gains from my daily training.\"<br>\r\n\"Damn, then maybe I should skip less often the training sessions.\" He said as he examined Shiro biceps, also greatly bulkier.<br>\r\n\"Lance!\"<br>\r\n\"Ehh... why did you come here, Lance?\" Shiro tried to change the topic.<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"</span></div></div>",

With no time to waste, they hasted to their lions and started to blew up enemies.<br>\r\nBut something was happening in the black lion, who moved slower than usual, reacting slowly to enemy fire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fine, Shiro??\" Keith asked by radio, worried after seen him getting hit with a laser before Hunk could destroy the attacker.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I fine.\" He lied, covered in sweat. The truth is his arm was still causing him pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Drip*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother drop of Malessence was released on his bloodstream, and that was a drop too many for his body to bear. The concentration was excessive and his organs started to break down as he grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed in pain, as all his muscles expanded at once, as his elastic shirt finally began to rip here and there.<br>\r\n\"Shiro, what happens?\"<br>\r\n\"NNNGG!\" He grunted, as his bones cracked and elongated faster than his body could withstand, gaining 20cm (8\") in height in seconds.\"...'m fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get his senses back to the game, but every time he tried another wave of growth almost knocked him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason he hasn't passed out yet was the acute constant pain on his crotch didn't let him, as his enlarging balls and cock were crunched under the resistant cloth of his underwear, unfortunately too strong to be rip like the rest of his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Shiro is hurt, we need to bring back to the castle... AHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn imperial warship appeared and started to use a battery of weapons over them. They were outgunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Form... ugnn!\" Shiro shoulders widened 10cm by surprise in most painful way possible. \"...Voltron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team obeyed. The 5 robotic lions aligned and united as the giant robot known as Voltron that destroyed his target in two blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd something else happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach pilot is connected to his lion. The link is mostly telepathic, but it goes beyond that.<br>\r\nTrying to protect his user, Voltron's systems extracted the excesive drops of malessence from Shiro... but that artificial power was infective and hard to contain, so it got free... and because each lion is connected with the others as Voltron, it ended up in the bodies of the other pilots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Due the magic of Voltron, the malessence might take more time to affect their new hosts... or maybe not)</span></div></div>",

I saw him in the training room and noticed he looked buffer than usual but, man, this is crazy!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, we know, Lance.\"<br>\r\n\"He's like a 7 footer now! Or more!\"<br>\r\n\"YES, LANCE, WE REALIZED NOW SHUT THE QUIZN UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four paladins knew firsthand how heavy and big he had gotten: they were carrying the unconscious body of his leader, too big to be moved by one person, to the sick bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paladins! What happened to Shiro??\" Allura freaked out when she saw him in such condition.<br>\r\n\"We don't know! During the battle he sounded like he was in pain, lapsed into unconsciousness... and once we were back, we found him like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey put him in a cryo pod (with difficulty, his wider shoulders didn't fit through its door so Allura had to activate a bigger one).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEternal minutes of checks ended up in the most unsatisfactory way:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no idea what happened to him.\" Allura said, and Pidge continued. \"It is undeniable something had made him grow, but whatever it was, either it isn't on his system anymore or it's undetectable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth options were true. All the released Malessence had being transfered to the others, but the unreleased remained hidden on his prosthesis which altean sensons couldn't see through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although his body shows signs of having being under a great damaging strain, he seems stabilized now... actually, he's recovering faster than I would expect. In one or two days he should be awake and fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Unless whatever affected him attacks him again... *uh*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie (Pidge's real name) felt dizzy for a moment and stumbled a little with a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Pidge?\" The princess said, worried.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I'm just a little tired. I have to do more tests on Shiro...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll do them. Go rest for a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidge was too tired to argue, so she went to his room and as soon as she laid on her bed she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, she waked up strangely energized. Her tongue felt furry, so she went to the bathroom to brush her teeth.<br>\r\nShe felt sleepy, so her mind took a few seconds to react to the image she saw in front of her: Her brother's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her brain finally reacted, she pitted the dentifrice all over \"his face\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't Matthew, it was her reflection on a mirror.For some reason, her face looked sharper, maybe a little more masculine, to the point she could be mistaken to his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidge, checked the rest of her body and noticed some other changes, like the pijama she used every night was now a little too short,  showing her bare ankles and a few centimeters of her abdomen. The pijama t-shirt felt a little tight in the upper zone, like if her shoulder had grown in width a little.<br>\r\nSomething stranger was that despite the t-shirt was so stretched, she couldn't see the curve of her small boobs over it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green paladin never had big boobs like Allura and that plus her size was the reason she was often mistaken as a medium school boy. However, she had always had something there, although small... but when she took the upper part off, she find out her breasts had disappeared completely and instead, there was a plain chest with slightly muscular definition, kinda like his brothers a few years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidge felt she was losing her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she realized her underwear felt tight too. Fearing what she would find, her hands shook as they lowered her undies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAAAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small penis, no longer than 4cm, with the standard balls were uncovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha... this must be a joke. Someone must have put a false thing there. I can't imagine Allura doing this, so he must be one of the boys... I'm going to kill them for doing weirds things while I'm sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to unplug it... but when she put her fingers on it, she felt an intense sensation than caught her unaware.<br>\r\nHer fingertips lost strength and slipped over the phallus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried again, and the same pleasant sensation shook her body, breaking her grasp over her new penis.<br>\r\nAnd again, but she couldn't get it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with all those touchings, it grew harder and hotter before her eyes, up to 10cm (4\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... can't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept trying removing that, but without her noticing, it ended up as a weird masturbation, and soon it reached the climax and released a small jet of white liquid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it hadn't stopped there. It seemed tht part of the inactive Malessence had ended up stored on her brand-new penis (after all, that substance circulates through the bloodsteam, and a penis can contain blood for several minutes, absorbing the magic matter) and with all the stimulation it was activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidge moaned with pleassure as her body pumped more blood to her hard penis, growing centimeter by centimeter with extreme pleasure that overshadow the discomfort of her bones breaking and expanding. A powerful shot of cum, way stronger than the previous one, was able to cover 20cm (8\") before landing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet elongated as they moved away from Pidge's body by her growing legs.<br>\r\nHer torso and neck added a few centimeters in lenght, her shoulders cracked as they broadened 7cm more (2.7\").<br>\r\nAnd over the expanded skeleton her muscles grew a little more, now getting more defined pecs with a curve, like the boy's, bigger deltoids, a litter thicker limbs... she might be far from a athlete build, but she had got a nice slim but fit body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the transformation subdued and so the climax (by then she had being ejaculation for almost a minute). She took a minute more to recover, an another one to clean the mess she had left on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reflection looked even more like Matt, now more like the Matt prior his travel to Pluto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what's the matter with me...?\" Her brain started working \"This must be connected to whatever happened to Shiro.\" Then it switched to angst mode \"How are my parents going to react when they see me? Or my friends! Calm down, Katie, remember: Everyone thought I was a boy when I wore my baggy green clothes, with them they won't notice the difference...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Pidge had changed to her usual white t-shirt and green Bermuda... but this time she could see her navel and more of her stomach and her less masculine proportions printed on the a few sizes smaller clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better steal something from Lance's wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, when she finally dared to face her friends, she met them in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Pidge.\" Hunk greeted her before giving another bite to his sandwich.<br>\r\n\"I like the clothes you're wearing.\" Lance commented.<br>\r\n\"Guys, something weird had just happened. I'm... a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends looked each other puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were a girl.\" Keith had been distracted by Shiro's condition, but this bizarre conversation had caught his attention \"Matt's little sister.\"<br>\r\n\"I was! Am! But I changed!\" Pidge's explanation was pretty incoherent, but that's due to her still freaking out.<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec, it's this a trans thing?\" Lance got all the puzzles pieces of this conversation and put them together wrongly.<br>\r\n\"Of course! That explain why she... I mean, HE always avoided wearing girly clothes.\" Allura said joining her hands.<br>\r\n\"I'm not a trans!<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's the right name? Non-cis? Non-binary person?\" Hunk added.<br>\r\n\"You don't understand, I have a big penis now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie should have continued explaining she hadn't a few hours ago, but when she heard the words she had just said, the green paladin felt such embarrassment that felt mute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad your transition has been so... successful...\" Allura said blushing moments before she left the room. She was too timid to talk about sexual things.<br>\r\nHunk also left, but only because he was still strangely hungry and needed to cook something in the kitchen.<br>\r\nAll this conversation about penis had made Keith think about Shiro (the growth of the budge on his pants hadn't gone undetected by the red paladin) and decided to check him.<br>\r\nLance fled too, but not before he approached Pidge and said \"Now you're a member of the best club of the world\" Referring to being male. \"But if you want some lesson on how to be a man, I can teach you.\" The arrogant Lance, excited about the idea of teaching someone to be a Casanova like him, didn't notice his words could have a second, more sexual interpretation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WTF.\"</span></div></div>",

She was planning to talk to each one individually and make them understand.<br>\r\nAnd she was going to start with her best friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and to find him, she went to the most obvious place: the kitchen.<br>\r\nShe never expected to see the room under such poor conditions: Wrappers left all over the place, rests of food scattered everywhere...  That was abnormal, Hunk loved his kitchen and always kept it pristine. It seemed all the food of the kitchen had disappeared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunk, what's this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friend was sitting on the floor, turning his back to her while making chew sounds... Pidge circled around him. What she saw left her speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gut had swollen 3 times its original size after eating all the food in the kitchen, enough for 30 people, and kept going. Even more disturbing, he was acting like Pidge wasn't there and now was eating scraps from the trash bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunk, stop!\" Horrified, Pidge's kicked the trash bin out of his reach, and his fat friend whined like a hurt animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonono!\" He protested incoherently.<br>\r\n\"Hunk, something is wrong with you, you have to stop and go to the med bay!\"<br>\r\n\"But I need food. I'm hungry, so... UGGGGN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark skined paladin hold his huge gut in pain. Pidge froze, watching an impossible transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, his belly reduced to half its size (still bigger than before the 'feast') as all his muscles doubled their size.<br>\r\nShe could see how the fat of his man-tits melted and got replaced with manly pectorals that expanded uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UNG! AGG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bones creaked as his skeleton expanded to make more room for the muscle. He didn't grow much in height, hardly 10cm (3\"), but he got an astonishing increase in fatless heftiness. His shoulders widening 30cm+ (1'+) and immediately his delts and pecs made good use of the room to expand. His neck thickened.<br>\r\nHis arms and legs doubled its size with pure muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AhhHhH...\" It was the turn of his dick. It grew, but differently to Pidge's growth spurt, with each cm gained in length it got almost 2cm in width. And almost doubled its original 13cm (up to 20cm), so you can imagine how fat that monstercock had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gut contracted a second time, reducing to its original dimensions and kept shrinking more. Abs emerged from the shrinking fat layer.<br>\r\nHis shoulders had a smaller growth spurt. His feet a major one, in length and width, to better support his 110kg (242 pounds) of muscle... wait, it's 115kg now... No, 119Kg... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growing subdued, and the kind padded teddy-bear he was once had turned into a mighty, colossal American black bear, over 190cm (6'4) in height and an incredible width build. He hadn't the V-back of a bodybuilder due to his naturally wide waist, thick bones and a % of fat still a little higher than his other friends (although way lower than the ones he had before the Malessence), but he was clearly stronger than any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite how strong his muscles had gotten, the transformation had exhausted him. On his knees, the yellow paladin would have fallen backwards if Pidge hadn't hold him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunk, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n\"...ummm...\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever affected Shiro must have infected you as well, changing your metabolism to force you to get as much nutrients as possible to fuel your growth...\" Pidge went into Pidge-mode again.<br>\r\n\"...what's that smell?\" Hunk murmured while his head was resting on Pidge/Katie's lap.<br>\r\n\"I don't smell anything.\"<br>\r\n\"...smells better than freshly made cookies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunk turned his head against her pants and lowered her waistband, airing her 9cm soft penis (improved after her last growth spurt) and putting it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunk, what are you doing!?\" Pidge screamed, caught by surprise.<br>\r\n\"Mmm! This is the flavor I was looking for!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidge tried to release her cock, but her friend's sucking power was so strong escaping was impossible.<br>\r\nHis tongue caressed her cock, went around it, pressing the sensitive glans, filling it with indescribable pleasure. In seconds it went fully hard at 15cm, so hard it started to release important amounts of precum. Hunk reacted by nursing wildly, like a hungry baby in front of her mother's breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...! Ssstop...AHHHH!\" Pidge tried to protest between moans, but if Hunk understood her his hunger made him turned a blind eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to get worse. Inexplicably, her reddened cock expanded a little in a beat. And then another 2 cm (0.7\")... Like Hunk's sucking was stretching it.<br>\r\nAnd then her baggy tshirt (borrowed from Lance) began to snug around her upper-body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Quiznack, NOT AGAIN...\" Pidge recognized the signals: A new growth spurt was coming... \"AaAaHHHh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexual stimulation had reactivated the residual Malessence. She could feel her muscles burning and swelling. Her cracking bones and her point of view rising higher... And then, the cock...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UFf, uff... NnnhAGGh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...getting 5cm (2\") longer within a second. The base of her penis stood out Hunk's mouth, not because Pidge was beating his sucking power... it was because her cock was growing too long, reaching the bottom of his mouth and, to keep growing, had to expand outside his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n23cm (9\")... 24cm (9.4\")... *crack* A few centimeters more of shoulders, her pecs rose a little.<br>\r\n25cm... cramps on her legs and arms as they grew stronger, adding some muscle to a slim, tall body that keeps adding centimeters...<br>\r\n26cm (10.2\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother of all orgasms. A torrent of cum descended across Hunk's throat, more than he would expected, enough to calm the burning sensation on his stomach at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sexual frenzy concluded, they fainted side by side.<br>\r\nThe tall, slim-but-fit, Pidge on top of the less-tall, width and muscular Hunk.<br>\r\nA 16cm long and thin flaccid cock next to a 10cm long, ridiculously fat soft one, both aching after the experience.<br>\r\nThey rested for hours.</span></div></div>",

He'd probably grown only half a foot in size to 6'4\" (193 cm), but the amount of musculature he'd grown had ripped his clothing to pieces, every last part of him rippling with muscle. His pecs were jutting out several inches from his chest, and his biceps and thighs were bulging, each muscle clearly defined. His stomach bulged out as well, but no longer with fat, but a thick muscle gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really getting out of hand...\" Pidge said, looking at the thick, flaccid dick hanging from Hunk's crotch, and blushing intensely. She gasped as she felt something bump against her stomach, looking down to see her own hard cock rubbing against her abdomen. \"Oh come on!\" She groaned, the 10 in (26 cm) member standing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, realizing just how much more she'd grown. She was probably taller than Allura, but shorter than Lance now, somewhere around 5'7\" (170 cm). Lance's clothes were definitely snug on her now, although they thankfully still fit. She couldn't quite fit her cock into her pants though, not with how big it had grown. She had to admit, she was really liking the feeling of growing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned as her hand slowly wrapped itself around her cock, her hand able to grip the member firmly in her hand as she started stroking it off. She could see herself in the polished reflection of the kitchen wall. She looked so much like Matt now, it almost wasn't funny. Her face had grown much more angular, and she could even feel her Adam's apple bulging much more, not to mention the pillar of manliness hanging from her pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance's clothes looked halfway decent on her, Pidge seeing just a little bit of her pecs standing out from it. \"Although I guess I'm more of a 'he' now, than a 'she.'\" He thought, lifting up his shirt to see his budding abs. He groaned as he felt his body starting to heat up again, moaning as he felt his cock starting to expand again... 27... 29... 32... (12.6 in), and soon spreading to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====x====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the Cryo Room, Keith was pacing nervously around the room, somewhat more anxious than usual. Whatever was going on had him really worried. What if the Galra were behind it somehow? He looked at his unconscious mentor in the Cryo Pod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still clad in the remainder of his suit, although the top had ripped completely off, while his feet had burst through the bottom half. \"Shiro, what's going on?\" Keith said, not sure how to feel as his eyes wandered over his de facto brother. His body had exploded with muscle, the man standing probably well over 7 feet now. His entire body rippled with muscle, and his outfit almost couldn't survive the rest. Keith definitely eyed the massive 20\" soft monster in his groin, bulging his spandex outfit immensely. He could also the massive pair of pecs that jutted out from Shiro's chest, casting a shadow over his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind flashed back to Lance digging his hands into Shiro's back, and unaware of it, started growling, his whole body starting to heat up. 'No one touches Shiro except for me!!' He thought fiercely, gritting his teeth as his canines started sharpening, his nails growing into claws as they left a scratch on the cryo pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!!\" Keith growled, falling to his hands and knees as his whole body started trembling in a mix of pain and pleasure. \"Wh-what's going on!\" He groaned, his ears sharpening into points as his eyes collapsed into slits, his sclera turning a deep yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Un-ungh, st-stop...!\" He moaned as he thrust his crotch forward, something growing inside it as his front bulged more and more, a thick tube traveling down his leg. Under his jacket as well, his muscles started pushing up against his jacket, while his pants tightened around his legs. All kind of rips started showing while a long tail tore its way out from his tailbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Shiro slept peacefully, unaware of Keiths groans and moans growing deeper and more feral. He might've seen Keith's shadow starting to rip out of his clothing, and the tail that slinked behind his cryopod.</span></div></div>",

Show off to any alien girls interested~\" Striking a pose as he flexed his arms. His green coat unchanged as his twig arms had nothing to show. \"...Yeah right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his own thoughts, unaware of the malessence flowing in his veins, the Cuban entered the Cryo Room. The doors automatically opening as he entered.

Mine. *GRRRR*.\" Yellow eyes shined in the dark above Lance from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-!?\" Lance swiftly moved to turn around, when the yellow eyes left hand gripped him by the neck, lifting him in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrrk-\" Lance hands dug at the appendage holding him up, yet he couldn't even dent the skin. The figures outline was nearly as tall as the Shiro 7 ft(213 cm) as he sent Lance into the ground with a *THUD*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gef fof fe!\" Lance head pulsed in pain as he tried continued to dig at the thick arm pinning him down. His eyes began to water as he looked at into yellow orbs piercing into his very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-p-please!\" Finally letting out a desperate cry, the eyes of gold widened as the figure suddenly let loose its grasp, standing his full height as the shadow of arms grasped its head. Lance scooted back on the ground, too hurt to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-lance! P-prot-tect Sh-shiro!\" The figure's identity became known to him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keith!?\" He slowly rose to his feet, watching as Keith head moved wildly. The exit standing a good dozen feet behind Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Quiznak\" Heading back for a nearby wall, sweat beading down his head, tapping the walls as Keith tried to hold back whatever was infecting him. Moving slowly to not agitate Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter moving steadily across the wall by ten feet, he got what he wanted. A segment of the wall opened, showing a device meant to stun a patient temporarily. Grabbing it and holding it tight, Keith looked up in the darkness where Keith stood as he aimed it in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I?\" He was wary of pulling the trigger, even with the assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrr....D-do I-It!\" A deeper voice emerged as the hunched fogured turned, yellow eyes gazing at him, spurring Lance on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ZING* A blast of blue energy erupted forth and washed over Keith, his hunched form drooped down like it was jelly. All tension released from Keith's frame as he fell to the ground with a light *THUD*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance let out a *sigh* of relief. \"Whew....that was close! Now where are the lights?\" With the danger passed for the moment, he moved to cause the lights to resume operating, seeking answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of searching around the walls seeking for a way to turn the lights on, his hand finally moved across the switch. It glowed as the lights across the area began to brigthen. \"Finally.\" Looking over to where Keith lay passed out, head hidden by a mane of hairthe other direction, he sought to see up close exactly what had befallen the Red Lions paladin as he moved closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance observed purple pigmented skin as he got closer, clothes torn as bulging back muscle on display through tattered. Easily 6'7 ft(201 cm) in height. Getting on his knee, Lance gently moved the unconscious head to see Keith's face. The mess of wild mullet fell to the side as Lance got a view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BABUMP* *BABUMP* His face turned red as a his pants began to tighten, feeling some odd overwhelm him as he saw the face of the now half-Galra that resembled his alien parentage more. Lance, who loved Xeno girls, was postively smitten by the sight of Keith's sleeping face. Features enhanced by his purple skin, new ears, and a cute fang emerging from his mouth. The Blue Paladins hormones flaring as his body began to react.  Malessence rushing through his body as he moved closer to Keith's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro's own slumbering body within the Pod forgotten in the moment of Lust<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A bit of the lions element fusing with every drop flowing from Shiro into Voltron as a whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arg! What is this burning?!\" The sturdy Hunk grabbed his stomach with both hands as he felt like his entire body was erupting. Ripping apart muscle and bone, a dull sense of pain as it rapidly healed, before it ripped apart again. Sweat started pouring down his head as he felt his body shifting. \"Guys. Something is seriosly wrong with my body!\" His eyes soon glowed yellow as he tried to hold back yells of pain. *CRACK* and *RIP* as Sinew and Bone tore, stretch, grew, healed, repeat, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UGH*.

His height increasing faster than his own muscles as he gains 20 cm (8 in) in a few seconds.<br>\r\n\"My body is in agonizing pain and Im feeling famished. Not a great day.\" Hunk groaned as he felt his pecs expand, his hefty stomach changing beneath his thickening arms. A strong, powerful musclegut built to eat. \"I really need some food in me.<br>\r\n\"*NGH* Me too. My body feels like I starved it for a week.\" Shiro replied, not realizimg his hunger waa mostly his body craving more malessence.<br>\r\n\"You gotta EMBRACE the feelings! If you do that taking control of, mmm, and letting it go will make the pain feel GOOD!\" Lance was stroking his body, in love with his growing body.<br>\r\n\"What should be done about our clothes?\" Hunk asked as he felt his growing, bulging biceps and musclegut threatening to burst open his Paladin uniform.<br>\r\n\"Rip it off. It'll make things, *NGH*, easier.\" Shiro was himself feeling his beefy, scarred body as he simply let it happen as Lance suggested. The pain was still there, but was getting easier to deal with as his body grew.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the *UGH* advice Shiro.\" Keith thanked him as he ripped off his uniform quickly, his body thicker but still pretty lean at the moment. He was trying to let it happen, but the pain and fear of it kept him from embracing it.<br>\r\n\"YEAH BABY!\" Lance yelled as he flex his body to do a pose, loud *RIPS* and *TEARS* filling the comms as Lance kissed his bulging biceps, easily 61 cm (24 inches) biceps flexing as Lance happily loving every bit of his transformation.<br>\r\n\"Can we return to thr castle so I can get undressed?\" Hunk asked \"Im famished and I dont want to rip through my clothes\"<br>\r\n\"Good idea Hunk. Everyone! Lets get back to the castle and deal with this. My arm\" He reached down and felt the smooth mechanical appendage \"Needs investigating\".<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. Pidge can....wait Pidge hasn't talked at all. Are you okay Pidge?!\" Keith called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M FINE! I'M FINE!\" She called out. Her face was red. She'd been hearing their bodies grow, their groans, the pleasure Lance was deriving from it. Her face beat red as she realkzed she was the only unaffected one. \"You guys are just....acting different and it all caught me off guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy to know you're okay Pidge. Lets get to the Castle. I need you to see if my arm is okay.\" Shiro smiled as their female member finally replied. \"Now lets go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoltron split as the lions flew towards the ship, unaware of the continuing production of malessence.</span></div></div>",

Hunk kept rubbing his musclegut through his apron while cooking. It was hard to tell if it was because he was hungry, or liked how it felt. It made it a little difficult to get around the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro and Keith decided to train to get used to their larger bodies so they wouldn\u2019t be slowed down. In nothing but their tight pants, spard without braking a sweat. At least, not when they usually would. The rippling muscle of their upper bodies would be cover sweet soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance was trying to fit into his clothes. Although not could fit him properly, he LOVED the look and feeling of how tight his clothes were. He tried a lot of his clothes, but was now wearing his usual. Pants hugging around his calves, thighs and hips. Shirt stretched by his pecs. And his jacket\u2019s sleeves feeling like they\u2019ll burst by flexing his biceps. He looked like a kid that just outgrew his clothes. Lance couldn\u2019t stop looking in the mirror and his muscles directly while posing.</span></div></div>",

Well not really alone, but poor Neptr is so often forgotten by his maker. Jake had gone to see all his kids and wouldn't be back for a week, while BMO was outside playing whimsical games like usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn mechanical arm swiped a knife across a piece of bread, butter spreading across its surface as he prepared to make a grilled cheese. \"Man I can't wait for Jake to come home\" The constant struggles of his life currently gives him a desire to leave and find something to do to distract from Ferns death. Jake usually knew a few good things to serve as a distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will slay you mighty dragon!\" BMO yelled as he swung a makeshift cardboard sword at a mysterious dragon shaped object in the grass, the dirt at the bottom upheaved as if it it had fallen from the sky. BMO's imagination made the harmless looking figure into a massive and terrifying beast with four heads, sixteen eyes, a sleek black serpentine body, and two stubby wings. One imagined head rushed forth to bite him, only for BMO to clumsily knock it away with a cardboard shield being swung like a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImaginary growls emanted from it as BMO cockily stood proud, his tiny green robot body trying to impose confidence. \"It takes more than that to best me!\" As he readied tofight again the little machine tossed his sword by mistake at the object, a switch sound activating as the head popped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no I slew the dragon...Yay I slayed the dragon!\" BMO distraight turned to joy as he viewed himself courageously beheading the four headed beast in one fell swoop. \"What goodies await inside?\" walking over, he reached upwards to grab the opened hatch with both hands, pulling himself up and into the larger object. \"Lets see what I get!\" BMO saw nothing inside except a small statue of a caped armor with a tag attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over and looking at it, BMO read the tag and saw it say \"For Finn the Human\". \"Ah! None for me mister dragon? You're a jerk\". Picking it up, not noticing his strangely nonexistent weight, BMO brought it over to the opened hatch, dropping it to the ground before jumping down himself. He proceeded to lift it again and carry it to the Tree Fort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn meanwhile was fixing the second of several grilled cheese sandwiches, a finished one laying on a plate as the door opened. \"Hey BMO! Did you have fun outside?\" he asked without looking away. Deciding to focus his absolute attention on the pan as he held it with his mechanical right arm and a spatula in the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovered in dirt, the green machine happily responded to the blonde as he walked over to Finn. \"Lots of fun! I slayed the mighty dragon and got this from its cavenous innards!\" He placed the object next to the stove, right next to Flynns left arm. Moving over to the table to pretend to eat the first sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. That's nice.\" Finn had brushed it off as another fanciful delusion of BMO, not noticing the grain of truth as he bumped into the statue with his fleshy arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shockwave of pleasure caused Finn to freeze up in that second, his robot arm bending the pans grip by accident as his reflexs toss the sandwich and it collides with a wall. \"What the-!?\" His body felt as if something really good had just happened to every cell of his body.</span></div></div>",

The drained weary body began to feel as energetic as a massive sugar rush, bags beneath his eyes disappearing as energy pumped through his veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel loads better!\"Jake started jumping out of the blankets, only to trip on the thick mass \"w-whoa!\" crashing hard with a *THUD* as the flames on the wall started expanding, covering a fourth of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up within a second, the energy coursing through him getting pumped even more. \"Yo can't let this stop me! Gonna go see Spud and Tricia! Dra-choo!\"  He sneezed, sparks erupting and hitting the wall and the floor. It wasn't quite gone yet as the flames erupted and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man. G will kill me when he gets back\" He hadn't even transformed yet! Yet his body was burning with energy. The buzz overflowing as he yelled \"Dragon Up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Meanwhile====<br>\r\n\"Yo Gran! I made that potion you suggested. I bet it's working wonders right now.\" Fu Dog, dressed in a purple gaudy shirt with sunglasses on as he walked enjoyed a drink with his current company: The beautiful drider V-V-Veronica! The two enjoying a relaxing meal near some Satyrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Her voice was inaudible to his company, but Fu perfectly understood her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah the one that makes green fumes. Gotta say that makes me wanna gag just breathing it in. Whoa baby did that feel to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human? No grandma he's a dragon remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>........</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Curse of..... Vasuki? Shesha? Ophis? Apep? Leviathan? Jomunganny?\" He flubbed the last one \"Yo gotta explain this to me in more detail gran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........\" As he listened to her, his mouth went agape as his sunglasses tilted on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\" Dragging out a bunch of cash \"Meal's on me Veronica.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing him without stuttering her name to flirt, she gasped \"Fu what's wrong!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble with Jake. I <i>might</i> have made a bit of a mess!\" The magical dog got on all fours and started running for the store.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Back to Jake====<br>\r\n*BBOOOOMMM* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long, drawn out explosion erupted at Lao Who's store as head busted through the roof. The long red snout of the red with yellow belly Jake Long had grown through the roof of the small shop. Thick neck muscles throbbing as he started sweating as he saw his poking out behind the building, partly hiding him from the populace on the street in Chinatown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like the fires out!\" His giant muscular tail, thicker and longer than ever before had smashed through the burning wall, the end of the tail curling against the next wall in the room behind the new hole, ready to grow through it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick, bulging feet had completely smothered the flames on the floor. His sharp dark blue-gray clawed toes ready to stab the wall before them at his command.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man my chest feels <b>big</b>.\" Indeed. His already prominent chest was pushing like crazy against the roof to the sounds *GROAN* *CREAK* *CREAK* as it struggled against such a fearsome chest. Easily increasing to 50% its original size. His wings were pressed tightly against him, forcing them to restrict instead of letting loose and tossing aside the ruined shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pray turning back reverses....this.\" Jake felt uncomfortable trapped in there. \"And hey mom can order me some new duds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'll try exploring the weird side effects MUCH later. Likely when fighting the Huntsclan...</span></div></div>",

He shared a few classes with Adrien y Marinette, but they barely knew anything about him except his name. This introverted teen lived in a world of his own and rarely talked to any of his classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made him the perfect target for bulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy had a secret: He liked men, specially the tall, muscular and <i>gifted</i> ones. He had a collection of this type porn hidden in his laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, he had to go to the bathroom fast, leaving his computer unprotected in the classroom. The nossy Chloe took a look to all his files and eventually discovered his hidden porn folder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the student came back, he saw all the class knew his little secret, some of them looked at him with disgust and another part of the student actively made fun of him for hours until the class was dismissed. Chloe took care of making sure even the teachers heard about his unusual tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never feel so humiliated. He ran to his house, empty as usual because his parents were overseas, and then cried bitterly till a beautiful dark butterfly entered in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lepidopterous touched something, and then his blue feelings transformed into rage and sadism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, young man... I'm Hawk Moth, the only true friend you have right now... I'll give you power to avenge yourself, but in exchange I want Ladybug and Cat Noir's magic Miraculous.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll do your bidding, master\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy body was surrounded for darkness, and emerged with a darker skin tone, some kind of sport clothes (equally dark sleeveless shirt, wristbands, and shorts) and a weird spiky haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wait, what are your powers, exactly?\" For once, Hawk Moth didn't know what exactly he had created.<br>\r\n\"I'm the Builder of Bodies, master. I have the power of strengthen the bodies of my enemies.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds counter-productive. Why would I want to do that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis minion couldn't find a satisfactory answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugg, what a waste of my time... I'll take your akuma butterfly now\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, master! I need this power to get revenge... And I believe it could be useful to discover the secret identity of your masked enemies.\"<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n\"I could change dramatically their bodies. When they assumes their civil identities, they'll stand out a lot. It will be easy to identify them.\"<br>\r\n\"Mmm... it's an unconventional plan, but it might work... but you still need to create chaos to draw them\"<br>\r\n\"That won't be a problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy flexed his bodies, tensing all his muscles, and then he started to shine. Like a Dragon Ball character, his muscles started to bulge, his baggy shirt and shorts got progressively tighter as the girth of his torso and thighs increased... his pecs silhouette under the cloth were like two hills, his shoulders had become extremely broad in contrast with his narrow hip (with a full set of abs), forming a perfect V back. He was reaching his perfect idea of his ideal man. And his tiny cock grew until becoming a fat python shut in his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much space left for his muscles to grow more, so he had to make more room by stretching his bones, increasing his height fast, jumping from 160cm (5'4\") to 190cm (6'4\") and finally ended up to 220cm (7'4\") with muscular beyond bodybuilders' build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped to the street and with his new superstrength he lifted some cars and throw them to the buildings.</span></div></div>",

Looks like that growth spurt's finally kicking in~\" Plagg said, floating as he looked at Adrian from different angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian adjusted his collar as he somewhat realized what Plagg was talking about, his shirt digging into his chest as it seemed a lot, things coming a bit lower on his vision as well. He walked over to one of the nearby mirrors, seeing just how tight his shirt looked on him, lifting it up, and letting his jaw hang down. He had abs! Well, not a full pack, but they were forming! His shirt was not formerly that tight this morning, but what could be causing it? Maybe Miraculous had an effect on that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlagg looked down as well, and well, he had to admit, he had to smirk, especially considering Adrian, at least when he was Adrian didn't like showing off. \"Well, there are a few perks to being a model Adrian~\" He said, as Adrian tried to realize what was going on until he looked down, and then it hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a model, he had to be used to showing off in tight clothing, but one, his pants were only coming to slightly above ankle length, and he could see some tight muscle definition through them too, but wearing skinny jeans was not useful when it looked like you were trying to smuggle a small ball in his pants! \"Ah! What the heck!!\" He shouted, blushing as he moved to cover his crotch with his arms, panicking as he tried to find something to cover himself more decently with, but the thought was interrupted as the school bell rang. \"Oh crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, looks like you're gonna be late~\" Plagg teased, floating around smugly, quite amused at his troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, no camembert for you until I figure this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AWWW!\"</span></div></div>",

Of course he couldn't work miracles inside his undersized tight pants and anyone could see there was a pretty obvious bulge there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plan (if we could call it 'a plan') consisted in sitting so fast at his desk so no one would notice his enlarged package and praying no one would realize the toned muscles of his upper body... It was a plan so stupid he amazed it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not completely, because he ended up making a scene by bursting into the class and jumped to his seat, almost crushing Nino, his best friend who always sat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not know you liked Chemistry so much as to come running this way\" Nino joked around, but the nervous blondie didn't even smile.<br>\r\n\"Ah... eh... Of course... not... I... thought... I thought I was late.\"<br>\r\n\"But you know the class doesn't start until 9 o'clock...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian had stopped listening to his friend. Nino was acting normal, so he didn't notice his little transformation... at that moment he was more worried about his other classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was peeking at him lewdly, but he did that everyday. Marinette and Alya were chatting in the seats behind his own. When Adrian turned his body to greet them (and to check if they were talking about him) Alya answered normally whereas Marinette got very nervous and blabbed. Again, their usual behavior.<br>\r\nHe also noticed there were some empty desks: Jeremy's and Nathan's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How strange...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he overheard part of the conversation between Chloe and Sabrine, mentioning Jeremy's name, yesterday's Spanish class (an optional subject neither Adrian nor Marinette had chosen) and a few homophobic jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was about to ask them what was all that about, the teacher arrived and the class started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian couldn't focus on the lesson. He was still worried about his classmates and his changes, which should be connected to the villain he fought. Fortunately, the next teacher were ill, so he only had to wait for this class to end\u2026 but that was easier to say than done, because in the middle of the class he started to feel weird again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnh...\u201d He moaned as softly as he could, as he felt all his muscles palpitating. His body temperature rose as his clothes became progressively tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it suddenly stopped and the sweaty boy actually believed it had finally stopped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNNGH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but it had only started. His knees bumped against the table, and he had to stretch them forwards so they would fit the apparently shrinking space under the desk. But there was no solution for his feet, which were expanding too inside the cramped shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Please, stop\u2026 NGH! Stop...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body disobeyed him and kept growing slowly. He felt coldness in his belly and the low zone of his legs and knew his clothing no longer covered those growing parts of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Adrian...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino couldn\u2019t have chosen a worst moment to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you started working out?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEh\u2026 Yes?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you didn\u2019t have biceps this big before\u2026 or biceps at all.\u201d Nino said as grabbing his muscular upper arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026 a little\u2026 UNGGgg\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his body couldn\u2019t have chose a worst moment to grow. This time the growth affected mostly his muscles, and it amazed Nino as he felt how his biceps grew under his grasp. He couldn\u2019t cover even half of it with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe how big it gets when you\u2019re flexing them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian wasn\u2019t flexing them at all, but didn\u2019t correct his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNino, stop the chitchat and answer this question!\u201d The teacher shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero breathed a sigh of relief when Nino forgot about his growing muscles and payed attention to the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnhh...\" The growth didn't give him a break. His body had decided it was better to get more room for his future muscles before growing them further, and so it had started to stretch all his bones and broadening his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already almost a head taller than his best friend, and both were sitting (if he stood up on his long legs, he would be even taller). That fact didn't go unnoticed by the girls behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was Adrian always so much taller than Nino?\" Marinette wondered confused.<br>\r\n\"Actually no, they're at the same height, but Nino usually hunch a lot in the seat, making him look shorter.\" Alya's logic was sound, but then the blond head inched upwards a little more.<br>\r\n\"Did he get taller??\" <br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm sure Adrian was slouching too, but less, so he seemed taller, and now he had straighten his back completely.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnn... aah...\" Adrian muttered while he was covering his mouth with his hand. There was another part of his body growing, and with every inch it gained he felt so much pleasure he could cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his pants, crawling downward the tight trouser leg, expanding, but not erect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wished so much to touch it, to satiate its hunger of pleasure, but he knew if he did that, if it became hard, his pants wouldn't survive the experience...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIIIIINNG*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell sounded, Adrian ran outside and hid in the currently unused locker room, where he could examine his most private changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly\u2026 How it could swell so much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock, at last free of the constricting clothing, was hanging 16cm from his crotch. And it was soft. Way fatter than his original hard-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much can it grow when\u2026 No, I don\u2019t have time for this, I have to find out why this happened to me\u2026 Also, I have a photo session in an hour\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis penis twitched in the air and filled slowly with blood\u2026 Adrian couldn\u2019t help himself and touch it\u2026 and then shook violently with one hand\u2026 one hand wasn\u2019t enough to cover this huge pile of meat, so he used both while sitting on a chair\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the penis demanding more stimulation, and Adrian, who had become its slave, obeyed bending his back and lowering his head until the head of his cock entered into his mouth. The hands covered the part outside the mouth (most of it), but sometimes one strayed and started to play with the nipple of one of his immense pecs or went inside his anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eventually he came, filling his mouth with cum and then the rest of his body and his seat. The intensity of the orgasm made him dizzy and sleepy, although he also felt a little unsatisfied\u2026 like he could do it again\u2026 or maybe that feeling was caused by his empty ass\u2026 if he put something as big as cock there, maybe he would satiate that lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ring*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone rang, showing a pic of his father in the screen. Gabriel Agreste wanted to know where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Crap, the photo shoot\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it should had started 5 minutes ago, but he had been masturbating for an hour and, of course, he had forgotten it. The photographer didn\u2019t and called his father, who got pretty angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way, dad. I\u2019ll almost there.\u201d He lied. \u201cIn 5 minutes, at the most.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so, Adrian. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is only a way I can go there so fast\u2026 Plagg, claws\u2026 plagg?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis kwami was hidden behind a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-saw-it-all\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Say Adrian blushing.<br>\r\n\u201cYou really have changed, Adrian...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSomething weird is going on with me\u2026 Does it have something to do with my Miraculous?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it can\u2019t affect your body when you\u2019re not transformed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them knew the ring had absorbed most of Jeremy\u2019s Growth energy ray, ready to release part of it in the next transformation. The previous growth spurt was only due to the part of the ray which hit his body instead of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, if it\u2019s safe to use it\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

His hands grew too, and the pressure of the lengthening fingers threw the gloves to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u266a\u266b More Electric Guitar \u266a\u266b<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his uniform had been placed all over his upper body, the growing sparks made it grow in an spasm, and so his nice swimmer level pecs became more like the ones of a beefy gymnastic or swimmer. His shoulders expanded a lot, giving him an exaggerated V-back, as his deltoids and neck grew bigger and his abdomen became extremely toned, where his abs stood up under the cloth like a set of bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis recently formed skintight uniform couldn't bear his increasing upper body and tore here and there during the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u266a\u266b Ta-ra-ra-RA \u266a\u266b<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the transformation affected his legs, and just after that part of uniform had been finished an specific wave of growth ripped it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs became longer and thicker, his calves and quadriceps grew so fast the cloth ripped just a second after it was formed and his 12cm (5\") longer feet broke through the shoes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u266a\u266b\u266a\u266b Final epic chords \u266a\u266b\u266a\u266b<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his belt-made tail fluttered in the air, Adrian's own tail inched downwards, and the sensation the expansion made was so good it responded with an explosive hard-on which tore the crotch area of his pants, rose up well over his navel, almost touching his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian, out of his wits, started shaking it non-stop until it threw up cum like a volcano over everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music ended, and the superhero regained consciousness. He found himself laying down a puddle of cum. His torn clothing had begun to repair and clean itself (the magic cloth can do things like that), so when he got up he was pretty presentable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has happened? I... came again? But I had just finished masturbating two minutes ago... That sensation was incredible, I should do it ag... NO, I have to do a photo session!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe model ran to the door, and then his forehead was hit by the door frame, throwing him to the floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch... what\u2026? I'm taller than the door?? But when I got inside I didn't touch the door-frame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he remembered again his schedule, and passed through the door lowering his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got there, the photographer got a big surprise when I saw his teen model a head and a half taller than himself, and much heavier, but soon his surprise became enthusiasm when he discover how photogenic his body was. There were other models besides Adrian, all older than the student, but no one could match his hot physique and quickly they were forgotten by the photographer, who only had eyes for the blondie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... great... flex a little your body... perfect... smile to the camera... (oh my, I think he's giving me an erection) ...now let's flex a little more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian had some clothes prepared for him, but there were too small for him now, so he had to use the other models' clothing, which still were tight and undersized but at least he could move with them and the small clothes made him hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ups!\" He flexed his muscles too much and the buttons of his shirt flew out. His shirt stayed open, exposing part of his muscular chest and abs. \"Sorry.\" He apologized with his puppy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, kid, I have a lot more of clothes... *CLICK* *CLICK* ...but I'll take some more pictures of this clothing before you change... *CLICK**CLICK**CLICK* Damn, this is wonderful... Do you think you could burst another shirt?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photo session continued with Adrian demanded to do even more sexually explicit poses.</span></div></div>",

Let's talk about the whereabouts of their owners...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was Jeremy, a gay student barely known by our two protagonists who was akumatized after Chloe and other classmates found out his porn folder and mocked him in front of the whole school. He had a quick fight with our two favourite superheros until he disappeared in the thin air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one was Nathan. He was a short redhead, quite introverted like Jeremy, who loves drawing and Marinette, a one-sided love...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jeremy was humiliated, nor Adrian neither Marinette were there (they assisted another subject). Actually, most of their class wasn't either... Although Nathan was, and witnessed all. He didn't participate in the bulling, but he didn't do anything to defend the victim. He had some qualities, but courage wasn't one of them. Although he did have conscience, and started to feel guilty and worry after the boy left the classroom and never came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to go to his house (he knew where he lived, although they were never close) and rang the door bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, Jeremy got startled when he heard that sound. He had just got home, he didn't expect any visitors (he didn't have friends and his parents were traveling for Asia). His first thought was the caller had to be a bully from class, eager to keep torturing him... that made Jeremy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still in his muscled tall form he used to fight Ladybug. He couldn't wait to face those bullies with all that super-strength... but before he opened the door, he heard Nathan's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy, are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead was the last person he expected to see here. He didn't know why had come, but doubtlessly not to batter anyone.<br>\r\nHe was about to welcome him when he remembered he was a huge villain now, and he didn't want his looks to scare him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe concentrated, and with a great effort and pain he could reduce his body to almost his original size (he was still a little taller and more toned than before).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For some reason, shrinking is harder than growing...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike other akuma guys, his appearance hadn\u2019t changed much, aside a small tan in his skin and his clothes could pass for normal sport clothes with a mask\u2026 so after he took that off he was ready to receive him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d He said a little coldly to Nathan.<br>\r\n\u201cH-hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long moment of silence\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I came to see if you were fine after what happened in class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Cute. And pathetic.\u2019 That was what the akumatized teen thought. \u2018 I\u2019m stronger than ever, I\u2019m preparing my revenge on everyone who wronged me\u2026\u2019 But, of course, he couldn\u2019t say that to his guest. \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother awkward, long silence. An evil idea emerged from Jeremy\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan didn\u2019t want to, he was feeling extremely so intimidated by Jeremy for some reason... but he couldn\u2019t refuse his invitation, that would have been impolite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth kids sat on a long sofa in the living room. More awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what happened. Those guys were awful.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2018And you simply watched, coward, not lifting a finger to help me...\u2019 Jeremy thought.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to return to class tomorrow?\u201d He interrupted his train of thoughts.<br>\r\n\u201cI think after what happened, I\u2019ll take some days off\u2026 but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m going to come back VERY SOON, and see you ALL\u2026 hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t sound creepy AT ALL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 cool\u2026 Then I think I should be going...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jeremy did the first movement, sneaking his arm over Nathan\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve just arrived\u2026 please, stay a little more...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nathan was brave enough to turn him down, he would have stopped those bullies in school. So he stayed there, frozen, without knowing what to do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while the kid freaked out silently, Jeremy\u2019s hand started to send his magic energy to Nathan body, and the scrawny boy shot up slowly. He stopped when he reached his height, after growing 10cm (4\u201d).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 eh\u2026 Jeremy\u2026 I\u2019m glad to\u2026 to see you\u2019re fine, but I think\u2026 If you don\u2019t need anything for me\u2026 I...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut there\u2019s something you can help me.\u201d The smirking boy got closer to him while holding a TV remote. \u201cWe could watch a film together...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need me to watch a movie...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so insensible\u2026 I\u2019m traumatized after what happened. I ran out from school in the middle of a class to hide myself here. I\u2019m scared.\u201d He lied. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! I\u2019ll stay with you... for a while...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie began, and a pair of swimmers appeared in the screen. They were fairly tall, quite handsome with perfect shaved muscular bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy smacked his lips while fantasized with the image of a Nathan as big as them. His power responded to his wish, and added more centimeters to the redhead, now pushing to the 180cm (6\u2019) tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of movie is this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOne about sports.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little more growth, and the artist broke the 180cm (6\u2019) barrier and was approaching to the 190cm (6\u20194) one\u2026 his build was filling with muscle, with his pecs pressing with his shirt, which couldn\u2019t cover his whole torso now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem uncomfortable.\u201d Jeremy noted.<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 my shirt feels much tighter somehow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan had to look away from his face and pretend he was interested in the movie.<br>\r\nHis devilish smile terrified him.</span></div></div>",

The cloth ripped and an impossible big hard cock (who knows how big it was then) made its presence felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan lost his voice, he didn\u2019t know what it was happening of what to do.

After that growth spurt, each time he put his cock all the way inside, the stomach of the redhead got temporally deformed.<br>\r\n\u201cYessssssh...aggah...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy finally reached the climax, and that made him loose the control of his powers\u2026 his body started to hulk up, growing until his head and shoulders were pressing against the ceiling, wearing Nathan like he was a condom in his humongous penis\u2026 the inner stimulation made him cum too, and between the two covered the room with cum and musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed out, and no one wakened for hours.<br>\r\nThe first awake was Nathan, lucky him. His mind took almost another hour to regain full conscience and free will. Whatever magic spell had Jeremy cast on him, it was wearing off, although there was still traces trying to keep him obedient and submissive. He needed to use all his willpower to get up and run away before his slaver awakes and takes the control again.</span></div></div>",

Alya.\u201d The two girls just looked up, and up. Before, Marinette only had to look up slightly to lock eye with Adrian. Now she barley came up to his well tone abs. Adrian then blushed when he realized that he was shirtless. \u201cOh, sorry. I should be wearing a shirt hu? Hold on a sec.\u201d Adrian then returned with an ill fitting version of his regular clothes. His white dress shirt hung off his torso and it\u2019s sleeves were ripped off. Same goes for the t-shirt\u2019s sleeves. The shirt barely covered his pecs. Marinette could hardly hide her blushing face while Alya could hardly keep from laughing.</span></div></div>",

She grabbed her yo-yo and acted lightning fast, trying to pull him out of the way. \"CHAT! WATCH OUT!\" She shouted, trying to calculate where he was gonna land as he rushed forward, but,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chat slowed, not expecting her shout as he stopped in his tracks, energy still concentrated in his hand as he looked directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" She shouted, trying to pull in her yo-yo, only to accidentally wrap it around Chat's leg, pulling him down as his hand impacted with the ground, erasing the area where it touched, as Chat all but face-planted on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeee!!!\" Both of them shouted as the beam impacted Chat dead on, sending him crashing into a wall, the string attached dragging Ladybug along with him, Chat leaving a catboy sized imprint in the wall as he slammed perfectly parallel into it, Ladybug somewhat dusty from getting dragged along on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat aching from getting dragged along, \"Ungh...\" Ladybug stirred, trying to get up as she brushed some of the dust off of her. \"Unh, Chat, are you alright?\" She asked, waiting for her double vision to clear as she blinked, catching sight of Chat, sparking with energy as he pulled himself out of the wall, sending bricks everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Un, what did you do to me?!\" Chat demanded, feeling the energy starting to suffuse him as he looked at Jeremy, who crossed his hands with a smug look. He held him his hand which started twitching uncontrollably, with a swelling sound as his forearm began swelling, veins throbbing through his suit as he gripped it with his other hand, as though it could stop it. \"Ugh, what's going on!\" He cried as a RIPPPPP rang through the plaza, his tanned skin throwing through the torn costume as it spread up into his arm, his bicep exploding through, a sole vein peaking on the middle as he involuntarily flexed, making it even bigger, groaning as it spread into his shoulder Feeling his hands grow bigger as well, the gloves tightening around them as rips appeared in them as well. Within seconds, the changes had spread to the other arm as well, leaving him almost comically looking, two enormous arms, with biceps as big as his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to wait long though as his back grew to match, lats expanding as they ripped the back of his costume open. With a THOOM, his pecs ripped open his suit, not even bothering with his zipper as the strange leather-like fabric was ripped to pieces, revealing muscle to rival his biceps as his smooth, shiny pecs pulsed into being. Within seconds the transformation had spread down, his waist thickening as his leather cat belt snapped off, no longer able to wrap around his torso as his stomach rippled, abs popping row by row into being from his pecs down, coming to where his old waist was formerly! \"Mmm, getting bigger, stronger! He moaned, feeling it spreading down, his smooth, model-body becoming into that of a god, the sweat he was giving off giving his body a nice shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet burst out of his shoes, thick, and powerful enough to give him the support his giant god-body needed, as the transformation shot up, calves thickening into globes as his quads formed into that teardrop shape bodybuilders lusted after. With a rip, he felt a hole form in his back, as his muscled ass ripped the back open, but it wasn't done as he felt one more change. \"Mmm, Ladybug, you... might want to look away for this one!\" Chat moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, she quickly saw what he meant, 'Oh, hell no!' She thought, eye twitching. Claws twitching from the sensation, Chat moaned as what was left of his suit, around his lower regions started bulging, the remaining growth heading right to his groin. the bulge within quickly straining his remaining rags to their limit, the long bulge within moving down, as two smaller ones throbbed underneath. With a grunt, he felt it surging bigger and bigger, hands twitching as his suit's zipper gave up the fight, a giant throbbing pillar, at least three feet in length shot out, slapping him right in the middle of his giant pecs, sending a few drops of pre flying, already as thick as his forearm and getting even thicker. Blushing heavily, he reached down, trying to do what he could to help his trapped orbs, still stuck in the tight leather, but it didn't help as... \"So... close, so good, so biiig! Can't help it! I'm, I'm cumming!\" Chat moaned as his cock pulsed, sending a giant wave of white out before the eyes of Ladybug and Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was doing what she could to avoid blood loss. As annoying as Chat could be, seeing his small frame rip out of his suit to turn into something the Greek statues at the Louvre would be jealous of... his smooth, hairless body like a model most designers could potentially die for. Mon dieu! Thank goodness Alya wasn't filming this, she thought as she looked at Chat panting, blushing heavily as his the tattered remains of his suit hung on, his little bell ringing between his pecs, somehow having survived despite his thick neck, and that giant throbbing cock... despite making a mess, he was still hard as ever. It's not like she could avoid it, considering she had to look up at him now. But still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What a Catastrophe..' They both thought at the same time, Ladybug somewhat hating herself for the pun, only to be interrupted by a beep on Chat's ring as one dot flashed. 'OOOhhh shit...' They thought again.</span></div></div>",

In her palm resided a replica earring based on Ladybugs' own, a recently sold store product. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. With your powers attracting her earrings based on their superficial similarity will finally get it within my grasp.\" Smiling, Hawk Moth clenched his fist as his Sigil connected them. \"Then with Ladybugs Miraculous taking Chat Noirs will be a cinch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir.\" Hawk Moth turned to see Natalie had entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The news has caught site of Ladybug and Chat Noir\" Showing her boss her tablet, the two hiding behind an empty bus to ready themselves for taking on the Akumatized Villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work.\" Bowing, she returned to oversee her work As his personal assistant as his public persona, Fashion Designer Gabriel Agreste.

A small red creature popping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus on her Chat!

I know the invocation thanks to a few trade secrets. I don't want them to easily obtain it ever again after past failures. Now invoke The Kwami and The Miraculous activation.

Hawk Moth collapsed, landing on one knee as Natalie dropped her tablet to head her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hawk Moth!\" A frown crossed his face as he solemnly closed his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Miraculous of Creation and Destruction have been used, I was connected to that light.for but a second and saw what will come to be!.

Everything looked normal. \"Just a nightmare\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nightmare about gaining the power of Creation and destroying reality to make a new one was just too absurd.

An impossibly handsome young man was there, with the build of a bulky swimmer that over-stretched the sleeveless shirt and well-padded boxers.

He had indeed hit rock bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his giant plates were empty, Adrien stood up, got his backpack and got ready for school, but when he was leaving his head hit the top of the tall doorframe of the frontdoor with so much strength he left a hole in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrien, are you okay?\" His father asked, worried.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" He said, rubbin his unharmed forehead. Not even a cut nor a bruise, more than we could say of the wall of concrete \"I guess I'm still a growing boy...\" Our protagonist said with an innocent smile.<br>\r\n\"I'll call the builders. I calculate in a few days they will have lengthened the door... again.\" Nathalie mentioned.<br>\r\n\"Okay, take care of the preparations. I have to go to school. Today we have sex-ed, and I don't want to miss it.\"</span></div></div>",

The room shined brilliantly without a speck of dirt as light flowed in from the open windows. The Mewman princess wand safely tucked into his pocket as he finished setting her blankets in place without a single wrinkle. \"There! Now she'll have no reason to leave me behind. Again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been less than thirty minutes ago when Ponyhead rushed in \"Hey bestie! I, like, need you to come with me for a sec. Not you Marco just us girls.\" Pushing Star off into a portal made via the Dimensional Scissors faster than Marco could rebuttal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Marco my wands on the bed!\" The golden haired princess called out before vanishing. Not even enough time for him to toss it, the wand turn green as bat wings grew forth from him holding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here he was, withnothing to do for Star until she gets back. Her room clean and any plans they had ruined by Ponyhead. It was only several minutes before-\"Well I'm bored. I might as well call someone.\" He walked over to the mirror and said \"Call Tom Lucitor\" underworld through the mirror. The reflection of Marco in Star's bedroom shifting to the fiery and earthern dwelling of Tom Lucitor, who sat before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three eyed demon prince was in zen meditation. Taking a lesson from his life coach Brian for tempering the natural born rage born from thousands of demonic spirits residing within. Which he's improved considerably on all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes, the three eyed prince smiled \"Hey Marco. Calling me from Stars room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Ponyhead nabbed her for something and wouldn't let me come along. Even left the wand.\" He pulled it out to show. \"And well the adventure we were about to go on involving an ancient wyrmslaying was kiboshed. What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I have no plans of doing any more exorcisms, Brian's been having me do this instead. It's pretty boring.\" Tom, who had never used the wand before, had an idea. \"I want to try something. I'll be there in a second.\" The mirror turned to normal as Tom a portal opened up in the room and Tom appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to to do?\" Marco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to use the wand on me. Help me get more tougher so my rage won't swallow me if I get mad enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wand? Nuh-uh! There's no way I can use it without Stars permission.\" He crossed his arms to flatly declare no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you used it before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it was to try and find Star.\"<br>\r\n\"Think of it this way: You can practice should you ever need to use it again, and you can even get back that older bod you love so much.\"<br>\r\n\"I did love having abs in Hekapoos dimension.\" He shook his head \"My answers still no.\"<br>\r\nThe pink haired demon tried to sweetn the pot \"You can not only try it first, but I'll even include a ticket to Love Sentence next concert.\" in a wisp of flame a ticket appeared in his hand.<br>\r\n\"I thought their next concert was all sold out!?\" Marcos eyes grew wide with joy as he glimpsed the wonderful treasure in hand.<br>\r\n\"It nearly was. I barely got this one. So want to try it out? I might even go with you to slay that wyrm in Stars place.\" Tom added one more piece to hopefully find a way to curb his anger a tad more.<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Taking the ticket, Marco readied himself. \"I heard Eclipsa say intent and a few word invocations is sometimes all one needs to cast spells.\" He thought to the recently free Queen of Darkness and now resident of the Mewni palace with current Butterfly royalty. \"So I hope this works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy pointed the wand at the mirror and said \"Grow.\" A beam burst out and bounced off the glass to go straight for Marcos mole. The blast sending down to his feet. \"Ow! That hurst worst than I imagined.\" he rubbed his cheek where the mole was nestled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Tom eagerly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure? Let me try a spell on you next.\"</span></div></div>",

That if I didn\u2019t use that, I\u2019d be too weak to handle him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! Besides, you can use tricks!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe said that was the only thing we used in common. That since I\u2019m smaller than him, that my dagger would stand a chance against him without relying on Pixie Dust for my tricks and getaways.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just letting him get to you. Think about it, if you\u2019re mulling over it like this, imagine how Hook is taking it!\u201d Peter looked at Slightly with a smile and pated his head before Slightly ran off to play with the other Lost Boys.<br>\r\n\u201cIf only getting bigger didn\u2019t mean getting older.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was strolling around Neverland when he found Tinkerbell. \u201cHey Tink, what you got there?\u201d She had some Pixie Dust for his as he was running low. He thought about what Hook said before showing a smile as he accepted the dust.<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Pixie Dust young man?\u201d Peter and Tink turned to see a flower. \u201cI\u2019d LOVE Pixie Dust! It feels SO nice in my roots.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you use it like fertilizer?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you could say that. Do you mind?\u201d Tink looked at Peter with a stubborn look on her face. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. How rude of me. I\u2019d introduce myself if I had a name. Besides that, it\u2019s also rude not to give something to YOU in exchange! Is there something you\u2019d like?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless you had something to make me bigge without getting older.\u201d Peter said to himself, not realizing it was out loud.<br>\r\n\u201cIs THAT all? Here!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What is that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a... fertilizer dust of sorts. Plants in the forest and jungle use it more often to grow big and tall. Would it be all right to exchange all this for a little Pixie Dust? I just love the floaty feeling I get when I use it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDeal!\u201d Peter grabbed the, the, ..., Grow Dust! Yeah. And let the flower get a, a, ... \u201cPetal\u201d full of Pixie Dust. \u201cThanks Dusty!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank YOU! Wait. I don\u2019t have a name. I guess I do now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me that look Tink. I already feel bad about using as much dust from you as I have. If this works, I might not have use it AS often.\u201d Peter then grabbed some of the grow dust from the pack and sprinkled it on himself as would with Pixie Dust. He felt a small tingle. His shirt felt a little tighter, but nothing else seemed to change. (The dust grows his clothes with him)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stanford and Stanley were waiting for Mabel and Dipper in the hall, expecting them to open the door in any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a while since the last time they saw them (almost 7 years!), after the Cypher's battle and defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, the two old men had traveled around the world, had too many adventures to be summed up here and their damaged fraternal bonds got reinforced... but they never forgot about their two kids, they began to miss them more and more like they were their own. That's the reason why when they received Dipper's email asking them to spent some time with them, they abandon their supernatural project in the Amazonas and got the first plane to Gravity Falls to get ready everything to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old shark required a quite a lot of maintenance before being habitable again after 7 years of abandonment, but the two uncles repaired, cleaned and drive plagues away as much as the original structure allowed, until it became as liveable as 7 years ago (in other words, <i>barely liveable</i>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the only remaining task was to wait for their guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tlin*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang. A beautiful girl with gorgeous and dense brown hair, sparkling eyes and a smile that didn't feel ashamed to show her braces went in and jumped to their arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grunkle Stan! Uncle Ford!\"<br>\r\n\"Mabel! You has grown into a beautiful fine lady!\"<br>\r\n\"And look who comes with me: Waffles!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 350Kg (770Lbs) pink pig came to her and start to lick-kiss her rosy cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expected (hoped) that pig would have ended up bacon years ago...\" Stan grumbled, but his brother made him stop.<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be that bitter the first day with the kids. Pigs are wonderful pets.\"<br>\r\n\"Then I hope you don't mind to clean the wonderful pet's gifts he leaves over the carpet...\" He said with a malicious smile. And then it turned into a more innocent smile as he talked to Mabel.<br>\r\n\"Didn't you bring your luggage? And your brother?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I gave all of it to Dipper... here he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big dark figure appeared in front of the opened door, covering it with his frame, darkening the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard an \"ouch\" when his forehead hit the top of the door-frame. He had to duck to go in... and twist his body, because of his broad shoulders and the big travel bags he was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Di... Dipper?\"<br>\r\n\"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen left Mabel's heavy handbags and his own backpack on the floor and said hello to his surprised uncles.<br>\r\nHe towered over the two uncles, a head and a half taller. When he hugged them, the uncles felt like their roles had been exchanged and now they were the kids and he the adult uncle. A stupid impression they tried to forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you... Wow. You really have changed, kid.\" Stan commented, getting his shit together, and friendly placing his hand over his nephew's broad shoulder.<br>\r\n\"You have grown into a fine man too!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Dipper said, a little uncomfortable by the attention. He never got used to it at home as he grew taller and taller...<br>\r\n\"And strong as a bull! Thanks to him I can bring half of my room in bags during my travels!\" Mabel said as she dragged with great difficulty one of her 25Kg huge bags to the guests room, leaving the three men alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed silent for a moment. The old men were still getting over the surprise. They watched Dipper's body in detail, the still childish face with messy hair placed over that large body... his very broad shoulders with quite narrow waist, thick muscular arms and legs, clown feet and, as much the slightly undersized orange t-shirt allowed them to observe, had some good pecs and abs under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big are you, kid?\"<br>\r\n\"I was 211cm (6'11\") tall last month.\" He pronounced the last 2 words with a little extra emphasis. The previous month he had to measure himself to order online some clothes, but after 4 weeks it started to feel a little too tight, so he guessed he was taller again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was a tired to answer that question to every familiar, friend and even stranger he met... something unavoidable for people that tall... but he had to talk more about his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the reason I wanted to see you, Uncle Ford.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's normal. There's no one as tall as me in our family.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, even so, sometimes when the genes lines up, a tall boy is born in a short family.\" Stanley played it down. His brother took a more serious and scientific approach...<br>\r\n\"Did you have a medical check-up?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, and they didn't find anything wrong... but...\" The kid felt a little unsure and scared \"I think they're wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took some photos and a height chart he had been elaborating since he noticed something was wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just after leaving Gravity Falls I had a 5cm (2\") growth spurt. Nothing too alarming, I remember I was pretty happy to be the alpha twin at least... I got a few cm more after that and at the end of the school year, months after becoming fourteen, I was roughly 159cm (5'3\").\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe showed them a photo of her sister and him happy, he was almost half a head taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not an unusual height for a 14yo boy. Maybe a little on the short side...\" Ford pointed out.<br>\r\n\"Yes, because I was a shrimp to begin with... but the next year... bang! I got a 10cm growth spurt. And after that another 5cm during Spring, I ended up 174cm (5'9\") tall at the end of summer, more or less as tall as you, when I turned fifteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother photograph, both Mabel and Dipper looked older, probably Mabel had grown taller as well but she couldn't match the speed he was growing, so the height difference had increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next year was strange, I had smaller, less noticeable growth spurts, each one less than 5cm, but more numerous too, and before I realized I was almost 200cm (6'7\") tall and the school basketball and volleyball teams wanted me to join...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next pic there was a 196cm (6'5\") tall Dipper in the beach wearing a blue swimming trunks which looked small on his long body. He also looked less lankly, kinda buffer, than in the previous photo: His pectorals weren't completely plain anymore and had like 2cm (1\") of thickness. His arms seemed a little thicker, but he still was pretty much abs-less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he had developed a considerable bulge on his crotch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between my 16s and 17s, I barely grew a centimeter, but again have to renew my wardrobe every quarter as I started to pack muscle like crazy, even without exercising. I eventually ended up signing on the basketball team, although the football and wrestling clubs also wanted me in. There was another thing that grew even faster during that time... my... ehh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper, blushing, couldn't bring himself to explain about those private growth spurts. They were enough to drive all the interested girls away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the third year school year, my last year, I was happy because I hadn't any kind of growth during the first months... but on April-May I had this huge 15cm (6\") growth spurt and pack lbs and lbs of muscle every week until I were at the verge of being a 7 bulky footer. And I know it isn't over... my growing pains are getting worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exposition left his uncles speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"It started when I left Gravity Falls... So I bet something here is the culprit of my crazy growth.\" Dipper concluded.<br>\r\n\"Well... I can do some checks.\" Ford finally said something. \"I'm a top biologist, physicist and engineer. If there's something natural or supernatural in your growth, I'll find it.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, uncle.\" The boy said moved as he hugged him again.<br>\r\n\"And I'll help you in any way I can...\" Stanley added. \"(Although I don't know how)\" He thought unconvinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFord guide his nephew to his underground lab while Stanley tried to grab Mabel's second huge travelbag to their room, but he only get his back hurt. The fact the kid could easily move with three like that bags and its own muscle mass didn't help his self-esteem.</span></div></div>",

Plopplopplop....*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white substance was manifesting from nothing in the air above a small bed of nestled around tropical flora. Each bit of vanilla goop dropping into the water, slowly merging with the other white drops on the aquas surface. The last *Plop* bringing forth the final drop of plain sludge, two little black oval shaped dots attached. It slowly came in contact with the rest as it merged into a small ball shape small enough to fit a childs palm. The oval dots moved across the goo before blinking, eyes staring piercing intent straight into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have stayed there for weeks, looking above awaiting the great comet in thr sky, were it not for the rustling of leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing apart tropical plants, a boy with shaved sides and a ponytail. \"Sweet! I found water!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already unmoving creature froze in place, not even a blink escaping as the kid before him began scrounging up water into bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah so lucky! Toph went around drinking all the water and I saw no fruits near.\" The blind girl had been woth them when the group was togrther, splitting up to get resources and find info due to a nearby heavy blockade of Fire Nation ships to signal the rest of the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was happily scooping up more, Sokka saw the white ball floating upon it. Reaching out to grab the ball, Sokka brought it out of the later. Eyeing it suspiciously as it remained motionless. He then got a whiff of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck!\" He grabbed his nose and pulled back. The smell was positively rancid. \"Whatever this is smells disgisting. Can't believe the only freshwater is contaminated by this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka carelessly tossed the thing behind him, hitting a tree a few feet away witha heavy *SPLAT*. The being made a nice goopy mess across it as it slie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching an arm, Sokka grinned cockily. \"I'll have Aang and Zuko work overtime boiling this so I don't get sick!\" He scooped up several more cupfuls before comlleting his work. Standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, the white slime was now looking at him, its oval eyes turned as it fumed at its treatment. The mess began to move towards each other, reforming itself back into a ball with trails of slime sticking it to the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly it began to make a cavern beneath its eyes, opening up to give form to a mouth whilst tendril stretched out of its body. Then it gave a mighty *GULP* as it put as much air inside itself before releasing its voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"_________!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, static, undecipherable echo screamed out, causing Sokka to cover his ears in pain. Its tendril was growing a ball shape as it began to twirl its tentacle around and round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck's that!? Sokka zipped around as he tried to find the source, moving too fast as he tried to locate it before finally turning just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty *THWACK* it released the ball directly for Sokka's face. The goo splattering all over his eyes, nose, and mouth. Some getting inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmff! Gezmf omf emmm!\" He tried to speak, only getting more down his thorat as he peeled at it. The stuff stickier than the ball he held snd fighting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball, agitated by the boy, made another tendril as it stretched it impossibly far to attach to a tree. It detached from the current one as it began swinging from tree fto tree to find a place to rest. Thirty minutes passed before it reached the edge, asome ten mnutes off from the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it just found more of the creatures that angered it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy with a scar across the side of his face was sitting beside one with short hair and the markings of a tattoo they covered. The ball landed with a small *Thud* beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" The scarred boy, Zuko wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...?\"The other, Aang, loooked inqusitively as he moved to touch it, poking his finger through one of its eyes. In that moment he felt a great and poowerful energy flowing within in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little guy is a spirit-\" In a *FLASH* Aang dodged a ball of slime as it aimed for his face, its tentacles ready as it prepared one to toss at Zuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Zuko dodged the one aimed for him as it began to slide across the ground, eyes fixed in place as it began tossing more orbs of slime at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you shouldn't have touched it!\" Zuko unleashed a torrent of fire that dried out the sludge and made them collapse to the ground as the fire slowed their momentum. Crumbling at it did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked harmless! Even-\" Aang used airbending to blow away three, tossing them into the woods. \"Most spirits don't get volatile so easily unless angered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it clicked as their third companion had been in the same direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTakjng a moment to sigh and Aang slap his head, a bit of the substance had now hit them both. Aang on his neck and Zuko's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It got a hit in!\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing major at least. Lets deal with it-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith its targets now locked and retribution payed, it quickly bounced its way back into the trees faster than they could follow, going a different path than it appeared from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here!\" Zuko was about to follow before he was stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang stood there shaking his head \"Sokka probably needs our help! Let's get him out of the mess he made first.\" Pointing to the woods Zuko nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Afterwards we have find it. We don't know how long we'll stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. An angry spirit can be trouble so we best pacify it peacefully\" The two began to head into the forest, not noticing the slime on them was slowly slithering up towards their mouths.</span></div></div>",

It's weight pressing into the earth, compressing the very land beneath its feet into permanent massive foot-shaped valleys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeach City, home of the Crystal Gems, was hundreds of miles far from this goliath. Yet its shadow darkened the night of the town even more due to its sheer size!

Her mouth agape as she started running for Beach House. Not even Pearl or Amethysr crossing her mind in her panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Steven. I know how we can prevent the worst case scenario!\" She spoke aloud to herself. The future she saw could be altered, but a growing figure was shown to be predetermined in every possible future..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Beach House====<br>\r\n\"C-come on!\" Steven Universe was strugglimg with his jeans. The zipper wouldn't *zip* together and stay no matter how much he struggled. His curly black hair shone with water after finishing a recent bath. Putting his clothes back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell trying to anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" Steven was frustrated as he stopped, not letting his anger boil over that his powers go berserk that he starts glowing pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the third pair this week!\" the jeans, snug and tighf on his thighs, showed a surprising amount of bulging mass beneath, the cuff of his jeans riding up several inches of where theh normally resided to show a bit of his thickened calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just these accursed jeans either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis toes and feet had grown considerably bigger than his sandals, to the point he could squeeze them between the strap being nothing more than a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't evee gotten started on his shirt OR jacket!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jacket now only came down to his belly button, the sleeves riding up his arms to show his thickened triceps that throbbed uncontrollably beneath with the smallest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis black shirt with a gold star was even smaller! It only covered a little of his newly grown 4 pack abs. He moved a hand to feel his lower and, skin bare from his clothes not fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing has been going right for me all lately!\" Steven grumbled as his troubles have worsened in the future. \"Just what else could go wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to know, finally giving up on his clothes to toss them all aside. A few *RIP* and *TEAR* happening as he did so. That had happened the last few times as well. Elegantly he swiped his towel, wrapping it around himself to calm down and analyze his ruined clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just why are my clothes shrinking?\" the normally shirt Steven Universe had yet to realize what was going on.

I'm moving to Florida.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...A nightmare based on what happened a few days ago. The last time he saw Connie.<br>\r\nThe Steven from the past, who had walked her girlfriend to the bus station, opened his eyes wide-open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a little bit too dramatic, Connie? That aerospace summer course you're taking only lasts a month and a half... right?\"<br>\r\n\"The course, yes... but a week ago I received an admission letter from the same academy\u2026\u201d Connie couldn\u2019t break the bad news until then\u201c...telling me I was selected for a full scholarship that covers all high school years. Getting a top notch education, being trained by actual NASA members, with I chance to be selected to work with them\u2026 I couldn\u2019t say no. It\u2019s my dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no\u2026 I mean, that\u2019s great!\u201d Steven lied, trying to maintain a false smile \u201cAnd you\u2019ll return each holiday, so...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents will move to Florida too, so I don\u2019t think I could visit Beach city before I get a driving license\u2026 and even then, I would rarely have time with so many extracurricular activities.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I still can visit you anytime using Lion! Right, Lion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis oversized cat, uninterested by his proposition, walk away without looking at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll do it if I give him one steak or...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to visit me!\u201d Connie yelled it. The face of Steven filled with pain. The girl regretted the wording immediately. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean\u2026 What I want to say is\u2026 do you remember the ruckus you caused when you brought Lion to my previous course? Everyone panicked. I got expelled! We can\u2019t repeat that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen\u2026 what is going to happen\u2026 to us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie hated to each word he was about to say, but she couldn\u2019t find another solution\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been officially together for over a month\u2026 and it has been the sweetest experience of my life\u2026 you\u2019re the sweetest, most charming boyfriend anyone could get! But...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA relationship comes with responsibilities with each other, responsibilities I can\u2019t fulfill\u2026 and I don\u2019t want to tie you to this and force you to wait years\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho felt more pain that day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to break up.\u201d Connie finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but\u2026 \u2026 mm\u2026 ...o-ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven never was good at hiding his emotions. Connie wanted to comfort his (now) best friend, but just then the NASA bus arrived and all the students had to enter. Two classmates of Connie, Sasha and Marcy, \u2018kinda friends\u2019, clung to her and forced her to walk forward as they said banalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you doing with that boy?\u201d Sasha asked interested.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2026 just being the worst and short lived girlfriend ever...\u201d Connie confessed, ashamed.<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you were that squirt\u2019s girlfriend? But that rugrat must be in elementary school or something!\u201d Sasha exclaimed loud enough to be heard by everyone, including Steven, who blushed in shame.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s older than me\u2026 he\u2019s 16!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?? But you\u2019re A BIT TALLER THAN HIM! What a dwarf!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSasha!!\u201d Connie protested, horrified by her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal world: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 mmmh! ...a dwarf\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Steven was reliving that memory in his dreams, the angst had activated his gem, who started to sparkle with pink. His legs started to stretch longer, beyond the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u2019m not...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDream world / Memory:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could have choose better\u2026 I mean, look at him, he\u2019s not just short, it\u2019s also fat like a toad!\u201d Marcy continued Steven\u2019s mortification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal world: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnnnno...\u201d He mumbled as his body bloated, but with muscle instead of fat, almost doubling the girth of all his extremities and trunk in a matter of seconds. He looked like Steg, but without the body hair nor the extra limbs. And it hadn\u2019t ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem\u2019s glow grew more intense, shining veins appear around it, sending the order of growth to Steven\u2019s organic body, along with all the supernatural energy to make it possible. And so the boy kept growing lengthwise and across at a more stable pace. Soon his knees were hanging at the end of the bed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDream world / Memory:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at him, isn\u2019t he crying? Are you sure he\u2019s not a baby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal world: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not... a baby...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis growth accelerated. He had surpassed Rose Quartz\u2019s height and getting close to Pink Diamond. In terms of bulk, the same. He looked like a bodybuilder, if there was 8 feet tall (240cm) bodybuilders. His pecs were like big hills, and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDream world / Memory:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet a tiny baby like him also has a tiny baby di--\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSASHA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======================== <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal world:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo... It isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Steven was talking in dreams when his thick big body (at this point as tall as Pink, with as much body outside the bed as was on it) started to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the towel that covered his waist, something started to shine in pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gem sent growth energy to his genitals in pulses. The tissues started to multiply, millions of new nerve endings were created in an orgasmic sensation, igniting an erection. His thing, who during the previous days had gone from \u201csmall\u201d to \u201cover the average\u201d, started to rise, sweeping the towel among with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n21cm\u2026 (8\u201d) 24cm\u2026  27cm\u2026 30cm\u2026 (a whole foot)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...it isn\u2019t tiny\u2026 mmmmmm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulsating, the cock grew 5cm (2\u201d) more, and then other extra 5cm. The friction against the cloth that covered it felt so good it began to release impressive amounts of white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s big. I\u2019M BIG.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n50cm 60cm 70cm 90cm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his body resumed the growth. The TV and furniture were pushed by his growing limbs. The bed broke. And meanwhile, his colossal dick, which hadn\u2019t stop growing, bent forward his pecs, resting between the two hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a baby, I\u2019M A MAN\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his mind, Steven\u2019s nightmare had changed its course: Steven began growing as quick as in real life, casting a shadow over the bus and all the scared students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m big enough for you, Connie?\u201d The hung-up teen asked her sincerely, hoping his childful appearance was the only cause for their break-up. It wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie screamed, like an actress would do in an old scary movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock was enough to awake him on a busted mattress, surrounded by broken furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, man, Lion must have been playing in my bedroom and made this mess.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had shrunk to a more normal height, somehow, although he was 30cm (1\u2019) taller than before the crazy dream. He wasn\u2019t aware of it, despite the considerable gains and the higher point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid dream\u2026 that never happened.\u201d He muttered as he tidied the room naked. Once he had fixed everything with his saliva, he tried to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes were even tighter than the day before, the only things he could put on was some long, baggy knee-length basketball pants which now looked like tiny, skintight boxers, and a sleeveless t-shirt turned into a top on his longer, broader upper-body. On the list of the most feminine outfits Steven had worn, it  was at least the third one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to do something with these shrinking clothes\u2026 I\u2019ll have to check the drier. But first, I have to get new decent ones. Maybe I should go see Dad and ask him some money\u2026 or stop at Peedee\u2019s and get some fries\u2026 although I shouldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to get fatter...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, those cruel girls\u2019 words had taken root on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hybrid gen got out and used his powers to moonjump towards Beachcity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later Garnet, who had just seen the terrible premonition, bursted into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven, you\u2019re going to lose the control of your powers! Whatever you do, don\u2019t go to the city!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was too late.</span></div></div>",

It had a lid on, but it was bubbling so much, the lid kept moving.

Harry touched them, as though unsure they were his. He jumped when he saw the size of his hands. They had grown as well. So had his arms. He looked at them and saw more of his wrist poking out of his sleeve and his forearm getting thicker. He lifted his arm and saw his biceps bulge up, straining his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRon\u201d Harry breathed. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt gets better\u201d smiled Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Harry couldn\u2019t think how this could get any better. His thighs were growing, filling his trousers and so were his calves. But then, suddenly Harry felt really aroused. His cock started tingling. He put one hand over it and then quickly pulled it away when he felt it twitch. It was growing. He could feel it getting longer, making a bump appear at his crotch. Harry looked down over his still growing chest as his cock filled his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The growth slowly stopped, leaving Harry Potter covered in huge muscles. His cloths were tight and they showed of how defined his body was. Ron watched as Harry turned, looking at his new body. Harry looked behind him, at his broad back and his round bubble butt. It looked so tight and firm in his school trousers. He turned back to the front and rubbed his cock bulge slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis is great\u201d he said, feeling the weight of his new cock and balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Harry looked at Ron and realised he\u2019d not only grown muscles, but he\u2019d grown taller too. Harry was used to having to look up to Ron, but now, Ron had to look up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat are you going to do with that new body?\u201d asked Ron.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harry throws off the lid, sticks his head in the cauldron and starts drinking from it like a dog. After he'd taken a few gulps, he realized what he'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ron?\" he gasped, pulling his head out of the cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ron was leant against the wall, rubbing his head. When Harry rushed towards him, he pushed himself aginst the wall, trying to get away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh God Ron I'm sorry\" Harry said. \"I just lost control.

Harry tried to bring his hand to his head, but the sleeve of his robe wouldn't allow it. The material was stretched to the limit. Harry tensed his arms and his biceps popped out, splitting his sleeve like it was tissue paper. Harry smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh-oh\" breathed Ron, seeing the wicked grin spread across Harry's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Harry stood to his full height, towering a good foot and a half above Ron, and started admiring his still growing body. His pecs were staring against his shirt, the buttons trying to keep it together. Harry breathed in and his buttons popped off. He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The remains of his robe were struggling to stay on, the bottom of his robe fluttering just under his well rounded backside.His broadening back finally proved too much. His robe split down the middle and flutter to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm massive\" Harry cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He ripped the rest of his shirt off, revealing his well muscled torso. His shoes had already burst open and his trousers had started splitting at the seems, his mega thighs pushing them apart. Harry bent to tear them off, causing them to split at the back. He laughed madly as he grabbed them by the waist and pulled them apart, leaving Harry in only a very tight pair of boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ron could do nothing but watch as his best friend continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look am me Ron\" said Harry. \"I'm the biggest man in the\"-BANG-\"Ow! I bit my tounge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ron looked up to see that Harry's growth had brought him to the ceiling, his black flattened between his head and the ceiling. His glasses were hanging by one of his ears, looking tiny on his over grown head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh my God Ron\" cried Harry, panic in his voice not pride. \"Look at me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Harry had to curve himself to stop from growing through the ceiling to the floor above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ron what do I do?\" Harry begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sit down\" cried Ron, \"it'll give us more time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Harry lowered himself to the ground, his bulging boxers swinging between his open legs. When he was sat, he stretched his legs out, knocking desk to one side or crushing them. Ron pressed himself closer to the wall as legs thicker than his whole body plowed past him. He ducked under Harry's knee and stood between his giant friends legs, unable to tear his gaze away from Harry's boxers. The material was starting to loose the battle, already holes had started appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ron, I'm up here\" said Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ron shook his head and looked up to Harry's face. \"Sorry\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Harry's growth had seemed to have stopped. His massive round shoulders were pushing against the walls and his hair was brushing the ceiling. Ron could see the peaks of Harry's biceps, pressed between his legs and the wall. Suddenly a movement caught his eyes. He looked down and saw Harry's tattered boxers were twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Harry?\" asked Ron. \"Are you growing again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not all of me\" said Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ron looked up at Harry and saw his cheeks were bright read. Before Ron could say anything, there was a loud ripping sound, and something thick and meaty smacked him back. Ron stumbled and saw a cock bigger than him pointing straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Bloody hell\" Ron breathed. \"Do you find this hot Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... I didn't use to\" stuttered Harry. \"But it's just I'm so big and strong (he flexed his pecs) I couldn't help it\"</span></div></div>",

Harry goaded Ron into having another swig of the potion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the now smaller vial in his hands he took another quick swig of the potion. The effects where just as immediate as the previous time. His pecs filled with mass and strained even further, rips and tears filling the air as more ginger muscle ballooned outward. His sleeves ripping apart as his biceps burst through them, back growing wider and thicker as he surged higher and higher, slowly approaching the ceiling. His feet ripped apart his shoes, then socks as his feet spread over the floor boards. Finally with a loud RIIIIIPPP his shirt has lost the battle and exploded off his, revealing all the thick and bulging muscles that continued to swell and swell. Ron couldn't resist running a hand over his gorged pecs, feeling how thick and meaty they had become. Finally the grow slowed down, with his head just shy of the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was speechless as he gazed over his now massive and beefy best friend. Eyes drinking in the thickness and power that flowed through Ron, his mind clearly some where else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, mate.....you all right there.....unnngghhh\" he groaned as he felt the grow kicking in to the only place untouched. Ron felt a stirring in his briefs flowing by a growing horniness.

Finally a swift RIP resounded as his briefs exploded off his body. His cock had already started chubbing up, even though is it was well past the 14\" mark, his balls had swollen to the size of oranges and churned with his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt a blush creep over his face, gazing at his best mate's manhood reaching full mast.

And his magic powers weren't the only thing growing: After a month holding the Rah's Orb, his small scrawny sorcerer body had turned into a 10ft tall, muscular one, stronger than Superman's or Lobo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explains why a battalion of the best Green Lanterns weren't able to stop him, despite getting more and more reinforcements every day... his power was increasing faster than their numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't make him invincible: He turned overconfident, let his enemies assemble his forces believing they couldn't do him any harm... and when they proved to be more dangerous enemies than he expected, he felt overwhelmed and used his most destructive spells against the corps... but he hadn't calculate how strong the spells had become after his powerups... the explosion that killed half green lantern forces also reached the villain, destroying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green survivors informed the guardians about his demise, believing the dangerous objects had also being atomized in the explosion... but it wasn't true.<br>\r\nThe spell had only propelled the artifacts to outer space, loaded with magic from the spell and green energy from the lanterns. They plowed through the stars, adrift, until they impacted against a strange magenta meteor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts color was due to its main component, pink kryptonite... a benign kind of kryptonite Superman hadn't had '<i>the pleasure</i>' to meet yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the magic objects became irradiated by this kryptonite for all their journey, changing slightly its properties, becoming more affine to the kryptonian biology... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this meteor was heading to Earth, but the JLA satellites detected it on time and Captain Marvel and Martian Manhunter, with the help of several tons of explosives, were able to alter its course to the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know the events they started up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe objects weren't exactly destroyed in the Sun... they melted under its heat with the kryptonite, but at least the Orb was a magic solar object and its power increased with the sunlight... so when it melted, its power was released and propagated across the atoms of the star... the other magic objects and the kryptonite, linked to the orb after their long journey, did the same... and soon some strange pink sun spots started to form on the surface of the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8 minutes later, the magic radiation reached the Earth, but due to the kryptonite's influence, only the last sons of krypton would be affected.</span></div></div>",

He chose to ignore it. When they eventually finished their conversation and left the illuminated by sunlight room, he noticed like his clothes felt tighter than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent another hour on his desk, writing articles more slowly than usual, stopping once in a while to took at Lois' empty desk with sad eyes.<br>\r\nThe kryptonian signed cheerless, and the added volumen of inhaling was enough to make a button of his shirt blew out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constrainting sensation got worse over time, the loosing effect of removing that button disappeared as his muscles expanded, printing their shape under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mr. Kent. Have you being hitting the gym lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gains were too big to go undetected, and Jim Olsen was the first one to notice them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... yes, I've started with a workout routine weeks ago... you know: running, weighs...\" Clark lied. He felt bulkier than usual, but he didn't realiced how abnormal and fast it was. He attributed it to his constant fighting against Mongul, Bizarro and the rest... in other words, Superman's own version of a workout routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, maybe I should accompany you. I wish I could pack some muscle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead flexed his slim arm, but it barely gained any thickness.<br>\r\nClark's were the opposite case, incredible thick despite being extended. If he imitated Jimmy, his sleeves probably wouldn't survive to the experience.<br>\r\nThe superhero hurried to finish that conversation, not only because he wanted his pal to forget about the dangerous idea of training together, also he was beggining to feel funny. It wasn't a disagreeable sensation, it was mostly tingles, specially on his underpants area, and hotness... also he felt more energetic than usual, like his body needed to do something with his growing strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed to the restroom to cool off. He felt a little better, calmer, but that couldn't fix the crampiness of his clothes or the tingled in his private parts.<br>\r\nThe exposure to the solar light that went through the window of that toilet didn't help either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe locked himself up in one of the walled toilet, and once he had some privacy he pulled down his pants.<br>\r\nClark didn't see anything wrong with his cock, maybe it was a little sweaty and bloated than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... I've being so busy lately that I hadn't cared much about my biological necessities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKal-El got it wrong. He thought the increased size of his cock was a partial erection, horniness caused by forced abstinence.<br>\r\nBut although he was indeed horny (an effect of the pink kryptonite?), his cock was completely soft, despite hanging a several centimeters further than usual at 14cm (5.5\")...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was about to change... more sensitive than ever, a mere brush with his fingers was enough to make the phallus shiver with pleasure, starting to fatten up and rise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark couldn't stop it... instead, he felt so overwhelmed with the pleasure than began to masturbate, despite being in the bath of his workplace and could be discovered at any time... but the pink radiation had seemingly reduced his self-control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis penis reacted by growing more and more, pushing the fingers of his huge hands outwards as its head stood up and towers over them. The super-reporter moaned, leaning back his body on the WC, beding his toes rhythmically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow his hard cock managed to gain more centimeters, surpassing the already amazing 20cm (7.8\") pornstar mark and getting closer to the impossible 25cm size (9.8\"). The way it slowly grew felt amazing, even better than the masturbation itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only thing growing: two more buttons flew out while moving his body, his muscles were getting thicker and, as his sleeves and trouser legs seemed to recede as he grew a little taller, exposing some of his wrists and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... MMMMMmh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in his frenzy, he began to masturbate at superspeed, squeezing his steel cock as hard as he could. After another intense minute he was rewarded with the most intense orgasm he had had, followed with an ejaculation that covered one of the inner wall with white (luckily for him, the jet avoided completely his clothes (it would be hard to explain to his coworkers why he was covered in cum).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got back to his senses and cleaned the mess at superspeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me? Has it being so long since I had sex that I lost the control and masturbated in a public toilet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink kryptonite was responsible for his spontaneous lust and part of his growth, but the hero ignored that. He limited to wash his face and hands trying to be presentable again, despite his clothes being a few size too small and smelt to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped he could keep a low profile until he could get home, but when he left the restroom he bumped into his chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kent! I've being looking for you for half an hour! Where were you?\"<br>\r\n\"Umm... sorry, Mr. White, I didn't feel good.\" He tried to make up an excuse, despite after that hand session he felt so good and relaxed it was hard not to smile.<br>\r\n\"Did you finish the article of intergang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*whoosh* Superman's civil identity used again his speed to reach his desk, type the missing pages and flew back to Perry while he was blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mr. White.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proceeded to show him his hurried work. Perry was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his business were finished, the old man gazed at his star reporter and appreciated his shaggier-than-usual looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kent, you've being working a lot since... that happened.\" Perry still couldn't talk about what happened to Lois, neither Clark wanted him to try. \"Everyone here would have understood if you would need some time to recover. I would be no problem to accord some vacations, reducing working hours... but you started working harder than ever.\"<br>\r\n\"I like my job, it helped me during those hard times.\"<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that, but as your boss I want you to take care of yourself, I don't need a burnout reporter, I prefer a healthier one. So why don't you take all those months of vacations you've gathered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a tempting offer, and the reminder that under the facade of hard and strict boss Perry cared about his employees like they were his sons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\"<br>\r\n\"If you're so workaholic I could assign you some low-priority jobs so you could keep yourself busy working at home without overworking. And you could spend more time with your son...\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had being a long, weird day, and Clark couldn't find arguments against a deal so good... so he accepted, and could leave the Planet sooner.<br>\r\nHe was glad he was free to be with Jon now that summer holidays was starting, but also felt scared about having too much free time to think about things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dressed as Superman to fly directly home. The caress of the sunset's light felt so great he flew a little slower to enjoy it.<br>\r\nOnce at home, his son went out to welcome him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad!\"<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jon.\" He said smiling while he petted his messy hair. \"It looks like I'll be on vacations too!\"<br>\r\n\"Cool! We could do a lot of things together this summer! By the way, dad, my clothes looks smaller... I think I had a growth spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had indeed had a big one under the sun... but Clark barely noticed because he had grown almost as much as his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little, but I think the actual problem is just the clothes. I think mine, and probably yours, have shrunk in the washing machine.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Jon felt a little disillusioned.<br>\r\n\"We could take advantage of our free time to go shopping new clothes at the mall.\" The father said after checking his spare clothes has seemingly 'shrunk' too.<br>\r\n\"And later we can go to the new McBurger of the mall!\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, pal, you got enough A and B this school year to get to choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather and son had a healthier dinner at the dinning room. They felt calmer now the sun had set and their bodies had used up most of its magic energy.<br>\r\nBut the sun will always come up again...</span></div></div>",

The sun shone upon its surface as rays unnoticeable save by scientists studying radiation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Justics Leagues Watch Tower orbiting earth likewise remained silent, the radiation deemed harmless by its sensors as it tried to keep track of any microscopic threats. Dawn had already come on this saturday and with it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PING* A button popped off the shirt of the man of steel, Clark Kent, as he sat down a plate of waffles, big hearty omelettes next to chopped fruits amd toast for breakfast with his son, Jon Lane Kent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang. That's the third one this morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman wore a button plaid shirt, the buttons at the top had popped off as he got ready this morning. His shirt only started being constricted as he was cooking breakfast, and as Lois typically handled that he wanted to focus solely on it to prepare the best food for him and his boy. The muscles of the blue eyed man were noticeably bulging beneath his clothes, sleeves riding up his thickened arms as it begged for space. His pecs were so desperate for space they forced the buttons apart. Thankfully he wore some loose pants, giving his thighs and quads more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Guess mine weren't the only ones that shrunk in the wash!\" Smirked the youth as he reached for the huge breakfast his dad prepared, even bigger than the meals of his mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly lanky superboy was chuckling as he picked food off plates with a fast pace. The normally lanky kid was noticeably bigger, his slender arms bulging with small but notcieably growing biceps. Unlike his dad the boy already took his shirt off, his sleek clothes became too tight for him and knew his mom would ground him for carelessly destroying his clothes. Now he was left in some blue pants that were clinging tightly to growing thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this isn't normal buddy.\" Clark chuckled as he ruffled his boys hair before moving to quickly unbutton his shirt. Taking it off, folding it, and setting it down as he moved to sit. A ravenous hunger started hurting his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis massive and wide body was on full display, his imoressive physique taken to greater heights. He moved to grab food he cooked to feed his hunger, keeping control of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're going to Damian's dad after we eating?\" Jon etalked between chewing his omelette and going for some buttered toast to take a bite from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes\" Clark ate his toast in one bite, his mouth visibly big enough to finish it instantly. Chewing in silence before continuing \"Lois will be gone for awhile and we don't need everything to fall into chaos before she gets back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't actually know when she'd be back. An alternate universe version of himself that became a machine, along with the Justice League where they were all Elementals and Golems of several different realities had needed her help. So she was off having an adventure she'll be happily writing about once she gets back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think if I get too big I can't attend school with Damian?\" Jon slurped up fruits as he flexed off to look intimidating. Failing hard in the process despite his new mass. Even his newly visible set of abs was only starting to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruce and the rest will solve it before that happens.\" Clark confidently prided his boy to believe in his superfriends. \"It'll be hard to keep our identities if it doesn't otherwise. Just imagine me trying to speak to Jimmy only for him to be completely invisible beneath my chest!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet if I keep growing Damian will be jealous I'm not only taller but wider than he'll ever be!\" Jon amused himself at the thought of grouchy and older Damian being forced to ride on him as he fies, so wide the boy wonder could easily hand on his shoulders while grumbling about it. Superboy grabbed half the waffles, dumping loadso f syrpu on it before eating it all as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful Jon. Eat that fast and you might bite your tongue.\" His father warned for concern, taking the other batch of waffles to eat at a slower pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither father nor son had noticed their increase in height. Only a small increase of two inches(5 cm) at this point, but who knows how things shall go for both, especially as their clothes continued to tighten as they grew thicker and wider as they finished breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp....sorry dad.\" Jon rubbed his bloated stomach, noticeably bulging out. \"That was pretty good. Almost as good as moms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit I did not expect to eat so much.\" Though he had eaten even more than his kid, the man of steel stomach digested it as soon as he consumed it. His perfect cobblestones on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hurry.\" Father and son zipped in a *FLASH* as they vanished and returned dressed in their costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe notcieable muscle, each one on display in incredibly tight clothes that rode up their calves, abs, and arms. Save for Jons belly being too big and even the hem of his shirt had rode halfway up it. Otherwise every nook and cranny of their growth visible for all to be enthralled by. Jon wanted to feel every one of his muscles, but held back till he can tease Damian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off to Damians!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another *FLASH* the two were gone and zipping across the sky as they head for Wayne Manor. The two moving faster than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Meanwhile at the Secret Sanctuary=====<br>\r\n\"This is super embarrassing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperboy, aka Conner Kent, clone of Lex Luthor and Clark Kent, was sitting in the Secret Sanctuary. His clothes were completely shredded. Tattered shirt cloth and pants were sprayed all across the floor next to a table. Wrappers and empty bags of were empty across the table. Every scrape of food, even sauces, all gone as the stubbled face of Conner towered next to a table. Easily now Supermans normal height of 6'3 (191 cm) and wider with beefy mass than Supes ever been. His stomach stretched out comically in front of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Urp*...this feels...aweful. *Urp*.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner was consumed with ravenous hunger, his speedy friend Impulse watching his beefy body and him groaning for food not longer after they woke up. Begging the speedster to get him nourishment, he came back woth a ton of food, giddy as he saw Conner devour it all and begged for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone rubbed his belly as Impulse, Bart Allen, zoomed back with a *FLASH* with more bags of take out were put before him in a flash. Conner nodding with a smile to his friend as he reached for the nearest bag, opening the wrapper and taking a bite of a sandwich. Soon followed by a second. Then a third. Then a fourth. Followed by fries, nuggets, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just keep getting bigger! Is this the influence of kryptonite!? You got exposed to some funky radiation or magic!?\" Impulse aggresively asked before Conner could reply, poking his friends bloated belly who groaned from the contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly zipping off with a *FLASH*, Impulse quickly leaving and returning with more food. \"You've got a bottomless appetite man!\" Bart smirked as he placed more food before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...*URP*...know\" He reluctantly sighed in frustration. Impulse was happily pressing his left hand into the bloated orb, earning more groans while his right was moving lightning fast to massage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So cool! Tim's gonna love this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when thry hearded a quiet *Zoom* as the door opened for Tim to see his friends. The teen stared awkwardly as he saw a nearly naked Superboy with hulk physique and a giant air balloon inflating from his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what is this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpulse zoomed over, grabbing Tims hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! It's weird! It's cool! I gotta get him more food! Can you massage his belly!? I gotta go the pizza I ordered should be done!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tim could even reply Impulse was off again. Looking at Conner as he walked over slowly, softly, lovingly, placing a hand on the stomach to a deep *GROAN* as he began to move back and forth to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna call Batman, Conner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Urp*...thanks Tim. This.*URP*..is the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back!\" Impulse happily came back with a number of pizzas. \"I dropped a couple but these should work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpulse went to work, pulling out a cheesy pizza with toppings as he held it before Conner. His head moving up to take a bite. Tim pulled out a phone to call Batman for aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bruce. I got a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it Conner Kent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll assume this is affecting Clark and Jon as well?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Correct. I'll have you transported to the Watch Tower with them. Anyone else there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bart. Bruce transport the nearby food as well, Conner has an insatiable craving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon light enveloped them as all three and half a dozen pizzas were on the Watch Tower...</span></div></div>",

He removed his green eyemask as he left the batmovil, but Batman didn't felt like removing his hood, nor keeping eye contact.<br>\r\nAnd he didn't need doing it to continuing lecturing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were unable to stop one of scarecrow's henchmen and escaped. Your aim with the batarang was awful.\"<br>\r\n\"But I succeeded in capturing the other 20 and help you with scarecrow! I bet the fugitive is just a mere thug, nobody important...\"<br>\r\n\"ALL THE DELINQUENTS ARE IMPORTANT. ONE FREE THUG OF TWENTY IS ONE TOO MANY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in hours, Batman faced Robin, with a piercing eye contact and all.<br>\r\nHis tensed 6' 2\" (188cm) muscular body stood at mere centimeters of the slimmer 5'6\" (167cm) boy, making Tim to back a little.<br>\r\nTim didn't know if he was trying to intimidate him like he usually does with the rest of the villains or was only grumpy... but that was the effect he was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim lost his voice, and Bruce grew tired of waiting for a new excuse and went to his study, but not before telling him to do a complete session of heavy exercises before dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Bruce...\" Tim said as he started with with 20lbs weights. was getting sick of this darker and grouchy version of Batman Bruce had turned into during the last year. \"He thinks he's so great and everyone else are rookies... I wish I could teach him a lesson or two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sweat had wet his t-shirt to the point he was starting to feel cold. He removed it and got a glimpsed of his body on a nearby mirror: he had a handsome body, with more definition that most kids from his age, nice but thin pectorals and the shade of a 6-pack on his abdomen... but he was still far from Batman and his bodybuilder build. Or most superheroes (for some reason, almost all supers were 6' /180cm and taller). \"Damn, even the superhero women are usually taller than me. I hate being short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got lost in his dispiriting thoughts until the clock's strokes awakened him. He couldn't believe it was so late, and he was been doing exercise for so long.<br>\r\nHe felt tired and his muscles was aching, but also felt a pleasant sensation all over his trained muscles. Also felt like his muscles were slightly bigger, but he just attributed it to the usual toning up effect of a good workout session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, their butler found the 18 year old boy emptying the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Alfred, but after all the effort of the mission and the training I got really hungry.\"<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say sorry for the appetite of a teenager, master Tim. After all, I've alredy served 5 generations of Robins.\" The english man said as he picked some rests of food that had fallen to the floor. \"You can always call me to prepare you something. Or pick it up.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wouldn't like to bother you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the butler stopping moving for an instant, noticing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Tim, I believe your training is starting to yield results. Your uniform is becoming a little too short for you, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right. The Robin suit he was wearing (without the mask) didn't cover half of his ankles and wrists. The boy smiled, realizing the eyes of Alfred weren't as high as usual, he must had gained 5cm (2\") in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your suit still comfortable?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it feels a little constricting in the shoulder area.\" Tim said while rotating one arm.<br>\r\n\"You can't go to fight crime in a suit that doesn't adapt to your body. Fortunately, I think Master Bruce prepared a few bigger spare uniforms just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked down to the batcave and pushed a button to get that suit. Tim made a face of disgust when he saw it was a bigger version of the original Robin suit, the one without trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to continue with my old uniform until I outgrow it or until I convince Bruce the perks of trousers.\" He said mockingly, believing this growth spurt was a miracle wasn't going to repeat...<br>\r\n\"...\" ...Whereas Alfred didn't say anything. As the butler of the Wayne family since decades, he wasn't allowed to comment Bruce's strange fetishes, like making boys fight criminals in green shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing else remarkable happened that day.</span></div></div>",

Who...the hell was that?\" A second voice called out as his eyes opened instantly from the noise. Only to see nothing but pitch black Darkness. His arms and legs tightened in place as he attempted to move, staying tight despite his best attempts to shift about and get loose. Chilly air on his bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I've been tied up <i>and</i> I have to hear J-Red Hoods voice.\" The boyish tone and childish antagonism gave away the second individuals identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hearing the boy wonders voice alone makes whatever torture about to be inflicted far worse\" The third voice, Jason Todd, also known as the Red Hood, called back. The boy he replied too gritting teeth as the older man moved with what little freedom given to see if any of his knives for cutting loose remained. <i>\"Thorough bastards. Sans my mask the rest of my clothes have been changed.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you.\" Damien Wayne, the current Boy Wonder, proclaimed in a bratty tone as he turned his head in the direction opposite of the voice. Arms attempting to get out of restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! Now is not the time to pick fights <i>Robin</i>\" A fourth voice chastised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nightwing.\" Damien knew that responsible trying to be the adult-in-the-room as soon as he heard it. Having been robin to him for a time when he was Batman during his fathers disappearance. Richard Grayson, also known as Dick and Nightwing. The first Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They snatched me all the way from Metropolis!\" A fifth voice spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red Robin.\" Nightwing listened as he heard the third robin. \"You remember where you were last?\" Damian was clearly annoyed blowing raspberries at Tim, but the two ignored the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was with Superboy and Impulse. The three of us were tracking down the blood of the Gods as Captain Marvel/Shazam asked us too, he was dealing with Black Adam at the time. After we got there...I-don't remember.\" Tim contemplated, eyebrows furrowed as he tried to recall an empty darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully your friends are okay Red.\" Nightwing consoled, wanting to reach out even if there weren't any way to do so with strapped down limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was with Arsenal and Artemis. The three of us had tracked down a large supply of venom shipped to Gotham. Arsenal was knocked out and I reached for him. Then I got my head slammed into a wall.\" Jason spoke up, having reached the conclusion that it might be related.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing it himself, Nightwing replied \"Me and-\" <br>\r\n\"<i>I</i> was forced to take my babysitter Nightwing with me to Metropolis by fa-Batman.\" Robin interrupted, daggers from Dicks piercing eyes looking in his direction, even as the blindfolds beneath the mask kept him from seeing the youngest Robin. \"I'm not allowed to hang out with <i>my Superboy</i> by myself apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Because you stole a car and took Superboy for a ride in it last time</i>.\" Three voices chimed in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Grumbled Damian. \"Then there was a car crash on the wsy there.  While me and Nightwing escaped the limo the truck that rammed into us had loads of kryptonite in the back. Then I got some weird nast spray in my face. Smelled awful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So we all got taken out by targets that were related....\" </i>Nightwing and Tim thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt as one of the worlds greatest detectives sidekicks, you've all already figured out all three were connected yes?\" The first voice, the one behind this, called out from a speaker in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard you're voice before bastard! Arsenal and Artemis better be okay or I'll make your death painful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be more worried about yourself Mr. Red Hood.\" The voice was cheerful as he conversed. \"We've got a special experiment my employer wants done on you while he combats Batman in Gotham~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Bane isn't it?\" Tim, whose detective skills were around Bruces level, put together who typically uses Venom and would be brazen enough to think they could fight Batman and be able to keep him out of the way of the experiments. Strong as he is smart, Bane has always been a formidable foe for the Dark Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Damn. He\"s going to be mad I gave way who tested the new God-Venom on the Bats proteges.\" Disappointment peppered his words before \"Oh well~ I'm still getting paid so it all works out!\" *Click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZING. Whirrrrrrrrrr. ZIP. CLING. ClANG. BUZZZZZZ. The noises of machines at work filled the four Robins ears after the voice pressed something. The four instinctively began to try harder to release themselves from the bindings holding them down, but attempting to do so only seemed to tightened them even harder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastard! Tell us what you are going to do!\" Damian screamed as he in desperately, dislocated his shoulder. \"Hah!\" He gritted teeth as his shoulder limped, but the bindings <i>tightened further</i>. \"Dammit! Don't dislocate your limbs! These crappy straps actually get tighter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously!?\" Jason was on the verge of doing it himself, quickly stopping himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nightwing do you have anything to get us out!?\" Tim pleaded as he tried to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't.\" Nightwing stayed calm as he prepared himself for whatever dangerous chemicals were soon to be pumped into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bane didn't let me learn your identities when he brought you four in, <i>but</i>, when this is done your faces will be fully visible. I can sell your identities for a nice profit~\" As he finished, the four simultaneously felt something penetrate their spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\"<br>\r\n\"Helll!\"<br>\r\n\"S-stay s-stro-ong!\"<br>\r\n\"Urgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four bear through the pain of four needles filling them with glowing, sickly green substance that was pumped into their spines. Less than thirty seconds of pouring it in , the needles released themselves from their bone and skin to the sound of a *Whirrrrrr* and *DING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't so bad now was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" Damian and Jason cursed, disgusted that they've been dumped with who knows what kind of life threatening chemicals this God-Venom was. Richard and Tim stayed composed as they tried to think of a way out...</span></div></div>",

Muscles expanding by painful spasms.

He was growing so fast that if he were still wearing his uniform, it wouldn't cover his stomatch, now with a rising 6-pack.<br>\r\n\"I'll take that like a 9. Don't worry, only the first growth spurt is that painful, when the God-Venom break apart your growth plates by force for the first time. But once they're fully open, the growth will be nicer than disagreeable.\"<br>\r\n\"*Ungh* ...wait, FIRST growth spurt--? UGG!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightwing couldn't finish the question, an intense sensation in his crotch. His immense calves had almost crushed his relatively big flaccid penis, but then Dick's dick had started to twitch and get hard... but instead of stopping at his usual 16cm (6.2\") his altered body continued to pump blood, blood filled with growing drugs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis penis' cells started to multiply, the tissue increased its capacity, millions of new nerv endings were created in orgasmic expantion, so pleasant it nullified the growth pains... Dick couldn't help himself to moan when his cock surpassed the 20cm (8\") mark, precumming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were at the same situation, with Jason a few centimeters ahead of Dick (he had a head start, originally bigger at 18.5cm, but his growth seemed a little slower so it wasn't impossible for Dick to caught him up the next minutes. In terms of height, Dick had already surprassed Jason by almost a head despite starting 2\" /5cm shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf minute later, those two were tied at 25cm (~10\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamian, smaller than anyone, had grown incredible fast (maybe because he was the youngest and still in development?) and his tiny 11cm (4.3\") had reached Tim's 21cm mark. Also he was almost as tall as him, but he had a slimmer build (maybe due to his too fast growth).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first one reaching the Foot (30cm) mark wins.\" The mad cientist joked while watching their transformation without losing any detail. \"And then maybe we could start phase two a little sooner and make a race to the 2 feet mark (60cm).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick, whose growth was at last slowing down, wasn't willing to pass for the same shit a second time. He made an effort and tried to break his bindings.<br>\r\nHis body had gained a tremendous explosive strength, but couldn't access to it, still weak by all the major changes he experimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he kept trying and, by sheer willforce, was capable of shatter them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but those bindings were supposed to contain a Wonder Woman Level hero.\" The villain noticed. \"A little too soon for you to grow to that point... that makes you the most promising candidate, Dick.\" Smiled like he didn't care about the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightwing fell to the ground, and for a second he felt tempted to stay there and let his body rest and it ended growing... but he knew everyone depended on him.<br>\r\nLooking ahead, he got a good visual of their kidnapper: He was still behind a crystal screen at the end of the room, watching them with coldness and arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move, legs, move...\" Dick begged, trying to get his huge body in movement. Seconds later it responded and the hero started running toward their shared enemy.</span></div></div>",

The two kept apart by a mysterious bubble like force field, with itself further split within by walls of energy colored like a rainbow. A large building, situated around a great forest of bizarre flora, tree like plants that grew long glowing pink vines in place of leaves and coral like bark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a dark lit lab, light shining from videos on display of a great computer. Watching from a massive throne sat comfortably a great giant, easily thirty feet tall and clad head to toe in Dark Green armor. A singular visor that glowed a sickly neon green as he watched a number of videos of people.:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*A blonde man wearing a dark uniform holding back the hand of a massive purple minigiant. <br>\r\n*Two bearded men in having a onesided pissing contest on a spaceship,<br>\r\n*A normal man trying to let loose a great green giant from within, only for his refusal.<br>\r\n*A man in a dark grey with red helmet and a red and black suit stuck in the Quantum Realm seeking aid.<br>\r\n*There other were ones of a long haired man with a metal arm, a dark skinned king calling to his people, an archer watching his family turn to ash, and a young man dressed as a spider on the ruins of a world, but the scenes of them were paused in place. As if he did not yet desire them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great armored glove moved to his side as he watched, picking up a thin like needle attached to a cord. Moving it, the giant pushed it in to an object hidden by shadow, lighting it up as a golden gauntlet with gems positioned in sockets shined. Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt moved in response to the needle, the light of the gems shining brighter as it showed the decapitated hand that lay within it. Multiple needles, IVs, and machines dimly shone hooked up to exposed purple flesh, seemingly keeping it alive, and likewise moving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Fortune ensured this limb was preserved when the fool dared to take the Soul Stone by force. All this time, my research to grow life to untold sizes across the universe seemed doomed, even further to have said life go forth and fertilize new worlds for life.</span>\" </i> The giant stood up. GRIND. GRIND. GRIND. his movements came with the heavy sound of machinery moving. CLANG CLANG CLANG. His heavy footfalls left the sound of metal across the floor as he observed the ones moving in their images. <i><span class=\"clgreen\">\"I need only one to be my willing test subject, then the rest I can influence with the Soul Stone.\"</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across each one, he could only continue to think his thoughts in private. <i><span class=\"clgreen\">\"To think I would stumble upon this by mere chance on the day I chose to leave my abode.\"</span></i> He reached for a needle place in the purple hand, only lightly pressed into the flesh residing in the tiny object compared to his own mighty paws. <i>\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Too long by myself in my lab, most of my brothers dead, forgotten, or lost. But I will continue my mission. Starting with one who has seen the world on the tiny scale and on a giant one. I call you forth, Scott Lang, Antman!</span>\"</i> He smashed the needle in with as much force as possible, the hand THROBBED from the jolt as the fingers moved, coming together to a resounding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP*<br>\r\nA powerful shkckwave shook the area as the gems glowed brilliantly to answer the wish, the radiation that should fry the already necrotic flesh held at bay by the bizarre concotions flowing through the hand. Fingers fell silent as the movement granted disappeared, collapsing with a light thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned away from the displays, the man in the quantum realm disappeared appeared as he turned to a display with no one on it. Of a human looking home furnished to ease a coming guest as a *FWWWWWOOOOMMMM!* of a portal of energy ripped open and tossed a man onto a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God someone finally let me....w-what j-just happend!?\" The voice of Scott Lang came from behind the helmet as he surveyed the area, trying to find an answer as he observed a nicely furnished room. \"This is not anywhere near where I went subatomic. Too bad they've got some pretty bad taste on top of it. All this looks pretty tacky.\" Thankfully the alien had no concern in human decor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies Lang Scott. I teleported you to my world as I need your help.\" A deep voice emanated from nowhere to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly turning to see where the voice is coming from. \"Is this Hank? I should have known you'd screw me around like that and it's not funny. Whatever you did I couldn't even bring back the container of Particles for Ghost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alas Lang Scott, the one you call Pym Hank was turned to ash in your world. I am The Grower. A being from the edge of the galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait I've been kidnapped by aliens? Please don't probe my brain, and especially not my butt. Ive never practiced anal and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have little time for your desire to converse, so I shall update your memory with current knowledge.\" The Grower moved a hand to shift a needle within the arm, causing it to twitch uncontrollably as it once again *SNAP* information into the mind of Scott Lang. At least, info beneficial to the Celestial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rush of knowledge to Scotts head, however, felt like he ate a lot of freezing cold ice cream really fast. \"Brain freeze! I don't even get to enioy any ice cre-oh dear God they were all turned to ash by that ugly purple guy.\" The shock widened his eyes as he tried to look for the voice. \"Thank God Cassies okay! And Captain America is rocking the beard. Wait don't get distracted! Okay uh Grow guy what does a growth experiment have to do with stopping the jerk with the ugly chin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanos is strong, but he will soon try to destroy the stones. I can deposit you upon the world where he will try to destroy them, and by surprise you can squash him flat. He has no means to stop you, as he threw away his powerful battle armor, and great damage has been inflicted by using the Infinity Gauntlet once. Then you can crush him underfoot as his guard is down and reclaim them for the Avengers once they reach the same destination.\" He left out, of course, how Scotts timeline was doomed, as the rat that would free him in that one possibility never arrives in his own reality, nor that the one he sends back will be a copy of his being: soul, body, and mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well that works......\" Scott remained silent for several moments before shaking his head amd taking off the helmet, rising from his seat to place it on a table. \"Yeah no this knowledge you shoved right into my skull tells me you want me to grow into a Giant <i>without</i> the suit and that's just nuts. Ill turn into a giant goop of guts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will work. After all, everything I've already done including bring you here from the subatomkc is not normally feasible, is it not?\" The visor dimmed as he awaited the answer he knew would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Alright. But I want to contact my daughter after we start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light in the visor shined brilliantly \"A fair trade.\"  The deal, and with it, the fruition of this Celestials long desire to expand life itself with the growing universe will finally come to pass. \"Now let us begin!\" He took a needleand repeatedly stabbed it into the still living flesh! Again, and again, and again! The guantlets fingers twitched and convused due to the flesh beneath as it slowly ebbed towards making another *SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had figured out the process of using the gauntlet after numerous failures on fauna he had grown personally on this world. All but the food resource fauna now extinct. Yet now he can see his work put to the test!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm glow engulfed Antman as he closed his eyes. \"Mmmm...this feels good...like feeling Captain America's arms good....\" The Grower tiled his head as he didn't factor in how much of a crush the sizeshifter had on Steve Rogers. Making a mental note for future experimentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red and black suit began to press outwards, almost looking as if it was bloating as Scotts arms swelled with mass! His chest pushing out shutting off inch after inch of stomach even as steel hard abs forged underneath. His head rose higher as his neck thickened and bulged! His delts grew just as his thighs did, becoming huge and nearly reaching tree trunk, calves carving into diamonds before the glow suddenly stopped. Scotts eyes opened. \"That...was a rush!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere once stood the lean 5'10 Scott lang now stood the great 9'10 Scott. Towering over Thanos himself by a foot. Thankfully his suit grew too! Except...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Grower. I want you to let ms talk to Cassie. Oh but make sure she cant see anything but my head. I dont want fo freak her out, especially as your experiment did some obscene things in my pants!\" a noticeable bulge filled them, easily being a foot in length if he had been his original height, now a foot and half long sausage lay nestled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" instead of the gauntlet, he simply opened a secret hatch to press a button, opening a holo screen before Scott as it peeked in his mind for the one to contact. Letting him talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his first willing subject, he could now inlfuencd the rest. starting with..m</span></div></div>",

Just cruising the universe, not worried about particularly anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Rocket!\u201d Peter yelled. \u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d \u201cSeems to be the middle of nowhere!\u201d he replied. \u201cCool lights passing by though. This area has been labeled \u201cdangerous\u201d for some reason. A little light show never hurt anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d Gamora called. \u201cCould be anything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to like anything.\u201d Peter smiled. He was wearing one of his tight shirts to show off for Gamora. \u201cBut, what\u2019s not to like about me?\u201d he chuckled. Gamora scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Break it up you lovebirds!\u201d Rocket called from the cockpit. \u201cThere\u2019s a panel that\u2019s short-circuited. Get on it!\u201d Gamora walked away mumbling. \u201cLovebirds... ha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter shrugged and turned to the wall. At that moment one of the \u201clights\u201d flew through the side of the ship and hit him square in the back. Everyone whipped around and looked at where it had come from. There was no hole. It had simply phased through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Rocket called. \u201cIs Peter alright?\u201d Gamora ran over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey are you okay!?\u201d she yelled. \u201cWhat?\u201d Peter replied. \u201cThe light! The one that hit you!\u201d Gamora sputtered. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Gamora thought out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ll be back. I gotta grab a wrench.\u201d Peter said as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey... are you... bigger?\u201d Gamora stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter seemed to be taller and... bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean... my shirt does feel a bit tight.\u201d he replied as he fidgeted with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway...\u201d Gamora said as she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... I\u2019ll go get the tools.\u201d he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away, Gamora couldn\u2019t help but notice his shoulders seemed larger and his back looked stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the shirt.\u201d she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, an oblivious Drax was chatting with Mantis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m learning how to scare people.\u201d he stated. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to use it on the others. BLAAH!\u201d he yelled, which made Mantis jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter came back a few minutes later. After finishing with the panel, he turned and faced Gamora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to say something when he felt a strange sensation. They both watched in a mix of horror and amazement as Peter\u2019s arms began to swell. It wasn\u2019t inflammation. His muscles were growing. They were getting huge, larger than Drax\u2019s. He groaned as they burst through his sleeves, revealing his massive arms to him and a shocked Gamora. Eventually the growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood there in shocked silence for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat just happened..\u201d Peter breathed. \u201cI think that ray caused some sort of rampant cellular multiplication!\u201d Gamora stammered. Peter flexed a massive bicep. \u201cI could punch through the wall with this monster!\u201d he yelled. \u201cBest not to.\u201d Gamora replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The room pitch black as he turned the light on. *Click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for you to hide away little guy.\" Standing there under the light, the young hero clad in the black and white spider suit of the Venom Symbiote. The alien parasite began to quickly receded under his clothes, hiding itself away as the brown haired teens red jacket and blue jeans became visible. Though it slowly trailed upwards until it formed a black ball for a head peaked out from beneath the shirt under the jacket. It rubbing itself affectionately against his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird thinking how you split into three.\" The brown haired hero rubbed the symbiotes \"chin\" with his finger. Thinking back on how they joined together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===Less than a week in the past===<br>\r\nThe Symbiote Venom had been solely united with Eddie Brocks. The former friend turned madman as the two sought vengeance against Pete. Eddies sanity devolving as he started using \"We\". Both had reunited recently after escaping asylum, just as a golden stone engraved with a black spider descended from the heavens into the middle of Midtown Manhatten in  New York City. Floating just before touching the surface of the Empire State Buildings top. The fight had escalated across the city from Horizon High as Peter unknowingly brought Eddie and Venom there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know for seeing couples counseling recently you two seem even more obssessed with me!\" Spidey thwipped across building to building as he headed for the stone, as if drawn to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence! We will see you crushed and your head splattered across the streets Pete! Know our desire for retribution!\" The massive tongue leaped out of the monstrous fanged mouth of the black and white beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Went as poorly as expected then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rah!\" Swiping claws Peter narrowly avoided from turning, slashing through brick and glass of a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drew ever closer as football player and Peter's classmate, Flash Thompson, stood under the Empire state building. As if waiting for something. \"Pete promised to help with my homework. Don't know why he asked me to meet him here.\" Peter had promised no such thing, yet a text came from Parkers phone that said as such nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging to the top by the unknown call of the object, the brown haired hero let out a \"Whoa!\" as he only now saw it come into his vision. \"Looks like some extraterrestial object descended! Usually SHIELD or the Avengers deal with that. Unless some villain organization is incolced like AIM...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on the tip of the building, just below the glowing object. Until a *TINGLE* sent his spider senses off and he jumped up, hands and feet touching the shining rocks underside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETE!\" The yell of Venom called out as he narrowly missed. Following upwards to attack on the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BZZZZZP* A zap of energy sparked through Venom as the black spider markings glowed. The entire world was soon devoured in light, the shadow of a spider in its center. It dissipated as soon as it began, and with it all trace of what it had done. Not even those right next to it recall the light, or what it had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Plop. Plop. Plop. Glop.* The sound of slime ozzing off could be heard as Peter watched wide eyed \"Looks like Venom can't keep himself together.\" He saw the dripping chunks sliding rapidly from the surface of the buildings roof and rapidly down it in the same direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pe...te....\" The head of Venom shifted as the slimy symbiote receded, exposing the unconscious head of Eddie as the blondes eyes were white from shocked as he fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie!\" *THWIP* A sling of webbing caught him before he could fall far from the stone, sticking him to it as the concerned webslinger slid down the web to touch him, only for a small goop of slime that was dripping below to suddenly go upwards! In a flash a small ball of Venom symbiote separated from the rest and quickly crawled up Peter's suit. The rest sticking to Eddie contently as no more detached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No way am I getting taken...over...huh?\" The Olive Green eyes sharpened as he readied to grab it, only for the small substance to begin nuzzling him. Eyes widening as the blob of symbiote acted not with aggression but affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the disgruntled Flash Thompson had tired of waiting for Peter. \"Don't know why he called me out here when he wasn't going to com-UGH\" He felt the black goo of Venom fall upon him, drop after drop, making his hair sticky. \"Gross! I'm going to get on Parkers ass about this!\" Passerbys paid him no attention beyond mutterings and chuckles. It quickly vanished within his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon police arrived to arrest the fainted Eddie and the still aggressive fragment of the Symbiote, Jameson on TV ranting  on how Spiderman planned to create a Symbiote army to dominate the earth as Officers took the two entwined criminals away. Looking inside his shit to see the little Venom slithering about harmlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hosts to a divided Symbiote. What was this Stones goal? None would find out except the the Webslinger when its goal is achieved.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====Present Time=====<br>\r\nPeter fell back on to his bed, letting out a *YAWN* as the little symbiote nestled against his neck protectively. His pants had a noticeable tent in them. His face turning slight tint of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't had any private time since I got you lil'Venom.\" Nonstop villainy meant he fell down on his bed, suit on, for six nights straight. The little symbiote removing itself and the normal suit so Aunt May would not learn his identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on it, he shrugged. \"I'll handle it another night. *YAWN* Night Lil Guy.\" Turning off his light, Peter went to sleep and dreamed an endless dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLil'Venom 3, however, did not rest. It could sense the strain of Pete blueballing himself night after night, and no more. Slithering through clothes, squeezing into pants and boxers, it found itself a throbbing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on primal instinct it felt, nay, NEEDED to do this. It formdd a bulb in the shape of a head as it wrapped itself around Peter's cock. Every bit of its black bulb moved down to swallow the six inch hard cock as it began to rub itself against it. Tendrils coming out to stick to Parkers skin as it began to pump itself faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FAP* It imitated the way it knew Peter moved to get off, not knowing more than the basics of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FAP FAP* Harder. Rougher. Faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FAP FAP FAP FAP* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmf...!\" The groan of delight told it to work faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dam finally burst. A huge splooge of white began to pump out into Lil'Venoms form. Filling it up. It could only think as more continued to gush forth, expanding it to thrice its size was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelcious. Tasty. Scrumptious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt needed more. It needed to help Peter Parker <i>more</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began the process again *FAP FAP FAP* The brown haired heroes cock rising as it felt the sensitive touch of the Symbiote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly its form began to shrink, only...it was bigger...and the tendrils stickingnit to Peter were piercing his skin....pumping <i>something</i> into Spiderman....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The crowd cheered enthusiastically. \u201cAs you are aware,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe tributes are already in the arena fighting to the death. While pulling these tributes from the existing pool of victors was a twist, I am here to tell you we have another one planned!

We should move. Lead on Katniss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three began to walk through the jungle in silence, the quiet only being disturbed by the crunching of leaves. Suddenly, they were startled by a series of screams echoing around the arena, each of which were abruptly cut off. \u201cThis can\u2019t be good,\u201d Finnick mumbled, gripping his weapon as the screams became closer and closer to the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a well-concealed trapdoor opened under Katniss.

He flexed his muscles, warming up. That was when he felt the dart hit his chest, followed by the feeling of something being injected. He quickly pulled the dart out, knowing that whatever damage it had done was already done. He scanned the area where it came from with his eyes, up in the rafters, but could see nothing. And that was when the warm feeling started. What was this? Did someone poison him to keep him from competing? He felt a warm pressure build in his well-toned chest where the dart had hit him, and he felt it spreading through the rest of his strong body. He groaned as the pressure increased, dropping the dart. He fell to his knees, clenching his teeth in pain. He felt that if this pressure kept increasing, he might simply explode. He couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He stopped resisting. The second he did, he roared as every muscle in his muscular body explode outward. His pecs burst forward against his shirt. His arms thickened quickly. His abs tightened. His legs expanded outward in his pants. His glutes pressed against the back of them. He jumped up, looking down at his larger body straining against his now too tight sleeveless spandex jersey and pants. He could see every muscle outlined in them, and, not to mention, his noticeably larger bulge. He also realized he had shot up to nearly 5\u201910. He chuckled. \u201cWell I guess this isn\u2019t too bad,\u201d he concluded. But then the pressure in his body began rising again. He groaned. It was much stronger this time. He roared as his growing body exploded out of his jersey, followed by his pants giving way. Sam\u2019s chest simply forced his jersey open like a bomb going off. His legs weren\u2019t going to be confined by such weak material. His growth halted as he reached 6\u20191. He was left in a ridiculously tight pair of compression shorts. He couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. He lightly touched his sweaty pecs that had become four times as large as his hands. He ran his hands over his biceps that had become as large as melons. He looked down at his ridiculously defined 8-pack and his legs as thick oak trees. His large package now threatened to break free of his compression shorts. \u201cOh man,\u201d he said. He loved his new huge body. Then, suddenly, the pressure shot up again. \u201cOh no. NOT AGAIN!\u201d he yelled. \u201cUH! I CAN\u2019T RESIST IT.\u201d He roared like a lion as he exploded in every direction again. His compression shorts finally gave way, leaving him sweaty and naked. His pecs grew to the size of beach balls. His biceps grew to the size of a man\u2019s head. When his growth stopped at 6\u20195, he stood there surveying his huge body. He could now easily win any sport he wanted to. He grinned as he thought of the upcoming Olympic gymnastics.</span></div></div>",

With a roar and a massive thrust, his manhood burst free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stood there in the sun, his massive chest heaving. He was now around 7\u201910.

He set down his towel on a chair and went to edge of the pool. He eased his muscular body into the pool, noting how warm it seemed. \u201cIt must be the sun,\u201d he reasoned. He floated out towards the center, repeatedly diving under the strangely warm water. However, he didn\u2019t know what had happened earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp the hill from his house, a botched super-soldier serum from a nearby lab was being transported to a top-secret waste containment facility. The serum worked very well, but it caused some strange... \u201cside effects\u201d that weren\u2019t wanted. It was on its way to be locked up when the truck hit a pothole. A single barrel rolled out and down the hill, unnoticed by anyone. It rolled until it stopped against a log. The serum leaked into the ground, ending up in the filtration system of the Paul\u2019s pool. It slowly leaked until the entire contents of the barrel were in the pool. And it was way more than the normal dose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan was floating in the center of the pool when the tingling began. He felt odd, weak, and strongly aroused. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d he mumbled. He wasn\u2019t sure what to think, so he got out of the pool and toweled off. He then went and lay down on his towel at the edge of the pool. He didn\u2019t realize his bathing suit was still wet. \u201cFunny,\u201d he thought. \u201cMy shorts seem like they\u2019re almost clinging to my skin.. WHAT THE.. OHHHH.\u201d His glutes seemed to suddenly thicken in his pants, raising his waist up slightly. He gasped as his quads seemed to expand in his slightly tighter suit. He sat up and flexed his legs. His quads felt strong. \u201cHuh,\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cBut what about my.. OHHH.\u201d He fell back flat and threw his head back, moaning. His dick and balls were swelling in his pants. He loved the feeling. Then it stopped. He stood up and, looking around to make sure no one was watching, took off his pants. He gasped. His dick looked to have gained around 3\u201d. His balls looked around the size of small oranges. His quads looked harder. His butt looked sturdy. \u201cWow...\u201d he breathed.</span></div></div>",

But as he walked along the pool\u2019s edge, he slipped on a puddle. With a shout, he fell back in. He quickly stood up, but not fast enough. \u201cWha..?\u201d he mumbled. He seemed to be almost frozen within the waist-high water. He felt the tingling begin. \u201cNO NO NO!\u201d he yelled, but he coudnlt move. He felt his calves expand out and become rock hard like his quads. He moaned as both his quads and his calves kept growing, tearing his shorts partially. \u201cNO NO NO.. YES!\u201d he roared as his butt became harder and his package exploded larger. His pants finally gave up and tore, leaving his godly lower half fully exposed to the chemical-infused water. He now didn\u2019t want to resist this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered himself in and swam out to the center, neck-deep. He felt his hands become larger and more manly as he grunted with pleasure. He felt the water almost grab him as he suddenly yelled and shot up 6 inches. He was now 6\u20198. He compensated for the sudden growth by bending his knees so he could remain submerged. \u201cOh yeah...\u201d he moaned as his forearms grew solid and rock-hard. \u201cOh yeah!\u201d he exclaimed as his biceps swelled to the size of melons. \u201cOH YES!\u201d he yelled as his shoulders became as large and as hard as bowling balls. His traps swelled up as his neck thickened until he looked like a professional linebacker. His abs tightened into an 8-pack like a brick wall as Logan grunted again in pain and pleasure. Both waves of growth reached his already nice pecs at the same time. Logan roared as his pecs exploded outward and swelled to the size of watermelons. His lats exploded in every direction until you could see every movement in his body in them. He was silent until his large body was wracked by one last huge wave of growth. He roared like a lion as his muscles swelled all at once. He shot up again to 7 feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 seconds of being absolutely still. Logan stood up, his enormous glistening chest heaving with every breath. He grinned as he looked at his body. He felt strong. He walked to the edge of the pool and lifted his Herculean body out of the pool. He flexed his godly muscles. \u201cAwesome.\u201d he said in a noticeably deeper voice. He thought about Jake, wondering what he would think of this. He then realized how attractive his brother really was. How had he never realized that? What he didn\u2019t know is that he had been affected by the unintended side affect of th serum. It turned men gay. He thought of what it would be like if Jake got in the pool...</span></div></div>",

He then took it out to the pool and filled it with the chemical-ridden water. He then walked back towards the house. He stopped at the back porch. \u201cHey Jake!\u201d he yelled, trying to make his voice sound like it did before he grew. \u201cWhat?\u201d came the voice of his brother from an upstairs window. \u201cCome down here! I have something to show you!\u201d Logan yelled back. \u201cAlright! \u201cI\u2019m coming down!\u201d Jake yelled down. Logan grinned. Jake had a pretty good body, and he typically walked around in just his underwear. Perfect... The back door opened. Jake, in nothing but a pair of spandex underwear, walked out. \u201cWhat is it... WHAT!?\u201d Jake yelled. \u201cWhat happened to you bro!?\u201d Logan simply grinned and threw the bucket of water on Jake. \u201cWhat the heck!?\u201d a now sopping wet Jake exclaimed. \u201cWhat was thaohhhhhh...\u201d Jake moaned. Logan could see his lean chest pulsing. \u201cWhat was that!?\u201d Jake asked, storming towards Logan. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be like me.\u201d Logan replied. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be huge.. uhhhhhh.\u201d Jake growled. He fell to his knees on the ground. \u201cI have to resist..\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Logan said. That was all Jake could take. He roared as his chest swelled. His arms thickened. His abs tightened. His legs became hard and strong. His butt became tenser. He fell flat on his back. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he asked, lying in his too small and tight spandex. \u201cNope.\u201d Logan grinned. He ran over to the poolside and refilled the bucket. He ran back to where Jake was still lying on the ground recovering.</span></div></div>",

They swelled until his balls came to his knees. Jake sat there lying on the ground, athletic chest heaving. \u201cIs that it?\u201d he asked. Logan grinned. \u201cNope,\u201d he said. He picked Jake up and, with his powerful arm, threw him into the pool. \u201cNO!\u201d Jake yelled. But it was too late. His chest exploded out again. He shot up to 6\u20198, just like Logan. He moaned as his arms thickened. His biceps grew to the size of melons. His abs tightened as he moaned in semi-erotic pain. His shoulders exploded to the size of bowling balls. He tried to swim to the edge of the pool, but Logan shoved him back in. His traps blew up against his thickening neck. His quads and calves turned his legs into steel beams. His butt tightened and expanded. \u201cOH YES!\u201d he roared in a much deeper voice as his package exploded out again. He then had one final growth spurt, shooting up to meet Logan\u2019s 7 feet. After a moment, he heaved himself out of the pool. \u201cLet\u2019s go grow some more guys,\u201d Logan said. Jake grinned.</span></div></div>",

But he would soon enough. He gave a sudden groan. Michael Phelps looked over in concern and gasped. Nathan seemed to be swelling. \u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m GROWING!\u201d Nathan growled. His lean pecs swelled. \u201cOh GOD!\u201d he yelled. His legs thickened, straining his speedo. \u201cYES!\u201d he roared as his muscles swelled again, tearing off his now minuscule speedo.

I\u2019m getting so BIG!\u201d he roared as his already well-developed muscles expanded. His back muscles swelled, and the others watched in awe as Ricky grew taller. His glutes were becoming massive like the rest of him, and forced his speedo to give up, exploding off of him. He groaned in a deeper voice as he succumbed to his massive body, just like Nathan, who had finally stopped growing, and simply stood there (he was so large he was standing in a 7 1/2 foot pool) panting. The others, wide-eyed, continued towards the edge of the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did this pool have to be so big?\u201d Ryan thought. His train of thought was suddenly interrupted by the nearest guy, Chad, groaning. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to me!\u201d he yelled. He sped towards the edge of the pool on suddenly stronger legs and heaved his strangely heavier body out. Standing up, he breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cI made it.\u201d he whispered to himself. Welllll... no he hadn\u2019t. The others still in the pool watched as the South African began to shake. His shoulders became larger, starting a wave that spread down his arms, exploding massive muscles into existence. He roared as his upper body swelled until he was absolutely massive. His legs followed suit, destroying his compression shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan watched in terror at what had just happened. Chad had been close to him. Too close. With that thought, he felt something seize him. Something cold, yet it felt... good. He watched as his biceps swelled. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of this pool!\u201d he thought. He could feel himself getting larger. He finally reached the edge and pulled himself out of the pool. He was strangely exhausted, and all he could manage was to roll away from the edge. Lying on his back, he mentally celebrated escaping from the pool. Then he felt something odd. His dick was feeling... big. He wasn\u2019t aroused, as he was not gay. He moaned as his dick suddenly swelled larger in his speedo. So he hadn\u2019t escaped. \u201cBut maybe..\u201d he thought, \u201cthat wasn\u2019t such a bad thing.\u201d His muscles started to grow again. He could feel his skin sliding across the rough pool deck, but he wasn\u2019t moving. He was just getting bigger. His arms continued to expand, becoming large and strong. His pecs grew as he moaned throatily. His quads ballooned, with his calves following suit. His speedo finally gave way, unleashing his massive package.</span></div></div>",

Swimming the hardest he ever had, the Italian clambered out of the pool. He didn\u2019t know how, but he felt like the water was \u201cangry\u201d he had escaped. As he was about to leave, he heard a shout. \u201cHelp me!\u201d a deep voice with a German accent yelled. He looked back, and saw Steffen struggling to exit the pool. He had been fast, but not fast enough. He had already grown quite a bit. Luca could tell his speedo was about to burst off his large, muscular legs. Luca ran back to the edge of the pool and grabbed Steffen\u2019s large hands. As he was pulling the large German out of the contaminated pool, Steffen groaned and had a strong growth spurt. The pair tumbled into the water. Luca briefly realized that the water had forced Steffen to grow larger to get both the Olympians back into the pool. \u201cClever...\u201d the Italian thought. He could feel tingling and knew the water was inside of him. He glanced over at Steffen, who had now become almost as massive as the others. He gave a guttural growl as he reached a height of 7\u20195\u201d. There was no helping him now. Luca moaned as he grew a little. There was no point trying to escape. He hopped up and sat down on the edge of the pool, pondering the last moments of his normal-sized life. He growled as his legs grew larger, tearing his speedo. His chest swelled to an awesome size, as he grimaced, as his growth halted. \u201cIs the water showing mercy or something?\u201d he thought as he stood up. He looked over his slightly bigger body. He looked good. He wasn\u2019t much larger than before, but definitely a lot stronger. He suddenly realized that there was a weird pressure building inside of him. His growth was simply being held back. The water was punishing him for trying to help Steffen. He roared as it released him and his muscles exploded with growth. He grew to the size of the others within seconds.</span></div></div>",

Especially considering that now more than half of the guys who were here were now a foot and a half taller than they were and incredibly muscular. He somehow made it to the edge of the pool and fled into the locker room. He stood there in shock at what had just happened. Besides Tom, James, Eamon, and him, everyone had been grown by the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he backed away from the door, he didn\u2019t realize he was under one of the showers. Little backstory here. The filter in the pool was a miracle compared to the state of the filters in the showers. Hearing a creaking in the pipes, Michael turned around. The shower was somehow turned on by the water and blasted Micheal in the face. He growled as he felt his jawline becoming stronger and more masculine. The water ran down his neck, and he felt it becoming stronger and incredibly muscular. He watched in a twisted mix of horror and arousal as the water ran over his chest, which exploded outward. The water hit his abs, which became rock-hard. \u201cHuh.\u201d he wondered. \u201cI wonder what would happen if it got into my spe.. WHOA!\u201d he shouted as the water reached his speedo. His package swelled massively and threatened to burst out of his speedo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was loving this. He stepped forward into the shower and let the water cover him. His shoulder became massive, and his arms followed suit, becoming large and strong enough to tear apart a small boulder. His back expanded in all directions, and his legs destroyed his speedo, turning practically into tree trunks. He grew enormous, reaching eight feet. Muscular chest heaving, he turned towards the door.</span></div></div>",

He had seen Michael make it to the locker room, so at least he might get away. He looked over at Tom. Poor Tom, who in his successful attempt to get to the edge of the pool had panicked and swallowed some water. As the smaller British swimmer climbed out, his back simply became ripped. Contaminated water on the inside doesn\u2019t do you much good. Tom tried to stand, but the muscles of his upper body suddenly swelled enormously, bringing him back down to the ground. He tried to push himself back up, and Eamon could see his enormous biceps working on it. His legs compensated and grew, but it was too late for him. The now massive Brit stood up, a total muscular beast. It was now just Eamon and James. It looked like they were both going to escape, when Eamon suddenly felt a strong hand clamp on his shoulder. He looked back and saw Ricky, who was smiling. \u201cLet\u2019s conduct a little experiment shall we?\u201d he said in an impossibly deep voice. He dragged Eamon through the water over to Nathan, who grabbed him as well. They pushed him down to where he was almost completely submerged. Eamon could see they were concentrating on something. He could suddenly sense them forcing power into him. \u201cOh no...\u201d he thought. \u201cTheir combined power along with the water would make me... I don\u2019t know how massive!\u201d He suddenly roared as his lean body was wracked with growth. His muscles tripled in size and he shot up two feet. Nathan and Ricky smiled as Eamon became larger than both of them. He pushed them both off as he stood up straight. They all looked over at the remaining Olympian.</span></div></div>",

As they returned to the locker room, it seemed like it would be another normal routine of getting out of their hot uniforms, showering, redressing, and leaving. As the entered the locker room, however, the didn\u2019t know that nothing would ever be the same again. After Brand had taken his shower and relinquished it to another jock, he noticed their team captain, Andy. He was still in his uniform, panting. His dirty blonde hair was damp with sweat. Brand had never seen him like this. He was a large guy, not one to seem to have any weaknesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Brand questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d replied Andy in his deep and manly voice. It seemed deeper to Brand than it usually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel odd... and... stronger,\u201d continued Andy. \u201cI feel... ohhhh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrand took a step back as Andy moaned. \u201cI\u2019m getting... BIG.\u201d Andy growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrand watched as his captain began to swell in his uniform. It became tighter on Andy\u2019s growing body. Andy growled again. Brand had never seen him like this. He could now see every engorged muscle in his tight uniform. Everyone in the locker room jumped as they heard a tearing noise and watched in awe as Andy\u2019s uniform began to split along the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my... what\u2019s happening,\u201d Andy moaned as he lifted his arm and watched his bicep thicken. Everyone watched as his upper arms exploded out of his too-tight sleeves. His massive biceps were becoming powerful mounds. Andy roared as his uniform finally tore on his back. His now smaller teammates stared at his broad, hulking back. With another small explosion, his round shoulders burst from their fabric confinement. Andy looked down at Brand with a look of fear and lust. Suddenly his pecs, built strongly from years of hard training, swelled, threatening to destroy what remained of his uniform. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to him!?\u201d Josh, a teammate yelled. \u201cI\u2019m turning into a beast!\u201d Andy shouted. With a loud roar, he tore his shirt off of his massive chest. Brand was in awe of the shirtless beast before him. His pecs were twice as large as what they used to be. Andy flexed his huge biceps, admiring them. His ripped back had expanded, showing off his massive muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrand looked down. Andy\u2019s now skintight pants remained on. His glutes and quads looked much larger, threatening to explode out at any moment. Brand blushed as he realized Andy\u2019s cock had enlarged greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another guttural growl, Andy\u2019s thick legs began to grow again. Within seconds, his pants had exploded off his quads and swollen calves, leaving him barely covered with just the upped remnants of his pants and underwear remaining. With a final roar, what remained of his clothes exploded off, revealing his massive, thick glutes and enormous cock. Everyone involuntarily took a step back as he gave out a booming laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have become your true captain! You will all join me soon.\u201d Andy rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrand looked down. All he was wearing was a towel. He was pretty much defenseless. He looked up again at the huge, muscular man who, just a few minutes ago, had been a high school senior. Brand\u2019s eyes wandered to his godlike biceps and enormous pecs. Andy\u2019s already well-built abs had become a brick wall of pure power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
