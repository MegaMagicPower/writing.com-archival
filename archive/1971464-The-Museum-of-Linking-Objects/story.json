On top of each pedestal is a single object, which is covered by a clear glass dome. I walk to the first pedestal, look at the object under the dome, and a tear rolls down my cheek because this item belonged to a long deceased family member. I turn my back on that pedestal and go to the one directly across from it, where I find another item that links me to someone out of my past. I look at the item and smile because this object belonged to an old friend I have not seen or heard from in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk along the row for a few minutes, look at the item on each pedestal, and either smile or cry because of the person the item belonged to. I walk back to one of the pedestals, reach out my right hand, and touch the glass dome covering it. The dome dissolves allowing me to touch and then pick up the item.

The case is probably about two or three inches wide and four or five inches long (I could be over estimating the size because I don't smoke), with ridges across the length of the case. I open it and look inside, there I find two metal spring pedals to hold the cigarettes in the case. On one of the pedals I find the words \"Parker of London Made in USA.\" I close the case, caress it, and then smile and cry at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember seeing Grandpa carrying this case when he wore his <i>Sunday go to meeting</i> suite. Most of the time Grandpa wore overalls or work clothes, but when he went to church, a funeral, or a business appointment he wore a suite. At those times, he carried it in his breast pocket and, on Sunday, when he was <i>shooting the bull</i> (as he called gossiping with his friends) in the church yard or parking lot, he would take it out and offer his friends a smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cry, as I think about those times, knowing that it was the rolled cigarettes that caused his lung cancer, but I can't bring myself to destroy this object that links me to my father figure. Therefore, I place it reverently back on the pedestal, watching as the glass dome reassembles over the cigarette case.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Under a dusty glass dome, is a sepia colored photo of a man in a military uniform. Something about the man catches my eye so I reach out to release the old photo from its glass prison. The glass dome melts away and displayed on a ornate, scroll-worked, black metal stand is a tintype photo. I pull the metal photograph gently from the stand and hold it up so I can examine it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember my Gramps used to have a thick, red, felt type photo album full of photos such as these. When I was a child, I loved to pour over the photographs. My grandfather did not know who the people in the photographs were. The book had been handed down for hundreds of years. Unfortunately, the photo album was lost when the garage it was kept in was hit by a drunk driver and was demolished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps had taught me that tintypes were photographs made by creating a negative on a thin sheet of metal coated then processed with painting, lacquering, or enameling  then coated with a photographic emulsion. They were around from the 1850s to the 1940s. The process was quick and the use of iron metal sheets meant the photographs could be done cheaply. This was perfect for photographs taken in the battle fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who is this young soldier in the photo? He is standing with a group of other men, around a campfire. Tents are spread out behind them. Several of the men are sprawled on the ground and drinking from what looks like bottles and cups. Most of the men are laughing, but some of them have stern looks on their faces. They all have beards except for the subject of the photograph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier has what looks like stick-straight, shoulder length, black hair. His eyes are dark and almond shaped. He seems to be peering off into the distance, away from the photographer. Does he wonder what will happen to him next? What horrors will he experience? Will the laughing men around him be back at the campsite the next morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sepia tones reveal darker skin and a prominent nose. He is standing alone, closer to the camera. I think back to the verbal history of my family my grandfather told me. I didn't know about any of my relatives being in the civil war. If they were, they would have fought for the north. The uniforms didn't look right. The one the soldier in the photograph is wearing is a loose tunic like top with a vest over it. Looped across the vest is a belt full of big bullets. Light colored, loose pants are tucked into knee-high moccasins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoccasins? I look more carefully. The soldier in the photograph is wearing a bandana and is carrying some sort of long-arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould the soldier in the photograph be one of my American Indian ancestors? Could he be a scout for the American troops during the Apache wars? Why is he with this group of laughing men and why does he look so lost? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put the photograph reverently back in its stand and watch the dome magically cover it over again. The dust is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wander around the museum of linking objects and wish the album and my grandfather were still around, and I could solve the mystery of the man in the military uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead are more pedestals with objects to discover. I head for the one on the left and find...</span></div></div>",

It is a large, chunky type mug, the type he always used to fill to the brim with milky coffee which sloshed over the sides on to the tarpaulin as he carried it through to the lounge where we would be watching some cheesy teen horror flick on the telly or playing \"Final Fantasy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI touch the glass gently and it disappears, leaving the receptacle free to be lifted from the pedestal.  It is a standard white mug with the Spanish flag printed on one side and a map of Tenerife on the other.  I remember him choosing it idly whilst I agonised between souvenir tea towels, aprons and egg cups for my friends and relatives back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenerife - the holiday to begin the holiday revolution!  I was so green back then, phoning up an agency I found online and jabbering  away.  How long ago it seemed now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at the mug, turning it in my hands, remembering how I built a sandcastle on the beach whilst we swigged sunkissed drinks from plastic cups.  I was thinner then, I looked good in a bikini.  I bought an inflatable crocodile and we went croc surfing in the sea, under an azure sky.  In my minds eye, a girl in a red dress and a man in tie dyed cut-offs look at me and smile.  I smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI return the mug to the pedestal and turn to the next one......</span></div></div>",

After one of the latter, I wander quickly down the hall to an archway trying to escape the strong personal emotions that each object triggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround a corner, I enter a dim hall. There's a glow from between two columns that pulls me in. I stop. In an alcove are framed items on the wall. Two needlepoint pictures. Pheasants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are my mom's. She made them. They hung in my parents home, and now I am there again looking across the wood dining table and chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three part casement window to my left lets in the warm glow as the backyard appears beyond. It's shallow, a dozen feet deep. A rise at the back, a few feet tall, leads up to the field of grass or wheat that dissolves into the distance. The rock garden sits on the hillside, more rocks than flowers. Only the phlox thrives creeping over stones in several spots. Its small blossoms the only color besides brown and gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the garden now, to my left is the back patio. The black-and-brown mutt looks over his shoulder before he dashes off into the neighborhood of ranch-style homes. A dog chain hooked to a stake in the yard has another dog.  I release the little brown dachshund who leads me back inside to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorner windows over the sink show me where I just came. Small shelves hold knickknacks by the windows with cupboards extending down the walls and over the stove. Past the fridge is back to the dining room and the pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attention, though, turns to the the window shelves by the sink - a crystal squirrel, life size, sitting up. Its silhouette catches a sunbeam and sparkles a rainbow into my eyes, glistening brilliance surrounds it floating in front of me until everything fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm back in the main hall, a pedestal before me. Light points down from the ceiling through the dome and is scattered by the crystal creature inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I back away, but this time I amble slowly through the hall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This smile turns into a laugh. Withdrawing a tissue from my pocket I wipe the tears from my eyes. You see this reminds me of my father-in-law. He was a tight-fisted soul. It could have been that being raised by a single mother home and the brunt of all the meanness his siblings fostered at his expense, he clung to what was his and what he paid for.  I saw this in evidence during the time my mother-in-law was alive. Something changed when she died. He retired and bought a little trailer and drove from branch church to branch church offering his hands to whatever needed done.  <br>\r\nHe landed in Portland, Oregon about the time the headquarters began to build a new church across the street from the Tabernacle and campgrounds.  During this time he found a girlfriend and after months of dating he asked her to marry him, much to his children's surprise. We'd heard it was yes, but she had some conditions I guess my father-in-law determined to change. Around Valentine's day he bought her a red heart-shaped box of chocolates. It must have been a little while before the actual day and he pilfered one. This left a hole so he adjusted the rest of the little brown paper cups to fill in.  He slipped out another and then another until he couldn't hide the fact anymore and so just went ahead and ate all the chocolates in the box.  Now he had no candies in the box to give his sweetheart. Not to be undone, he wrote this note and taped it to the bottom of the inside of the box. It read:  \"My heart is empty like this box of chocolates.\"  I don't think she was too happy to get that gift on Valentine's day.  It was just a short while later we found out the engagement was off. She didn't want to travel around the country in a beat up old trailer when she had a nice comfortable home.  <br>\r\nI place the dome back over the red box with its ruffle band and \"Happy Valentine's Day\" stamped in gold. With a last little chuckle I move on down the aisle. </span></div></div>",

I probably should have taken pity on my lil bro and let him win, but then what kind of man would he be today? Tired of the game and the chase I tackled him to the ground and pinched both clips to the front of his shirt.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Under a glass dome, a chlld's hardcover book is illuminated under the bright museum lights. I am excited to see probably the last remaining copy of my favorite book as a youngster titled \"The Adventures of Starbeem and Re-Koil\" by D.J. Donovan, written in 1967, one printing. I held my hand over the glass dome and eagerly held the book in my hands again for the first time since I was five years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis edition of the book looks well loved, much as I loved my book. There is the smiling face of Re-Koil, the orange space dog with three eyes, who is a bit of a dunce but a good friend of Starbeem, the space cat star of the book series. Starbeem stares out at me from the cover. She is a beautiful space cat, black with bright blue eyes and a star on the tip of her tail. Her friends are Webby, the space bird and Wilfred, the baby space dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book was printed by a private press out in Ohio. My parents found it for me at a Book Fair. When I open the book and trace the illustrations with my fingers gently, I think of the thrill of the chase at all the book fairs my parents would take me to as a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents would give us ten dollars and let us loose in the warehouse that ran the book fair. This was the nineteen sixties and seventies, when parents allowed their children more freedom. They dropped us off in the children's section and went browsing adult books on their own. There were loads of other kids there too, most parked on the floor, lost to the fantasy worlds children live in with books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found Starbeem. Her face and starred tail greatly appealed to me. I could never have a cat for a pet, since I am deadly allergic to them, therefore, a cat was what I wanted most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paid for the book and a couple of \"Archie and Veronica\" comic books and my parents drove us home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith colored pencils or watercolors, I would spend hours copying the illustrations from Starbeem's book. I still have a little notebook at my parent's home filled with my drawings. I wrote fan fiction based on Starbeem. The book's prose was probably written for a much older child, but it was the illustrations I was in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time, I forgot about  Starbeem. Now, here she is again. With a sigh of regret, I replace the book on the pedestal and the dome reappears around it. For a moment, I think I see Starbeem wink her black eyes at me and her starred tail twinkle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the corner at the museum, another item catches my eye. It is..</span></div></div>",

You find fault in everything I try to do to help you. If you don\u2019t want me around anymore that is fine with me.\u201d She stood and wove her way through the tables and out the door; leaving Diane to pay the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething fluttered at the edge of her vision and she turned to look. A coat stand with a beautiful black cloak, lined in red satin danced in the breeze. it. She looked up at the sign that read; The Museum of Linking Objects. Her feet moved to the door on their own volition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon. I hope you're having a pleasant day.\u201d The woman stood before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI seem better at this moment. I was feeling a bit upset, but stepping into your shop I feel,\u201d she paused. \u201cNot peaceful but, content is the word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled. \u201cYou have come to the right place.\"  Tabatha's anger from the earlier conversation drained away.  \u201cCome, I think I know just the gift you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t come here to buy anything. I was just-\u201c She wondered why the woman thought she needed a gift?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know my dear, but you need to give this to your friend. It is something that she will come to appreciate.\u201d Alice moved along the rows of wonderful dishware.  She reached to pick up a cup decorated with ivy that formed a handle. \u201cDon\u2019t touch that!\u201d Alice ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabatha drew her hand back quickly and looked up. Alice smiled. \u201cNot everything in my shop is meant to be handled. They are unique pieces and meant for a special person. Just as I have found for you. Here it is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice opened the box to reveal a beautiful silver hairbrush. It was nestled in a bed of fine blue satin, the color of royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that is beautiful.\u201d But there would be no gifts to her former friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you need to reconsider, this is a special brush that would mean something to the very person you thought of.\u201d Alice shut the lid and pressed the ornate lock. The scent that had been so light before was almost overpowering her. She handed over her card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are my dear, take this to your friend. I'm sure when she has used your gift, you will find she is changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabatha frowned. \u201cDo you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice patted her hand as she reached for the handle of the bag. \u201cYou just give this to her. I am sure you'll be hearing from a changed person when she calls you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabatha left the gift with Diane\u2019s houseman and drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone ring woke her the next morning. \u201cHello?\u201d her voice hoarse from sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTabatha, how could you? You have to come here right away!\u201d Diane\u2019s crying, frantic voice assaulted her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust get here as fast as you can.\u201d She heard a long wail and the phone went dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonald, the houseman, let Tabatha in and pointed up. Diane's crying rang throughout the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed Diane\u2019s bedroom door open. Her firend sat at her dressing table. The silver brush in hand brushed her hair, or what was left of it. Long blond strands lay in a pile on the floor around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop brushing,\u201d Diane wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppalled Tabatha reached for Diane's hand and tried to make it stop brushing. It was as if something controlled the brush. The repeated brushing continued in spite of Tabatha's firm grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere's Phil?\u201d Tabatha asked about Diane's husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is out of town for a few weeks. Tabatha, what's happening to me? Why can\u2019t I stop brushing my hair? It's all falling out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabatha found the ornate bag on the floor, the tissue ripped where Diane pulled it from its nest. She looked at the box Alice had placed the silver box in; it had nothing but designs on it. Nothing evil or sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll go back to where I bought it and see if I can find out how to make it stop.\u201d Tabatha drove to the Museum but there were no lights inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment she pulled the doobell cord and saw Alice walk toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've come to find how to reverse the spell of the silver brush.\u201d She spoke after she opened the door and turned to walk away.<br>\r\nTabatha followed  \u201cWhat happened? Is she cursed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a way. The things that became important to her cursed your friendship. One of those things was her beauty which she spent a fortune to enhance and keep. She thought nothing of your situation or what she could do to help those less fortunate than herself. The brush is showing how little these things mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I caused it.\u201d Tabatha felt horrified at what happened to her best friend. Diane may have needed an attitude adjustment, but she didn't deserved this degree of punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my dear, she could have returned the gift, left it as a thing of beauty to be observed, had it appraised and sold, giving the proceeds to the poor. But her selfishness overcame her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does she have to do to stop all this and how do you keep reading my mind?\u201d Tabatha added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cContrition. She must ask forgiveness from you and have a change of heart. She will need to see the error of her ways and want to change. When she does that the brushing will stop.\u201d Alice ignored the latter question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's all? She just has to ask forgiveness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice gave a chuckle. \u201cIt's harder for her than you think. She must really mean it. The brush will know when that moment comes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered Diane\u2019s dressing room she hesitated and wondered what she was going to tell her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you find her?\u201d Diane\u2019s arm was still in movement, brushing the few patches of hair left. \"I can't be seen like this. It's all your fault, how could you do this?\u201d Diane began to berate Tabatha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brushing picked up in intensity, the bristles dug into Diane\u2019s scalp, and bubbles of blood began to appear. Worried, Tabatha sat next to her friend, \u201cDiane, the only way this will stop is for you to say you're sorry for the way you have treated me and others; to be really sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Sorry for what? I haven\u2019t done anything wrong. This is your fault. You sent me cursed brush! Ow, ouch, this is hurting me.\u201d She cried and reached her hand to the back of her head. When she brought it down to look at it, her palm was streaked with blood. She cried harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiane, listen to me,\" Tabatha was frantic, \u201cWe've been friends since high school. After you married Phil he was promoted to CEO, you changed. You began to act differently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Diane was sobbing, holding a towel to her bleeding scalp with one hand while the other held the brush that continued to stroke her scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou became obsessed with your looks, had implants, plastic surgery, hair plugs, skin peals and I don\u2019t know what else. I tried to tell you that all this was not the Diane I knew. We volunteered at the shelter for abused women, but you couldn\u2019t be seen there, you just wrote a check for them. We used to do the Walk for the Cure, but you only went when you wore these cute pink outfits and when you were left behind because you were out of shape, you quit. Every time I make an appointment to meet you for lunch, you talk about your latest improvement or where you've traveled. When I try to share what's going on with me, you make excuses and leave.\u201d Tears flowed from Tabatha\u2019s eyes as she watched her friend suffering from the brushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane stared at the mirror for a long time and then at Tabatha who held her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a bitch.\u201d Tears filled Diane\u2019s eyes. \u201cI've been totally engrossed with myself.\u201d She dabbed her eyes with the blood speckled towel. \u201cWhen I married Phil and he was promoted, I felt inadequate; that I wasn\u2019t good enough to associate with the other wives. Now I'm just like them.\" She cried harder. Tabatha noticed that the brush strokes slowed. \u201cHow do you feel about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane didn't answer right away. Tabatha could see the war waged on in Diane\u2019s mind. Her expression revealed anger because of the brush and its curse, but love pushed strongly to overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did buy me this awful brush,\u201d She accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was cursed. I felt drawn into this shop compelled to buy the brush. I think I must have been under some kind of spell.\u201d Tabatha whispered, \u201cMaybe fate stepped in to save you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave me from what?!\u201d Diane shouted, \u201cI'm happy the way I am.\u201d The speed of the brush picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really? Are you and Phil happy together the way you were when you first married?\u201d Tabatha\u2019s kept her voice low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I'm not happy, and Phil and I argue all the time.\u201d The words burst out of her like a geyser. \u201cOh, Tabatha, I'm sorry for the way I treated you.\u201d Diane cried and the strokes slowed again. \u201cI want us to be friends like we were before. To do the things I though were important. I want Phil and I to be happy like when we were first married.\u201d The brush lay limp on her lap unnoticed. \"I really am sorry.\" Diane sobbed in true contrition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabatha reached out and hugged her friend. The brush fell to the floor unheeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later, Tabatha and Diane walked down the sidewalk from their lunch. \u201cThis is where I saw the Museum.\u201d Tabatha pointed and then stopped. There it was. She looked at the businesses on either side and they were the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go in, I'd love to see what's in there.\u201d She started to the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, believe me you do not want to go in there.\u201d Tabatha took Diane\u2019s arm and steered her down the street.  </font></span></div></div>",
