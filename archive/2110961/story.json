There were a couple of notifications of newsfeed post replies, an E-mail informing me that someone had purchased me some raffle tickets and a reply from a friend to an E-mail I had sent her a few days ago asking how her daughters wedding had gone, and then, right at the top - so most recently sent, a review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a review to the story I had posted earlier that day, which I had uncharacteristically subsequently posted on the \"Please Review\" page with a flourish.  I wondered now whether that had been a good idea.  The confidence which had oozed from my fingers as I typed that morning had dissipated somewhat, as the day started to fade in to evening and the reality of my abilities as a short story writer had sunk in.  Poetry was my forte, after all.  My short stories were rarely appreciated with gusto and were usually picked apart for a zillion tiny grammar mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarily, I opened the E-mail, visibly balking at the content before I had even started reading it - the review was practically an essay in itself - how anyone had thought of this amount to say about my 1500 word story was anyone's guess.  With that much energy they could surely have written their own short story.  I scrolled down to the bottom, curious of the rating - and expecting something dreadful, but they had given four stars. Four stars?  That was reasonable.  I scrolled back up and started reading the review properly.  The reviewer was called DARKMOUSE9, and had been a member for a year, although I couldn't remember coming across him or her before.  DARKMOUSE - it would appear, really liked the way I told a story, as well as my plot, yet unsurprisingly found holes in my grammar and listed them at great length as well as finding my main character a little unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clicked on Darkmouse's suitcase to access their port, which gave me little information about my reviewer.  The profile picture displayed was a photograph - probably pinched from the internet- of a white mouse in shadow (very clever).  The bio block was blank and sat above a dozen or so documents, most of which appeared to be articles or technical writings.  I clicked on the \"Bio\" tab where only four of the fields were filled in- Type of Writer:technical, Favourite Movies: The Godfather, X-Men, The Imitation Game, Gender:Male, Location:England, South Coast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked.  England, South Coast?  Coincidence.  That was where I lived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabbing back to the review which still remained open in my inbox, I started to type a reply....</span></div></div>",

They knock again, more persistently. I continue to ignore it, now out of principle; after all they are rudely pounding on my door. As the pounding comes again I got up, angry and prepared to counter rude with rude although I usually try to mediate rather than argue. I glance at my computer screen, tempted to turn around and let the angry knocker knock until they wearied themselves of it. I choose instead to find out who is there and why, bothered by their bad manners. It never occurs to me to be weary of them or why they were knocking. I drew a deep breath and turned the knob, swinging open the door I saw a familiar but unexpected face. </span></div></div>",

The exact same thing happened to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe not the EXACT same thing, but something very similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI, too, was once challenged to do something which I thought I could not do. In my case it was spend the night in a haunted house, which I admit is not at all identical to the challenge in your story, but it is similar, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll my life I have been afraid of supernatural beings ever since a disastrous Halloween night when I was 9 years old and suffered a severe fright. That was the last Halloween I went out trick or treating. After that night I would just say, \"I am too old for such childish activities,\" but really I was frightened to be outside on a Halloween night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in my early 20's when I received my challenge and feeling unusually bold for a change. Normally, I was shy and skittish. But for some reason that night I accepted the challenge to spend the night in our local Haunted House.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soon as I entered the house I knew I had made a mistake, but I didn't want to lose face by running right back out like a scared cat. I decided that I would wait a little while and perhaps be able to sneak out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow I managed to fall asleep sitting there on the floor with my head nodded over. When I woke up with a start, I didn't know what time it was. I had a memory of some strange sound waking me up. I jumped to my feet and ran outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friends were all standing there laughing. It had only been an hour. I must have been really tired to fall asleep like that. Or... something made me fall asleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I was delighted and surprised to read your story. I did find a few errors of spelling and grammar which I shall discuss now...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop reading for a moment and ponder the reviewer's story.

His comment was that he didn't understand it.  After looking at this bio (which was blank) and reading a few of his works, it was obvious that English wasn't his native language so I could understand his confusion.  What I didn't understand was why he bothered to rate it at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI politely responded, asking what he didn't understand.  Of course, I never heard back.  I then sent a second response and suggested if he didn't understand something, perhaps he should have passed it and not commented.  Again, I never heard back. The last time I checked, he was no longer on the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would have loved to have had a conversation with him.  Not everything I write is for all readers.  Unfortunately, in this situation, I foresaw:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you didn't understand what the story was about? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Story. Dead man. Speaks. No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh. What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Story. Dead man. Speaks. No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't understand about a dead man speaking?  Well, he was brought back to life to right the wrongs of his life. He wasn't really dead.  He was given a second chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Story. Dead man. Speaks. No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh.  OK.  Well, I'm glad we had this chance to talk.  By the way, I'm giving you one star for this conversation <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/rolling.png\" alt=\"*Rolling*\" title=\"Rolling\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI agree, negative comments aren't pleasant but they do help us as writers to see through the reader's eyes. I read each one with care and use it to improve my clarity when writing ... except when it's obvious that the negative comments really weren't about the craft of writing or the story line.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you so delicately put it, sometimes folks are just having a bad day <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/laugh.png\" alt=\"*Laugh*\" title=\"Laugh\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> and if they vent on one of my tales, then I guess in some twisted way, I've performed a service. <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/rolling.png\" alt=\"*Rolling*\" title=\"Rolling\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you have to make a decision:</font></span></div></div>",
