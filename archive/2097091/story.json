Heck, you just had to go to that party\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy family and I had decided that with this being my last summer home before I head off for college we were gonna have a big road trip across the country and spend a couple weeks in California. Not even half way through our time in California, I met a girl who invited me to this party. On my way there I witnessed a murder. I immediately called the police, and identified the guy who did it. Only it turns out the guy was a drug lord who, and after I testified in court he threatened to kill me and my family. No more than 5 minutes later my family and I were taken into protective custody and were on our way to live out the rest of our lives in witness protection. The only problem was that this drug lord has so many connections that we were going to be some of the first people put in a special, super top secret, witness protection. Based on the files they gave all of us, we were all going to be injected with this serum that will completely change our DNA so there would be no way in a thousand years they would find us. The only major problem was that to do this, all of us would have to become the opposite gender. My mom would be my dad, dad my mom. And I would be their daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the thoughts that looking in the mirror was bringing me, I left the bathroom and rejoined my family in the lounge area we were waiting in. As I sat next to my dad, I said \"I'm so sorry about all this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be\" he replied while placing a hand on my shoulder. \"You did exactly what your mother and I raised you to do. It's not your fault that this guy threatened us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but if I hadn't gone to that party I wouldn't have witnessed the murder. And we wouldn't be here right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were trying to have the best vacation possible. Your mother and I will never fault you for that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I just can't help but feel guilty because of this. I mean\" I said, before I was cut off by the one of the marshals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The plane is here, let's get going\" he said. With that, my parents and I picked up our bags and headed outside where a private jet was waiting for us. We all followed our marshal escorts out to where a jet was waiting for us. As we walked up the steps and entered the jet, I was blown away. I'd flown tons of times in the past, but this was a whole different thing. This plane had recliner chairs and couches. \"Wheels up in 5 minutes, I'd get comfortable\" the marshal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right because no more than 6 minutes later we were in the air and off to Seattle. Once we reached our cruising altitude, the marshals went over to a small closet and pulled out a metal briefcase. \"What's that?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the serums we will be injecting you with to change your DNA and make all of you new people\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt?\" My mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" the marshal replied. \"It has included in it a drug that will put you to sleep so you won't feel a thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" my dad stated. \"Let's get this started then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the marshals proceeded to give us the injections. It was no different than getting a flu shot at the doctors office, but unlike a flu shot it wasn't long before my vision started getting foggy and before I knew it I was unconscious. As I slept I thought about who I'd be when I woke up. So far, I was to be moved to the only body available a woman and I didn't know if I'd be average looking or beautiful, blonde or brunette, blue eyes or brown or green. All I knew was it would be like I was meeting a whole new person when I wake up. A person, who, I'd have to know everything about even though I was just meeting her for the first time. And who I would become..</span></div></div>",

Lighter in some places and heavier in others. Looking down I could see two modest bumps sticking out from my chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I remembered the serum as I sprang out of bed. I was in a hospital room by myself as I ran over to a mirror and looked at myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I saw could only be described at what I would guess I would have looked like had I been born female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I was much shorter now only about 5\u20197 compared to my 6\u20192 earlier. My skin was the same color but it was much smoother now as al body hair seemed to vanish off me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy chestnut brown hair was longer touching my shoulders. My nails were also longer and they seemed to be manicured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had two small to medium sized breasts sticking out on my chest. I guessed a solid B-cup or so. Not big or anything but very perky and sensitive. My penis had also been replaced as I saw a perfectly well trimmed Vagina were my once proud member had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall I was rather cute. My face was very feminine and I had nice curves, wide hips and a cute butt. I wasn\u2019t going to win any beauty contests but I was definitely cute looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door as I yelled realizing I was very naked. Seeing a hospital robe in the door I grabbed it and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slowly opened as a man in a white lab coat and another man wearing a black suit entered my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we feeling Brittany? Getting used to your new body? It\u2019s okay. My name is Dr. Thompson, this is Agent Mires with witness protection.\u201d He said in a friendly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are my parents? Are they okay?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes yes my dear. They have actually been up for hours now. They should be joining us shortly.\u201d Dr. Thompson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later I gasped as my parents walked in my room with their new bodies. My \u201cMom\u201d looked a lot like what I would have imagined my dad would look like as a woman as vice versa. Both of them seemed happy enough as they smiled to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally at this stage of the process you would all he in witness protection already and getting adjusted to your new lives...However...we have a problem.\u201d The Doctor said with a nervous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...are we in danger?\u201d My \u201cMom\u201d said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...no...it\u2019s your new daughter. I\u2019m sorry Brittany. Something didn\u2019t go right with your serum injection. It seems....well you are not done changing yet.\u201d The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What do you mean.\u201d I asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor turned off the lights as he turned on a PowerPoint and directed us to the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou notice here the blood work of both parents. Before and after the change. They are different but equally stable. The cells have adjusted to their bodies. Now take a look here at yours.\u201d The doctor said clicking to the next slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn my bloodwork the cells had changed but didn\u2019t seem to be stable. They seemed to be still changing shape slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems someone tampered with your serum. They added an additional formula. One we never would have used on someone like you.\u201d The doctor said nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat type of formula....?\u201d My \u201cDad\u201d asked with an angry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems her serum was spiked with a latent....Bimbo formula.\u201d The doctor said sweating our reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait....a what?\u201d I asked still a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor clicked to the next slide and showed a picture of a bimbo woman that was used as the base in the serum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in the slide had long flowing platinum blonde hair that reached down to her wonderful perfectly round ass. She had huge perfectly rounded boobs, wide curves, perfect hourglass shaped body. Long lucsious legs, tan skin, long manicured nails and puffy lips. She looked like the kind of Barbie doll you would see on a porno cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis template was used. Slowly your daughters body and even possibly parts of her personality will start changing to adjust to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell my parents wanted to freak out but I jumped out of my bed to stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean my personality will change?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParts is your personality will adjust to fit the new body. Your sexuality will increase dramatically. You will start craving things like sexier clothes, high heels, etc. you will still be you but you will have new desires.\u201d The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long does she have?\u201d My \u201cMom\u201d asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot long. At this rate maybe a few days maybe a week. Our tests show she will still be a healthy young woman once the changes are complete....just a...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a total bimbo.\u201d I said looking out the window. I could see several strands of my hair were already looking lighter so I knew this wasn\u2019t a joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will find out who did this. However in the mean time let me show you to your new home.\u201d Agent Mires finally said.</span></div></div>",

They read the device deliberately, as if expecting the words to change or disappear if they read it hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's enough to draw a smile to your face. As you wonder how that smile would look from behind those eyes. It's the sweetest pleasure to see their sudden jokes and insults vanish, and disbelief cross their faces. Even now, the disbelief was fading to sickening realisation that Doctor Hilton wasn't joking, that both would be joining him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your bodies will be stored rather than destroyed, for your return.\" Doctor Hilton assured them. They barely acknowledged he'd spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A month?\" Agent Cochran said weakly, a bare whispering mutter. Perhaps a question, but the Doctor nodded at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back from the table, he'd removed many of the photos. Other women who couldn't help <i>him </i>adjust to <i>her </i>new life, you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared the three of you were destined... doomed to become petite Asian women. Them for a month, and you for the rest of your life. Reading the back of your photo, you found your new name \"Sakura Watanabe\", the quotes suggesting to you, that it was as unreal as any other detail. However, a sickening realisation, came across you, as you realised before she'd been used as a whore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knot in the pit of your stomach, tight, cold and icy. Both agents look over the remaining photos, their hands scrabbling through the pictures as if looking for a male body. As if they wished, and tried hard enough they'd find one... find two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whispered shuffling of the photos slowed from the feverish rustling, until both had reluctantly selected their future bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whore.\" Agent Cochran silently mouthed the word. Either a question or an admission, but in either case the other agent nodded, her eyes looking just as horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crossed your face, as the foundation of a plan started to form. You might not have had quite <i>this </i>perspective before but you were used to the intrigues of the girls in your various stables. If they kept those timid expressions as women, they'd soon find themselves at the bottom of the pecking order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust wishing that whoring wasn't legal now, then you couldn't be facing this future yourself either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it is, and you are. The doctor leads you towards the exit. The agents glance back towards the door they came in, a sick look on their face at walking forward. Agent Cochran's feet are unsteady, his knees almost trembling threatening to give way. Agent Lachlan look pale and bloodless. His breathing shallow and rapid. You recognise the burgeoning panic in his features. The <i>'fight of flight'</i> mode now gripping him strongly.</span></div></div>",

The thought doesn't make you happy either, but you want to establish authority over them, as firmly as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, as we'll be fully legal you can pick your customers. You can choose to be lesbians if that's easier than facing a cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of dread on Lachlan's face, is as enjoyable as the last of the colour draining from Agent Cochran's. \"But even you'll know I look out for my girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProjecting as much confidence as you can, far more than you feel. You strut forward, away from the prep room. The doctor leads you into a short corridor. It looks antiseptic as though it belongs in a hospital. With only curtains to separate you from the agents, you settle into the large padded reclining chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing the squeak, as it tilts even further back, you allow Doctor Hilton to adjust the helmet. The urge to squirm and wriggle is overpowering, as that damned helmet is about to rip you from your body, and broadcast you into Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From this point onwards, everyone you'll meet will know you only as Sakura Watanabe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he's satisfied, the machine starts to whine, building power to a climax or some such. It reaches a steady tone quickly, and from either side, you hear a rising tone come from the flanking recliners. You hear the sound of sobbing coming from your right, and a faint whimpering coming from your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whine around your head makes it hard to distinguish what's being said. But you assume it's the same speech to the agents too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tones harmonise, and you feel the oddest sensation, as if you're being pulled out of your skull. Concentrating on your breathing, you keep it steady, as the curtain walls start to spin. Soon the centre is spinning faster, as if pulling you into a whirlpool. You can't tell if you scream, beg or stay silent, as the world blurs. Your soul feels like a twisted rope, straining to the point of bursting apart into threads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is just a vortex of spinning lights, and you feel the tension ease. The colours slow, as if unwinding, and you feel the world stop spinning. Despite what you know and expect, it's still a surprise to see you've shifted places. Taking a deep calming breath, you feel other changes... changes that confirm your new body. Glancing down, you see the sheets covering your body. It looks far too small, and vulnerable. Lifting the sheets confirms that you're fully female. Not heavily endowed, thank goodness, but obviously not going to pass for a man any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, you sit up in bed. You're alone in the room. The view out the window tells you that you're in a different city. Hell! If you guessed, a different time zone. Assuming the agents are waking nearby, you have to think about how you'll present yourself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing yourself off the bed, you find it's a little drop. Your legs too short to reach, walking the length of the bed and back, you keep one hand hovering over the sheets, ready to support you. Thankfully you don't need it, but as you concentrate you find that you're moving with a feminine gait. You have to concentrate to not swivel your hips. The instincts of this body serving to guide you for the basic mannerisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the bedside unit, you find a selection of clothes. Not ready for skirts, you find some resistance to the idea of wearing trousers. An urge to dress is strong, to cloak your nudity. Settling into the chair beside the bed, you struggle into the trousers. You hadn't realised how tight, how stretchy these things were. They cling to every curves you have, and as you pull them over your hips, you're glad you don't have a very curvy figure. It's a tight enough fit, to pull your fingers free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping on the spot, you pull them free. The jumping reminding you how much your new chest can ... and does move. Heaving the girls into what you guess is a sports bra, you wriggle into a sparkly top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready cursing the absence of meaningful pockets, you pick up the bag that's in there. A soft rattling tells you that it's already filled. You find a driving licence in your name, a couple of bank cards, and a few notes. There's also a phone in there too. One in a hideous pink, sparkly case. You rip the case away, that's not the personality you want to project. You toss it in the nearby waste basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your half-reflection in the window, you admire yourself from different angles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8bfafce42ffa07bf1ca6246dc49c5c2e/tumblr_pp32tyiQBY1w2lwkto1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/8bfafce42ffa...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b93b9140da23e2f081a2298a7c691948/tumblr_pp32tyiQBY1w2lwkto2_540.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/b93b9140da23...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e474bb3ecd2ec88e45d8267cc1cef22/tumblr_pp32tyiQBY1w2lwkto3_540.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e474bb3ecd2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft squeak of the trousers is unsettling, as are the heels you wear so easily.

The sound of movement comes from one of the nearby rooms, and you look into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vision of feminine beauty stands awkwardly in the room. A smile spreads across your face, as you take her in. It looks like she succumbed to the first recommendations of her subconscious.

Her head tilting like a confused puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kaori Kenada.\" she repeats. This time the frustration is clear. \"Kao-ri Ke-na-da.\" Slowly she says it again deliberately pronouncing each syllable. The frustration turning into fear, and dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her face is delightful, even if you suspect the same resistance to saying your former name exists too. You want the new arrivals to be off balance, making them more open to your influence. These former men aren't used to being judged on their looks, their clothes, their submissiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crash draws both of you from the spiral of concern and worry. Crossing the hall, you come across Agent Lachlan. Or at least that your best guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's dressed without exposing a bare midriff, but hardly any more subtly. The leather dress clinging to her body, snatching her hands away from the hem of her skirt. Those fingers plucking at it, attempting to pull it lower. However, the dress is absolutely not going to cover any more skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Misao Suzuki.\" Her purse tapping irregularly against her leg, drumming an anxious beat. With her free hand she plays with her hair. A sharp contrast to her crew-cut she wore just moments ago as a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both dressed to please mens' eyes.\" you smirk. Your <i>casual </i>comment made to undermine the new girls, get them to listen to your suggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you wanted women customers, rather than facing a stiff cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect is obvious, as they both fidget nervously, eyes wide, their bodies made for receiving cocks, and dressed to show their bodies off in a most pleasing manner. They don't even point out that, it was your suggestion rather than their hopes or wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking them firmly by the shoulders, you stand in their middle as if consoling them. \"Don't worry, with practice you'll get the right kind of attention. At the moment you're just too ... too obvious.\" you pitch your voice to sound sympathetic, as if you're softening your criticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Women are more refined, have higher, harsher standards for their custom, for their choices. You'll need to embrace your femininity, and dress appropriately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasking your smile, you see both women nod their comprehension, already bending to your will, accepting your suggestions. They barely think of anyone but themselves. They aren't asking about your looks, and your future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your arm firm, you march them out of the room. Your heels clicking in time as you pace towards the exit and your new life. As you walk, your arms slip lower, until at the base of their spine, you let them rest. A comforting hug of support, as you emerge into the light, you see quite how run-down this part of town truly is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands pat their arses appreciatively, wishing they were a little more padded. Wishing you had some 'Femilox', to boost their hormones, and curves. You need to watch your drinks aren't spiked with that particular drug.</span></div></div>",

I see yo-you're upset, but some of th-these profiles are perfectly enviable! L-look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks up a random picture, quickly assesses the back \u2014 but then quickly puts it down, a visible frown creasing his forehead. He repeats it a few times before you notice a pattern \u2014 the ones he doesn't elect to show you are the profiles of whores, prostitutes, and sex workers. It seems these profiles aren't as enviable as he would have thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, he finds some that fit his example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, this one has quite the cushy job, and a house all to herself! As long as you quickly adjust to being an <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">adult</font> model, you could live quite comfortably!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/2bd63e211171e6b7763c146aa70a5656/tumblr_noq8w5f4V61u3wdwxo6_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://66.media.tumblr.com/2bd63e211171e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eye her with a dry throat. She resembled one of the blonde girls you 'managed', almost down to a T. And by the sound of it, she did fairly similar things. The doctor continues, however, undeterred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this profile is only nineteen and already financially independent! <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Th-that may be because she works as a waitress</font> but you could... graduate highschool? Ah, I'm sure that's because she has so much on her plate \u2014 <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">we might have to install neural inhibitors elsewise.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7H6Tdyf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/7H6Tdyf.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like one of your 'perfect recruits': guileless, young, struggling a bit with her money. The youth you'd regain was a small boon, but small was the emphatic word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this profile has managed to work her way up to secretary, despite her lack of education! You could use y-your business acumen to maintiain her position!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/564fdf98464ffe216c2f0057c176e883/tumblr_mzltkc5IIe1rgf7zzo1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/564fdf98464f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the doctor's face. There's no ironic smirk or sign of trickery in his eyes. He genuinely believes that she was hired for her skills. The agents on either side, meanwhile, are disguising their mirth as coughing fits, their faces red and purple respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sift through the piles of profiles on the table with increasing fervor. It seemed the doctor was wholly honest about those being among the best there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind made up, you...</span></div></div>",
