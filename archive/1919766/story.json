She told me I was supposed to spent a month at your house.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, Sarah of course. Come in I'll show you around.\"<br>\r\nYou obeyed her and followed.<br>\r\n\"My name is Maria, so call me just that. Now I'm sure you noticed, but I run a kennel and we, me my daughters and you now, live in the back. It's a really nice place you'll see.\" she told you as she leaded you through the kennel before opening a door to what looked like a normal living room.<br>\r\n\"Here we are. My room and the girls' are upstairs. Right now, they are sleeping by friends of their so you'll meet them tomorrow. Do you want to eat something ?\"<br>\r\n\"If it doesn't bother you...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh it doesn't.\" she said as she gave you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
