You spotted someone up ahead, you decided you could use some company and ran up to him. It was a boy around your age of fifteen, he had spiky orange hair that was matted down by the purple headphones he wore that matched his purple shirt and shoes, the only thing not purple that he wore were his shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something familiar about this boy, but you couldn't put your finger on it. Suddenly the boy raised his arm and a large portal formed in front of the both of you. You screamed and ran in the opposite direction as the boy laughed derisively at your futile attempt. The force of the suction picked you up off your feet and sucked you into it, along with the orange haired boy. You knew no more after this for quite awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally woke up you found yourself laying on a soft smooth surface. You looked around and saw the boy's face smirking at you. Only he was huge! \"Wha-\" you began, but his booming laughter interrupted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence slave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped at his command, but nonetheless you continued to speak. \"What do you mean slave!?\" He grinned down at your puny form in his hand and made a fist that enveloped you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean just what I said, You're my tiny slave! You are going to do whatever I say!\" He laughed, blowing smelly hot air at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared down at you and suddenly tossed you into his mouth! He sloshed you around his hot damp foul smelling cavern of a mouth with his tongue. \"Mmmmm.\" He moaned at your taste. \"Please don't eat me!\"  You scream getting some of his saliva in your own mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this somehow, he grins and spits your sticky form out into his hand. \"Good boy...Now for the introductions....I'm Neku.....Thats Master Neku to you though....And you're just slave.....that okay with you? It is? Okay...first things first....\"</span></div></div>",

It was then you noticed you were no longer outside, but in some kind of abandoned apartment. The walls looked torn and covered with graffiti. Your view of the room suddenly flipped over as Neku tipped his hand and dropped you on one of his socked feet. The soft material of the sock cushioned the fall, but you still wondered why you were being placed on a foot in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's it smell like? I haven't taken off my shoes in awhile to check.\" your giant, teenage master asked from high above. The smell hit you like a ton of bricks as you grabbed your nose on impulse. It smelled like his sock was practically radiating horrible fumes. \"Not so good, I take it. Well, that's what happens when you buy cheap shoes like those: your feet practically suffocate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed and tried to crawl off the sock, but the smell was really messing up your senses. It was also very warm and was causing you to break out in a sweat. Neku laughed as he watched you crawl around in circles before shaking you off his foot like a bug. Before you could pick yourself off the floor, the socked foot came down on your back and compressed you against the ground. The orange-haired boy started to roll you under is foot and even give you a few squeezes with his toes before taking the foot off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better get used to that, you're my property now. As my slave, you'll also have to put up with a lot of stuff. Like, for example...\"</span></div></div>",

You just stared at your young captor, completely dumbfounded. Surely enough, he lifted one of his feet up, and after a brief moment of struggling with his dirty, sweaty sock he pulled it off his foot. The same he soon did with the second foot. You could smell the cheesy, putrid scent of foot sweat even a few miles away from his feet. Although these were miles to you, to any normal sized person you were only 3 centimeters away from his toes.<br>\r\n\"Well? They aren't gonna worship themselves\" you heard Neku speak. <br>\r\n\"No way!\" you said. \"There's no way I will serve your putrid smelling, cheesy feet! Clean them up before you shove them into my face, dammit!\"<br>\r\nYou'd soon regret these words, as you saw his foot slide towards you. The smell had gotten so hard and so intense, it was a bit overpowering. Then you looked at the foot and, well...<br>\r\nNeku had lifted his big toe up, and positioned his foot so that the toe would be right above you. <br>\r\n\"I'm not giving you a choice, bug. You're nothing more than my slave, and if you're not going to serve my foot you will die by my foot!\" <br>\r\nYou watched in horror, at the enormous sweaty and dirty wall of flesh that was Neku's big toe. The smell was so intense you could almost taste it.<br>\r\n\"Well, slave? You either walk up here and give it the best rubbing and licking you can, or you get smushed under it!\"</span></div></div>",

It's only right it gets some worship of its own, don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...No way! I don't agree!\" you scream as you dart in the opposite direction. Neku chuckles and take s few steps forward, easily catching up to you and scooping you up into his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pointless to run. You have no where to go, slave. No where but down, that is...\" Neku brings his hand behind his back and opens his pants and boxers with the other. \"...down my pants!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as the fingers let go, depositing you in darkness. You quickly feel yourself land on the smooth texture of Neku's young butt as you slide down it. You hear the snapping of Neku's pants as they're put back in place. Neku's white shorts push you into his round buttocks. Considering where you are, you'd expect it to be very hot and musky. While it was definitely hot, the smell wasn't that bad compared to his feet. Maybe it was because you weren't in direct contact with his crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your master start to walk, grinding you against his boxers with each step. Neku tried to ignore you and think about what he was going to do next, although it was kind of hard. It just felt so good to have a living being under your control. Neku was pacing around the apartment simply to pulverize you. Soon, though, he grew bored and decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were walking home after picking up some things for your mother at the local department store. The plastic bag swung back and forth in your hand. You looked at your watch and sighed. The day was still young, but there was nothing to do. You had no money to rent a movie and your video game system was at the repair shop after your brother wrecked it. With nothing to do, you had been forced to pick up tonight's dinner ingredients for your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm so bored. I wish there was something to do.\" you groaned as you scratched the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can help with that.\" spoke a sudden voice out of nowhere. It was so surprising that you dropped the bag you were holding. As the contents spilled over the sidewalk, you kneeled down to pick it all up while also taking a look at your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that? Where are you?\"\u009d The voice chuckled, but did not speak again. You were about to walk away when suddenly your stomach started to hurt. As you reached down to hold it, your head started to ache as well. \"Ugh. What's going on? I feel sick!\"\u009d You started to get dizzy before collapsing on the ground; knocked out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoken an unknown amount of time later, you felt something was wrong. The bag of groceries was gone and the ground didn't feel like a sidewalk. Thinking you had been picked up and placed on a bed or something, you looked around to notice you were still outside. If that wasn't bad enough, your frontal view was blocked by a giant torso! You looked up the white shirt to spot a boyish, smirking face topped with grayish hair. You recognized the giant as Joshua, a character from a video game you played a few weeks back. But why was he so big and why were you in his hand?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell by the look on your face you're pretty confused. They always are.\"\u009d he stated, scratching his chin as he reminisced  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you talking about? Why the hell are you so big?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua's smirk returned to his face as he peered down at you. \"I'm not big, you're small. You said you were bored so I shrunk you and brought you over to my world.\u00e2\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why on earth would you do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause I felt like it.\"\u009d He replied, curling a strand of his gray hair around his finger. His smug attitude was kind of annoying. He didn't even seem to care about what he just did. \"Anyway, here's deal. You were bored so I'm offering you the chance to become my own personal slave. How does that sound?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a horrible idea!\u00e2\" you shouted up at him. His expression didn't seem to change at all by your remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's your opinion and all. I'm not forcing you to be my slave; it's totally your choice, dude.\"\u009d He explained, continuing to stare at you with those piercing eyes of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, in that case\"\u009d you began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also get to choose whether you live or die. Your first choice determines your second, so it's two answers in one. Isn't that convenient?\"\u009d the white haired teenager smiled down at you, an expression not going with his threat a second before. He continued to smile as he awaited your answer. </span></div></div>",

You were still a few feet from the ground when you dropped, so the landing was a bit painful. As you laid there in pain, you noticed a shadow envelop everything. You quickly turned over onto your back just as the shoe of the giant landed on your chest. You yelped in pain as everything other than your head was pressed into the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow sad.\u201d Joshua said, high above you. \u201cI gave you a  chance to live, but you\u2019d rather be a squashed bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t choose anything!\u201d you yelled up at him as you tried to struggle free. All Joshua saw of your struggles, however, was your tiny head writhing as the rest of your body remained compressed under his foot. \u201cLet me go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an option. The options are either living as my slave or dying like an insect. Maybe I wasn\u2019t clear enough? If you want, we can try again. How about that?\u201d The giant sneered evilly, obviously enjoying the control he had over your life. This kid was a sadist. You remained silent, not having any intention of being this jerk\u2019s plaything. When Joshua didn\u2019t hear any response, he simply sighed. \u201cI see. Maybe you need some more motivation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Composer moved his foot so your upper body was no longer being pinned, but your legs were still trapped under the trends of his shoe. Joshua gently started to press down on your lower half, putting more strain on them by the second. You grunted in pain as you leaned up and tried to push the shoe off you. Your efforts were useless\u2026the shoe was just way too big for your tiny muscles to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pain will go away once you submit to me. Just say you\u2019ll be my slave and I won\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201d small cracks could be heard as your legs were beginning to fail. Tears started to fill your eyes as you bit your lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop\u2026your hurting me. You can\u2019t do this!\u201d you tried shouting at him. He just grinned the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t? But I already am. You think this hurts? How about this\u2026\u201d Joshua licked his lips as he put all his weight down, effectively crushing your lower body into nothing. You screamed like you never screamed before, but to Joshua it only sounded like a high-pinched squeak. You couldn\u2019t feel anything below your waist, and the pain was unbearable. Joshua lifted his shoe up, bringing you up with it for a few seconds before you fell off with a splat. Through your blurry eyes you could see that the bottom of Joshua\u2019s shoe was covered in a bloody mess, which could only have once been your legs. Joshua put the foot down next to you so you were positioned between both his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t heal. All you have to do is agree to serve me and I\u2019ll fix you right up. Continue to be disobedient and you\u2019ll be decorating my other shoe. So what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough your immense pain, you were able to choke out a response. A response that would decide your fate. </span></div></div>",

You wanted to glare up at him but you were too weak to do even that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...I'll be your slave!\" you shout up with your remaining strength. You think you're about to die, when the god-like voice above you answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I knew you'd come around.\" The Composer squatted down and moved his hand over your body. You thought for a second that he was going to smear your body across the pavement, but instead he stopped inches from your broken form. A white glow started to admit from his palm. The light washed over you and you felt a feeling of complete comfort. It was the exact opposite of what you've been experiencing up till now. You felt this way for only a few seconds before the light faded and Joshua took his palm away. You opened your eyes wide as you noticed the pain was gone. You looked down at yourself and saw your legs, good as new. Even your jeans had been reformed. You smiled and started to touch your leg, making sure they were real. You didn't have much of a chance, though, as two giant fingers grabbed hold of your leg and lifted you clean off the ground. You ascended for what seemed like miles until Joshua held you in front of his young, handsome face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better? Don't disappoint me, and you'll never have to feel like that again. Understand?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to your new master. Joshua looked satisfied by your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, let's go back to my pad. We have a lot to do.\"</span></div></div>",

Your favorite games were those in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and your favorite character was the blue blur himself. You thought of the speedy hedgehog as a hero and role model. One day, arriving home from school, you found a package at your doorstep addressed to you. Inside was a note with a lot of fancy words and lettering, but basically explained that you had won a random drawing contest and received a new Sonic game before it had even been announced. Without asking yourself when you had entered such a contest, you immediately searched the bottom of the box until you found a small game case. Your excitement peaking, you open the case without even reading the game\u2019s title and reach for the disk. The moment your fingers touch the surface of the game disk, you feel an electric shock and everything flickers in front of you. You can\u2019t stand on your feet anymore and they give in from under you. Everything goes black and you never feel yourself hit the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, you wake up to the sound of something crashing against the floor, followed by another crash and so on and so forth. You\u2019re laying on your stomach with you face staring at a wooden floor. You don\u2019t remember standing on a wooden floor as you slowly sit upright. Your head aches and your eyes are still blurry. To make things worse, that loud crashing noise is getting louder. Soon you notice that the floor quakes each time you hear the crash. You remain confused even when two, large masses of red slam down on either side of you. Your eyes widen in shock as you look back and forth between the two similar objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-huh?\u201d you mumble before looking around. With your eyes clearing up a bit, everything looks different. This isn\u2019t your house, sure, but why did everything look gigantic!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange. I thought I heard something coming from in here.\u201d boomed a loud, oddly familiar voice above you. You start to shake as you slowly start to look up. The color of red changes to blue, and the blue stretched hundreds of feet high. These red objects, you realize, were shoes. And towered right above you was none other than Sonic the Hedgehog. So many questions filled you mind, but you didn\u2019t give them too much thought. You were simply too frightened by Sonic\u2019s titanic form. One of the bright, red shoes lifted into the air as Sonic took a step forward. You watched the giant hedgehog walk right over you, never noticing your three inch form between his feet. As your fear struck eyes continued to watch Sonic walk away, you tried to think of a course of action. </span></div></div>",

Being a fan(atic) of the blue hedgehog, it only made sense to try and run after him(a bit difficult considering that even at walking pace, he vastly outdid your running pace given the scale involved). Considering his personality, he'd probably be willing to help... or at the very least, not hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuckily, the hedgehog didn't go out on a run, or you would have been in deep. He instead took a seat at a couch not too far - to him, anyways - from where you were, clicking on the television set as he laid back and crossed his legs. On closer inspection, it could be seen he was already getting bored... the hedgie always having had a habit of losing his sanity if he stayed in one place for too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile he was trying to find something interesting on the TV - which he obviously wasn't, given all the rude remarks he was making about the programming, his voice quite clear as he assumed nobody else was in the house - your tiny form advanced across the wooden floor towards the titanic hedgehog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou had ran towards him in the hopes he would see you(and to get there quickly before he left), but he was so busy fiddling with the stations he didn't notice the three-inch being steadily approaching him. Panting and exhausted, you arrived at his feet, hunched over as you tried to catch your breath... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t...A booming sound was heard as he set the remote down, not to watch a channel, but to get right back up. Knowing this was your only chance before he likely went on a run he wouldn't be back from in a while, you shouted at the top of your lungs while jumping, trying to get his attention. From your fanaticism with him, you knew he stood about 3'3'' (though at this size, he seemed larger than that... maybe he was for all you knew. You thought you'd never be able to be sucked into a game with him, either) in comparison to your 3'', so surely there was a chance he would notice you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStanding up, Sonic was about to take his first step on a trip towards the door... not running simply because he didn't want to tear up the floors.</span></div></div>",

Thinking it was just a bug, he was about to stomp it faster than you could say \u201csquish\u201d when he noticed the bug was acting a bit odd. Listening closely, he discovered his name being shouted by the bug. The bug also waving its arms, as if to get the hedgehog\u2019s attention. Sonic squatted down to get a better look at the bug, and sure enough the bug was actually a tiny human! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, what are you, little guy?\u201d Sonic asked, staring at you with his bright green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic, thank god! You have to help me!\u201d you yell up at him. Before you could start to explain what you needed help with exactly, Sonic grabbed you between two of his giant, gloved fingers and brought you up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question: what are you?\u201d Sonic repeated, holding you in front of his giant face.

Wasn\u2019t that obvious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, a human? I\u2019ve seen plenty of humans before, but none of them quite as small as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was shrunk!

You started realizing that getting Sonic's attention probably wasn't the best idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"whats wrong little buddy? you scared? heh heh heh\" Sonic chuckled evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou literally melted in fear as you gazed at the titanic hedgehog, and saw an expression from him you have never seen before a look of pure Evil. Soon in the matter of a second, The giant hedgehog grasped you in his gloved fist and began to slowly squeeze you. You screamed in pain as the fist was crushing your tiny form. you watched as once your idol and role model, laughed deeply as he was crushing you to death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was unbearable, you felt your skeleton slowly collapsing under the hedgehogs grip and all he did was laugh at your pain <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a blue blur fanatic, according to his personality, Sonic the hedgehog would never hurt someone innocent, never!. But then you soon realized, you were in Sonic's house with no one else except him. In his games he probably portrays himself as a hero for his fans, but in his house by himself hes a different hedgehog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the titanic hedgehog released his grip and let you lay on his palm exhausted, gasping for air and crying in pain. \"Aww is the little baby crying over a little boo-boo? hahaha\" Sonic laughed. This made you angry, you wanted to get up and punch him in the face but you were too mangled and in pain too even get up. plus you wouldn't stand a chance at your current size, the hedgehog would smash you easily so you just continued to lay there in pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn sudden shock the hand you were laying on closed up into a fist again and you looked up at the blue hedgehog and cursed at him. Suddenly the gigantic hedgehog grabbed your arm with his huge thumb and index finger \"Heh heh heh......lets see how much pressure a tiny human bone can take before it breaks. this should fun! Hahaha\" Sonic laughed You were then hit with a wall of  shock as you realized that the giant hedgehog was gonna snap your arm in two! you began yo cry knowing how painful that would be \"Noooo! please nooooo! Sonic please! don't break my arm\" you begged while crying your eyes out. \"dont worry........it will only hurt for a second hahahaha!\" sonic laughed evilly as he began to bend your arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced and groaned in pain as you felt your arm slowly bend out of place \"whoa! human bones are pretty fragile when there shrunk\"  the giant hedgehog said in fascination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour mind exploded with so many thoughts and questions........why is sonic doing this? he supposed to be a hero or am i gonna die here? your body was going numb because of the thoughts and immense pain. Everything you knew about Sonic was wrong..........Crrrcackkk!.........AHHHHHHHH!. you scream as loud as you could as your arm was bent 90 degrees the wrong way because of the titanic blue bully. \"Wow! thats freaking cool! Ive never seen someones arm bending that way before hahaha! it broke so easily too.....\" the blue hedgehog said laughing at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were wide and you were immobile. The pain was so severe you couldn't move, think, or even breath. you couldn't believe out of all the people in the world who would bully and torture you to death, the last person....or hedgehog would be your idol.....Sonic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic just gazed at your lifeless body in his fist and grinned in triumph. \"heh don't worry little buddy the fun isn't over yet\" Sonic boomed in your ears. You really couldn't stand hearing is voice anymore plus the fact his booming voice had already blown your ear drums and made them bleed. you wanted to kill him make him pay for torturing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Sonic's fist opened up and you fell through his hand and began plummeting to the hardwood floor. Eventually your body landed hard on the floor causing more of countless broken bones to break. You didn't even try to break the fall because you fell unconscious during the fall. You just laid there helplessly with the titanic hedgehog towering over who was laughing \"hahaha hopefully you wake up in time to dodge my foot little guy heh heh heh\" The giant exclaimed as he lifted his bright red shoe high above you and began to slowly bring it down to crush you............. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, fate would not allow that and forced you to wake up to this cruel reality. As you stirred awake, you immediately felt the intense pain from your legs. They had been severely injured from the fall. You howled in pain as you just lied there, tears streaming down your face and blood dripping from your ears and mouth. Sonic heard your screams and chuckled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou woke up, eh? Good for you.\u201d the giant bully said in a mocking tone. You looked up in the direction of his voice, but did not see his evil face grinning down at you. Instead, you saw the dirty bottom of his bright, red shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sonic, what are you doing?\u201d you ask, practically choking out the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing much\u2026I\u2019m just going to crush you.\u201d Sonic replied in a calm voice, smiling widely. \u201cBetter dodge if you want to live, human.\u201d You heard Sonic cackle as his foot continued to decent upon your frail body. You were in a very bad position; your right arm and both your legs were useless. The only thing you could do was roll onto your stomach and use your left arm to drag your broken body to safely. It didn\u2019t take long for you to realize how pointless your efforts were; Sonic\u2019s shoe was just too huge for you to escape this way. Eventually you just gave up and squeezed your eyes shut, wishing this nightmare away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was still there, so you hadn\u2019t woken up or anything. You thought Sonic\u2019s foot should be on top of you by now, so you turned your head around to see the giant blue runner taking his foot away and smirking down at you with that face you had once loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI changed my mind. It would be a waste to squash you right now. It\u2019s not every day a shrunken human turns up in my house; I have to milk this chance for everything its got!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sonic\u2026you said you\u2019d\u2026help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic put his hands on his hips and continued to smirk down at your mangled body. He just stared at you for a few seconds before saying, \u201cI will, little buddy. You\u2019d live a miserable life at this size, so I\u2019ll do you a favor and put you out of your misery\u2026eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic started laughing hysterically while you stared up at him in shock before beginning to sob again. You were glad to be alive; you still had a life to live. However, if Sonic was just going to kill you later, you would rather just get it over with now instead of going through more painful suffering. </span></div></div>",

You didn't bother to turn around to see his face evilly grinning down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"j-just....k-kill.....me\" you choked out as best you can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gigantic hedgehog ignored you and held the green jewel above you.

Because im gonna keep torturing your pathetic little body and when you eventually die ill just bring you back to life and start the process over.....and over......and over again! Muwhahahaha!\"  The hedgehog Laughed manically. You couldn't believe what he said. You remember playing the games where hes doing nothing but being everyone's hero and here you are At his mercy begging for your life. Your brain was malfunctioning you couldn't believe the same Sonic you played as in the games was the same one grinning evilly at you right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sonic why are you doing this to me!?! why are you tutoring me? why are your causing me pain? i didn't do anything to you........you were my hero.......why sonic why?\" you asked the blue titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"why?......you wanna know why?\" Sonic roared in anger at you causing to jump in fright and then suddenly he started laughing deeply \"the reason why is............is because i can\" then sonic began to laugh loudly literally tearing the insides of your brain from the immense volume <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now were gonna play a new game.....its called stomped!.....the rules are simple.......i try to crush you under my sneakers and you have to make it out of my house, once you do ill restore you to original height and let you go free.\" Sonic these flashed his emerald and this time a blue aura engulfs you \"i have given you 3 lives.......once your out of lives that's it your dead. ready.....Go!' Sonic stated as he quickly slammed  his foot down and stomped you once again \"heh heh 2 lives left!\" Stated the giant bully as he lift up his foot and revealed your crushed body which then healed back to perfect health again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you fuckin cheater! thats not fair!\" you shouted at the titanic being. Sonic just responded with slamming his foot down to squash you again. with shear luck you roll out of the way before the massive sneaker could claim another one of your lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr stop moving so i can squish you!\" Sonic said in frustration as he stomped again and you avoided <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"this games is gonna be harder than i thought\"  you thought to your self that this was your chance to live to see your family again run or get squashed!      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you dodged another attempt by Sonic to crush you, you glanced over at the front door and noticed it was open. That was good, since you now had a direct exit to the outside. If it had been closed, things would have been much more difficult. You focused on your door to freedom and dash toward it, occasionally keeping an eye on the floor for a shadow that signaled Sonic\u2019s foot was right above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at rolling, human, but how long can you keep it up?\u201d Sonic asked mockingly as continued to try and stomp you. After dodging his foot for the eighth time, you began to realize what he meant. All this dodging was taking its toll on your body. Your muscles felt sore and you had slowed down considerably. Sonic, on the other hand, hadn\u2019t even broken a sweat. You watched a shadow fall over you again and tried to dodge, but your legs wouldn\u2019t obey and you ended up falling on your stomach. Sonic smirked triumphantly as he watched you fall and lowered his red sneaker on you slowly. \u201cDid you honestly think you could escape from me? I\u2019m the fastest thing alive, runt.\u201d You tried to crawl out of the way, but soon felt the massive hedgehog\u2019s foot on your back. Sonic slowly began to apply pressure on your minuscule form and you felt pain shoot through your entire body. You screamed in pain and begged him to stop, but the cruel blue titan just pressed down on you more. He moaned, as if in pleasure, as he heard your bones start to crunch and pop. He finally put all his weight on his foot and felt the resistance underneath it just vanish with a final crunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one left,\u201d the giant hero cooed as he lifted his sneaker off the floor and inspected your squashed body for the third time. \u201cThen you\u2019re gone.\u201d Sonic chuckled coldly as he scraped your mushy, pasty remains on the wooden floor and watched you reform, clothes and all. You dropped to your hands and knees and panted loudly. The first two deaths had been quick and painless, but this one had been different. You had felt your skeleton collapse on itself\u2026you had felt yourself die. Now you were back to normal and perfectly fine. It felt so weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty of time to rest in the afterlife, bug.\u201d Sonic boomed as he raised his foot over you, ready to snuff out that last, insignificant life of ours. He stomped down, but you had already taken off again for the door. \u201cWhat?!\u201d The emerald had not only healed your ruined body, but it also replenished your energy! Sonic cursed at this minor setback, took a few steps toward you, and raised his foot over you again. He was ready to end this little game. With all his speed and power, the mighty blue god stomped down with all his strength. However, with an increase in force comes a decrease in accuracy, and the foot missed you entirely. Instead, Sonic\u2019s red sneaker went right through the floorboards and made hole in his floor. Not only that, but the force of the impact was so great that it swept you off your legs and a few feet closer to the door! Sonic\u2019s eyes widened as he noticed he had failed to squash you and helped you instead. He growled in frustration and moved to end you, but found his foot stuck in the floorboards! He frantically tried to pull his foot free while glaring at you angrily. \u201cCome back here you fucking insect so I can squish you! I\u2019ll make sure your last death is long and excruciatingly painful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored Sonic\u2019s voice and focused on one thing: freedom. Your friends, your family, your normal size, your old life. If you could just make it out that door you\u2019d win Sonic\u2019s cruel game and have a chance of having it all back. The outside was so close\u2026you were almost there. The fresh breeze coming in through the door felt so nice\u2026</span></div></div>",

He continued to stare at you in anger. Then out of nowhere he began to grin evilly which got you confused. You won the game and beat him why was he smiling? Soon you felt a loud boom behind you and a dark shadow casts over you. You strain to turn around and saw a black hedgehog Giant and his air-shoe only inches from crushing you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son-of- a-....\" before you can say the last word the colossal Air-shoe stomps down and you flattens with a thoom. \" Sonic....are you home?' Shadow said looking in while standing in the doorway. Shadow then noticed his rival laying on the floor laughing hysterically \"Sonic.....you okay? and whats so funny?\" Shadow asked curiously as he helped the hedgehog who was laughing out of control out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its nothing shadow......heh heh heh you lost you little runt.....\" Sonic said aside to himself but shadow heard. Shadow just brushed it off not caring at all <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Sonic.....Doctor Eggman is attacking the city again\" Shadow ordered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.....alright! Some more adventure!\" Sonic shouted. Shadow again didn't understand when Sonic said \"more\" but brushed it off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both hedgehogs left the house, both stomping on your already crushed, red past of a body. Shadow didn't notice but Sonic did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hold on....i forgot to lock the door\" Sonic said smiling a little as climbed the steps again and then he stomped on your body again and smeared it all around enjoying the sound of your bones crunching \"heh heh heh......i never lose!......Never!\" Sonic stated to himself<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sonic what are you doing? Come on lets go!\" Shadow shouted from the sidewalk \"Sorry shadow i just had to crush a pesky  bug\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in a flash both hedgehogs were gone, leaving behind the red paste that was once your body.

Sonic was stills stuck in the hole behind you and had no way of stopping you from emerging victorious. At least, that\u2019s what you thought before you felt a tremendous gust of wind hit you in the face and blow you several feet backwards! That last thing you saw before you went flying backwards was a blue blur passing you by. As you stand up and hold your dizzy head, you hear the sound of your doom: the door closing. Your eyes go wide as you look toward the door and see Sonic, one hand leaning against the door and the other placed on his hip. He\u2019s grinning at you\u2026a sick and demented grin that you never thought he could make till now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad, little buddy, and you were so close too.\u201d Sonic says as he slowly approaches you, cracking his knuckles as he advances. You fall to your knees, no longer having any hope of surviving. Tears seem to automatically fall from your eyes as Sonic\u2019s feet place themselves on either side of you. The sexy blue hedgehog looks down at you with  not a glimpse of pity. \u201cYou stupid, tiny human. Have you ever heard of the great Sonic the Hedgehog losing? I sure haven\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know this is it for you as Sonic raises his foot over you. You\u2019re about to become a stain on the bottom of your video game idol\u2019s sneaker. He\u2019ll be running off on his adventures while you\u2019ll be dead and forgotten. You squeeze your eyes shut and cover you head, awaiting the blue god\u2019s judgment\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ring*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you think of when you hear this is that Sonic as squashed you and you\u2019re hearing heavenly bells. You open your eyes, however, and discover it\u2019s just his doorbell\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck, horrible timing.\u201d Sonic curses as he puts his foot down and glances over at the door. Without looking at you, the giant points at you and says, \u201cStay put. I\u2019ll deal with you in a minute.\u201d before walking toward the door. You do as he says and just sit there, seeing no other choice. There\u2019s nowhere to hide nearby and by the time you did reach anything to conceal yourself, Sonic would be through with the person at the door and come back to stomp you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speedy hero opens the door and is met with the vastly more mature face of Shadow. The black hedgehog is tapping his foot against the ground impatiently and seems to be in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want, Shadow? I\u2019m kinda busy\u2026\u201d Sonic says to his black furred friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Eggman, he\u2019s attacking the city again! You need to get over there right now!\u201d he replies, practically shouting in the teenage hedgehog\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn Eggy, he has the worse timing. I\u2019ll be right there, I just need to grab something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?! We don\u2019t have time for that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust go ahead of me, I\u2019ll be right behind you. Heck, I\u2019ll probably get there before you!\u201d Sonic chuckles as he turns around and walks back into his house. Shadow just rolls his eyes at his rival\u2019s smugness and dashes off, leaving you alone with the blue bully once again. Sonic stands over you and puts his hands on his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, runt, it looks like our little game just got interrupted. Let\u2019s call it a draw, shall we?\u201d he says to you as he reaches down and grabs you with his sweaty, gloved hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Does that mean I can live?\u201d you ask, shuddering before your blue god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026for now. However\u2026\u201d Sonic brings you closer to his face and smiles widely, showing his sharp and white teeth to you. \u201cYou\u2019re going to wish I had crushed you, human.\u201d </span></div></div>",

With his smelly sneaker in one hand and you in the other he held you above is sneaker and realized what was to come. \"No! Nooo! please! don't put me in there!\" you pleaded. Sonic just showed his trademark grin and dropped you in the shoe. Inside the shoe it was the worst smell you have ever experience! you almost passed out but you were determined to get out of there but then you felt the shoe lower to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen landing on the floor you immediately look up and saw the hedgehog grinning evilly and slowly bringing is foot down to the shoe \"enjoy the smelly ride! runt!\"  the bully bellowed from above. you instantly ran to the tip of the shoe to avoid being crushed. you helplessly watched the massive socked foot enter the rank prison and slowly approaching you. you tried to step back further but was only in the wall of the shoe. The large socked toes then began pressing you tightly against the wall of the shoe crushing your ribs. You could tell what was worse the pain or the smell. Our supposed hero finally latched his shoe and began to move and stretch his foot and toes around playfully causing you to slide underneath his foot. \"Heh heh heh poor little fella, i kinda feel bad for the runt!.....\" Sonic said lying to himself as he took a step towards the door. You felt the shoe lifting into the air and then crashing down with a thoom. You groaned as all the hedgehogs weight was on you! you weren't crushed because of the squishy insole and his squishy foot itself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlike a complete dick, he stops purposely and put all his weight on his right foot crushing you even more \"Huh? what was i supposed to do again?\" The sexy blue bully said sarcastically as he knew he was crushing you \"oh yeah! the city...right......i swear those humans are so pathetic and worthless. Why cant they just save the city from villains for themselves?\" Sonic said annoyed. you couldn't believe at what sonic said. He sounded far worse a villain than doctor Eggman himself. Sonic then was hit with a brilliant idea. He pulled out the chaos emerald and gazed at it........and grinned evilly as he thought of his vicious plan.....  </span></div></div>",

If having one tiny bug to toy around with was fun, what about a few more? His so called \u201cfriends\u201d would finally be useful for a change. Sonic grinned toothily and took off toward the city, wanting to hurry up and take care of Eggman. Once he ad arrived in the city, he heard noises coming from the center of town. He followed his ears until he came across one of Eggman\u2019s giant robots fighting Knuckles. While the red echidna dealt with that, Shadow and Tails were busy directing the humans to safety. Sonic scoffed at their efforts; why worry about the pesky humans? They\u2019d thank us for saving them even if there were a few casualties. Without wasting another second, Sonic joined Knuckles in fighting Eggman. With the blue hero\u2019s help, it only took a minute or two before Eggman\u2019s newest machine was a heap of scraps and the evil Doctor was retreating in his Egg-o-Matic, shouting at the blue menace in anger. With the danger gone, Knuckles walked over to Sonic and put one of his strong hands on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose were some nice moves, Sonic. I could have beaten him in one punch, though.\u201d Knuckles boasted. As he said this, Shadow and Tails had finished leading the civilians to safety and joined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time you got here, Sonic.\u201d Shadow said, folding his arms over his chest and glaring at the blue hedgehog. \u201cWhat was that about getting here before me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust ignore Shadow, Sonic. You were awesome!\u201d Tails praised, looking up at his best friend with a smile. \u201cI caught that last move you pulled; it was amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you expect, little buddy? I\u2019m Sonic the Hedgehog!\u201d Sonic grinned triumphantly while Knuckles and Shadow rolled their eyes and Tails nodded in agreement. \u201cAnyway, what do you guys say we celebrate this victory at my house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, Sonic!\u201d Tails exclaimed. \u201cWe can all chip in and buy a bunch of snacks too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can count me in.\u201d Knuckles spoke up. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of guarding the Master Emerald 24/7, so a little relaxation sounds great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pass\u2026\u201d Shadow muttered. \u201cI have better things to do than hang out with you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on, Shadow!\u201d Tails looked up at the black hedgehog with puppy dog eyes. \u201cYou never hang out with us! Just for a little while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow stared at Tails for a few seconds before finally giving in. \u201cFine, but just for a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails cheered and the four friends headed off together. Occasionally, Sonic would smirk as he imagined one of his friends a few inches tall and at his mercy. He couldn\u2019t wait to get home and have some real fun. As he walked, he could still feel poor you squirm under his socked foot. You were still alive, but probably in a lot of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*A little while later, at Sonic\u2019s house*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the four guys entered Sonic\u2019s house, they turned the living room table into a snack table consisting of popcorn, chips and dip, pizza, soda, and other junk food. Tails sat down on Sonic\u2019s comfy sofa and watched one of his favorite movies while stuffing his face with snacks. Knuckles was taking the time to do some exercises while occasionally gulping down a can of soda. Shadow just leaned against a wall with his eyes closed, sometimes cracking an eye open to glance around the room and scoff at Sonic\u2019s design choices. Sonic was alone in the kitchen, busy taking his right shoe off. Once he had tugged it off, he held it upside-down over the kitchen table and watched your minuscule body tumble out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, runt! Did you enjoy the ride?\u201d Sonic asked in a taunting tone. He watched you wobble to your feet while clutching your side, obviously in a lot of pain. \u201cLooks like some of your ribs are broken. Let me fix that for you.\u201d Sonic held out his Chaos Emerald and the same soothingly light from before engulfed your body. Your pain faded away as your shattered ribs healed. \u201cThere we go, good as new! I need you in tiptop shape before the real fun begins!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? What are you going to do to me?\u201d you asked, fearing for your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just what I\u2019m going to do to you, but also what I\u2019m going to do with my guests.\u201d Sonic pointed in the direction of the living room and cast an evil smile at you. You gaped up at the hedgehog as you understood what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Sonic, you can\u2019t! You can\u2019t shrink them, they\u2019re your friends! They always stuck by you and helped you as you saved the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh, runt! Those \u201cfriends\u201d of mine are a bunch of annoying pests! Knuckles thinks he\u2019s stronger than me, Shadow thinks he\u2019s the fastest hedgehog, and then there\u2019s Tails. That little brat has always followed me around! He\u2019s always calling me over to his workshop so he can show me one of his inventions that I couldn\u2019t give a damn about! I\u2019m going to enjoy putting them all in their place.\u201d Sonic chuckled menacingly as he peered at his reflection in the emerald. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re a monster!\u201d you scream up at him, tears streaming from your eyes as you\u2019re forced to see the true nature of your idol. It hurts even more than being crushed under his giant foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment, kid.\u201d Sonic put his hands on his hips and grinned down at you. </span></div></div>",

Then the blue hedgehog began to laugh deeply while looking into the chaos emerald. \"Hey Sonic are you ok?\" Tails asked frightened. Sonic just ignored them and laughed louder. \"What so funny?\" The black hedgehog asked very annoyed. you screamed as loud as you can telling them to run away, but it was useless they couldn't hear you, especially because of Sonic's laughter. \"You pathetic fools! you should bowing down to your master!\" Shouted the blue hedgehog with power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles and Shadow became aware that something wasn't right Sonic or so they think. Tails was extremely frightened, he never heard Sonic laugh so demonically like that nor saw that evil grin on Sonic's face before. \" What are you talking about....\"your master\"?\" Knuckles asked with an angry expression. \"Heh heh heh Oh! you'll soon find out!\" Sonic snickered as he held up the emerald. It began to glow brightly as you watched as Tails, Knuckles and Shadow were heading for the same fate as you. Soon The three began to feel uneasy and then they noticed that Sonic started to get bigger, but he wasn't growing they were shrinking! When the shrinking stopped Tails, Knuckles and Shadow were only a mere inches tall and stared up in terror at the giant blue hedgehog towering over them. They stepped back from the giant as the expression on Sonic's face meant trouble was ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look! bugs! i think ill crush them!\" Boomed the giant sexy hedgehog as he raised he foot over them. Sonic knew they would dodge the stomp but this was only a distraction. Sonic lowered his foot smiling evilly, then Knuckles grabbed Tails by the hand and the three jumped to the right dodging the massive sneaker that crashed down with a loud Boom. Before they could recover they felt a giant gloved fist close around them and they were hoisted into the air. Soon they were met with the Devil's gigantic face, they've never seen such an evil face before especially not from Sonic. For once Shadow was actually scared of Sonic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic hedgehog began to squeeze his fist tightly causing his three little friends to scream out in pain which amused the giant. \"Look at you three.....squirming like puny insects under my grip!  How....fucking.....pathetic!\" Boomed the sexy giant. The hedgehog laughed at his victims as he got a glass cup from the cabinet and then went back to the kitchen table where you were. You couldn't believe that Sonic would actually torture someone to death but torture his friends? no one else would have believed it unless they saw it. The hedgehog then dropped his friends on the kitchen table next to you and you watched them cough up blood in pain, it was a horrible sight. \"Look at you pathetic insects! Hmph! your all not even worthy of being in my presence\" Sonic cooed with a grin. You just ignored his words as you attended to the others. Soon Sonic felt a little uneasy and began to put his hands on his crotch \"Oh! i think i had too much soda!. you insects wait here until i get back from the bathroom i gotta take a piss But just to make sure you don't escape\" Sonic boomed as he encased all of you in the glass cup on the table \"ill be back to have fun with all of you in a bit hahaha\" said the blue bully as he was soon gone in a blue flash......... </span></div></div>",

They were still able to stand and examine their surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Sonic shrank us!\u201d Knuckles yelled, looking as if his Master Emerald had just been broken again. \u201cAnd who the hell are you?\u201d the red echidna pointed at you and you backed away from his angry stare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSettle down, hot head.\u201d Shadow said as he wiped some blood from his mouth and gazed at you. \u201cDid Sonic shrink you too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026no, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d You answer, thinking back to when you first arrived in this world. \u201cI just appeared here at this size. I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026well, we\u2018re in this together now.\u201d Shadow turned his gaze from you to Tails, who was still sitting on the ground with tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sonic\u2026why?\u201d Tails whimpered, not understanding why his best friend would do this to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWipe those tears away, Tails! This must be the true Sonic. I always thought he was hiding something\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! This doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d Tails shouted, getting to his feet. \u201cSonic wouldn\u2019t do something like this! Something must be wrong! Maybe Eggman did something to him\u2026or maybe he\u2019s being possessed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to hope something\u2019s wrong with him too.\u201d you reply to him, looking equally sad. \u201cRight now we have to get out of here! If we just sit here, Sonic\u2019s going to come back and kill all of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what do we do if we get out of here?\u201d Knuckles inquires, folding his arms over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I may have an idea.\u201d Shadow answered and pointed in the direction of the living room. \u201cI always carry a Chaos Emerald with me. When I got here, I put it down on the coffee table with all the snacks. If we can get over there, I can use the emerald to turn everyone back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it!\u201d Tails raised his voice and wiped the tears from his eyes. \u201cI want to get back to normal and do something to help Sonic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCount me in! Maybe a few punches will snap Sonic back to his old self!\u201d Knuckles exclaimed before bringing his fist back and giving their glass prison a mighty punch. The strike was enough to crack the glass a little, allowing Shadow to kick the weak spot and make a small opening for them to escape through. When the four bugs were out of the glass, they ran to the edge of the table and peered down at the ground below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what?\u201d you ask the other three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can fly us down, but I can only take one of you at a time.\u201d Tails suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll take too long. Sonic will come back and we\u2019ll all be dead bugs. I have a better idea; you two grab onto me.\u201d Shadow said as he glanced at Knuckles and you. The two of you nodded and grabbed onto the older male\u2019s arms. In the next moment, Shadow jumped into the air and started his freefall toward the floor below. You thought you were going to go splat against the ground, but suicide was not Shadow\u2019s idea. Right before the three of you hit the ground, Shadow released a huge gust of air from his shoes which stopped their decent and let them hover in the air for a couple seconds. Shadow stopped the output and you all landed safely on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that was awesome!\u201d you said, complimenting the Ultimate Lifeform\u2019s quick thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave the praise for latter.\u201d was Shadow\u2019s response before he looked back up at the table. \u201cCome on, Tails!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fox looked down for a moment before glancing over at the living room. His face suddenly filling with courage, Tails looked back down at Shadow and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fly over to the emerald first! I\u2019ll see if I can find it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Tails!\u2019 Knuckles shouted up at his young friend. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous!\u201d Tails did not listen to the echidna as his twin tails began to spin and he took off, racing though the air toward the living room. To a normal sized person, Tails would appear like a slightly oversized house fly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that kid think he\u2019s going?! Damn him!\u201d Shadow cursed and took off after him. Since he was injured, he could not run at his full speed. He was still much faster than you and Knuckles, who struggled to keep up with the black speedster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic sure is taking a long time in the bathroom\u2026\u201d you mumble to yourself, hoping that he\u2019ll take a bit longer. The last thing you wanted was for him to come back and find you all trying to escape. </span></div></div>",

Tails had finally made it on top of the living room table \"hey guys look i made it!\" Tails said screaming from on top the towering table. Then the 3 of you cringed as the giant hedgehog appeared in the living room. The giant noticed the tiny orange form on the living room table and began to approach it. \"Tails! Fly away Now!\" Yelled Knuckles \"Hes Behind you!\" you yelled. Tails just scratched his head confusingly as he couldn't entirely make out at what you and Knuckles had said. Tails then felt the table began to shake vigorously and turned around and saw the towering Hedgehog slowly stomping towards him with a vicious evil grin \"i....see.....you!\" cooed the sexy hedgehog. Tails was literally frozen in place from the amount of fear than consumed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails what are you doing? Run!!!\" knuckles yelled in anger. The black hedgehog cursed out as he sped off to save the terrified fox boy. Shadow ran as fast as he could despite his injuries, also losing his balance running every time the God took a step. Finally reaching the table he jumped up amazingly making it all the way up in one jump. Unfortunately Shadow made it too late as the titan already made it to the table and was reaching down to grab Tails. \"Don't you fucking touch him!!!\"  Shadow roared in rage as he dashed off in Tails direction. Sadly he was not fast enough, he got only inches away, so close that he heard the sound of bones crunching as the gigantic gloved fist wrapped around his fox friend. The black hedgehog watched helplessly as the gloved fist took away his friends and brought it up to the giant's face. \"Looks like this little pesky bug tried to run! how dare you!!!\"  Bellowed the giant as he squeezed his fist harder. The Pain was so gruesome he was considered half dead. Tails' ribcage collapsed entirely under the massive hedgehog's Intense grip. \"S-Sonic........w-why are you.......d-doing this.......t-to me. Y-Your my best........f-friend!\" Tails manage to choke out. Sonic just looked at him blankly then out of nowhere Laughed out load with his face to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend? hah! i was never your friend! i would never befriend someone as pathetic and weird as you! you got two tails! what a freak! the day i met you i literally cringed inside when you asked to be my friend! but i needed a sidekick, someone hideous enough to make me even more good looking! hahaha\"  Shadow and Knuckles were shocked at those words. They were mortified that Sonic could even say something so terrible especially someone who cared for dearly cared for him. Then the Blue God's belly growled and at your size it was loud. \"ooh someones hungry!\" Sonic snickered as he continued to eye Tails' almost lifeless body. \"Mhmm i think i found a way to punish you!......ooh i wonder what fox taste like?' Said the giant as he held his head back, took the orange foxboy by his twin tails and began lowering him into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" Knuckles yelled in rage as he charged the Giant's massive sneaker and began pounding on it. Sonic stopped and peered down at his shoe and chuckled as he saw how pathetic Knuckles actions were. \"pathetic echidna!\" Sonic Bellowed as he brought his foot back and lightly kicked the tiny echidna which was more than enough to send Knuckles flying across the room. \"now where was i? oh yeah!.....lunch time heh heh\" Sonic laughed as he finally lowered tails into his mouth but was interrupted \"i swear if you continue any further hedgehog was will end your very existence!\" yelled the black hedgehog. The God took the fox boy out of his mouth and said \"Please! tell me how your gonna end my life? im sexier, bigger and stronger than you! i could squash you with my pinky! plus with out this.....\" Sonic stopped as he grabbed Shadow's emerald off the living room table and taunted it in front of him \"you have no chance!!! Muwhahahahahaha!!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Shadow just watched helplessly as the Giant hedgehog laughed in your faces as Knuckles was unconscious and Tails was about to met his end......       </span></div></div>",

The last thing Tails saw was the wet, dark mouth of his best friend before the pain became too much and he slipped into unconsciousness. Shadow and you watched helplessly as Sonic dropped the young Tails into his mouth and shut it closed. The blue bully swished the tiny morsel around his mouth, getting a good feel of his texture. He began to moan as he took in Tails\u2019 flavor, all while peering down at you with an evil glint in his eye. In order to taunt you further, the cruel giant popped two furry tails out of his mouth and held them with his lips. You turned your head away in disgust as Sonic sucked on the twin tails, getting as much flavor out of his sidekick as possible. Finally, Sonic slurped the tails back into his mouth like spaghetti and used his pink tongue to send the young genius to the back of his throat. One loud gulp later and the poor fox boy\u2019s unconscious body was sent down Sonic\u2019s gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for trying to escape, freak. You tasted pretty good, though.\u201d Sonic taunted his meal as he patted his flat belly. \u201cOne down\u2026three to go.\u201d Sonic looked down toward the table and grinned at Shadow, who stared up at his rival with pure detest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for this, Sonic!\u201d Shadow yelled up at the blue giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, faker. You\u2019re going to be next!\u201d Sonic replied as he reached down to grab Shadow. The black hedgehog wasn\u2019t one to let his emotions take control of him, though. Instead of being paralyzed with fear and regret, Shadow moved quickly and jumped into Sonic outstretched arm. As he ran up the giant limb, Sonic snarled and put Shadow\u2019s emerald  back on the table so he could have a free hand to swat the bug with. Shadow dodged the hand and continued running over the sexy god\u2019s body. He tried using Chaos Spear, but his attacks didn\u2019t even graze the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two hedgehogs were preoccupied with each other, you took the chance to run over to Knuckles unconscious body. You tried shaking him awake, but he was knocked out cold. Instead, you slumped one of his arms over your shoulder and hoisted him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to find someplace to hide. It\u2019s too dangerous to be out in the open like this.\u201d you say to yourself as you walk away from Sonic\u2019s towering form. Knuckles is heavy (being quite muscular), so your retreat is very slow. It\u2019s better than just standing still and waiting to be captured by Sonic again, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Sonic and Shadow, the bigger of the two is starting to get pissed off at the agile little bug. He had dodged every one of Sonic\u2019s attempts to squash him, but Sonic wasn\u2019t going to give Shadow the chance to rest. Finally, one of his strikes almost hit Shadow and the gust of air created from the impact sent Shadow spiraling off his body. Sonic smirked and took the chance to clap his hands together, aiming to squash the pesky faker between his palms. When the teen separated his hands and examined them, he found  no trace of Shadow\u2019s remains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me, hedgehog!\u201d came Shadow\u2019s voice. Sonic looked around to try and find out where it was coming from. \u201cYou seemed to have forgotten that I can use Chaos Control without a Chaos Emerald in my hands!\u201d Sonic finally realized the annoying voice was coming from on top of his head. He angrily swatted at the shrunken hedgehog, but only managed to hit himself. Shadow used Chaos Control again to warp down to one of Sonic\u2019s feet. As Shadow stood on top of one of Sonic\u2019s red sneakers, he noticed that Sonic hadn\u2019t immediately noticed where he had warped to. This allowed Shadow a moment of rest and a chance to plan his next move before Sonic noticed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is bad. Being shrunken to this size has greatly reduced my power, not to mention that I\u2018m injured. I can\u2019t keep using Chaos Control to escape Sonic. I have to make these warps count or else I\u2018ll be too weak to move.</i> Shadow thought to himself. He didn\u2019t know how many more times he could use Chaos Control, so he had to be very careful using it\u2026</span></div></div>",

Shadow then looks around and realizes Sonic had sat on him. \"Hah! the ultimate life form my ass!\" Mocked the giant Blue hedgehog. Shadow became enraged not only for being mocked but about the humiliating situation he was in, he was trapped under his rivals butt. The angry black hedgehog struggled to get free but is was hopeless. \"Hey where did Shadow go?\" Sonic said with a sarcastic grin pretending to look around for Shadow. The bully then swiveled his butt around smearing the tiny form under him causing shadow great pain. \"oh we'll i think ill just sit here until he comes back!...... heh heh runt\" Snickered the giant sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally made it to the kitchen with the out cold echidna.

Urgh I CANT MOVE!!! ARRGGGHHH!!!' Knuckles cried in agony. After looking him over you suspected that the kick he got earlier must have broken his spine and left him paralyzed. Unfortunately your nowhere near medical attention but then Knuckles grabbed your shirt and said \"Go........g-get out of here.......w-while.....y-you s-still c-can....\" Knuckles choked out and eventually fell unconscious again.

You became mad that all the factors were against you, you couldn't fight back, you can't run. You realize there's nothing you can do, the only option left was to wait until it was your time to come for the Giant hedgehog to cruel-fully torture you to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realized all hope wasn't gone. The emerald..........The emerald was your only chance of survival. It gave Sonic power it could give you power too.

After a few minutes of just sitting, Sonic heard his stomach gurgle and he touched it with his gloved hand. Looks like Tails was digesting well. Suddenly, Sonic let one rip right on top of Shadow. He smiled and swiveled his butt again. Finally, he picked himself off the faker to get a look at his victim. Shadow was in a critical state; blood was trickling from his mouth and his body looked pretty bruised up. Both his arms looked like they had snapped in several places and his legs had been all but squashed flat. Yet, despite all these injuries, Shadow was still alive and conscious. He probably wasn\u2019t going to last long, so Sonic decided to finish him off quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, poor Shadow. You fought well, but in the end you\u2019re going to be nothing but a stain under my ass! See ya, buddy!\u201d Sonic mocked as he began lowering his butt onto Shadow again. He couldn\u2019t wait to twist his butt around and feel the annoying \u201cultimate life form\u201d crunch. Shadow watched through blurry eyes as Sonic\u2019s blue butt cheeks got closer and closer. Right before they touched him, a loud crash was heard from the kitchen. Sonic peered into the kitchen and whispered, \u201cWhat are those runts up to?\u201d The blue god stood up, sparing Shadow for now, and glanced down at the broken hedgehog. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back to finish you, don\u2019t go anywhere. Oh wait\u2026YOU CAN\u2019T!!\u201d Sonic bellowed with laughter as he walked out of the living room, leaving Shadow to suffer a little longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sonic was torturing Shadow, you were busy in the kitchen. After hiding Knuckle\u2019s unconscious body in one of the lower cabinets under Sonic\u2019s sink, you ran into a different cabinet and looked around for something to get Sonic\u2019s attention. As luck would have it, there was a tower of pots and pans stacked up in there. They were dangerously close to the edge and looked like they would fall with just the slightest nudge. You used every ounce of strength in your minuscule body to give them that nudge, causing them to tumble onto the floor and cause a racket. Just as you planned, you heard Sonic\u2019s booming footsteps heading toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Sonic cursed as he saw the mess you had made. \u201cI had all these stacked up perfectly! How did those bugs manage to knock them over?\u201d The evil hedgehog got on his hands and knees and started gathering all the pots and pans together again. As he did this, you sneaked past him and ran for the living room. If you had learned to do anything well after coming here, it was running. You somehow managed to reach the table before Sonic came back. Unlike Shadow, though, there was no way you could jump on top of it. Your only option was to try and climb one of the legs. You found a leg that looked climbable and immediately started scaling up it. You knew Sonic would be back soon and you prayed he wouldn\u2019t find you. That emerald was your last hope! </span></div></div>",

The gigantic being surprisingly did not notice you as he was looking down on Shadow. You climbed the rest of the way up and peered over the edge. You turned away in disgust as you never saw a leg crushed flat before. \"Poor Shadow.....\"  you whispered. You saw the Blue God standing over him looking down smiling at Shadow devilishly. \" sorry for the delay Shads but Im back so lets resume our fun!\" Sonic chuckeld as he turned around getting ready to sit. You watched in horror as there was nothing you could do, you weren't fast enough to get him and carry him away. You teared as you cursed at your human limitations.

All you could do is look away as you couldn't bare to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's butt cheeks finally touched down and you heard the crunch and saw the blood spatter. You saw that Shadow had disappeared underneath the massive butt cheeks. You watched in anger as the giant bully twisted his butt around smearing around what was left of Shadow under him \"The ultimate life form, reduced to nothing but a red stain on my ass!\" Laughed the cruel giant. Sonic lifted himself up to inspect Shadow's remains. All what was left was a bloody pulp, Shadow was crushed completely flat. \"Poor Shadow. Your end must have been excruciating painful but now you will join fox freak in my stomach!\" Sonic bellowed and he scooped up Shadow's flattened body and slurped him into his mouth and swished him around \"Mmmm! you taste alot better than foxboy!\" Sonic moaned in pleasure. Sonic savored the taste for awhile then in one gulp Shadow was gone. \"Mmmm! tatsy!\" Sonic moaned and he smeared blood off of his lip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two down......two to go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to find those other pesky bugs! Sonic the exterminator at your service!\" Sonic laughed at his joke as he stomped off back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill crying you looked up and realized Sonic's away at the moment and there it was just sitting there.......the emerald. You exciting climbed up on top of the table and ran over to the emerald. You gazed at its beauty exciting \"finally and can bring things back to normal!\" you said in triumph but then another thing crossed your mind. How to use it. You fell on your face in stupidity and realized you never asked anyone how to use the chaos emerald. \"How could i forget to ask how to use this thing!\" You cursed at yourself. You tried saying chaos control and chaos spear and other terms that you could remember from the games. Nothing happened. You got severely depressed until you got an idea \"Yeah! that's it! ill just ask Knuckles how to use it\" you said to yourself in a happy manner <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hah! gotcha! you little runt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as you slowly turned around as you saw that giant hedgehog had found Knuckles. You realize your only hope of using the emerald was now once again in the power of the sexy hedgehog God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm? what to do with you?\" pondered the giant as he eyed the injured echinda in his fist <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHH! MY BACK IT FUCKING HURTS! AHHHH!\" Screamed Knuckles <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here lemme fix it for you then!\" replied the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic brought the echidna to his mouth and savagely bit on him like a candy bar. Knuckles cried out in more pain as the giant's teeth sank into him and literally impaled him until the hedgehog pulled and ripped Knuckles in half! The hedgehog began chewing on half of Knuckles that went into his mouth and smiled evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"there you go buddy! all fixed!\" Sonic laughed as he chewed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"three down......one to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapsed to your knees as you saw the giant toss the other half of Knuckles into his mouth. \"Noooooooo!\" you screamed out in despair. As the giant bully just finished swallowing Knuckles he heard your scream and turned towards your direction and spotted you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look its my favorite bug!\" Sonic said cheerfully cracking his original trademark smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry little buddy im coming\" Sonic stated as he stomped towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the towering sexy hedgehog slowly stomp towards you each booming footstep getting louder and shaking the table more and more and you didn't move what was the point? there was no use running you end was coming there was no way out this time. You sulked as you put your head down as you started reliving everything that happened your life. Your friends, your family, your parents......... you said your goodbyes as finally the evil Giant was now standing above you smiling with his hand on his slender hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"what to do with the human?\" the giant pondered as you awaited your death........ </span></div></div>",

You won\u2019t be able to either!\u201d Sonic laughed as he reached down for you. You soon found yourself in the familiar hold that was Sonic\u2019s crushing grip. Sonic brought you up to his green eyes and looked over the last bug, seemingly trying to decide exactly how to consume it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t eat me, Sonic! I don\u2019t wanna die! I just want to go home!\u201d you cry, going into a desperate state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, don\u2019t beg. It makes you look even more pathetic\u2026and even more delicious.\u201d Sonic grinned toothily, showing you his teeth that have been stained with the blood of Shadow and Knuckles. It made him look feral and even more frightening than usual. You squeezed your eyes shut and waited to be thrown into Sonic\u2019s wet mouth. Instead, Sonic released you and let you fall out of his hand. You opened your eyes, expecting to see the hard ground below. Instead you saw\u2026a bowl of onion dip? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell into the bowl with a small splash and quickly swam to the surface. As you breathed in fresh air, you saw Sonic plop himself onto the couch and click on the TV to one of his favorite shows. After getting himself comfortable, he took a potato chip out of a second bowl, scooped up some dip, and ate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026Tails\u2019 homemade dip is really something! I suppose I should enjoy his last batch\u2026ha-ha!\u201d Sonic chuckled as finished chewing the chip up and reached for another one. After consuming this one, he leaned back on the couch and watched TV. He seemed to be ignoring you, but every now and then he would take another potato ship, scoop up some dip (missing you), and consume it loudly. You wished your death would be quick, but Sonic wasn\u2019t so merciful. He was dragging this out by making you watch him devour the chips, just like he had done to his friends. Just like he was going to do to you. You found yourself thinking about Tails, the last thing he saw being the open maw of the guy he thought was his best friend. You thought about Shadow, the look of desperation on his face as he reached out for you before having his life snuffed out by Sonic\u2019s bottom. You thought about Knuckles, the strong fighter who had been crippled by a mere kick and then painfully devoured by someone he trusted. You couldn\u2019t save any of them\u2026you couldn\u2019t even save yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a full hour of wallowing in despair, the show Sonic was watching ended and there was only one chip left in the bowl. Sonic picked the chip up between his fingers and peered down at you. You knew what was coming\u2026it was time. Sonic slid the potato chip underneath you and brought your drip-covered body to his youthful face. His mouth curved into a smirk before he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTails was okay, Shadow was great, and Knuckles was\u2026meh. I have a feeling your going to taste better than all of them, human.\u201d Sonic licked his lips seductively, coating them in salvia that was soon going to coat you. Even though you knew it was hopeless, you couldn\u2019t help but beg one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Sonic! I\u2019ll be your slave for the rest of my life! I\u2019ll rub your feet! I\u2019ll lick them! I\u2019ll lick any part of your gigantic, marvelous body! If you kill me now, you won\u2019t have a tiny bug to play with anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, runt? As long as I have a Chaos Emerald, I can shrink any one of my remaining \u201cfriends\u201d and play with them. If I ever run out, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of devoted fans out there that would just <b>die</b> for the chance of being my friend.\u201d Sonic explained, taking great amusement in the hopeless look your face showed. \u201cLook on the bright side, kid. You\u2019re going to become part of the great Sonic the Hedgehog, savior of the world!\u201d Sonic used his other hand to gesture down his slim body. Even after everything he has done, you couldn\u2019t deny that he was one sexy hog. That didn\u2019t matter, though! He was no \u201csavior\u201d, he was an evil monster that just hid behind a kind smile. You didn\u2019t want to become part of a monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! I don\u2019t-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even letting you get close to finishing your sentence, Sonic casually tossed the chip into his mouth and snapped his jaws shut. You were consumed in humid darkness, screaming your head off, for about two seconds before Sonic moved you onto his molars and started chewing.  Your screams became those of agony as Sonic\u2019s perfect, sharp teeth mashed your body into pieces along with the crunchy potato chip. Sonic leaned back on the couch as he listened to your screams get drowned out by his eating. When it was all over, a mixture of mushy potato chip, onion dip, and human mush laid upon his tongue. Sonic swallowed you down and felt you enter his gut. He happily rubbed it while feeling the remains of his four shrunken victims mix together along with the bowl of chips he had consumed. Together it was all digested into a milky soup for Sonic\u2019s body to process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFour down\u2026*burp*\u2026none to go.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He noticed you on the table and laughed that your efforts were useless because Shadow and Silver were his Evil playmates! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed out loud Shadow and Silver and they didn't noticed you right away until a huge glass of water was set down beside you with a boom and you were grabbed from behind and brought into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Sonic you shrunk a human?\" Silver asked in amazement standing up from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep and hes all ours!\" Sonic bellowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned in despair as sets of green eyes, red eyes and yellow eyes stared down on you in Sonic's fist.You were now in the power of 3 hedgehog Gods. you were seriously fucked. 'Mhhm! you picked a delectable one Sonic!\" Shadow bellowed licking his lips. \"Yeah hes so puny! i can wait to crush him!\" Silver chuckled. You looked up and couldn't believe that Shadow and Silver were just like Sonic, You probably thought all the rest of them were like Sonic, if so there was no hope left. Suddenly a blue aura engulfed you once more <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There i gave him his 3 lives back so..........who wants first dibs? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ill go first\" Shadow ordered. Sonic then handed you over to Shadow and you were then in a tighter grasp. The black hedgehog squeezed you and noticed the difference in grip as he was crushing you alot more easily then the blue God. You screamed in pain while looking up and the dark colored God \"Pathetic human\" Shadow bellowed with his usual angry stare. The hedgehog then tossed you into his mouth and shut his jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nit was hot and humid in the ultimate lifeforms mouth. You struggled to maintain balance due to the slippery pink muscle and its sliminess. \"haha having fun?\" Shadow bellowed as he blew out your ear drums with his voice. You instantly collapsed due to the immense volume of pain and all of a sudden the pink muscle pushed you far into the ultimate lifeforms cheek, he was savoring your flavor. \"Mhmm! delicious!\" Moaned the dark hedgehog. He continued to swish you around enjoying your taste and eventually spat you out on to his fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey its my turn now!\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You then turned around and met with the white hedgehogs face who was smiling evilly \"Shadow was right you really are a pathetic human!\" Bellowed the giant Silver. You just got so mad you cocked one back and spat in Silver's eye. Silver jumped squinting his eye from the unexpected attack, This angered Silver \"Ow! You little runt! how dare you spit in my eye!\" Yelled the white God and all you did was cover your ears laughing at him. Sonic and Shadow were also laughing at Silver but he ignored them and focused on you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you think its funny? well ill show you funny!\" Bellowed Silver in anger.  Soon the blue aura that contained you brought you down and placed you on top of the table. You struggled to break free but could not move an inch. You then looked up and saw Silver turn around and wiggle his butt a little bit \"Sorry kid but you will be the \"butt\" end of your joke!\" laughed the white God. Silver then began to lower his butt onto you, you also had to though Silver did have a nice ass but you began to try and break free again but your efforts were useless. All you could do was watch Silver's white butt cheeks get closer and closer. You screamed in horror and soon your screams were snuffed out as the white butt cheeks landed with a boom and you were crushed completely flat, you had disappeared under the white hedgehogs butt cheeks while Silver swiveled his ass laughing loudly \"haha hey guys have you seen that human anywhere? i cant seem to find him\" Silver chuckled swiveling his butt again. Silver then got up and turned around to show his ass to his friends and Sonic and Shadow laughed at the red stain on his ass cheek which was you. \"Eww gross\" Silver laughed as he peeled you off his white ass cheek and watch you reform in his hand \"2 lives left\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Silver lemme get that human again! i wanna crush him with my ass!\" Bellowed Shadow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver agreed as he threw you to Shadow and you found yourself once again is the ultimate life forms grip...      </span></div></div>",

It wouldn\u2019t take much effort for the black hedgehog to snap you like a twig in his hand, but that wasn\u2019t the death he had in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to see my ass, human? I guarantee you\u2019ll love looking at it as it squashes you into the table!\u201d Shadow chuckled evilly before dropping you onto the table where only seconds before you had been killed by Silver\u2019s butt. You watched the giant turn around and stick his behind out for you to see. You watched in awe as he flexed the two mounds of muscle, making them grind together and pulverize anything that happened to be between them. You thought about yourself being crushed between those as cheeks and how it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad way to die\u2026wait, what are you saying?!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the new strength given to you when you were reformed, you turned around 180 degrees and dashed away from the looming butt. You were on the living room table, so you didn\u2019t exactly know where to go. Anywhere other than under the shadow of that ass was good. Before you could make much progress, however, the familiar blue aura from before surrounded you and you collapsed on your stomach and glued to the coffee table. You couldn\u2019t budge and inch, but your head was tilted in such a way that you could look up and see Silver gleaming down at you with a grin on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold him right there, Silver.\u201d Shadow said as he hovered his butt over you once more. He flexed his black, furry buttocks once more before he moved to take a seat. You screamed like before, but like before they were snuffed out as the butt came down on you and squashed you instantly. Shadow smirked as he swiveled his butt around, smearing you into the coffee table and listening to your bones pop and crunch. After a few seconds he lifted his butt off the table to get a look at your flat corpse. While the other two hedgehog gods looked at it and laughed, Shadow wasn\u2019t satisfied and sat back down to pulverize you some more. After what seemed like an entire minute of twisting his butt around and turning you into some unrecognizable, Shadow finally stood up and showed his ass to his two playmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how\u2019s he look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, you really did a number on him.\u201d Sonic commented, a chuckle escaping his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like some of him got pushed inside you butt, Shads.\u201d Silver said as he pointed at his friends behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Shadow replied as he grinded his two furry mounds together and, sure enough, felt something wet and meaty between them. \u201cYou\u2019re right, better let him out so he can reform.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow turned so his ass was facing the sofa, bent down, and released a humongous fart into the room. The two other teens plugged their noses and laughed as the force of Shadow\u2019s fart ejected your remains from his ass and splattered them all over the couch. It was defiantly a messy sight, but no one had to clean it up as they watched each piece of you come alive and slowly reform. Soon you were back to your normal self, as if you hadn\u2019t just been sat on and blown out of the ultimate life form\u2019s ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne life left\u2026\u201d Sonic said as he approached the couch you were standing on. \u201c\u2026and one more sexy ass to snuff it out!\u201d</span></div></div>",

There was no way you could escape the wrath of three giant, teenaged gods. You were doomed and you may as well accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiving up, eh? Well, in that case I\u2019ll try and make this quick.\u201d Sonic wiggled his butt for you and you thought to yourself that his butt was probably the most sexy out of the three of them. The two others walked over and got ready for your final death. This time, you weren\u2019t coming back. You were going to be turned into a stain that would probably be washed off in the shower. As Sonic\u2019s big, blue ass descended on you, you thought about how humiliating this death was. You had barely lived and the only reason you had lived in the first place was so you could meet you end via the behind of your video game hero? What a shitty twist of fate. With that thought, the blue bully\u2019s ass came down with unforgiving force and everything turned dark\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t much later that you started to stir awake. You felt was seemed to be glass under your hands and you stood up and slowly opened your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I\u2026dead?\u201d you ask yourself. Your vision is still blurry, but you can make out three shapes around you. A black one, a while one, a blue one\u2026oh no. There was no way! You rubbed your eyes, clearing your vision, and saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, not yet human! You aren\u2019t dying until your gods say you can!\u201d the giant blue speedster said as he grinned at you though the glass walls of your prison. You just now noticed that you were inside of a glass; you must have been dropped in here when you were unconscious\u2026but why-?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why you\u2019re not a red stain, huh?\u201d Shadow asked, picking the glass you were in up and bringing it to his face. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? Using a Chaos Emerald, we can revive you as many times as we want! You aren\u2019t staying dead until we get bored of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow bellowed with laugher as he shook you around in the glass before placing you back on the table. You looked round again and realized that the three hedgehogs were all sitting at a kitchen table, with you on that table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you want to do with him next?\u201d Silver asks, glancing at his two buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026he tasted so good when he was in my mouth\u2026and that run here did make me pretty hungry.\u201d Shadow replied as he looked at you with a hungry stare and licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, Shadow!\u201d Sonic said, stopping Shadow\u2019s arm as it reached to snatch you up. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we can revive him if you eat him. The only thing that will be left are his bones in your crap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m REAAALLLY hungry and I\u2019m curious as to what humans taste like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you mention it, I\u2019m kind of hungry too\u2026\u201d Silver sat back in his chair and rubbed his growling stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we both can\u2019t eat him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026I know!\u201d Sonic shouted loudly and slammed his fist into his palm. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we head into the city and shrink ourselves some snacks? Station Square is full of useless humans and they still owe us for saving their asses a few days ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea!\u201d Silver shouted back., clearly enthused by his blue buddy\u2019s plan. \u201cWe could even bring back some friends for our favorite bug.\u201d Silver turned to you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You can\u2019t do that!\u201d you yell, banging on the side of the glass. \u201cThey\u2019re innocent people who trust you! You can\u2019t turn them into food! That\u2019s not fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you guys hear something?\u201d Shadow asked his two companions, both whom shrugged. You watched the three giants stand up and make their way out of the kitchen. You could do nothing but watch them leave and hear the front door open and close. You collapsed against the side of the glass, suddenly feeling weak. Was this your fault? Would those three monsters even have the idea to shrink people if you hadn\u2019t come to their world? No one in Station Square stood a chance\u2026</span></div></div>",

Were bringing back alot of them!\" Stated the blue speedster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic does have a point. i wanna be able to crush some too!\" Silver exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"look theres the mall just a couple of blocks down! lets go to the thrift store and grab some jars\" Shadow said pointing towards in the direction of the mall<br>\r\n the three hedgehogs then decided to go with Shadows plan and the three of them disappeared at lightning speeds towards the direction of the mall.<br>\r\narriving at the mall they spot the thrift store near in the main lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" Shouted the blue one and all of them ran inside the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside they devised a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"okay you two stay here at front door so no ones leaves.....ill be right back\" states Sonic. Sonic then approached the counter and met eyes with the store clerk, an average looking teenager would was soon gonna regret coming into work today, he saw the blue hedgehog and recognized him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey Sonic! can i help you with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh yeah can i have 3 jars please?\" Sonic asked with a grin, an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing buddy be right back\" the clerk then walked away to get the jars<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Heh stupid human...soon you wont be calling me your buddy )\" Said the blue one to himself. He looked back to his comrades at the door with a thumbs up. Eventually the teen came back with the 3 jars and rang them up in the register<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok that comes to.......17.50\" exclaimed the clerk. Sonic lloked at him with an evil glint in his eye and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hold on lemme get my wallet out\" instead Sonic pulled out a glowing emerald while smiling evilly. The teenager looked at him confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"umm i don't think we take jewelry\" said the clerk. Soon the familiar bright flash hit the teenage clerk and he was shrunk. After realizing his surroundings he glared up at the large hedgehog and opened his eyes wide at the sight of the enormous giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?! you never seen a hedgehog at this size before?\" Bellowed the hedgehog chuckling a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what the hell did you do to me?\" yelled the store clerk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple Ive shrunk you! like were gonna do to everyone in this mall! and since you helped obtain what i need to hold everyone we shrink you wont have to be crammed into the jar you get the special compartment!' Sonic bellowed as he reached down and grasped the tiny teen by the back of the shirt with two gloved fingers and brought him to his butt and slipped the tiny teen between his blue butt cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! all nice and snug!\" laughed the blue god as he clenched his butt cheeks together feel the human being crushed. People in the store saw the unbelievable sight of the clerk shrink and everyone in the store panicked and rushed the front door only to be stopped by Silver's PK abilities.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work Silver\" Sonic applauded as he took out his emerald and shrunk everyone in the store. When shrunk everyone looked up and saw the 3 towering sexy gods looming over them and began running away from the 3 giants..........it was useless. They were lifted into the air by Silver and were all put and sealed into Silver's jar. The people in the jar freaked out also when they saw the giants looking in on them. One man kicked the side of the jar <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you fuckin assholes let us the fuck outta here!\" Yelled the mafia looking man. Soon the top of the jar opened up and a giant gloved hand came down like that the hand of a god coming down from the heavens came down and grasped the little man tightly and took him out of the prison only to be met with and angered Shadow the hedgehog with scared the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't take kindly to a pathetic human like you! calling me and my comrades assholes!\" Shadow bellowed in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sonic is it alright to start eating now!\" asked the dark on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure i don't see why not!\" replied the speedster with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good because of starving!\" Shadow said as he began licking his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey b-buddy c'mon i d-didnt mean it! h-honestly! waddya say i give you whatever you desire! money, cars, babes you name it! just please dont eat me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but no thanks.....what i desire IS TO EAT YOU\" Shadow roared as he slipped the mafia thug into his mouth. The giant swished and swashed the man around his mouth getting his flavor as the man screamed for mercy. The black hedgehog then pressed him against the room of his mouth then the inside of his cheek, Shadow just absolutely moaned, he loved to taste of human. Soon the hedgehog was done acquiring his taste and just swiftly put the man between his sharp teeth and began chewing literally shredding the man into pieces drowning out his cries of agony and slurped him down the hatch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm!!!.....human is amazing.....*burrrp*........ thats the last time he'll ever call the ultimate lifeform and his friends assholes\" said the dark one. The other people in the jar were mortified at the sight and looked up in fear at the 3 giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok i guess that takes care of this store guys, lets split up and go gather everyone!\" Sonic stated. The hedgehogs then headed out of the store to go conquer the mall <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job back there Silver without your powers i dont know what we would have done\" Sonic congratulated also giving Silver a congratulatory smack on the ass causing Silver to blush a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys cut it out! lets get to work on bagging these bugs!' roared Shadow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pipe down Emo\" Sonic laughed also smacking Shadow's ass which also made Shadow blush and piss him off. But Shadow let Sonic go on that one because he liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile several minutes later Silver used his telekinesis to block off every exit and entrance to the mall and the panicking began. Chaos filled the mall as people tried to escape but failed. Sonic and Shadow then jumped on top of a vendor wagon in the middle of the mall. Using the powers of both emerald combined then both shouted in sync \"CHAOS SHRINK!!!\" and the whole mall was filled with nothing but with bright green light. When it faded away the mall was empty at least until you looked at the floor and saw nothing but human bugs. Silver easily just finished it with his PK and transported everyone inside the 3 jars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work\" Said Shadow as him and Sonic walked over to Silver with the 3 filled jars floating around him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece of cake guys!\" Silver said happily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" asked Shadow <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess were done here boys! lets back to my place\" ordered the blue one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the trio headed out until something caught Silver's eye. In a display window he saw a tiny model town and he put his face and gloved hands to the glass and peered inside and gaped with amazement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh guys come here and look at this!\" Silver shouted to his friends<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow and Sonic put their faces to the glass and peered in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A model town? so what?\" asked Sonic to see that Silver had gone and was inside the store. Silver looked down on the tiny model town and became engulfed with power. Silver then peered down and noticed a tiny house at his feet. Silver then took the delight of raising his boot and bringing it down on the tiny house crushing it easily and instantly. Silver moaned at the pretend sensation of being a real giant. He then lied down on his belly crushing other models with his tone slender body and he peeked down on on another house poking it and prodding it with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Silver what are you doing?\" Sonic asked with confused. Shadow just sat there and drooled at the sight. the way Silver was positioned on the floor plus with the way Silver's ass looked facing directly at him it looked very suggestive. Silver just ignored them and rolled over on his back crushing models that happend to be in the way <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sigh... i wish i could really be this big)\" Silver said in his head  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Silver! quit fooling around! i wanna get home and have some fun with our bugs\" Sonic said frustrated <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok sorry about that lets go\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the 3 Gods left the mall leaving it a complete ghost town while the 3 sexy hedgehogs began planning what they would do when they got back to Sonic's     <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Shadow and Silver just stared at each other all confused. Sonic then came back into the kitchen will 3 glasses of water, a chocolate pie, chips and dip and an empty bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i just an had idea how we can spice things up on our delicious feast of the humans!\" state the blue speedster. Shadow and Silver grinned at the proposal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm i never had human chocolate pie before!\" Silver exclaimed rubbing his belly \"Or humans and dip!\" Shadow said licking his lips <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before we have those tasty choices were gonna have an appetizer first\" Said the blue one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then walked over to the living room table putting everything down also giving you a quick grin as he placed everything down.

The enormous hand grabbed a large sum of the bowl and crunch and popping could be heard and he squeezed and raised his hand out of the bowl. Shadow was ruthless he quickly tossed the handful into his mouth and chewed. He closed his eyes moaning in satisfaction from the taste and the pleasureful cries of the humans being eaten and shredded by the massive jaws of the ultimate lifeform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver also enjoyed his mouthful of human. He crunched away as laughed at the cries of the innocent lives he was forcefully taking away just by eating them. Sonic watched as his 2 friends devoured the humans in the bowl. You cringed and cried at the sight and the sound of the cries of the people being devoured. What scared you was the blood that poured from the giant hedgehogs lips. They looked barbaric and they looked almost demon like. Then you felt the table shake as you saw the blue giant approach you. He just stood there glaring down of you with a grin with his hands on his hips and laughed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah i forgot about my little friend from the mall i put between my cheeks!' Sonic said he reached between his butt and pulled out the clerk but he wasn't a clerk anymore he was a squished piece of meat skin and bones he was unrecognizable <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! i guess left him in there too long! poor guy....well at least he was crushed by the worlds fastest and sexiest ass!\" Sonic chuckled and he dropped the body on the floor and stomped it and walked away to join his friends in the feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow and Silver had already devoured the entire bowl clean <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for saving me some guys!\" Sonic yelled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early bird gets the worm! Sonic\" replied Silver with blood all over his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys should go clean your faces ill get main dishes ready\" Sonic said<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith that the two other hedgehogs made their way to the bathroom to wash up as Sonic already opened up the half filled jar. He plucked out a couple humans and dropped them in the chocolate pie and others in the onion dip. He laughed while looming over the helpless humans stuck in the thick foods. He then picked up one human and brought it to his face. The man shrieked at the face of the giant hedgehog and soon found himself inside the mouth og the sexy hedgehog and was chewed to pieces <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm Shadow was right human is good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the two other hedgehogs returned into the living room and were ready for round two <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys ready for the main course!\" Sonic asked with a grin \"so lets go!\" Sonic finished as the 3 sat down on the couch and dug in. Silver had taken a piece of the chocolate pie and brought it to his face and peeked at the humans lodged in the pie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha your all gonna be eaten!\" Silver mocked as he took a bite out of the pie consuming about 3 humans in the process. Shadow had plucked humans from the bowl and dipped them into the onion dip and slurped them into his mouth and then chewed them with delight. Sonic was just occasionally taking a human here or there and devouring them but was mostly drinking from his glass of water because he didn't really wanna eat he wanted to get to the good stuff with his companions. The crushing! Sonic stood up and got his friends attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys lets finish eating later! Lets do some crushing! my feet and ass are aching to squash some bugs into paste! C'mon on boys lets go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic said as he dumped the rest of the humans onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay boys! lets crush em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> When all of the trio\u2019s shrunken victims, which numbered in the hundreds, were scattered over the floor, the start of the massacre began. The three teenaged gods wasted no time in advancing toward their prey, while most of the humans screamed in terror and ran away from the titanic gods. A few of the humans, who still believed that the three heroes were kind hearted, huddled together and begged the giants to stop. Sonic and his friends didn\u2019t care much for these humans, as they wanted to experience the thrill of the chase. Without giving the group an acknowledging glance, the hedgehogs trampled over them like they were nothing and set their eyes on the real fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the many humans scattered, the trio split up to follow them. Shadow had his eyes set on a fairly large group of people who were heading straight for the door. They believed that if they stuck together they would increase their chances of survival. Unfortunately, it only made them a bigger target. Shadow easily caught up with the fleeing bugs and with one thunderous stomp, crushed over half of them with his left foot. The rest of the humans were send flying back via the shockwave created from the stomp. Those that were not crushed could no longer move, may it be because their legs were broken or because they were frozen by fear. Whatever the reason, it allowed Shadow to easily stomp them one by one. He couldn\u2019t believe how weak the humans were and wondered why he ever bothered to protect them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver was currently following another group of humans, but at a much slower pace. The smaller group looked back at the giant hedgehog and thought that if he continued to walk this slow, they might just escape. Their hopes were crushed, however, when they felt their feet become glued to the floor by Silver\u2019s telekinesis. They were unable to move their legs and could only watch in horror as Silver slowly made his way toward them. It felt like hours to the poor humans before Silver was finally upon them. Pretending he didn\u2019t see the bugs, Silver carelessly stepped on them and easily squished them all. He took a moment to enjoy the sound of them crunching before setting his sights on new prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was just finishing up crushing his second group of tiny humans when he spotted something in the corner of his eye. A lone human had escaped his onslaught and was limping away. Sonic smirked and reached down to snatch up the insect. Once he had him, he brought him up to his handsome face to get a better look. The human appeared to be a teen around the same age as the clerk he had crushed with his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, S-Sonic! Don\u2019t kill me! I\u2019m your biggest fan!\u201d the tiny teen cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBiggest? You just look like another pesky bug to me. Watch how easily I can crush you.\u201d Sonic replied before he started to clench his fist together, making the boy scream in pain as he felt his body compress. Sonic never eased up on the pressure and enjoyed every crack and crunch the human made in his fist. With one last crunch, the teen fell limp in his grip. \u201cAww\u2026he died already.\u201d Sonic whined before dropping the corpse onto the floor and stomping it flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the entire ordeal from your glass prison. You had long since given up on shouting at the three to stop. Your pleas fell on deaf ears. You just sat there with tears streaming down your face as you watched the three gods take innocent life after innocent life. Not once did the titans show any signs of mercy, even if their victims were just kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Sonic knock a group of people off their feet and, before they had a chance to stand up, stand over them and sit down. You gritted your teeth at the look of satisfaction Sonic had as he mashed the group into paste under his butt. Nearby, Shadow was forcing a few humans to lick the remains of his last stomp off his shoe. He claimed that he\u2019d let them live if they obeyed him, but it only took Shadow a few minutes to get bored and turn the obedient slaves into another layer of mush on his sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Silver had chased a group of four humans to the other side of the living room. He four insects were starting to tire and Silver took the opportunity to walk over them and bring his ass down on them. Instead of standing up to inspect their remains, Silver slid across the floor and left a streak of blood in his wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, there\u2019s no escape from Silver the Hedgehog!\u201d the white giant said as he stood up and searched for more people to smush.</span></div></div>",

All he could see were small splotches of blood and the mangled remains of humans. He was amazed that so many people had died in his living room and no one outside heard a scream. None of them had stood a chance against the three of them. They were doomed the moment they decided to visit the mall today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want my living room looking like a bloodbath occurred in it. Silver, do you mind cleaning this mess up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. For letting me have so much fun, I\u2019d clean the entire house of you wanted me to!\u201d Silver replied before he started making his way toward the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and take off your shoes. We\u2019re going to be leaving bloody footprints everywhere if we keep them on.\u201d Sonic said as he began removing his own shoes. Silver took off his, followed by Shadow, and the three tossed their footwear in the corner to be washed later. Moments later, the younger hedgehog came downstairs with a mop and bucket floating around him. Without lifting a finger, the hedgehog from the future began cleaning up any evidence that a massacre had occurred here today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I should wash these too.\u201d Sonic said to himself as he looked at his white gloves, which had been stained with the blood of that teen he had crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the three monsters, their massacre was not without survivors. During the panic, just two humans managed to hide themselves under the living room couch and avoid the three gods\u2019 sights. They were both teens, one around eighteen while the other just thirteen. They were brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be happening\u2026\u201d The older teen said to himself as he paced around and bit his fingernails. \u201cWhy would Sonic shrink all those people? Why would he kill all of them? It doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdam, what\u2019s going to happen to us?\u201d the younger boy asked from his seated position. His eyes were wet with tears and he was hugging his legs against his chest. \u201cYou saw what they did to all those people. They ate them\u2026and then crushed the rest! I-I don\u2019t want to die, Adam!\u201d the thirteen-year-old shook his head and burrowed his face into his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, Tom!\u201d Adam said as he shook his brother by his shoulders. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t let anything happen to us. We just have to wait here until they leave. Maybe this shrinking thing isn\u2019t permanent! You can\u2019t give up hope.\u201d The older teen tried to comfort his brother, but the truth was that he was just as scared as him. If one of those hedgehogs found them, they were good as dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two males heard the \u201croof\u201d of their hiding spot creak. Shadow had just sat down on the couch and was searching for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Sonic, where\u2019s the TV remote?\u201d Shadow yelled to his friend in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not on the coffee table?\u201d Sonic\u2019s voice called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Shadow scanned again and his eyes fell upon you, still trapped in the glass. He grinned at you and plopped both his feet onto the table. His two socked feet were on either side of the glass now, giving you a good view of them. \u201cHey, Sonic, what should we do with this one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything we want, Shads! He\u2019s our little toy to use as much as we want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow grinned evilly and said, \u201cHear that, little human? You\u2019re are slave until we get bored of you. Once we get bored\u2026well\u2026you watched the show, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at the cruel giant with so much hate that it took every fiber of your being to stop yourself from shouting every profanity you knew at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s the last of them.\u201d Silver said as he finished mopping up the floor. Nothing remained of the crushed humans except for what was still stuck to the bottom of their shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I found the remote.\u201d Sonic said as he entered the living room, waving the remote in his clean, gloved hand. \u201cIt was in the kitchen. I must have left in in there.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Finally the blue speedster slips forward and lands on the floor hard landing on his belly. You laughed as you watched the massive blue titan tumble over and slam onto the floor injuring himself. You chuckled thinking that Sonic had a run in with bad karma. With that the remote that was in the hedgehogs hand was sent sliding across the room, under the living room table and finally just stopping right next to the scared little brothers hiding under the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit Silver! your suppose to dry the floor when your done washin it!\" Sonic winced in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought how funny it was that Sonic was whining over pain from falling flat on his face meanwhile the pain he caused the innocent people that he crushed was not even comparable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sonic\" Silver apologized helping up his friend off the floor \"Here lemme go get some towels and dry the floor up\" Silver said as he rushed to the bathroom for some towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where did the remote go?\" Sonic asked as he scanned the floor for the remote<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It slid under the couch, ill get it!\" Shadow replied. The brothers had heard the giant and panicked! there was noting else to hide behind and theres was nowhere to run. If they ran out into the open they would most likely be caught and then crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two scared brothers saw the massive dark hedgehog get on his knees making a thunderous boom when his knees hit the floor and then watched the enormous gloved hand reach for the remote. Shadow picked up the remote and spotted the two boys cowering in fear at the sight of the giants face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! I found some more bugs!\" Shadow bellowed with a smirk as he reached for the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really where?\" Sonic and Silver Said in unison as they jumped looking in Shadow direction <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teen were scared but were not about to quit. When the massive hand was just about to grab them they avoided it and ran the other way. They were soon stopped by the other hand and were thwarted as the two \"walls\" came together and grasped the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Shadow said in triumph as he stood up and showed in catch to his fellow Gods<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys were almost petrified with fear as they looked up at the three Gods grinning evilly at them while they were trapped in the dark hedgehogs strong fist. They both struggled to break free but proved futile. The three hedgehogs laughed at their efforts and just Shadow squeezed his fist harder making the boys scream in pain. You looked up from your glass prison and witnessed the two boys around your age facing the same fate your had endured when Sonic first found you. You punched the glass in anger because you were too weak to help them so you just sat their and continued to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well would ya look at that? two pathetic bugs that managed to avoid getting squashed! well they aint gonna be alive very much longer!\" bellowed the blue God<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest of the two boys began to cry in hopelessness as he realized his end was near. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sonic how should we punish these pathetic creatures for not joining the fun we had earlier? \" Shadow looked at Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Sonic! how should we end the lives of these puny bugs?\" Silver added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then began thinking of what to do to the boys as he glared at them evilly        </span></div></div>",

He thought that if they had just stayed under the couch and waited, the giants would leave and give them an opportunity to flee. Thanks to dumb luck, here they were; trapped and about to meet their ends. His brother, while his intense crying was understandable, wasn\u2019t helping him think\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the question is, which one should we kill first?\u201d Sonic said, placing his hands on his hips and glancing from brother to brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI vote for the smaller one. His crying is giving me a headache.\u201d Shadow replied, raising Tom up to his menacing red eyes. Tom trembled under their gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea. There\u2019s always room in my belly for another tasty human!\u201d Silver exclaimed, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, why do you get to eat him? I was the one who found them!\u201d Shadow replied, glaring at the younger hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t dropped the remote, you wouldn\u2019t have looked under the couch!\u201d Sonic cut in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, guys.\u201d Silver tried to calm his two buddies down. \u201cI cleaned up the mess we made all by myself; shouldn\u2019t I get some kind of reward?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026I suppose you do. Okay, Shadow, give the younger human to Silver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom\u2019s eyes widened as he realized he was about to become food. He started crying louder and squirming against Shadow\u2019s strong grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No! Brother, help! I don\u2019t want to be eaten!\u201d Tom cried, looking over at Adam with total fear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? They\u2019re brothers?\u201d Shadow inquired, becoming more interested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome! Make sure the older one watches as I devour his little bro!\u201d Silver cackled evilly, imagining the look on bug\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please, don\u2019t do this!\u201d Adam begged, looking from one hedgehog to the next. \u201cYou can do what you want with me, but please don\u2019t hurt my brother! He\u2019s just a kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me think about that.\u201d Shadow answered, making a face like he was thinking really hard. \u201cNah.\u201d Shadow then flicked the wrist that had Tom in it forward. It took Adam a second to realize that his brother was no longer next to him. He had been tossed through the air toward Silver. The giant time traveler opened his mouth wide to receive the incoming meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOO!!!\u201d Adam shouted, as if his voice could somehow will Tom to a halt. Alas, everyone watched as the thirteen-year-old was caught by Silver\u2019s open maw. The hedgehog teen slammed his jaws shut, sealing his meal in darkness. Adam watched helplessly as Silver swished his brother around in his mouth, moaning at the boy\u2019s fresh taste. Tom was still screaming his head off, which were occasionally interrupted when Silver smacked the boy into his cheek with his pink muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026don\u2019t\u2026let him go! Please stop! Stop!\u201d Adam begged, banging his fists against Shadow\u2019s hand. The black hedgehog responded to the plea with a tight squeeze, making the older teen yelp in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it, human. We\u2019ve crushed and eaten plenty of people\u2019s brothers. What makes yours so special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your glass prison, you decided you could no longer watch this and buried your face into your arms. The cruelty of these three titans knew no bounds. You thought that Sonic falling on his face was an act of karma, but it was just another act of cruel fate. Maybe it would have been better if these brothers had been crushed like everyone else. At least it would have spared them this torture\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Silver had sucked all the taste he was going to get from the kid\u2019s body and decided to silence his screams for good. Giving Adam a smirk, Silver tilted his head back and swallowed. The older brother watched, speechless, as the hedgehog\u2019s Adam\u2019s Apple bobbed up and down and his throat carried his brother down to his stomach in the form of a small lump. As soon as the lump faded into Silver\u2019s chest, Adam felt like he had been hit by a truck. He gave up all struggles within Shadow\u2019s fist and just stared at Silver in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, that his the spot.\u201d Silver commented as he rubbed his stomach. \u201cThey taste just as good when you swallow them whole, and I can feel him struggling in my gut!\u201d Silver chuckled as he focused on the movement in his belly. Tom was still crying out to his brother, but his words no longer reached the outside. Silver\u2019s thick abdomen took care of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026Tom\u2026\u201d Adam sobbed, burrowing his face in Shadow\u2019s glove. \u201cI promised nothing would happen, but\u2026I couldn\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m so sorry, Tom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, the bug\u2019s getting my glove all wet!\u201d Shadow shot the grieving teen an annoyed glance. \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and dispose of him too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I just crush him?\u201d Sonic asked. \u201cOr do you want to eat this one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Adam picked his head up and stared straight into the face of Silver. \u201cPlease\u2026eat me too! I don\u2019t want my brother to die scared and alone. Let me at least comfort him. I\u2019m begging you!\u201d Adam had given up all hope. If they were going to die here, his only request was that they to die together.</span></div></div>",

I wanna see my brother! Please eat me!\" Adam cried. You heard his plea from the glass jar and thought the kid was crazy. \"Alright kid.....it's your life\" Silver bellowed as the ultimate lifeform handed Adam over to Silver. When Silver got grasp of the boy he grasped him pretty hard making the boy cry in pain. Silver glared at the boy with a smirk, big yellow eyes locked on the tiny miniscule human. \"Alright kid.....time to go\" Silver bellowed. Adam didn't even struggle becuase his fate was sealed, he would be with his brother soon as so he thought. As Silver opened his jaws to lower the boy in he thought of a sinister idea. As the boy layed helplessly on the giant pink muscle the hedgehog closed his mouth slowly and soon the boy was trapped inside the maw of the giant. Suddenly the giant tongue jumped and the boy was pressed against the ceiling of te hedgehogs mouth. Silver moaned happily in satisfaction taking pure pleasure in the taste. Silver swashed the boy around and eventually pressed the boy against his cheek. Silver grunted in power of the control he had over the boy and also because of the taste. \"Mhmm you taste really good human\" Silver bellowed as Adam heard it from inside his mouth except amplified 1000x louder almost blowing out his ear drums. Soon Silver was getting enough of the boys taste and decided it was time. Silver had a glint in his eye and he slowly lifted his head up to send the boy down. Adam prepared to meet Silver stomach as he screamed out to Tom \"Tom I'm coming! Don't worry I'm here for you!\" Adam then heard a bellowing chuckle deep from the throat noting Silver thought that was pathetic. Tom had heard his brother from up above which made him feel better. Silver then laughed as he lowered his head back down which confused the boy. \"Sorry Adam there was one thing I forgot to tell you. You said you wanted to be eaten right?\" Silver bellowed deep from bus throat. The boy became confused \"yes please eat me!\" Adam cried. \"okay it's your choice\" Silver laughed. Soon the tongue jumped and Adam was jerked towards one of the giant molars and quickly the tooth came down while half of Adam was caught in the way and soon the crunch. Adam stopped all actions and he realized what had happened and looked down and saw from the waist down was crushed completely flat. There was a quick pause and soon Adam screamed as loud as he could from the pain and started crying as he cringed at the sight. Silver and the other hedgehogs heard the scream and all of them laughed. You from the glass prison just shook your head. \"Sorry you asked for this! You said eat me pwease! Eat me pwease!\" Silver laughed immitaing Adam's plea.   Tom had heard his brothers scream and became uneasy and started to tear again. By then Adam was still screaming and Silver wanted it too end. Silver then began chewing and the crunching began Adam was being pulverized and shredded to pieces and soon the screams were over and Silver ended him with one final gulp. Tom heard gurgling from above and then pieces of meat fell from above and then an eyeball landed Toms lap and the big realized his brother was eaten and began screaming and crying and that was the end of the brothers.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The 3 Gods began laughing at the pathetic end of the 2 brothers. \"Silver your so cruel!\" Sonic said with a grin. \"Yeah I know\" Silver laughed back at the comment. Soon the hedgehogs grew bored and decided to watch tv. The three hedgehog took a seat on the couch thief sexy asses toching down and they kicked back and watched the televsion. You looked up at the 3 with shock \"wow I guess they forgot about me?\" you asked yourself. The 3 hedgehogs sat as they watched the tv and Shadow picked up the remote to change the channel. He final stopped on a move channel and the 3 saw Godzilla on the tv. \"man I'm bored\" Sonic said with a sign. \"yeah let's go shrink some more humans\" Shadow replied. Silver paid no attention to what his friends were saying as he watched in astonishment and he saw on the tv the giant reptiles foot coming down and stomping a taxi. Silver then shot his eyes wide as he thought of the greatest ideas ever. Silver then hopped of te couch quickly which startled the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys I got it! Instead of shrinking the people......why don't we just grow? Ya know we grow instead of shrinking everythig else\" Silver shouted happily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Silver that's an awesome idea! I never been an actually giant before! I say we do it!\" Sonic jumped up in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but how?\" Shadow replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question\" Sonic replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec guys.....back in the mall. What was the word you guys said to shrink everyone?\" Silver asked <br>\r\n the two hedgehogs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaos shrink?\" Sonic and Shadow said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah let's try Chaos \"grow\" instead!\" Silver shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then let's do it\" Sonc said. You watched as the three hedgehogs huddled around the chaos emerald and looked down upon it as it began to glow.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe hedehogs then counted down and at te three of them At the same time shouted<br>\r\n\"CHAOS GROW!\"           </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as the three spoke those words, the Chaos Emerald began to release a radiant light. The light did not fill the entire room, but seemed to be concentrated around the three hedgehogs. You, unnoticed by the three hedgehogs, were also caught in the light. You shielded your eyes from the brilliant light, while Sonic and his buddies stared into the chaotic energy with grinning faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s working!\u201d shouted Silver. \u201cI can feel so much power swelling up inside me! It feels like it\u2019s going to explode!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel it too!\u201d Shadow shouted, looking down at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick, let\u2019s put our shoes back on before we start growing. I don\u2019t want to be stomping around in my socks!\u201d Sonic said. The three comrades darted toward the corner of the room where they had tossed their shoes and quickly slipped them back on. No sooner had they put them on there feet that they began to expand. Their bodies quickly filled the room, which as far too small to contain their giant forms. \u201cUgh\u2026I guess we should of grown outside\u2026\u201d Sonic groaned as his back pressed against the back wall. If they didn\u2019t break out of the house soon, they were going to get squashed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, a random passerby was on his way to the city when he noticed Sonic\u2019s house. The blue speeder\u2019s home was atop a hill near Station Square. The man stopped his car in front of the house and peered at it like it was some kind of national monument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this is Sonic the Hedgehog\u2019s house! I better get a picture to bring home to the kids.\u201d the man told himself as he opened his glove compartment and searched for the camera. As he did this, he suddenly heard a loud booming sound come from Sonic\u2019s house. The man turned back to see the roof of the house completely destroyed. Not only that, but three figures were emerging from the building. Judging by their odd colored bodies and spines, they could only be Sonic, Shadow, and Silver! But why were they growing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, so much for your house, Sonic.\u201d Shadow said as his expanding foot mowed down the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it! The humans built me this house for being their \u2018savior\u2018. I can always make them build me a new one.\u201d Sonic replied as he and Shadow stepped out of the house, knocking down a few houses in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, you won\u2019t mind if I do THIS?\u201d Silver asked just before slamming his butt on the remains of the house, crushing it and everything inside. He laughed as his quickly expanding ass overtook the rubble. It had been so easy to destroy it\u2026to think they had just been sitting in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their growth into true giants came to a halt around 300 feet, Sonic noticed the passerby parked in front of his house. With a smile, the blue giant stomped over to the driver. The man quickly stepped out of his car and gazed up at the blue titan with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that really you, Sonic?\u201d the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many other sexy blue hogs do you know?\u201d Sonic answered, putting his hand son his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026why are you do big? Are you preparing for another big adventure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, REAL big.\u201d Sonic chuckled and lifted his shoe over the man\u2019s car. With one stomp, the vehicle was crushed flat under Sonic\u2019s red shoe. The man was flung away from the wreckage and landed next to Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-why did you do that?!\u201d the man yelled up at the blue hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sonic, who are you talking to?\u201d Shadow asked the teen, walking over to him and unknowingly stepping on the poor man. Shadow was so powerful now that he didn\u2019t even feel the man crunch under his air shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, no one.\u201d Sonic replied. He looked back at Silver, who was still smothering his house with his butt. \u201cCome on, Silver, let\u2019s go \u2018visit\u2019 the city!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Silver jumped up and was about to walk over to his two friends when he noticed something move near his foot. He looked down to see a human crawl out of the ruined house, somehow having survived his butt. It took a moment for Silver to realize who the human was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey everyone, it\u2019s our favorite bug!\u201d Silver called out as he reached down and grabbed you. Sonic and Shadow came over and peered down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it is! I totally forgot about him. The Chaos Emerald must have grown him too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations, kid, you\u2019re back to normal!\u201d Sonic laughed as he took you out of Silver\u2019s hand and gave you a quick squeeze. You glared up at the giant SEGA mascot, but didn\u2019t say anything. Yes, you were back to your original size, but now they were huge! Nothing had actually changed! \u201cWe\u2019re going to have some \u2018fun\u2019 in the city; wanna come for the ride?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few moments of silence where you thought Sonic was expecting an answer from you. Before you could utter one, he said, \u201cHaha, you thought you had a choice, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic held you closer to his body and released you. You screamed as you plummeted toward the ground, but in your desperation you managed to grab handfuls of Sonic\u2019s fur. You pressed yourself up against the huge mass of blue as you clung to it for dear life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on tight, little bug! Wouldn\u2019t want you falling!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three giants turned their attention to Station Square. With excited grins on their faces, the trio began the short trek toward the city. They were about to have a lot of fun at the expense of several million insects.  </span></div></div>",

People going to work, Kids playing around, criminals being busted by the police but little did they know what was in store for them. Stuck in the middle of traffic a gangsta looking kid in a Lamborghini huffed as was stuck there in traffic for at least an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin bullshit yo cmon! This fuckin traffic!' Tony yelled out the window of his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Tony began to noticed the ground was slightly shaking. Every couple seconds the shaking got more violent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mutha fucka What the fuck?\" Tony cursed acting all gangsta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he heard screaming coming from behind him and then 3 separate booming laughter's that came from from the sky. The thug looked out his window and turned around and went wide eyed at what he saw. He looked up in horror at the 3 Giants stomping down the busy highway and were heading his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Tony blurted out in shock. Tony looked back trough the front windshield and saw everyone getting out of their cars and running away. He pounded his fists into the steering wheel because he didn't want to abandon his car mostly because he paid a lot of money for it. The hedgehog giants were closing in on him but still he remained in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three hedgehogs looked below as they stomped down the busy highway all of them grinning evilly as they crushed cars and innocent people under their feet. they also laughed as the watched the tiny bugs runaway but were ultimately crushed in futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at these pathetic humans, they actually think they can get away?\" Shadow said with a smirk <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah these cars are puny too! i cant even feel them crunch under my boots!\" Silver said with a grin looking down and crushing a parked bus filled with people completely flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! This is it guys! Were Gods!\" Sonic shouted as he was the one closing in on Tony's lambo. Tony final decided to screw it and abandon his ride but it was too late. Tony got out and only got about 2 cars away from his until Sonic's trademark sneaker came down crushing Tony into the asphalt. Ironically Tony was crushed into ground while Sonic had completely missed the Lamborghini but Sonic was so big he didn't even notice the Epic fail that took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehogs rampaged punching and kicking every building that got in their way and only laughed as they watched the those buildings crumble. Shadow had stopped and noticed a bus that had crashed into his foot. Shadow grinned toothily as he reached down and clutched the bus in his gloved hand. The hedgehog brought the bus to his face and smiled from ear to ear as he looked inside the windows of the bus and saw the humans screaming and crying begging for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You humans are pathetic! so you all shall perish!\" Shadow bellowed. Shadow had the idea of just crushing the bus in his palm or simply eating it but he then had an even better idea. He had thought of what Sonic did to that clerk back in the mall and had decided the fate of these human. The dark furred God gave the people inside one last grin and slowly brought the bus behind him. Shadow then slipped the little bus in between the two dark furred mounds of muscle which was his butt and got ready to clench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye!' Shadow laughed as clenched his butt cheeks together and felt the minuscule vehicle crunch and collapse under the pressure. Finally his cheeks touched one another indicating the bus was gone. He reached between his ass and pulled out what was once a bus but now appeared to be a flat piece of metal. Shadow chuckled half halfheartedly as he tossed the flattened buss over his shoulder and continued onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhile Shadow had his fun Sonic had continued down the block and was running through buildings knocking him over one by one. He eventually came to a building that he towered over, it only reached up to his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo im beat! ugh i need a break!' Sonic said with a grin as he turned around and took a seat on top of the building. His ass touching down and the building buckled under his immense weight but surprisingly the skyscraper had held up the Sonic which amazed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh it feels good to be a Giant!\" Sonic exclaimed as he relaxed. Soon Sonic notice the building he was sitting on began to creak and crumble and eventually collapsed also sending the giant to land on his ass. Sonic was angry but laughed that he had took down a skyscraper by simply sitting on it. He continued laughing and went to join the other in the conquest.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic rejoined his friend and soon came to halt only because Silver had taken interest in a building that showed a good reflection from the windows. Silver stomped over to the building  and it was almost as tall as him. Looking at it he saw himself in the building and his sexy body. He turned around to get a good look at his ass which made him feel hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow i really do got back!\" Silver said to himself while feeling up his own ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white giant then stood closer to building and bent down his knees to look inside the skyscraper. He laughed as he saw little humans staring at him with shocked expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and Shadow both became irritated with the hold up until their eyes looked downward. Both hedgehogs gaped at the beautiful sight with tongues hanging out they drooled over Silvers perfect round and tight ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm Silver's got ass doesn't he Sonic?\" Shadow said drooling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Silver's got quite a rump!\" Sonic replied also drooling over Silvers butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver then stood up and put his hands on his slender hips. He then drew his fist back and punched the building hard which caused it to crumble almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic\" Silver said simply as he stomped away to rejoin his friends and noticed saliva covered their mouths. He couldn't figure out why at first but then realized when Sonic and Shadow both gave him a smack to his butt which made him jump in anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey stop it! You guys got asses too! go smack your own!' Silver said jokingly<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe 3 of them all laughed and then Something nearby them caught their eyes. They all smiled evilly and began to stomp towards it.......   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

He noticed the front entrance to the mall open and a woman walk out. The woman took one look at the three giants, screamed in horror, and ran back into the building. \u201cAnd would you look at that! There\u2019s people inside it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, stupid humans! You\u2019d think they\u2019d avoid this place after everyone suddenly disappeared, but just an hour later it\u2019s packed again! This place is like a magnet for humans!\u201d Sonic said, shaking his head at the inferiority of the human race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me. Now we have an entire building full of tasty snacks!\u201d Silver cried out in joy as he began tearing off the roof to the mall. The tow other hedgehog gods helped him and in a matter of seconds the roof came flying off like cardboard. The giants peered into the building, seeing all the humans on the top floor stare up at them in awe. Only when Silver reached a gloved hand into the building and scooped up a handful of people did the humans begin to panic. Silver stuffed the humans into his maw and chewed them. He moaned as he felt them crunch under his teeth and fill his mouth with their tasty insides. \u201cShrunken or not, these humans are the best thing I\u2019ve ever eaten!\u201d Silver shouted out loud, causing a few chunks of people to spew out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww, Silver don\u2019t talk with your mouth full!\u201d Shadow scolded the younger hedgehog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d Silver muttered after swallowed the remains in his mouth. He wasted no time in gathering up a second handful and depositing it into his mouth. Sonic and Shadow mimicked him and snatched up human after human until the entire first floor was empty. Sonic responded to this dilemma by rearing back his fist and punching a hole into the floor. He then tore out the top floor, exposing the next area of the mall underneath it. Some shoppers had been buried alive by rubble when Sonic destroyed the above floor, but most were still alive and fresh for eating. When the hedgehogs had eaten their way to the last floor, they found it empty of any living meat. That\u2019s when they looked to their feet and saw the humans fleeing to their cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Quick, catch them before they all escape!\u201d Sonic yelled as he began snatching up potential snacks. The three gods split up and stomped through the parking lot, catching prey with one hand and holding them in the other. Most were caught before they got to their vehicles, but some managed to start up their cars and drive off. The hedgehogs still managed to catch some of these vehicles and pluck their human drivers and passengers right out of their seats. After a few minutes, the parking lot was empty except for several cars that were or were not crushed flat by the giant speedsters. The trio walked back over to the mall and sat down on it, crushing it completely under their butt cheeks. Station Square mall, once a popular place for people to go, was gone\u2026just like that. The rubble was uncomfortable on the hedgehogs\u2019 butts, so they got up and looked for another place to sit down and enjoy their meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they seated themselves in the parking lot, the trio began chowing down on their captured snacks. Humans were a lot like candy to the three gods; they could be consumed in a variety of ways. Instead of just munching the humans to pieces, the hedgehogs came up with several other ways to enjoy their tasty treats. They sucked on them, swallowed them whole, crushed them before slurping the remains up, and even bit off their heads and sucked out their insides. You had to watch the entire display from Sonic\u2019s waist\u2026they way Sonic grinned every time he took an innocent life just to fill his stomach. It was disgusting and wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver\u2019s next victim was a small child, no older than eight. The boy stopped his whimpering for just a moment to beg for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Mr. Silver, don\u2019t eat me! I want to grow up to be just like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Silver wasn\u2019t listening. He was too busy glancing over at Sonic and Shadow. The two hedgehogs were sitting next to each other and whispering while giving him weird looks. It was really suspicious\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what they\u2019re talking about\u2026\u201d Silver pondered before popping the screaming child into his mouth and crunching him between his molars. As he did this, Sonic got up and approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Silver\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what is it?\u201d Silver asked as he tossed a teen into the air and caught him in his mouth. </span></div></div>",

Silver\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as Sonic licked his lower lip, asking for entrance. At first Silver flailed a bit, but Sonic quickly grabbed his shoulders and held him in place. The white giant calmed down and opened his mouth to allow Sonic in. The two hedgehogs kissed each other as their tongues battled for dominance. This meant bad news for the small teen still inside Silver\u2019s mouth, who was tossed around like a rag doll and squished between the two giant, pink muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody help me!\u201d he cried, his voice unable to pierce the sound of Silver moaning with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmh, Sonic\u2026\u201d Silver purred as he gave into the older teen\u2019s tongue, allowing him to explore his wet cavern without resistance. Sonic smirked and took the opportunity he was waiting for. Using his skillful tongue, the faster hedgehog scooped the hysterical teen out of Silver\u2019s mouth and into his own. He then broke the kiss and stood up in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d Sonic said as popped the teen between his lips to show Silver and then sucking him back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s the big idea?! He was mine!\u201d Silver yelled, looking up at Sonic with anger and confusion. Sonic replied to the white hedgehog\u2019s statement by tilting his head back and swallowing the tiny human, sending him to the final destination of his hell ride: the hot stomach of Sonic the Hedgehog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine now.\u201d Sonic replied, smacking his flat stomach tauntingly. It was amazing how Sonic could consume so much human meat and never once did his gut look any pudgier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArrh\u2026bastard.\u201d Silver cursed at his fellow giant, wiping some saliva off his mouth. \u201cWas that the only reason you kissed me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of. Shadow dared me to do it, and you know I can\u2019t back down from a challenge.\u201d Sonic pointed a thumb to Shadow, who was sitting down and having trouble suppressing his giggles. \u201c\u2026however, you are a really good kisser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks, you\u2019re not bad yourself.\u201d Silver said, blushing a bit. The two giants stared at each other for several moments before one of them spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I\u2026can I kiss you again?\u201d Sonic asked, scratching the back of his neck nervously. He was already missing the taste of Silver\u2019s mouth. It tasted like meat\u2026human meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d Silver answered, giving the blue giant a sexy grin as he clenched his fist, crushing the rest of his captured snacks into pulp. As Sonic gave him his own sexy smile and advanced toward him, Silver wiped his bloody hand on the cement of the parking lot. In seconds, Sonic was on top of Silver and kissing him passionaly. This time, Silver gripped Sonic\u2019s slim waist with his hands. This wasn\u2019t good for you, as you watched Silver\u2019s giant gloved hand pass over you and almost come down on you. If the white hedgehog had decided to grip Sonic just a few inches higher, you would have been squished under his hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Shadow was watching his two friends make out and chuckled as he munched on humans as if they were popcorn. He was surprised by this, but he was a bit envious. He thought Silver was sexy too, but decided to allow Sonic to have him this time. He would always get his chance later. For now, he just sat back and watched the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hedgehogs made out for a good while, occasionally breaking up for air but immediately going back to invading each other\u2019s mouths. After ten whole minutes, Silver need to rest and let himself fall against Sonic\u2019s chest. Sonic wrapped his arms around his time traveling friend and Silver burrowed his face deeper into his chest in response. Sonic looked down at Silver\u2019s blissful face and took in how cute he was. Cute for a psychotic, mass murdering, sadistic god\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants sat there together in silence for awhile. Eventually, Silver heard Sonic\u2019s sexy voice ring in his ears.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Do you hear sirens?\" Sonic said looking at Silver. Still clutching on to the blue gods waist soon enough you were relieved when you also heard the sirens.<br>\r\nAt the end of the block you and the giant hedgehogs saw an entire army of police cars, swat cars, helicopters, firetrucks,ambulances and Tanks! turning around the block and heading straight for the giants. Sonic and Silver became irritated by the disruption and Sonic gave Silver one last kiss and got up off his companion and the three Gods stood up and glared down at the massive army that were at their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of one of the Tanks was the city's chief of command, in other words he was the head of authority of police, the swat and the military. The giants just grinned as they peered down at the tiny army general that stood before them. The chief took out a megaphone and spoke out to the giants<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is General Thomas Conway speaking!  I order you to cease your senseless rampage of destruction on the city! So surrender yourselves peacefully or we wont have to use brute force!\" The General stated his voice amplified by the megaphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Gods just stared blankly at the tiny general giggling and trying to hold in the laughs but eventually the hedgehogs burst out in hysterically laughter. The general with the rest of the army watched as the towering sexy Gods laughed clutching their sides, You had a hard time hanging on to the waist of the blue God as his abdomen kept moving in and out from his laughter. Finally Sonic stop his laughter and spoke <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to be kidding? You a \"tiny\" human is ordering us \"giants\" to stop our fun? you cant be serious!\" Sonic laughed as he wiped away a tear from his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you and what army general!?!?' Silver roared pointing down at the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh Silver.....he does have an army\" Shadow replied putting his palm to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.....never mind then hehe\"  Silver chuckled putting a hand behind his head in embarrassment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then put his hands on his hips almost crushing you and glared at the general with a glint in his eye. He then crouched down as low as he could go to get a better view of the general causing the general to shake in his boots. Even though the general was married and had two kids, he had to admit the giant crouching before him was indeed a very sexy being as well as the other 2 giants. Sonic grinned evilly while eyeballing the chief, He was scared but remained still while other soldiers that were next to him had ran back the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want us to stop destroying the city? Okay then well stop....\" Sonic said simply while closing his eyes. Shadow and Silver were shocked in awe at what he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic are you serious?\" Silver asked in a worried tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hpmh\" Shadow grunted in anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general was glad that the giant had come to his senses and started walking back to his men but as he was walking away Sonic opened his eyes and smiled evilly. Sonic raised a gloved fist and slammed it down crushing a couple of soldiers and 3 police cars. Sonic lifted his fist and revealed the police cars and they  were completely flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops Sorry! looks like i should watch were i slam my fist next time!' Sonic said laughing sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe General turned around and saw the hedgehog smiling devilishly as he just crushed and killed innocent officers. Sonic then stood up and placed his hands on his hips again <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Sonic! i knew you wouldn't quit like that!\" Silver said as he hugged the blue speedster<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general became enraged and looked and saw the bodies of officers he was good friends with and then looked up and saw the white giant hugging the blue one he was pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright men! do not hesitate! OPEN FIRE!!!!!' screamed the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that officers, swat, soldiers, helicopters, and the tanks readied their aim and fired. Bullets and missiles soared towards the giants and Hedgehogs were caught off guard by the hasty attack. Bullets and missiles struck the three giants and the giants were engulfed in a large cloud of smoke. The general snickered as he grew victorious as it was a direct hit he thought the giants were finished, or so he thought. Eventually the army had cease fire and began jumping in joy and celebrating in victory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got em!\" the general said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them watched as the smoke cleared and were hit with a wall of shock at what they saw Their the Gods stood smiling evilly their hands on their hips as there wasn't barely a single scratch on them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it cant be? The-there st-still alive!?!?\" The general said to himself all frightened. The massive army were shocked and were now frightened that all that weaponry and bullets and missile did even graze the skin of the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! is that all you got? Its gonna take a lot more than that to take us down!\" Sonic snickered wiping dust and dirt off his arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puny ants and their weapons.....how pathetic!\"  Silver grinned <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare they shoot at us? and pathetically not even cause damage? i cant believe why we even bothered to protect you pathetic bugs!\" Shadow bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'C'mon guys! lets show these army ants why you shouldn't mess with us Hedgehog Gods!\" Sonic stated three Gods began to advanced on the l<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sonic grinned as he swiftly stomped his foot crushing a large group of soldiers and officers and stopped to enjoy the feel and sounds of them crunching under his sneakers. Soldiers and cops frantically kept to their guns and fired up at the giants which once again proved futile as they didn't even graze the Gods. Shadow looked down and felt little pricks and nicks all over his body but just smiled at this. \"Foolish humans you should have runaway while you had the chance!\" Shadow bellowed as he shook his head as raised his air shoe above these soldiers and simply stomped them chuckling as he enjoyed the sound of their bodies crunching and popping under his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sonic and Shadow were stomping out the infantry Silver had taken interest in the tiny vehicles. Like a happy toddler, Silver got down on his belly crushing some infantry and two police cars that he didn't notice and peered down grinning at the little cars and tanks before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! look at all the pretty toys!\" Silver giggled as he reached his gloved hand down and picked up a tank. Silver brought the tank to his face and examined it like a curious child. \"Wow this puny tank is sooo intimidating!\" Silver said sarcastically peering through and seeing the tiny soldiers inside. Soon Silver had grown bored of the dull tank and crushed it in his fist easily and tossed the crushed tank over his shoulder. The white god soon got up and on his feet and rose his boot into the air to crush the pesky infantry and cars until he noticed by his face what seemed like flies to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helicopters? these are helicopters?\" Silver said Shaking his head while putting a hand on hip. The helicopters flew close enough to be 5 feet away from the Gods handsome face. The soldiers prepared to fire at the God until Silver breathed in heavily and blew. Silver thought it was amazing! his breath was able to blow back helicopters! Silver bellowed in laughter as he watched 3 out of the 5 helicopters fall pathetically to the ground. The other 2 choppers regained balance and approached the giant once again. Silver got irritated by the persistence and swiftly grabbed the two choppers in each hand. He brought them to his face and grinned showing off his razor sharp teeth. As Silver opened his mouth to bring one of the choppers in soldiers who were smart enough jumped out before helicopter disappeared in the Gods mouth. Silver began chewing on the little copter but squinted in distaste of the helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww yuck!\" Silver said spitting out the half flattened helicopter and wiping his mouth. The soldiers thought they have escaped with their parachutes and celebrated in victory but soon they were engulfed in a strange blue aura. The soldiers panicked struggled as they started floating back up and towards the giants face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh some real food!\" Silver bellowed whilst licking his lips as with the tiny soldiers floating his front of his mouth. Silver opened his maw revealing his sharp teeth and his saliva covered tongue and the tiny men screamed in panic and struggle to break free again but was once again futile. Silver mockingly waved to the soldiers goodbye as they floated into Silvers maw and the moment they touched his tongue he instantly sealed his mouth shut trapping the puny ants inside. Silver swashed and swished the men around his mouth covering them in saliva. One of the soldiers lit a flare which lit up the inside of the wet cavern. Another Soldier also readied his combat side knife almost dropping it out of his hand due to the saliva. He quickly took a strong grip of his knife and stabbed it hard and down into the massive tongue pulled on it creating a large gash which instantly spewed blood. The hedgehog actually felt this and screamed out in pain tearing a little from the sharp pain on his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww! oww! my tongue! oww! it hurts\" Silver cried out in pain with his mouth open. With that he instantly spit out the soldiers and dropped the other helicopter and  clutching his mouth in anger and let the soldiers and helicopter fall to the ground. Silver began to cry as he tried to get the knife lodged in his tongue out but couldn't. The other hedgehogs instantly stopped what they were doing and ran over to their fellow giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silver whats wrong?\" Shadow asked with concern as he stepped on the soldiers Silver spat out earlier without knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright silver?\" Sonic asked worriedly as he stomped on the helicopter Silver dropped also unknowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! ow! i tried to eat a couple of soldiers but.....they stabbed my tongue and i cant the tiny knife out!\" Silver said sobbing in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here open you mouth! Lemme try and get it out!' Sonic asked hurriedly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white God opened his maw and Sonic looked in and instantly saw the knife, The inside of Silvers mouth was covered in blood and Sonic had felt bad for his fellow giant.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSonic carefully clutched on to the knife but slipped every time he tried to pull on it and kept trying and trying but couldn't get it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch! i cant get it out!' Sonic said frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this Shadow was angry....really angry. One of his fellow Gods getting hurt by tiny pathetic bugs severely angered Shadow. He turned around and looked back at the army ants a couple feet away. \"Aaarggghh! You fuckin pathetic bugs! how dare you hurt my Silver! He roared in anger and stomped thunderously towards them. They were frightened by the bellow God and instantly retreated but they weren't quick enough. With a thunderous stomp he crushed about half group of soldiers and raised his other foot and stomped it in rage crushing the rest of the ants at his feet. He then turned to the tanks and police cars and furiously stomped all of them flat as pancakes. When he was finished Shadow huffed in rage as he looked down at the destruction he had caused. Shadow had taken out the city entire military defense by himself but still he wasn't satisfied. In the distance he saw a lone tank, it looked different and was bigger than the other ones. Inside that tank was no other then general Thomas Conway.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arggh!\" The general grunted in anger through the megaphone of the tank but Soon the general smiled \"Heh heh heh! With these kinetic missiles this tank is equipped with Your going down giant!!!\" Shouted the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow just stood then grinning cockily and put a hand on his hip \"You really think your puny missiles can stop me? Hmph c'mon give me your best shot human!\" Shadow replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the large tank readied his missiles, and the tank fired the large kinetic missile blowing the tank back violently. The dark furred just remained his position and did not move. Eventually the large missile struck the hedgehog in chest hard but Shadow's muscular Pecs literally caused the missile to bounce right off of him and cause him virtually no pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really all you got? How pathetic!\" Shadow stated in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general got worried that the giant was right but then an idea cam into his head and snickered evilly at his new plan. The general readjusted his aim and got ready to fire another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your actually trying again? Foolish human! Your pathetic missiles cant cause me harm!\" Shadow said mocking the general but the general was sure his plan was foolproof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the large tank fired again causing the tank to blow back and again the giant hedgehog did not move! he remained in his spot. Shadow then closed his and crossed his arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph I'll give you credit human! for actually trying to fight back agai- eek!\" Shadow was interrupted as quickly shot his eyes open and looked down and saw the kinetic missile had struck his crotch! Embarrassingly Shadow fell to his knees both of his hands clutching his crotch as he cursed out in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general had laughed at the success of his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you aint human! but i was pretty sure you had balls hedgehog!' Laughed the general. Shadow cursed that the general was right. The three hedgehogs were \"equipped\" but they were kept away from sight internally, the only evidence that their was anything there was the noticeable bulges the hedgehogs had in their crotch area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh thats gotta hurt!' Sonic said chuckling a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Shadow had got up on his feet now clutching his stomach because the pain had moved upward. Shadow had felt embarrassed but soon the pain faded quickly and was in full form once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shot human but ill wont let a slip up like that happen again!\" Shadow bellowed in anger. Shadow quickly stomped towards the tank and swiftly tried to stomp it but the tank dodged his stomp and fired another kinetic missile but Shadow dodged carefully as it almost hit his privates again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hpmh lets see if you can handle this!' Shadow chuckled as turned around brought his ass down and landed directly on the tank. He then swiveled feeling the tank crush underneath him and eventually got up and inspected the tank. It was crushed pretty bad but not flatten and then noticed the general crawl out from the wreckage. The general finally got on his feet and suddenly was surrounded by giants gloved hand and was squeezed and was brought up to the air to the giants face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your men have brought pain to my friend......you also have brought great pain to me! Now your gonna feel the pain!\" Shadow bellowed as he used two fingers and pressed against the generals head. The giant slowly began to press his fingers slowly on the generals head causing general Conway to scream in pain. Soon the generals head finally gave away and crushed under the pressure. Shadow chuckled in triumph and he sucked out the insides of the generals body and then tossed it into his mouth and swallowed it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then returned to his friends and saw Silver was still sobbing a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any luck of getting the knife out?\" Shadow asked his fellow blue giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No its too small for my fingers to pull out\" Sonic replied. Both of them looked at Silver in sorrow and felt bad but then Sonic had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shads i got an idea!\" Sonic said as he looked hoping to see you and unfortunately he did. Sonic plucked you off his waist and carefully brought you to his face. You were surprised that Sonic wasn't crushing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bug we actually need you for once!\" Sonic said chuckling a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need me?\" you replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silver tried to eat a couple soldiers and one of them happen to stabbed his tongue and were too big to get the knife out....your small enough to pull the knife out\"<br>\r\nSonic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what was happening the people who tormented you all this time were asking you for help you still couldn't even register fully what Sonic said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't help us.....well lets put it this way if you don't help us say good bye to your life Human!\" Shadow bellowed interrupting your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought hard of what to do and you looked and saw Silver tearing and frowning and actually felt kind of bad for him but then remember when he ate those brother earlier and didn't feel bad anymore. You thought what you should do?                <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

You still had a life to live; why should it end here? You felt bad for those two brothers and everyone else that had lost their lives to these three, but why should you surrender yourself to their fate? You should honor the victims by living and remembering them. Then again, your future didn\u2019t look very bright. Even if you did help Silver, Sonic would just put you back on himself and possibly kill you later. He might accidentally crush you when he lies down to sleep. If you wanted to live, you had to get away from them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you\u2026but only on one condition! After I get the knife out, I want to be set free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No way!\u201d Sonic responded instantly. \u201cWhy should we let a bug like you escape? The deal is you either help us and live a little longer, or refuse and die right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you can kill me right now, because I\u2019m not helping! In the meantime\u2026\u201d You pointed a finger at Silver. \u201cYou can keep that knife lodged in your tongue and suffer! As long as it\u2019s in there, you won\u2019t be able to eat any more people! You probably won\u2019t be able to kiss Sonic either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic, he\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Silver mumbled, wincing because it hurt just to talk. \u201cLet\u2019s just agree with his demands. There are plenty of pathetic humans on this planet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose your right\u2026\u201d Sonic replied, not seeing much harm in letting one human free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI for one am against this!\u201d Shadow shouted, shaking his fist in anger. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be gods! Gods who kill the weak humans, no matter how young or old they are! Gods who can brush off a military attack like it\u2019s nothing! Are we seriously going to let one stupid kid go free? Let\u2019s just squish him and find another human to help us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook around, Shadow. The immediate area is completely leveled. If there are any survivors, they\u2019re probably buried under tons of rubble. Even if we did find someone alive, they\u2019d probably in too much of a panic to listen to us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! Sonic, it hurts so bad!\u201d Silver cried, clasping his mouth in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, Silver. Just open up for a second.\u201d Sonic said as he brought you over to Silver, who strained to open his mouth wide. Shadow scoffed and turned away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic quickly deposited you into the maw of Silver and you bounced up an down. You couldn\u2019t believe you were inside his mouth\u2026you never believed you\u2019d be in here unless he decided to eat you. Silver, still in pain, was constantly moving his tongue and making it hard for you to get around. You scanned the giant muscle thoroughly until your eyes fell upon the knife. You crawled over to, disgusted by the mix of saliva and blood that was covering you. When you reached the knife, you saw that it had made a nice gash in the hedgehog\u2019s tongue. You thought about slamming down on the knife, causing the giant unbelievable pain in the process. While that would be fulfilling, it would also doom you for sure. You set your mind on living, so you grasped the knife tightly by the handle and started to pull. Silver responded by groaning in pain and thrashing his tongue wildly. You held onto the knife for dear life to avoid being thrown around the wet cavern. After several seconds of agony for Silver, the knife finally came out. Seconds later, Silver spat you into his hand along with some blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he get it? \u201c Sonic asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Silver mumbled, his tongue still a little sore. He placed you on the ground and turned back to Sonic. \u201cIt still hurts a little, but it should heal by tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, lets go find a river or something to wash your mouth out with.\u201d Sonic comforted his friend and wrapped his hand around him. He guided Silver away outside the city, leaving Shadow alone with you. The black hedgehog glared down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? What are you waiting for? Get out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at Shadow, half-expecting him to lift his foot and crush you like a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said go, before I change my mind!\u201d Shadow shouted, stomping his foot and sending a tremor through the earth. You got the message and ran down the destroyed street, still grasping the bloody knife in your hand. \u201cIf we ever see you again, we\u2019ll treat you just like any other bug! Remember than!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow turned away from the fleeing human and looked off into the distance. There was still plenty of Station Square that was still standing\u2026perhaps he\u2019ll let off some steam before the others get back. </span></div></div>",

Shadow just wanted to run down their after you and crush, if it was under his foot or under his ass, he wanted you crushed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he couldn't do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic had promised you freedom if you'd help Silver only because Silver suggested it was worth doing it and he didn't want to piss off his comrades. Still Shadow couldn't let you go that easy. He had crushed you under his ass before and he wanted feel your minuscule body being crush again.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hphm! No way im letting that kid get away so easily. When the time comes and i find him........He's mine! But for now,\" Shadow stopped turning back towards the  city in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think ill go lay waste to whats left of this puny city! and then hunt that little insect down.......and crush him! Muwhahaha!\" Shadow laughed as he stomped towards the deeper part of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sonic and Silver had stomped towards the nearest beach. Silver still winced in pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Sonic it still hurts!\" Silver whimpered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Silver were almost to the beach, the salt water would be great for your healing your wound\" Sonic said patting Silver on the back, also giving him his trademark smile and thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately People still crowded the beach obviously not knowing of the rampaging giants that attacked the city. Everyone was having fun swimming in the water, flying kites, tanning but Soon that would all change. Suddenly beach goers started to feel tremors in the sand and became worried until they saw the two massive Hedgehogs heading towards the beach. The tremors shook the ground more and more as the giants grew closer and the beach was in panic! Everyone grabbed their stuff and ran away to their vehicles, Some even jumped into the water to swim away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Sonic and Silver made it the beach parking lot both grinning at the panic they caused but paid no attention to where they were walking. People managed to get into their cars and start them but most of them were ultimately crushed by the sexy Hedgehogs giants massive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh this beach is so peaceful!' Sonic said he breathed in the fresh air as he stomped several beach goers into the sand without even knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow the water is gorgeous!' Silver gasped with amazement as he stepped on the lifeguard post completely destroying it without even noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic stayed (hence being afraid of water) as Silver got about ankle deep in and bent down and started rinsing his tongue with the salt water. Sonic taking a seat in the sand, sitting on a couple of lifeguards and enjoyed the view of the beautiful sun, the crystal clear water and the especially the glistening ass of his fellow giant rinsing out his mouth. Sonic licked his lips at the sight and soon he saw Silver was waving his ass back and forth Sonic blushed in anger that Silver was teasing Him. Sonic then couldn't take it anymore he got up, wiping the sand out if his ass also the dead lifeguards and dashed out and tackled his the sexy young hedgehog into the water. They both got up and laughed at they both started to splash each other and chase each other around in the water. Despite being afraid of water Sonic's lust for Silver's body desire was more important than his aqua phobia.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn downtown Station Square Shadow laughed maniacally as he stomped punching and kicking any buildings that got in his way. Citizens ran in terrow from the towering sexy God. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Run you pathetic little worms! Run from your God! RUN FROM THE ULTIMATE LIFEFORM!\" Shadow roared as he stepped back and punched a tall office building and completely obliterated it. Shadow looked around his tiny surroundings with triumph. He felt unbelievable power rush through his veins he felt like a true god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark God then turned to his right and saw a highway filled with fleeing citizens. He grinned evilly as he started to stomp down the street chanting as he stomped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fee!....Fi!......Fo!......Fum!......Squish!......Squash!.......Stomp!.. .....Crunch!\"  Shadow enjoyed the feeling of countless humans being squashed under every step he took. He remember back when he was on the Ark maria had read him the story while growing up \"jack and the beanstalk\" And felt powerful actually using those words himself while also throwing in his own choice of words as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria! I know you told me to protect these creatures but as the God i am i get to chose who lives and who dies and i say TO HELL WITH THESE HUMANS!!!\" Shadow roared as he stomped down an apartment flat with ease. Shadow continued down the street crushing everything that got in his way until something caught his eye below. A little elementary school sitting so innocently in front of him. He glared down at it crossing his arms. He then crouched down eying the tiny school buses. He picked one up and looked inside and saw it was empty. He frowned and tossed it high over his shoulder and stood back up. He laughed and raised his air shoe over the tiny school getting ready to stomp it but then he got another idea. He then lowered his shoe and laughed as he turned around and sat back deciding to sit on the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh this school gets a special way to end because i love children!\" Shadow stated sarcastically and he began slowly lowering his ass on the school. He giggled as he felt the schools clock tower touch his right ass cheek and soon crumbled from the pressure. Finally his ass touched the top of the school and slowly began to increase the pressure the school slowly buckling under his weight. The children inside the school cried and screamed as they were about to meet their end. Finally Shadow let himself go and the school disappeared underneath the Gods muscular butt cheeks with a boom. All Shadow did was laugh as he twisted and turned his ass crushing everything under him even more. Soon he got up and inspected the school and everything including the buses were crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hphm Poor kids.....shouldn't have went to school today\" Shadow said grinning as he continued on stomping on the remains of the school not even care that he had taken the lives of innocent children........                </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the beach, Sonic and Silver were starting to wrestle with each other in the water. Their giant bodies crashing into the water created tidal waves that swept toward the beach. Tiny humans who were still in the process of escaping were dragged into the ocean by the waves and brought closer and closer to the wrestling gods. They desperately tried to swim against the waves, but most were eventually crushed somewhere on the hedgehogs\u2019 bodies. The two gods\u2019 wrestling match finally came to a halt when Sonic pinned Silver underneath him. The white-furred psychic tried to escape, but Sonic\u2019s hold was too strong. As Sonic had Silver where he wanted him, he came down and planted a quick kiss on the other\u2019s lips. Silver smiled up at Sonic and returned his kiss with a quick smooch of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think Shadow\u2019s doing?\u201d Silver asked as he stared into the blue speedster\u2019s emerald eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, why don\u2019t you look for yourself?\u201d Sonic replied as he looked off into the distance. Silver tilted his head and looked where Sonic was looking. Smoke could clearly be seen rising from where Station Square was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like he\u2019s having fun.\u201d Silver said before he giggled when Sonic kissed him on the cheek. He looked back at his lover and said, \u201cDo you think he let that human go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. Don\u2019t really care. Why? Do you care about that human?\u201d Sonic raised an eyebrow and gave Silver a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d Silver shouted back. \u201cHe may of pulled that knife out of my tongue, but he\u2019s still just a bug. If I ever see him again, I\u2019ll probably squish him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026me too. It\u2019s like a band aid. It helps you when you\u2019re hurt, but once it\u2019s done its job\u2026into the trash it goes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hedgehog gods laughed as they compared a human to a band aid. You should be honored, however. These two powerful gods usually thought of humans as something LESS than a band aid\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to get hungry again.\u201d Silver said as he scratched his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain? Don\u2019t you ever get full?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like these bugs are full course meals, you know. They\u2019re just snacks\u2026and it\u2019ll take A LOT of them to fill gods like us up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see if we can find you any food.\u201d Sonic glanced over at the beach and spotted his sexy partner\u2019s next snack. A man was attempting to crawl out of the water, but the blood around his leg showed that he had injured it somehow. \u201cEast picking\u2026\u201d Sonic smirked as he reached over and grabbed the man by his injured leg. The man howled in pain as he was brought in front of Silver\u2019s giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026he looks tasty.\u201d Silver said as he licked his lips. As he did this, he suddenly winced in pain. \u201cOw\u2026my tongue still hurts a bit. I don\u2019t know if I can eat him, Sonic\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026I think I have an idea.\u201d Sonic cracked a smile and brought the man over to his own mouth. The innocent victim screamed as the giant hero tossed him into his mouth and started chewing. Silver closed his eyes and took in the soothing noise of the man\u2019s bones crunching and his flesh tearing. As he waited to hear the sound of Sonic\u2019s gulping, he instead found Sonic pressing his lips against his own. The blue hedgehog pushed the man\u2019s pulpy remains into Silver\u2019s mouth and broke the kiss. Since the man was already chewed up, Silver simply needed to swallow his snack and didn\u2019t need to keep it on his tongue for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was good. It didn\u2019t hurt much either.\u201d Silver smiled as he gave his blue partner a thank you kiss. \u201cYou gonna eat any yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d Sonic looked back over at the beach and tried to pick out his next victim. Suddenly, his attention turned back to Silver when he noticed a bit of movement on the psychic\u2019s body. A few humans were climbing on top of Silver in an attempt to get away from the thrashing waves created by their movements. \u201cLooks like you have some bugs crawling on you, Silver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Silver looked down at himself. \u201cHow dare they climb on a god! I guess we need to punish them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver smirked as he plucked a human off his side and brought the morsel to Sonic\u2019s beautiful lips. The blue hedgehog smirked before he opened his mouth to receive his meal. As soon as Silver removed his fingers, Sonic began chewing the human to pieces. He moaned a bit at the taste and soon gulped the remains down to his churning belly. When Sonic looked back at Silver, he found him already presenting another human to him. This one looked like a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026he looks really tasty. Why don\u2019t we share this one?\u201d Sonic suggested as he took the teen out of Silver\u2019s hand and brought him up to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-please don\u2019t eat me! You\u2019re S-Sonic the Hedgehog! You\u2019re supposed to protect us! You can\u2019t--!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic ignored every sound that came out of the boy\u2019s mouth and uncaringly tossed him into his mouth. His jaws snapped shut and he tossed the screaming teen around his wet cavern. The boy\u2019s terrified screams eventually came to an end when Sonic bit down on his head and began chewing his body into mush. Once the teenager was reduced to paste, Sonic locked lips with Silver once again and the two young gods started making out. As they kissed passionaly, the teen\u2019s bloody remains were spread over the inside of their mouths. Silver\u2019s tongue still caused him pain, but the taste of the human and Sonic\u2019s mouth was greater than the pain and he endured it. They kissed for a full minute before separating for air. Sonic nuzzled into Silver\u2019s neck and kissed him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Sonic mumbled, planting another kiss on the other hedgehog\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too, Sonic.\u201d Silver replies as he stroked the older teen\u2019s back. </span></div></div>",

Dozens of police buggies and some <br>\r\nmore tanks scattered on the beach and readied to fire at the Gods. \"Com on Sonic let's squash these pests!\" Silver cackles evilly \"Nah forget these bugs let's go back and see what Shadows up too\"  Sonic and Silver laughed as got up on their feet and slowly advanced towards shore. The men watched the towering beings trotted toward them and began to flee. Sonic and Silver set foot on land and without even looking down stomped the police bugs into the sand and left the beach leaving behind half of them crushed in massive craters.                               Meanwhile back in Station square Shadow continued to terrorize the city punching and kicking any building that got in his way. Shadow Without his companions was unstoppable . Shadow grinned evilly as he stomped down a large busy street crushing dozens of cars and fleeing citizens without a care in the world also laughing as he enjoyed the sound of human bodies crunching underneath his feet \"Muwhahahaha! run all you like you pathetic humans! You can't run from the ULITIMATE GOD!\" Shadow roared as he continued taking away countless lives with each step. The dark furred God had stopped and put his hands on his hips. Shadow looked back in triumph at the destruction he'd caused and grinned at the giant foot prints in the tiny street \"Ahh I can get used to being a this big!\" Shadow exclaimed. Shadow then noticed a skyscraper next to him which was as tall as him and decided to have a peak inside. A man in the building behind Shadow looks out the window and is astonished by the biggest pair of ass cheeks he's ever seen in his life. Shadow stands back up and takes a swing at the scraper and laughs as it crumbles down before him. The man oogled the massive ass outside his window and suddenly the massive giant turned around and bent down and meet eyes with the massive giant. The man practically shit himself as he stared at the massive red orb at his windows. He then hears the giant deep evil laugh and then sees the giant become very \"excited\" and the the giant grabs the building and backs up and the man watches the giant's memeber thrust it's way towards him........                                                                                                                                              </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shadow\u2019s face filled with bliss as his massive cock slammed into the building. The hedgehog god burrowed his cock all the way into the building until his stomach was touching it. Then, he slowly began to remove his cock from the hole he created. When only his cock head was inside the building, the black titan thrust his erection back into the building. He grinned as he felt the walls and structure of the building get pushed aside like paper. The man who had been watching Shadow was killed with the first thrust; his body crushed flat as the cock slammed him against the nearby wall. Despite his death, the man\u2019s squashed corpse remained stuck to the tip of Shadow\u2019s cock as he rammed it into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026this feels great!\u201d Shadow exclaimed as he placed his arms on the top of the building and humped it with glee. When he put his arms down, he heard a scream and looked down to see he had accidentally crushed some people who had fled to the roof. Apparently, the other people in the building thought they could survive if they ran to the rooftop. What a bunch of stupid insects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, bugs.\u201d Shadow greeted with a cocky smile. \u201cEnjoying the show?\u201d Shadow chuckled and continued to thrust into the building, destroying it from the inside. Even though the crowd of people was stricken with fear, they couldn\u2019t help but stare up at Shadow with awe. The titan\u2019s furry chest puffed in and out as Shadow breathed. The black and white fur was covered in sweat, which splashed onto the humans as Shadow swayed back and forth. Even though the people knew they were about to die, they knew this was more than worthy of the last thing they\u2019ll ever see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m almost there\u2026\u201d Shadow grunted as he gripped the building tightly, causing it to break apart. \u201cI think I\u2019ll lube up my dick a bit\u2026\u201d Shadow smirked and quickly gathered up almost all the onlookers on the roof. He pulled out of the building and wrapped his gloved hand around his junk. The bug-sized humans never stood a chance; they were effortlessly smeared across Shadow\u2019s dick. Shadow took his hand away and smiled down at his bloodied up member before thrusting it back into the building. After a few more thrusts Shadow moaned in ecstasy and climaxed. Any windows that weren\u2019t shattered were obliterated when a torrent of white, sticky cum slammed into them. Shadow came into the structure for a whole ten seconds, watching with amusement as the floors of the building collapsed one by one. With a sigh, Shadow removed his cock and gave the building a gentle push. The cum-filled construction toppled over and hit the ground with a boom, sending a cloud of smoke and debris into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026only thing I could be better than that would be Silver\u2019s ass.\u201d Shadow commented as he licked the blood from his fingers. The giant spun around and walked away from his work, leaving behind many injured humans and even more deceased\u2026all so he could get some pleasure. </span></div></div>",

You began to fear that the only way you would even be able to get home would be if Sonic himself used his emerald to get you there, and you knew that would never happen he'd would most likely have fun with you again and finally kill you. You couldn't take that chance you had to find another way home. You continued running through the city also stopping to ask citizens if they could help you but they just ignored you as they ran away in a state of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you came to a street, you stopped as you gaped in awe that the entire block was flooded with an unknown white substance but by getting closer you realized what is was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" You said out loud with questions running through head of why one of these hedgehogs could have jerked it in the middle of the city? Suddenly something had grabbed your foot and you quickly looked down and saw that a man had been trapped in the hedgehog goo grabbed your leg in attempts to get himself free. Your took the mans hand and pulled him out with one tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sonny\" The middle aged man said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to bother but what happened here?\" you asked the man confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That black furred giant that's what happened!.......The damn monster got himself excited and plowed that corporate business building like it was some peace of ass!' the man yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second.........you mean?.......H-He.,...\"fucked' the building?\" You asked with eyes wide<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That what i said boy!

Heh heh your so naughty\" Silver asked nearly laughing at him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you idiots! i didn't masturbate!\" Shadow roared in reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well unless that's ice cream id say that jizz on you buddy\"  Sonic stated pointing at his crotch <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do then?\" Silver asked in curiosity <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh well ya see......i came across this building and i was in the moment......\" Shadow was cut off by Sonic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!?!?!  You fucked a building!?!?!!?\" Sonic screamed in disbelief  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Silver added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, i showed that building who was boss. Fortunately i was even able lube up too! you sure can use these humans in a multitude of different ways\" Shadow laughed in triumph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats fuckin awesome dude! where is the skyscraper now?\" Sonic asked curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh in ruins down the block behind me? wanna see for yourself?\" Shadow asked with a sexy tone cupping Sonic chin with his gloved hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright lets go!\" Sonic said in excitement as He and Shadow stomped down the street crushing more fleeing citizens as they raced down the block<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver was left to himself and began to feel jealous that Shadow had taken his man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hphm Shadow this he's so sexy and cool!  he screwed a building so what? i could do that too\" Silver with jealousy as he trotted down the block his other two companions had raced down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow down to walking you began to feel hopeless that you may never get home also the fact your shirt and pants were now ruined by massive hedgehog juice. Suddenly your worst fear had come true you began to feel the ground shake and violently as you watched in horror as the 3 hedgehog gods were running down the street crushing everything in their path and they were heading straight for you. You panicked that if they saw you they would make you their slave again and play with you against your will you thought running would be useless because they would catch up to you and obviously if you stayed where you were you would be crushed flat like a pancake you began to feel that you were doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you remembered some ways down the block you saw a abandon buss parked in an intersection which was out of the way of the hedgehogs massive feet. You instantly spun around and ran as fast as you could back the other way and didn't look back. You saw that the intersection was just a couple more feet and you looked back and saw the hedgehogs gaining and fast. It was gonna be close you kept running probably faster than you ever ran in your life. finally you made the quick left at the intersection just dodging Sonic's sneaker and you quickly boarded the bus and got down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out the window and saw the hedgehogs were right outside gathering around the building that Shadow had creamed earlier and laughed at the destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehogs laughed as Shadow told his experience of copulating with the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats fucking hot Shadow i wished i was there to see it\" Sonic said with a sign<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sonic if you look around there are still some tall buildings left, why don't you go try for yourself?\" Shadow asked deviously he approached Sonic cupping his ass in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Silver pissed he watched as Shadow rubbed Sonic butt playfully, steam literally spewed from Silvers ears he hated being left out............  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The devilishly handsome giant smiled at his reflection and started stroking his monstrous cock, getting it ready for what occurred next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026thinking about what I\u2019m going to do to this structure is turning me on!\u201d Sonic said as he stroked faster. In no time at all his mighty rod was fully erect and he grasped the building with his hands. Without checking to see if there were any humans in the building (there weren\u2019t; they had already evacuated) Sonic thrust his hips forward, ramming his cock into the building. The hedgehog member crashed through the windows; the glass shards barely tickling the hedgehog\u2019s sensitive skin. Sonic moaned as he pulled his dick out and rammed it back in. \u201cOh god\u2026this feels so good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a few blocks away from Sonic, but you could clearly see the entire thing. His blue skin started to sweat heavily as he made love with the human structure. You knew you should hide, but you couldn\u2019t take your eyes off the destructive giant. You never thought you\u2019d see Sonic the Hedgehog fuck a building\u2026it was such an extreme display of power and dominance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Shadow and Silver were watching their fellow god have his fun. Their eyes were mostly glued to his arse; those sweaty, blue glutes swaying as the speedster\u2019s body jerked back and forth. Shadow\u2019s red eyes happened to fall upon a bus nearby; the same bus you were hiding inside. A brilliant idea formed in Shadow\u2019s head as he stomped over to the bus. Silver\u2019s lustful eyes were so focused on Sonic that he didn\u2019t notice when Shadow moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow towered over your hiding spot, his shoes sending quakes through the ground that shook the bus. The sudden movement made you fall onto the floor. You looked up just in time for a glance at Shadow\u2019s body before he bent down and grasped the vehicle in his hand. The bus was picked off the ground and you shuddered in fear, thinking Shadow had somehow saw you. Instead of peering into the bus, however, Shadow merely carried it over to his copulating friend. Silver noticed him from afar and his mind began thinking the same thing he was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Silver muttered\u2026just before Shadow snuck behind Sonic and shoved the bus up his ass! Sonic\u2019s eyes widened and he moaned loudly as the foreign object was pushed past his butt hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! What\u2026what the hell is that?!\u201d Sonic asks as he turns around and sees Shadow smiling sexily at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing. Just a gift from me\u2026\u201d Shadow replied as he pushed the vehicle a bit more between Sonic\u2019s butt cheeks. Sonic\u2019s look of surprise quickly turned into one of pleasure as he clenched his but cheeks around the object, slowly crushing it. Inside the bus, you watched in horror as half the bus was slowly compacted. The seats squashed together into a mess of metal and leather and the windows shattered into hundreds of pieces. Luckily, you were in the half of the bus that wasn\u2019t being crushed between Sonic\u2019s ass. You desperately hung onto a pole to avoid sliding into the compacting section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your \u201csafe\u201d hiding spot tucked away neatly between Sonic\u2019s ass cheeks, Shadow stepped away and watched Sonic finish up on the building. His cock had leaked enough precum to flood several floors and the bus in his arse was speeding up his climax. Sonic mumbled something and gave the skyscraper a few more powerful thrusts. With a moan of pleasure, Sonic came into the building. Gallons of white hedgehog cum poured into the building, burrowing everything under its weight. A torrent of spunk shot out of the other side of the building, raining down on the streets below. A few small thrusts later, Sonic pulled out of the building and collapsed against it. It only took a few seconds for the building to crumble under the hedgehog\u2019s weight. Sonic and a mess of debris fell to the ground in a cloud of smoke. Sonic was uninjured, however, and simply picked himself up and dusted his legs off. He reached behind him and plucked out the half-crushed bus. He brought it before his eyes and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA BUS? Hehe\u2026wow\u2026never thought I\u2019d have one of these things shoved up my butt hole.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026looks like you enjoyed it.\u201d Shadow said as he approached Sonic. \u201cMaybe tonight you can have something else put up your butt\u2026\u201d Shadow gave Sonic a sly wink, ignoring Silver\u2019s twitching behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026sounds good.\u201d Sonic looked back at the buss in his hand. \u201cHey, wouldn\u2019t it be funny if there was someone in here?\u201d Sonic asked as he brought the bus up to his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but what are the chances of-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, there is!\u201d Sonic shouted as his eyes locked upon you, lying on the floor with your arms covering your head. You were scared out of your mind and your heart was beating rapidly. Your attempt to hide from the gods had failed\u2026you\u2019ve been found. The question was...what happens now?</span></div></div>",

Sonic shouted holding the bus up to his fellow Gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey its our little bug!\" Silver shouted his massive eyes glaring at you through the windows of the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and were not letting this insect go this time!\" Shadow added in whilst laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic put a hand on his hip and glared at you. Your heart was beating rapidly that not only you were found but you were once again at their mercy. You looked around the bus possibly thinking of jumping out of the bus to end your life right there and not be tortured by \"them\" but the bus was far to wrecked to get out of it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic shaked the bus in his first purposely laughing as he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bug, How did you like riding a bus that the last stop was my ass?\" Sonic laughed as he continued to shake the bus up and down. You bounced around the bus painfully hitting your head against the floor and then the pole that you once held on too. Suddenly Sonic striped the bus open like a candy bar and turned it on its side chuckling as you landed on his gigantic gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey long time no see little guy!' Sonic asked with his trademark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sonic, what are we gonna do with him?\" Shadow asked while evilly glaring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont Know Shads, ill probably just eat this kid and end him once and for all!' Sonic stated while bearing his sharp teeth to you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah i say we let him run as we all chase him and try to crush him!\" Silver Said laughing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's dumb Silver, the chase would only last like 2 seconds and Sonic would most likely be the one to crush him!\" Shadow scoffed with his fists to his hips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i would be the one to crush him\" Sonic closed his eyes in triumph<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then approached Sonic and put his arm around him \"How about we use him as a little toy for tonight?\" Shadow asked in a sexy tone also giving Sonic the same sly wink as before which made Sonic blush madly. Steam spewed from Silver's ears as he saw Shadow make the move on his lover. Silver then made his move, He used his psychic powers to pry Shadow off of Sonic and throw him away causing him to crash into a building completely demolishing it. Silver then hugged Sonic tight, cupping Sonic's ass with his left hand stroking Sonic's quills with his right<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets eat the kid together instead like we ate those humans on the beach\" Silver asked kissing Sonic passionately on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had cringed as you noticed the competition for Sonic's attention. You had to admit though Shadow and Silver had gorgeous bodies and tight asses but compared to Sonic, Sonic was a God to them. Sonic had all the right curves, the most handsome face, the best looking body and finally the most gorgeous ass. You weren't surprised why Shadow and Silver wanted \"him\" So badly especially to themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow had picked himself up from the rubble and saw Silver flirting with Sonic. Eyes filled with anger he stomped over to the two fellow Gods while crushing a car flat on the way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silver! get away from my Sonic!\" Shadow roared getting ready to take his gold bracelets off <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up yours Shadow! Sonic is mine!' Silver yelled back then aggressively kissing Sonic on the lips in-front of Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr! you-piece-of\" Shadow shouted and he charged Silver and tackled him both sent flying into a building across the way. You and Sonic watched wide eyed at the action that just looked place. Shadow then got up wincing from deep cuts from the building but then out of nowhere Silver charges Shadow and punches him across the face stunning him for a second Silver then readied another punch but Shadow caught his fist and then countered with a strong punch to the face making him fall over landing on his ass crushing a bus under it in the process. Silver sat up wincing rubbing his face while Shadow jumped on top of him and brought back a fist to punch Silver once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic watched as his two friends fought He was astonished that his two friends would actually fight over him but what Sonic was really astonished about was the fight itself.<br>\r\nSonic eyes were glued to his friends bodies as they fought. Their muscles sweat glistened as they swayed with each punch. Their asses drenched with sweat and when they were on the ground their hot bodies touching, their crotches touching one another, their asses rubbing up one another. Sonic didn't take his eyes off for even a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God......This is fucking hot\" Sonic said blankly as he started getting \"hard\" down there. You realized Sonic and the others obviously had forgotten about you especially the fact that Sonic's other hand was jerking his massive cock. You struggled and squirmed to get out of Sonic's fist but ultimately failed. Shadow was about to punch Silver in the face but Silver quickly used his psychic powers to push away and hold Shadow in place Shadow try to break free but Shadow could not move a muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Shadow, looks like your in a predicament here\" Silver cooed while slowly circling Shadow he finally stops infront of him and brought his fist back and punched Shadow in the face. Shadow then began furiously to try and break free but failed once again  \"Oh your fucking dead when i get free\"  Shadow grunted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hpmh! Yeah okay thats if you get free\" Silver laughed and he then followed by bringing back his muscular leg and kicked him strongly across the face. Shadow faced began to show bruising after Silvers two attacks. Silver laughed in Shadow's face mocking that Shadow couldn't touch him also playfully turning around and spanking his ass taunting Shadow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Shadow hit me!\" Silver laughed as he spanked his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHAOS CONTROL!!!\" Shadow yelled and then vanished into thin air which shocked Silver. Silver gasped as he nervously looked all around him and couldn't find a trace of him any where. Then out of nowhere Shadow appeared right infront of him surprising The white God \"So you like to play dirty heh?\" Shadow asked cockily as he brought his leg back and kicked Silver right between the legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww....\" Silver blurted out wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver collapsed to the ground grasping his crotch in shear pain almost crying from the pain. Getting kicked by the ultimate lifeform in the nuts, he would be lucky if his balls were still there fortunately his nuts were still intact just the pain was far worse than Hell. Shadow just peered down to the white giant on the ground smiling in victorious triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cmon Silver whats the matter? an old kick in the family jewels too much for ya?\" Shadow mocked as he turned around and squatted over Silver putting his black muscular ass directly in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Silver hows the view?\" Shadow laughed as he squatted lower and rubbed his ass all over Silver face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was having a ball he couldn't take it anymore the sight of his friends was too much for him after jerking for a long ten minutes he finally climaxed shooting his load everywhere. You just closed your eyes in disgust</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shadow rubbed his ass in Silver\u2019s face for a good few minutes; the hedgehog of the future in too much pain to do anything about it. Eventually the pain subsided and Silver retaliated by pushing Shadow\u2019s ass off his face and giving it a hard punch. The punch was infused with psychic force, making it powerful enough to send Shadow flying off him. The black and red hedgehog stood back up and rubbed his glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little punk!\u201d Shadow yelled at his fellow giant as he got ready to throw a Chaos Spear at him. Before he could\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough you two!\u201d came Sonic\u2019s voice. The two hedgehogs looked his way to see their blue comrade with his hands on his knees and panting a bit. Seeing the cum hedgehog seed everywhere, they both figured out he had jacked off to them fighting. \u201cI\u2019m touched that you\u2019re both fighting over me, but you shouldn\u2019t beat each other up! We\u2019re supposed to be friends here! Fellow gods!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how are we supposed to settle this, Sonic?\u201d Silver asked. \u201cI refuse to just hand you over to Shadow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t give you up either! I\u2019ve liked you ever since we first met!\u201d Shadow exclaimed. \u201cI love you even more than I loved Maria!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic smiled. These two both loved him equally, but Sonic knew he couldn\u2019t share his feelings with both of them. Only one could be his significant other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about a competition? The two of you put on a show and try to sway me to your side. Whoever I think put on a best act gets to have me.\u201d Sonic explained, flashing a sexy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happens to the loser?\u201d Silver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Shadow put his hands on his hips and have Silver a sly look. \u201cThe loser becomes second best! Sure, you might still get some action, but the winner will always come first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShadow\u2019s pretty much right.\u201d Sonic said with a shrug. He then sat his blue ass on top of a building and stared at the two giants competing for his affection. You still rested in his fist, not caring the least about this contest...but of your own fate afterward. \u201cNow get started! Let\u2019s see how sexy you two can get\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver and Shadow gave each other a dirty look and went their separate ways. Silver was the first to act; he spotted a high-speed train that had recently stopped. To his pleasure, there were still humans inside it! The terrified tinies could do nothing to flee since the train was not stopped at a station and hundreds of feet in the air. Silver stepped over the train so it was between his legs and grabbed it by both ends. After crushing the sections in his hands, the white hedgehog pulled the train off the tracks and began rubbing it between his legs. He moaned as the metal slid over his nut sac, breaking a few windows and filling the train with his powerful musk. Silver pulled harder on one end, sliding the train between his butt cheeks where it was squeezed and crushed. The people inside crushed instantly; becoming twisted and disfigured along with the metal. Before the train could fall apart in his hands, Silver brought his muscular thighs together and crushed the rest of the train. He tossed the scrap metal away and looked for something else to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow glared at Silver from afar before looking at a tall skyscraper similar to the ones he and Sonic had fucked. He grinned deviously before wrapping his strong arms around the building and pressing his body against it. The dark hedgehog started grinding his body against the structure, smoothing it out under his muscled form. As he did this he turned to face Sonic and looked at him sexily. Sonic\u2019s tongue hanged out of his mouth as he stared at Shadow\u2019s body turn the building into rubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shadow did this, Silver cursed under his breath and quickly looked for something to top that. He noticed a small fire hydrant on the streets below and got an idea. The massive hog stood above the fire hydrant and reached down. He plucked the red object out with his fingers, releasing a powerful pray of water into the air. Silver moaned as the water soaked between his legs and wet his body. He laced his arms behind his head and stood there, letting the water wet his fur and make the muscles underneath visible. Sonic licked his lips as he watched Silver get nice and wet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow, refusing to let the younger hedgehog win this, decided to show Sonic how strong he was. Sonic didn\u2019t want a wimp like Silver who cries when his tongue gets hurt; he wants a big, strong man! Shadow looked around for a moment until he spotted a bus similar to the one you were hiding in, but slightly bigger. Shadow picked it up and held it in both his gloved hands. After making sure Sonic was watching, Shadow started to bend the bus. Someone of his power could easily snap it in two, but he went slowly on purpose. The muscles in his arms flexed as he bent the bus, eventually snapping it in two. Shadow tossed the two pieces over his shoulder and scanned the ground for something else decimate. He was surprised to see a human man staring up at him. Apparently Sonic wasn\u2019t the only one he was putting on a show for. With a crack of his knuckles, Shadow reached down and snatched up the poor man. He stuck him in his navel (which was hard to see due to his black fur). Once he was nice and snug in his bellybutton, Shadow put his hands on his hips and flexed his stomach muscles. His tight six-pack (which was also covered by his fur) came into view as he flexed. The man inside his navel was compressed between the rock hard muscles until the pressure was too much and he popped like a grape. Shadow continued to flex his abs, grounding up the man\u2019s remains into pulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic watched both of the hedgehogs with lustful eyes. They were both so powerful and juicy looking. It was difficult for him to choose just one, but he had to. After watching the two for a bit longer, Sonic came to a decision\u2026</span></div></div>",

Told ya im the sexiest Shadow\" Silver snickered in Shadow's face and then ran over to embrace the blue hedgehog his in arms. Silver jumped on Sonic and with that the building was about to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Sonic you made the right choice!\" Silver said as he kissed Sonic on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i know that thing you did with the train was the sexiest thing i have ever seen! Those humans should be honored that they were crushed by your sexy Ass legs and beautiful Butt!\" Sonic replied Spanking Silver ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if you get me another train ill do it again!\" Silver said seductively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! i wanna try it!\" Sonic chuckled. Soon both were caught up in their own laughter until hey heard Shadow laughing from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheheh! Sonic you are such a fool!\" Shadow said evilly as he continued to laugh demonically. Silver grew scared but Sonic remained strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone sounds like a sore loser!.........so what are you gonna fight me now?\" Sonic asked the black hedgehog <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah i wouldn't want to waste my energy on a weakling like you anyway\" Shadow retorted cockily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah fuck you Shadow!!! dont be pissed because Silver has a better body than you!\" Sonic exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill admit the kids got back............but NO ONE WILL EVER BE MORE ULTIMATE THAN ME!\" Shadow roared at the top of his lungs putting his fists in the air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHAOS SHRINK!!!!!!!!!!\" Shadow roared with a demonic face of evil<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and Silver went wide eyed as they heard those words and soon found themselves shrinking and watched as Shadow grew bigger and bigger to them Soon they were back to their regular height of 3 feet tall and the boy they have tortured all this time now stood over then at 5 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 of them stared up at the giant Shadow afraid, Now Shadow was the only God!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid run along your free to go!\" Shadow commanded with that you instantly ran as far way as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,.....To take care of you squirts!\" Shadow cracked his knuckles and reached down and picked up the now tiny Sonic and Silver and squeezed them tightly in his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow! please! Stop! cant.....breath\" Sonic choked out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm lemme think............Nah....\" Shadow laughed as he squeezed harder he felt their little hedgehog bodies crumble. Now Sonic and Silver knew how the boy felt. Eventually Shadow had spared them and let them lay gasping for air on his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Sonic was plucked of the massive hand and was brought to Shadow's giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sonic you think that little fucker has a better body than me?\" Shadow bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic only reply was.....\"Please Shadow! Please dont kill me!!!!\" Sonic cried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then i know exactly what to do with you!!!' Shadow chuckled as he brought Sonic behind him and to his very muscular Ass cheeks. Shadow taunted Sonic until he forcefully push Sonic deep between his butt cheeks. With that Shadow clenched his Cheeks together squishing the blue hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what to do with little old Silver?\" Shadow bellowed]   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

SONIC!!!!\u201d Silver shouted at the top of his lungs as if his voice could someone stop Shadow from murdering the love of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late to start yelling now, bug. Your lover\u2019s already meat between my cheeks!\u201d Shadow smiled evilly as he grinded his butt cheeks together; the sound of Sonic\u2019s bones snapping and his body squishing brought tears the small hedgehog\u2019s eyes. The former blue hero was no longer recognizable between those muscular black cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sonic\u2026\u201d Silver choked out, sobbing pitifully in the larger hedgehog\u2019s fist. Shadow just looked at Silver amused and gave him a quick squeeze, making him yelp. Silver looked up into Shadow\u2019s crimson eyes through teary ones. \u201cSha\u2026dow\u2026why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Because you two insulted me, that\u2019s why! Anyone who thinks a bitch like you is sexier than me deserves a humiliating death! And now, I just have to dispose of the bitch!\u201d Shadow cackled and brought Silver closer to his face. The hedgehog grinned toothily, showing off the sharp fangs that had ended so many humans. Silver looked at his frightened reflection and started to shake. \u201cHmmm\u2026I wonder what hedgehog tastes like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No! Shadow, don\u2019t!\u201d Silver cried as the giant god slowly opened his maw, revealing the wet and damp cavern within. He held the former god between his fingers and slowly brought him closer to that cavern. Silver screamed and struggled helplessly, seeming to forget in his panic that he had psychic powers. With a deep chuckle Shadow flicked Silver into his mouth and snapped his jaws shut, sealing his fate. Silver continued to beg as Shadow tossed him around his mouth and sucked on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilver, Silver, Silver\u2026\u201d Shadow muttered as he shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re sounding just like one of those pathetic humans right now. How could a little bitch like you ever exist as an all-powerful god?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow\u2019s voice echoed in Silver\u2019s ears as he was sucked on like some piece of candy. So this was what all the human snacks he had consumed felt when they were eaten. He couldn\u2019t believe it\u2026after all the people he had killed to satisfy his hungry stomach, he was now going to become food himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Shadow! STOP! I don\u2019t want to become food!\u201d Silver yelled just as he was tossed onto the giant\u2019s back teeth. He shrieked as one of Shadow\u2019s sharp teeth nicked him, but that pain was nothing compared to what he felt when Shadow closed his jaw on the younger hedgehog\u2019s legs. A satisfying crunch came from Shadow\u2019s mouth and the giant, sexy god smiled while Silver howled in agony. Shadow painfully flipped him around his mouth as he continued to chew, mashing the once proud young god into paste. Silver\u2019s screams quickly became gasps\u2026then whimpers\u2026and then nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a few miles away, you were still running as fast as you could away from Shadow. You didn\u2019t dare look behind you, but you heard everything that happened. Sonic\u2019s succumbing to his rival\u2019s ass\u2026Silver being turned into chewy snack. You didn\u2019t feel pity for either of them; they were both monsters who treated humans like insects and killed countless innocents on their rampage. Shadow, however, had to be an even greater monster to have betrayed his friends without any hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to get out of the city\u2026\u201d you say to your self. \u201cThere\u2019s only one of them now\u2026but it only takes one foot to crush me! If only there was some way to stop him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Shadow, the giant ultimate being finished chewing Silver up before sending his remains down his throat. He licked his bloody lips, cackled cruelly, and then thrusts his arms into the air. \u201cI\u2019M THE ONLY GOD NOW! NO ONE IS A MATCH FOR ME! I AM SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG, THE PERFECT ULTIMATE LIFEFORM!!\u201d Shadow stood there for a moment, laughing insanely. He stopped after awhile to catch his breath before putting his hands on his hips and glancing around. \u201cNow\u2026what should I do first with MY planet? Maybe I should find a new city to play in? Or\u2026maybe I\u2019ll use Chaos Grow to make myself even more massive! Unlike those other two FALSE gods, I can use Chaos abilities without a Chaos Emerald!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Several moments passed and slowly but surely his body had begun to grow, The Giant hedgehog's Muscles pulsating with pure Energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes......YES! The power! THE ULTIMATE POWER!\" Yelled the black and red hedgehog with pure Craze as he was rising towering over what was left of the city. As you were still figuring out a way how to stop the Dark Giant, the street you were walking down quickly went dark and you stopped to turn around only to be met with you worst nightmare. You slowly gazed up at the growing hedgehog watching him laugh deeply and he was growing shockingly huge! Finally something Made you snap back into reality and you instantly began to run in the opposite direction as fast as your legs could carry you. As you ran the growing hedgehog's body was further demolishing the city, Buildings were coming down everywhere and you thought you had made it out until a building happen to fall right on top of you painfully ending you life underneath the rubble......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow watched as his surroundings shrunk, The city he once rampaged in was almost completely obliterated by his growing airshoes. Shadow on the other hand could only smile and admire how big he was growing he was only shocked that this second growth spurt he was growing much bigger than the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh looks like the effects of chaos are more efficient when channeled through this sexy ultimate lifeform rather than some stupid rock\"\" Shadow Scoffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Shadow's Growth had stopped, Shadow was now several miles tall, He now had to be the biggest lifeform on the entire planet! He was a Mega God! Shadow peered down and chuckled that the cities were so small he could destroy just one of them just in a single stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Now thats more like it!\" Shadow Bellowed while crouching down eying the surrounding cities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow look at all the cities! They look like toy models compared to me..........\" Shadow chuckled evilly but then he stood back up and raised an airshoe above the city in front of him Smiling devilishly like satan himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........But Now God says its time for all human civilization to DIE!!!!!\" Bellowed Shadow as he slammed in his massive airshoe down, completely destroying the poor defenseless city that once laid before him. The city had completely disappeared underneath the ultimate lifeforms sneaker but once he lifted it the city was now nothing but a deep crater in the shape of a foot print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muwhaha! What unbelievable power to destroy an entire city, just by stepping on it! I truly am a God!\" Shadow laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark hedgehog then raised his other foot and stomped the neighboring city and then took his other foot and stomped the city that was next to that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! i could do this all day\" Shadow bellowed as he stomped Two more cities and then halted. He grinned as he looked over his shoulder to see the destruction, 5........5 cities Gone in the matter of 5 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh i wonder how many humans i crushed\" Shadow cackled. He then noticed another city stationed right behind him and then there was and evil glint in his eye<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yawn* im getting kinda tired i should sit down and rest a bit!\" Shadow grinned evilly as he got down sitting down hard, his Ass annihilating the tiny city which made Shadow bellow in laughter. Shadow aslo couldn't pass up the opportunity to twist and swivel his Ass cheeks grinding up what he had already crushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muwhaha!!! that makes 6!\" Snickered the dark hedgehog as he continued to swivel he then noticed a fairly well grouped city right between his legs and he sat up foward to further inspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm i wonder what one of these buildings taste like...\" Shadow pondered as he placed his massive gloved fingers on the tallest building and plucked it up right out of the ground with ease. He then tossed it into his mouth and began to chew after several second he gulped down the buildings and was pretty well contented with it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Gulp* not bad! lemme get some more!' Shadow stated as he brought his face to doomed city and began to lick and slurp up buildings one by one. After what seemed like hours for the innocent littles of the city was only minutes for Shadow and he then chewed what he licked up and swallowed in all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah buildings are pretty good snacks! maybe its because of the fact that there humans in them as well hehehe\" Shadow chuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then began to feel aroused not only because he was a giant crushing and eaten cities but from the rush of dominance and pure power! so Shadow decided to give the Pathetic humans of the planet some of his Godly Seed! Shadow grabbed his now fully erect member and began to rub very aggressively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ung *Moan*....\" Shadow Moaned panting heavily from the immense pleasure. Shadow then got up and his knees and he was ready to climax, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ung.....almost....ugh.....there.....ugn ooh ahhh!!!' Shadow Moaned as he blew his load and unfortunately for the city below all of the Hedgehog Gods seed flooded it drowning everyone in the city and the male musk could be smelled for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow laughed out loudly bellowing all through out the land but then tiredness and fatigue grew upon the God sized Hedgehog and he couldn't stay awake any much longer and flopped forward landing on the cum drowned city and the massive hedgehog quickly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the colossal ultimate lifeform his snore could be heard for miles and miles and the display out Giant hedgehog put on had everyone on earth flee and panic that they knew there end was near...........And as for our main character who had unfortunately been sucked into this world through a simple Sonic the hedgehog game CD and had went through the ordeal of the \"Real\" Sonic the hedgehog and Co. doomed by the moment Sonic first saw you..............Rest his poor soul....................</span></div></div>",

Giving myself a rub down with a train and posing soaking wet wasn't enough? are you kidding me Sonic!?!?!......hello Sonic?\" Silver whined but Sonic didnt pay attention because of the fact he was engaged in a very aggressive makeout session with Shadow to the point where the building had collapsed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver turned away and just stood there depressed coldly staring at the ground tears beginning to fill his eyes until he saw a man waving his arms from the ground trying to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey big guy dont be sad. I think you were way sexier than that black hedgehog!\" The man shouted cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver didnt answer or thank the tiny human he just replied by lifting his boot over him and Stomping the poor man crushing him underneath his boot.

I definitely have a better body than Shadow Heck im more sexy than they back stabber Sonic!\" Silver lied to himself. The white giant stood their and watched all the \"littles\" run from him and laughed deeply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish humans! As your god i command you to STOP!\" Silver roared as his body glowed with psychic energy and everything that was moving around came to a complete halt.<br>\r\nSilver then laughed as he took this opportunity and began Stomping every human and car enjoying the crunching metal and crunching bones with every step. Soon the white hedgehog got on his knees and then was laying on his belly crushing more people and cars underneath his well toned and muscled frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver looked all around him and chuckled at the little vehicles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh look at all the little toys!!\" This reminded him of when he was a little boy and he would play with toy cars and crash them into each other but now he was a teen and a giant and was about to play with real cars!. Silver put his fingers on an 18 wheeler and with his other hand a bus and like a child playing with toys would slide them back and forth and to his liking people were trapped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver continued this for about 5 mins until adjusted his hand so that the 2 would crash into each other<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! dont crash into that truck!\" Silver chuckled as he brought the bus and truck together and when they collided the truck instantly blew up killing everyone on the bus and the truck driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on my toys broke already?\" Silver whined and he threw the remains away and grabbed some more \"toys\". This time he grabbed 2 tractor trailers and this time his teenage antics took over and his inner child faded. Silver brought one of the tractor trailers to his Ass and stuff it tightly between them and with that he turned over on his back and was preparing to some \"Pleasure\". The white hedgehog now with the tractor trailer in his Ass started to become \"Hard\" when his penis was fully erect he brought the second tractor trailer to his immense shaft and started to rub slowly. Silver moaned as the metal slid up and down his dick and began to increase his speed. As he did this he was crushing the truck more and more with each stroke. Silver then began panting as he increased his speed, about reach his climax the truck by now was completely pulverized by the giant's penis and slowly but surely Silver had climaxed shooting his hedgehog seed high into the air and all over him. The white hedgehog took in gasps for breath as he laid there with his dick out and covered in cum, He soon grew weary and soon fell off to sleep in the middle of the street with the truck still up his Ass. As he was now asleep he hadn't realized he had put on a show for the littles he hadn't crushed           </span></div></div>",

You felt uneasy as you noticed your started to grow too, probably because you were close enough to the hedgehogs to take in the effects. the hedgehogs were growing rapidly soon their were pressing up against the walls of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this is awesome its actually working! how tall do you think were gonna grow guys?\" Silver asked while pressing against the roof!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know but we should have at least stepped outside first!\" Sonic replied also pressing against the walls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so much for your house Sonic\" Shadow added in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the 3 had burst through the roof off Sonic's house and at about 100 feet due to the size of their feet Sonic's house was obliterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn i just finished paying off the mortgage for that house!\" Sonic chuckled with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic you dont pay for your mortgage! Those humans payed for everything! Remember?\" Shadow laughed as he continued to grow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Heh heh\" Sonic grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccessfully escaping from the trio you had been running for what seemed like 15 minutes you looked back were shocked at how tall they've grown to. At reaching now 400 feet the hedgehogs looked down on their surroundings with evil grins, at this rate the hedgehogs would be unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah look how small everything is! i cant wait to crush everything!\" Silver bellowed in laughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im with Silver! im gonna show these humans who the ultimate lifefo- ahem err i mean the ultimate lifeforms are!\" Shadow laughed and corrected<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes i wonder if our little favorite bug made it out alive!\" Sonic said as he stomped his foot at where his house supposedly was from his view all the houses looked like specs because now they stood at 800 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ! how much longer we gonna grow? At this rate we wont be able to tell what were crushing!\" Silver bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually had stopped running away as he could not believe how tall they were. They were so tall they could only see enormous feet and their legs only cause the rest of them disappeared in the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy! They must be...be at least 1000 feet tall!\" You cried in terror and you began to run again not looking back. Soon the hedgehogs had stopped growing and all they could see when they looked below were just clouds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and his friends finally stopped growing at precisely 1000 feet tall, they were huge! The 3 of them took the opportunity to breath in the fresh air and moaned pleasantly but not only for how fresh the air was but for the gusts of wind that blew through their ass cheeks and crotches it was heavenly. The white God then looked down at the clouds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey i cant see anything?\" Silver bellowed with an irritated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry silver their just clouds i have an idea\" Sonic said but before he could explain his idea. Sonic had noticed a black spec floating in front of his face. Soon the other two hedgehogs noticed it too. They watched it slowly move infront of Sonic's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell could that be?\" Shadow pondered. They all thought for a moment until Silver grinned after figuring out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys do you know what that is?\" Silver Exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" Sonic and Shadow said in unison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a commercial airline!' Silver shouted <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and Shadow were flabbergasted at the white hedgehogs discovery<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its so tiny!\" Sonic said squinting his eyes to get a better view of the aircraft<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do to it?\" Shadow said putting a hand on his hip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got an idea\" Sonic replied as he grinned and closed his eyes and he breathed in creating a strong suction and Shadow and Silver watched as they plane disappeared into Sonic's mouth. Sonic chuckled as he gulped but the plane was so small he didn't feel at thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh nice Sonic personally i would have clapped my hand on it but then again who can say they ate a commercial airline? in one gulp?\" Silver bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic the hedgehog that's who!\" Bellowed Shadow. They all laughed at the realization but then they looked down and were back at their original problem all they saw were clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys i got it! we'll just blow the clouds away!' Sonic bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think would actually work?\" Shadow replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C 'mon lets try it\" Silver added <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the hedgehogs crouched to get closer and with a countdown and reaching to 3 the hedgegods sucked in heavily and blew creating winds so strong the clouds instantly dissipated and they couldn't believe their eyes when they saw their surroundings. When they saw the city and how small it was they were shocked. The trio then stomped over to the city literally obliterating the suburban area with there colossal feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to be serious?\" Sonic asked jokingly while crouching down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what i think it is?\" Silver replied simply amazed in shock crouching next to Sonic <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep That would would be the city boys\" Shadow said crouching next to Silver<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city was like a tiny model to the hedgehogs. They were so big they could crush the entire city just by sitting on it. The trio taking there own spot by the city all of them got down on their tight belly completely crushing everything that was under them. The 3 of them stared down of the city while lying on their bellys like curious children with some toys. Everyone stared up at the Gods while most of them ran for their life. You had made the wrong choice by going to the city to try and have everyone evacuate you should have saved yourself while you had the chance    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stared up at the Gods and thought that finally you were about to meet your end. You take one last glance and run away with the others. Sonic like a curious child took and readied his pointer finger and slowly lowered it on the city while cackling evilly and his friends watching curiously. You watched as a massive shadow appeared around and look up and saw a massive white finger. All you did was scream as it was to big to dodge and with a devastating boom you were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio laughed as Sonic twisted his finger around were he placed it unknowingly crushing you in the process. He eventually lifted up and looked at the damage and saw that he had crushed over a 20 block radius! That is an amazing amount of damage by just using a finger imagine if he were to sit on it?<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"So how shall we end this city guys?\" Sonic bellowed looking up at his two companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know? how should we?\" Silver pondered with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets just stomp it flat! I mean just one of us could take out half the city just by stepping on it!\" Shadow bellowed and had noticed when he talked the winds from his breath had been so strong he had blown down some of the buildings in front of him which made the hedgehog laugh hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Im so powerful i can destroy buildings with my breath!\" Shadow laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the hedgehogs sat up butt crushing what they had already laid on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah that's to simple\" Silver said as he placed his finally placed his ass down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do then?\" Shadow pondered <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 Gods sat their staring at the city and tried to come up with a most destructive but also fun way of destroying the city. Finally Sonic had came up with the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha! I got it! lets just butt crush it! all 3 of us at the same time! Sonic shouted snapping his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna do that Silver?\" Shadow looked to Silver<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im game plus i love ass crushing stuff\" Silver said with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"alright let go\" Sonic ordered as the 3 hedgehog Gods got up off their butts and turned around and readied their butts over the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys on my mark we all fall down\" Sonic commanded as the two others prepared to squish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh crushing the the famous station square with my butt! How sexy!\" Silver laughed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright 1,......2,.......3 GO!!!!!!\" Sonic shouted and with that instant the 3 massive hedgehogs jumped up and within a second their muscular butt cheeks came down on the city with deafening boom! And created an earthquake that reached for miles and miles. Station squared had completely disappeared underneath the massive sexy butt cheeks of the hedgehogs and all they did was laugh and swivel their asses back forth grinding up what they had crushed. Station square was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! i can actually feel the buildings crumbling between my butt cheeks!\" Sonic laughed as he continued to swivel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Me too! We are truly ultimate lifeforms of this planet!\" Shadow bellowed as he swiveled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ultimate lifeforms Shadow? Were the ultimate Gods! of this planet! WERE UNSTOPPABLE!!!!\" Silver bellowed loudly as he swiveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehogs just sat there for what seemed for like 5 minutes and soon the 3 of them got up on their feet and inspected the city and they all laughed at the result. Station square was gone......all that was left were 3 craters shaped like ass cheeks and the Gods bellowed in laughter while picking out the crushed buildings stuck between their butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow the city is completely gone\" Sonic snikered evilly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! all thanks to our backsides\" Silver bellowed looking at Sonic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of bitch and cant get this last piece of building out of my ass!\" Shadow said ignoring the other two. Sonic and Silver laughed at Shadow's retort<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sonic c'mon lets go find another city to crush!' Silver said as he halted his laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan Silver\" Sonic replied<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFinally Shadow had managed to get the last piece of building out of his ass and smiled in triumph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah let us conquest on our path global domination! At our sizes no being on this pathetic planet can stop us!\" Shadow Stated raising his fist to the sky <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes the earth shall be under the theocracy of us massive hedgehog Gods!\" Silver stated after Shadow also raising his gloved fist to the sky<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men lets go show the world that us Gods have come to rule over the humans and creatures alike!\" Sonic said raising his fist <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the 3 hedgehogs roared and yelled up the sky in dominating positions and eventually trotted off shaking the earth as they tread trampling over a city that the 3 of them didn't even noticed. The earth from here forth was now doomed forever and would now be ruled under the power of the 3 sexy hedgehog Gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Gods reached metropolis and settled down 3 of them getting hot over each others bodies and began kissing each other passionately. The last thing the citizens of metropolis saw before they were destroyed were the 3 massive Gods making great sweaty love with each other and were eventually crushed beneath the copulating Gods. And that was the end of that city and more other to come..............         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You can clearly see his gigantic form, but he doesn\u2019t seem to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like the chairs were recently used\u2026I guess I just missed him.\u201d Tails pouted as he pushed the three chairs in and paced around the kitchen. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll make myself comfortable until he gets back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTails!! Help!\u201d you yell, but the giant fox boy doesn\u2019t seem to hear you. The three hedgehogs must have had to listen very closely just to make out what you were saying. In reality, your voice was barely a squeak to the normal ear. You watched Sonic\u2019s best friend open the fridge and take out a can of soda. He walked over to the table and sat down, placing the can right next the glass you were trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder where he went\u2026and by the look of the chairs, he had company.\u201d Tails says to himself as he glances around again, still oblivious to your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTails, please! I\u2019m right here, you have to help me!\u201d you bang on the side of the glass, but Tails still doesn\u2019t look your way. He picks the can of soda up again, which is orange flavored, and opens it. He takes a sip of the fizzy liquid and sighs with satisfaction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope Sonic wants to hang out today\u2026we haven\u2019t done so for almost a week! Eggman has been really busy lately.\u201d Tails says to himself again. This kid seemed to enjoy talking to himself. If only he would just LOOK AT THE GLASS!</span></div></div>",

You always had this interesting fascination with the character Chaco, as if you wondered what would happen if he were suddenly a giant. But for some reason, a bright light came out of your television screen and seemed to teleport you into the city of Two River! You could tell that you were in the Winger District of the City due to the entire district being built over the river. You look up to see that everything is fantastically larger than you could ever imagine, probably putting you at only a couple inches tall. Suddenly, you hear what sounds like thunder as a gigantic talon-like foot plants right in front of you, making you get stuck between the taloned toes as the giant winger continues to run. From the voices behind the Winger, it was clear that there were a couple angry Kobolds chasing after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taloned toes kept you in place for a good while as the Winger ducked into his secret shortcut, safe from the Kobolds' wrath. He then takes a seat and pulls out a few wallets, probably loaded with a lot of money. Now that you're not being flung every which way, you look up at your unaware abductor. It's Chaco! Whatever fate was at work here, you liked where this was going. You decide to shout up, \"Hey! Hey, down here!\" in hopes that your voice will carry to reach the giant winger kid's ears. He stops being dazed by the money before hiding it reflexively, effectively pinning you under his talon-like foot in the process before you shout again, \"Ouch! Hey! I'm under your foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaco, hearing this, looks under his foot to see you, a small two inch tall person. Curious, he picks you up in his hand, \"What're you doing under my foot?\" as he looks at you. You then tell him how you got lodged between his toes when he was running from those Kobolds. Chaco then grinned a grin that you didn't like very much, \"Oh, is that so? Well then. How about this. In return for my 'protection', you can serve me as my slave! It's a fair trade-off for such a tiny bug like you!\" You looked at Chaco. On the one hand, you've had fantasies about this sort of thing and you'd probably enjoy being Chaco's slave. However, you needed to get back home and you didn't know how to do that. What to do, what to do...</span></div></div>",

Looking around, you're only a couple of inches tall in comparison to everything else. You get up and, not looking where you're walking, you slam into the side of something and fall over. You notice that it's a gigantic boot! But the boot's connected to a leg, which is connected to a giant Viktor! However, unfortunately for you, he appeared to be pretty drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you weren't going to give up. Whatever possessed you to start doing this, you start climbing up Viktor's boot and you were about to climb up his pantleg when you heard, \"Well, ish best be time for me to shove off now. G'night ev'ryone!\" as he hiccups, his whole body spasming slightly from it and sending you down inside of his boot. You then notice that you've fallen into the side of his boot, right next to his gigantic foot. But now what do you do? It's too dangerous to stay still, but you have two options. The first is to try and climb out of the boot. You'd be safe from getting crushed, but you might fall off and land on the floor again only to be crushed by a random person. On the other hand, you could go to the toe area, where you could crawl in-between Viktor's toes and be safe that way, but it smells in the boot and that along with the motion of Viktor walking made you sick.</span></div></div>",

You then crawled along the long passageway that was his dick, until you finally reached the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second... \" Sora said, as he began to slowly slide his pants down to his ankles, \"Okay, now hold on tight!\" and then he carefully laid down on the beach. You held onto the tip of his dick as Sora laid down! His dick was now vertical into the air, and still fully erect. You wrapped your arms around the tip as best as you could, and you began to shift your weight, up and down. Almost like trying to climb a tree trunk, you shifted your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every movement you made Sora's dick seemed to pulsate, and Sora would either sigh or moan or smile. You began to get erect as well, and the motion of you going up and down on Sora's massive dick was also masturbating yours as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sora were simualtaneously in your glory, as the cum began to rise for both of you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... a single moment... barely a second of time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat moment exactly before the relief, the release... the moment when you're about to let it all go... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both had reached that moment at the same exact time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... you could feel it in Sora's dick as it pulsated, rose up... and you could feel it in yours, as it began to release, Sora could feel you as you slowed down just a tad... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then cum began to shoot out of your cock as you could feel Sora's cock pumping cum out of the top of it! You could feel it cover and encase your arms and your body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of excited groaning coming from you and Sora... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly slid down Sora's still erect cock... you landed somewhere in his pubic hair, and you just laid there with a grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Sora spoke, \"That felt SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW!!!!!! That was amazing!!!\" You replied!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora's stomach growled... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what...\" Sora spoke again, \"I'm still hungry! But, it would be so cool to have me feet rubbed some more... or we could even try some other things!\"</span></div></div>",

He wanted to see how far you're willing to take your foot fetishism. After all, he still had quite a lot of sock lint stuck in between his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, while you're down there could you see how my toejam tastes?\" Sora asked suggestively to you, though it sounded more like an order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his slightly increased demanding tone, you  still perk up and smile giddily almost instantly, \"I would be happy too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared directly at his left foot before you start climbing forward, up to the toe section of his left foot. It took a few seconds but you made it to the top, just in-between his first and second toe. You revel in the smell for a moment, letting your nose slowly take the scene in before you start to lap out the slimy sock lint out of Sora's toes. Judging from the taste of the toejam, it was clear that Sora wasn't lying when he said that he hasn't washed his feet for quite a while but you didn't mind it one bit. In fact, you were loving it even more, detecting hints of days-old sweat and unwashed salty loose bits of Sora's sock. Anticipating with excitement, you plunge your face in between his smell toes. Sora caught on your enthusiasm and pushed your face energetically and playfully into the heap of toe cheese, while you just continued to suck it all up in your mouth. As you were finishing your task on each of the four spaces in-between his toes, you occasionally took big whiifs of the sweaty boy feet, savouring in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels awesome dude!\" Sora said as he felt you lick up the last of his foot funk underneath his left foot. For the 15 year old teenage boy, it tickled a bit but the sensation felt more relaxing and comforting than he would rather admit. It also didn't bother you, somehow! Most people would outright refuse the idea of cleaning a foot, let alone with their tongue but the keyblade wielder fortunately found the perfect candidate: you. Once you finished cleaning out all parts of gunk that hid in-between all the toes, Sora picked you up and carefully placed you in-between the toes of his other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora sneakily grinned, and winked at you as he done so, \"The other one needs attention too,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dug in straight away, diving in between his first and second toe into the generous amount of toejam that had accumulated in his foot. You started licking as hard as you know you could've and in the same amount of time as it took you to clean out the left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora, it's so smelly in here\" you laughed, to which Sora responded by wiggling his toes, \"but the stench of this is so irresistible! I just can't get enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Sora smirked, \"I never expected you would like it <i>this much</i> little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being really small, a small bulge was forming in your pants and Sora noticed almost immediately. Sora chuckled a little when he felt a small extra bump rubbing against his pinky toe, trying to get the sweat and dry skin off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your little buddy decide to show yourself?\" he teased, \"C'mon, I'll help get even harder by...\"</span></div></div>",

There was something about the way he had said that, it seemed like he was quickly aclimating to the idea that you were lucky to be worshipping at his feet, this slight change in personality only served to deepen your feelings of submission for this young stud. You looked up at his handsome face and almost fell backwards, this was truly a humbling angle, Sora's plump masculine feet loomed to each of your sides, his thick legs seemed to strech for miles until they came to his bulging shorts, the sight of which made your mouth water a little. The swell in his pants was so prominent that it hid his abs from your view but still allowed you to see his defined pecs, which rose and fell hypnoticaly with his even breath, and finally his boyish mug which he rested comfortably on his well defined arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly His eyes flew open and looked into yours seriously, almost sternly \"What's the hold-up?\" something in his tone made you flinch, it wasnt agressive, more like impassive, dissapointed almost. You felt a small pang of guilt in your chest, shame even, and in a breath you were kneeling down on all fours, dragging your tounge all over the strong heel *lick* \"Sorry!  Sorry!  Thank you for letting me *slurp* clean your toes Sora! *kiss* You just look so big from down here, I got distracted...\" In a second Sora was all smiles again, a big dopey grin across His face, \"Awww.. its all right little dude, I get it, hey maybe later you can give my abs a polish of sumthin, but first\" He lowered his sole completely over you, pressing his toes against your lively slobbering face \" You gotta do a good job on my feet, I want them spotless little guy!\" With a smirk and a wink that you missed beneath the sweaty piles of foot flesh, Sora closed his eyes again and focussed on the feeling of your cool little tongue dragging itself all over his hot tired feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little to the right dude... yeeaaah, keep licking there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels great man, dont forget to show my heel some love tho\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there's some the gunk beneath the nails bro, slurp that up for me will ya\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steady stream of directions and encouragements from Sora sink you deeper and deeper into your obsession to the point where you can't formulate any coherent pattern of thought, the only things on your mind are Sora's godly bronzed feet and His casually commanding voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings continue on this track until finally Sora grows tired of this worship and flicks you away with His big toe. A bit disconcerted by the rough treatment and the serious look on His face, you pick yourself up on your knees and look up Him anxiously.  He brings each sole to His face to examine your work and make sure you didnt miss a single spot, seemingly satisfied He brings both feet back down on each side of you and once again a big winning smile appears on His face \"That was great lil'dude, you're an amazing foot-cleaner\" you blushed and looked away \"Thanks...\" He smirked, \"But I think we forgot about a little thing we had to take care of\" You looked down and suddenly were very aware of your aching erection which had been all but forgotten by both of you until this moment. Smirking all the while, He curled His toe and gave your tiny boner a gentle flic which made you see stars and look up at Him with a mixture of absolute reverence and devotion.  In your worshiping frenzy you hadn't even felt the brush of your arrousal against Sora's hot feet, but right now with a mere flick of His toe all of that pent up sensation was released and you came hard, looking up at a smirking face and a pair of amused, steely blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Let's go on over to my house and hop in the shower!\" Sora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked for a while, and then you came to his house. He ran up to his bedroom and placed you, and his shoes and socks on his bed. \"First I've got to take my clothes off...\" Sora said, as he began to pull off his shirt. You could see that while he wasn't super muscular, he still had slight abs... He then pulled down his pants and his boxers, and slid them off over his bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that Sora was actually horny! (And so were you in all honesty)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora picked you up, and walked you to his shower. He stepped in and turned the water on. The water (at first cold, then gradually getting warmer) fell over you like a waterfall, but it was bearable. Sora looked down at you, his spiky hair getting wet and starting to flatten, and he smiled. \"Are you ready little buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and then Sora clenched his hand around you in such a way that your face and stomach were facing outward, but you were still fully gripped by him. He then began washing himself using you as soap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he brought you to his face... He took you up to his cheeks, and rubbed your body over them... His skin was soft, and wet. (thanks to the shower water) He pressed you into one of his cheeks so hard you could even feel parts of his teeth and his jaw! He then, lowered you, rubbing you down from his chin, and down his neck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel his throat rubbing against you, and then he rubbed you across his shoulders and the back of his neck. All of this rubbing was making you extremely horny! (after all... your front side WAS being rubbed against his body!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then brought you back across his shoulders and began rubbing you along his chest. He rubbed you down his front and across his stomach. You could feel the ripples of his abs as he rubbed you across them. He rubbed you up and down his abs multiple times, with each rub making you more and more horny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, he brought you down even further!<br>\r\n_______________________________________<br>\r\nfor those of you who don't like \"private\" interaction, then just skip ahead to the section that starts with (=*=)<br>\r\nI thought I'd warn some people... haha<br>\r\n_______________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought you down to his dick! He scrubbed you along his wet pubic hairs, and then even along his dick, rubbing your face along his shaft, and back again. (He was horny as well... remember? =P )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he brought you around his waist and to his rear end. He rubbed you along each of his \"cheeks\" and even slightly into his crack. (Only slightly) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(=*=) Then he brought you down even MORE and began rubbing you against his leg. He brought you down to his calves, and rubbed you against his calf muscle, and then he brought you even further down to his ankles and then, last but certainly not least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought you down to his feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first rubbed you along the top of one of his feet, running you across his toes' tops. And then, he lifted a foot up, and began rubbing you along the bottom of his foot. His foot was similarly soft, but more slick as before with the addition of water from the shower. You could still smell a bit of his feet stench as he rubbed and rubbed... and then he switched and did the same with his other foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however, he was a bit more thorough. After he had used you to scrub the bottom of his foot, Sora noticed that he still had some sock lint stuck in between his toes! So, he took your body, and ran you in between each individual toe slowly so that he could get all the junk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Sora said, \"You actually get the job done pretty well! I should use you as soap more often!\" Sora laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed too, but it was hard to breathe with all the water, and now the smelly sock lint being rubbed into your face. But you enjoyed it so much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Sora brought you up from his body, and lifted you back up towards his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun!\" You shouted to him! \"Now what do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora thought for a moment, \"Well... \"</span></div></div>",

So you try to walk across his neck, but whenever he swallowed, his adam's apple would jerk and you would fall. Eventually with great difficulty, you reach the top of his chin. At the top, you notice his mouth is slightly open.. What do you do? </span></div></div>",

His throat muscles slowly squeezed and pushed you down deeper and deeper towards Sora's stomach. You could feel the temperature rising as you moved closer to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, you felt the squeezing stop at your feet, and then, the squeezing stopped at your waist, and then... you were only being squeezed at your head, as you reached the end of his esophogus.

But, seriously, find your way out of my stomach fast! I don't want you getting hurt!\" You could hear Sora's loud rumbling voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed at how awesome it felt to actually be swallowed!

Once  you're dissolved your water, then carbs, then proteins, then fats are broken down and pass into his small intestine. Here, gooey brown bile breaks up the fat from your remaining essence. These will be used in by brain cells to make him smarter and in his semen to make him horny.  The proteins you've so \"generously donated\" to your new friend will make him stronger and making his muscles bigger. And the few carbs taken from you will give him energy to burn off. The young scamp... like he needs extra energy. And the water, well, he'll be getting rid of that in the morning. Along with the rest of you... Let's not ignore the obvious: everybody poops, even cute guys you've been crushing on since forever.<br>\r\nAs the young boy snores (loudly for a kid) your remains ooze through his intestines and gurgle through his bowels, which absorb water from you. At first, you're a slimy slurry, but you begin to firm up into an embarrassingly familiar form. If someone were to put their hand on Sora's lower tummy as he slept, they would feel the peristalsis driving you further and further to the back door. If they laid their ear on his gut, they would hear bubbles and slorping of digestive gas and waste moving down the track. And if they hung around long enough, they would surely hear the pffft of an occasional fart adding to his evening symphony of body sounds and smell the sharp odor of meat doomed for the humiliation of digestion and subsequent transformation into shit.<br>\r\nAs dawn breaks on the beach where your temporary captor sleeps, you pass into his rectum coated with slimy mucous prepared to be an enjoyable morning dump for Sora. It is the pressure you create in his rectum that wakes him up.<br>\r\nStill disoriented from a long peaceful night's sleep instigated by the best orgasm he's ever had, he creeps inland and squats for what will surely be a healthy large dump.  Sora drops his trousers and steps out of them. He kicks his shoes and socks off as he points his member (throbbing with morning wood) at a tree trunk and lets loose a torrent of amber rain. Feeling extra pressure in his butt, he squeezes out a small fart. The smell wafts up to him and he laughs at the gross smell. All of a sudden, he remembers eating you, but not puking you out. \"That means I'll be seeing you in a couple of seconds, haha\" He assumes you swam into his intestines to escape digestion and now are ready to take the safe, albeit GROSS way out. \"You'll have to take a shower first thing. Then maybe we can get some breakfast and you can play with my feet or something. Ugh.\" Conversation over. His bowels need emptying. of you.<br>\r\nSora squats his bare ass down aiming between his bare feet. They also smell, but not nearly as bad as you. Anyway, he maintains this squat pose for a second feeling his insides do the shit shift. He feels this is going to be a massive dump that will feel really good. He's right. As far as bowel movements go, this one will be good, just like his amazingly good night's sleep, his amazing bedtime jack-off, and his amazing meal.Let's face it, the kid has lucked out. He prepares to push as he plans what to do today.<br>\r\nPutting on a pensive face, he furrows his brow, presses his lips into a tight smile, grasps his hands together, stretches his toes, and contracts his rectum.  His pink virgin pucker ornamented lightly with hair yawns open. His perineum bulges outward. His balls retract just a little bit. A very slight crackly hiss comes from his back end as friction drives the slimy you-turd out of his back side. The first portion is large and thick and dry, but covered in slime to ease your passage.  Sora bears down on your new form and you slide out a little further. \"Ungh. OOP. HIH!\" he groans with effort as the first turd of his massive bowel movement slips out a little more quickly. Now, small poop nodules fall to the sandy floor of his make-shift toilet with tiny \"plinks.\" He strains once more as his ass muscles push his crap out and the turd eases out more fluidly.  Now the tip of the brown log you've been turned into has hit the ground. Sora lifts up a little to let gravity continue to assist his ass. Now the shit is softer, and smoother- less shiny because it doesn't need as much rectal lube.  It is at this point that Sora really begins to enjoy this early morning dump. The huge turd starts piling up on the ground now as more and more of the brown log this preteen boy has turned you into fold out of his gaping butthole. More sick \"schlorp\"-ing and \"plbbbbbt\"-ing sounds emanate from his feces as they slowly and sensationally ease out of his now soiled pucker. Nearing the end, Sora clenches his butthole pinching off the turd letting it fall with a wet slap on the rest of the pile. Gearing up for one more push, he ejects one final turd with the propulsion of an explosive fart.. This one lands atop the small heap of shit with a sickening plop of finality.  <br>\r\nReaching over for some leaves, Sora turns around to look for you in his pile. As he turns he accidentally steps a little bit into his poop getting brown smudges on the toes of his right foot. YUCK! He reaches between his plump-yet-firm buttcheeks with an unlucky leaf and gets to business as he scans his shit.<br>\r\nSeveral turds lay before him lifting up odorous steam. Your unique new scent reminds him of the gardening aisle of a home improvement store- heavy, organic, and sharp.The poop ranges in color from dark brown (the first of the turd to emerge) to light brown to occasional splotches of brownish green. Huh! he wonders what makes some turds of the deuce he dropped green. Anyway, he continues looking for you, hoping you'll crawl out of the mess so he won't have to dig you out- eeeyuck!  Uh Oh, he can't find you! He kneels down and bends over his crap. \"Hey you in there?\" he yells. Not getting a response, he backtracks his physiology.  Pointing his cute mouth at his belly, \"You still in my gut?! knock on something if you can hear me.\"<br>\r\nTo a passerby, this would have been an odd scene to say the least- a gorgeous naked boy crouched over a pile of his fresh poop yelling at it and his stomach.<br>\r\nOh no, he thinks, this is gonna get dirty for me, too</span></div></div>",

You were about to yell for help when one of them spoke, \u201cIs that really you man\u201d? You recognised the voice, Jason one of your friends but how could it be? Trying to comprehend the situation you looked down at your hands, only to find them stained a beetle black colour. \u201cIts me Jason, and this Kyle, come on man you know us\u201d Jason pleaded with you. On closer inspection he was right, while lacking their usual complexion and hair colour these were indeed your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down slightly after the barrage of events you began to consider the situation. Somehow the three of you had not only been teleported to the world of Kingdom Hearts but also shrunken and seemingly as a side effected dyed. You looked up at the Behemoths that were Sora and Riku, at this size and with this colour you realised to them you looked just like bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do\u201d it was Kyle who spoke this time his voice quavering.

While the trip had only taken moments it felt to Jason like a lifetime. He felt relief for a split second when his body was freed from the oesophagus\u2019s embrace only to find a fresh hell. Slimy, humid and filled with half-digested mush, the organ treated Jason like any other piece of food. His body was hurled around by the churning and the acid already started to burn his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, none the wiser to the torment he was inflicting on the creature within him, Sora enjoyed himself with his friends. Switching from energetic tackles and leaps which served to throw Jason around even more to laying back and watching TV and letting Jason simmer. In another bout of energy, Sora had tackled Hayner and was trying to pin him to the ground. This was proving difficult as Hayner took Sora\u2019s challenge seriously, despite his obviously playful intent. Not helping the issue was Riku, who stood back and watched, while occasionally dropping a comment that antagonised one or the other to increase their efforts, entertaining him more. Meanwhile, in Sora\u2019s belly Jason had lost any sense of direction, he wasn\u2019t sure whether he had been tossed around too much or the acid had finally eaten away at his senses, unfortunately, it was the former. Feeling his guts rumble Sora grinned and flipped over shoving his rear end against Hayner\u2019s head. \u201cTime for my special move\u201d Sora giggled, pausing for effect \u201cWind Breaker Blast!\u201d. Sora blasted Hayner with a particularly loud and wet fart. With a massive push, Hayner threw Sora off him and rolled away gagging. Inside his unwitting killer, Jason felt the entire stomach shake at Sora\u2019s butt blast. He was sure the force of the gas had broken his already partially dissolved bones. He felt like crying, maimed by a fart while not even near it, at least not yet. Before he could dissolve though Jason had one more show to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan that one stank,\u201d Sora said while fanning his rear. \u201cYou think?\u201d Hayner snapped maintaining as much distance between himself and Sora as possible. \u201cMaybe that little bug disagreed with you\u201d Riku posed his somewhat sadistic smirk returning. \u201cmaybe, do ya think he wants to come out already?\u201d Sora wondered. \u201cNah, why would he, it\u2019s a rollercoaster ride, I bet he\u2019s having the time of his life on the Sora express,\u201d Riku said, his condescending tone completely lost on Sora. \u201cplease don\u2019t encourage hi\u201d but Hayner was cut off by Sora farting again. \u201cWell looks like somethings leaving anyway, back in a minute I gotta take a dump,\u201d Sora told his \u2018eager\u2019 audience. \u201cThanks for sharing,\u201d Hayner said in the most sarcastic tone he could muster, only for Sora to say \u201cYour welcome\u201d before dashing off to the restroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he hovered over the toilet he thought to himself you\u2019re lucky I got you before Hayner stomped you flat\u2019 and with that thought, he brought his butt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his backside ornamented with brown hairs touched down on the porcelain he felt a cold shiver up his back. \u201cAlright, come out\u201d Sora told himself, flexing his toes as he began to push. As Sora\u2019s muscles clenched to evacuate his bowels, Jason could feel the stomach contract and the boiling mass of acid around him start to lower. It wasn\u2019t long before he found what was left of himself facing a massive fleshy pink sphincter. In one swift motion, it yawned open and sucked in digested mush before closing again. Unable to move his broken body Jason was forced to watch the great pink hole open and close again and again, drawing closer every time. Jason couldn\u2019t help but imagine another sphincter belonging to the boy, one that was at that moment opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, Sora pushed, his pucker opening with a burst of smelly wind. Now the path cleared, a thick brown log began to ease its way out of Sora. Having completed the initial push Sora relaxed and allowed gravity to pull his turd out. With a goofy smile he leaned back stretching his arms, the sudden movement caused his anus to close dropping the poop with a satisfying plop into the water below. With that initial release, it was Jasons turn to enter Sora\u2019s lower levels. With a final yawn the sphincter before him opened, sucking him along with other digested mush into the first length of Sora\u2019s small intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more grunts and plops, Sora lifted himself off his throne with a relieved sigh. Without looking he grabbed a handful of toilet paper, leaving a barren role and wiped half-heartedly, his efforts leaving a noticeable residue on some of the brown hairs close to his butt hole. He would end up scratching himself later and telling his friends about the itch, only to receive exasperated looks from Riku and Hayner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up his pants Sora looked into the bowl as if expect something, but found only the usual logs. Feeling the emptiness in his belly he put two and two together and smiled. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see ya tomorrow buddy, sorry about the smell but I can\u2019t help it\u201d and with that Sora exited the bathroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At that moment the sound of a toilet flushing rang out, loud as thunder and with that you and Kyle take off in different directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the entertainment room, Hayner sat with his brow furrowed as he stared intently at the cards in his hands. Across the table Riku just smirked, allowing a card to drop from his hand in clear view of Hayner. \u201cOops\u201d smiled Riku as he picked the winning card back up. \u201cI will beat you,\u201d Hayner said with a determination suggesting a life or death battle rather than a simple card game. \u201cSure you can,\u201d Riku told his opponent, enjoying his mental domination far more than he probably should of. Their game of strategy and finesse was interrupted when Sora walked into the room refreshed from his latest dump. \u201cMan my butts itchy,\u201d he said offhandedly scratching his rear. \u201cMaybe if you wiped properly\u201d Riku suggested as Hayner made a rather convincing gagging face. \u201cI wipe fine,\u201d Sora said waving away the comment with one hand as he scratched his ass with the other. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he said realisation striking him \u201cMaybe that little bug can help next time, you know since he\u2019s coming out that way\u201d Sora grinned, obviously proud of the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayner was about to tell Sora that disgusting little thing wouldn\u2019t be in any condition to help him when Riku silenced him with a look that said: \u201cdon\u2019t ruin my fun\u201d. \u201cYeah I bet after the ride you gave him, he\u2019d do anything for you even wipe your nasty ass,\u201d Riku said sarcastically. Missing the sarcasm, Sora retorted \u201cmy ass isn\u2019t nasty and besides if he has fun coming out, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t mind staying for a bit\u201d confident in his logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this discussion was going on, a single black spot could be seen on the carpet.

He had crept around hoping to find Jason, maybe playing with giant boys turning their terrifying experience into a brilliant one. But now Kyle knew where Jason was, as the three giants played unaware of their sadism Jason slid further and further into the depths of Sora. Kyle\u2019s tears had begun to make a sizeable, at least, to him puddle on the ground but he made no effort to move. Try as he might Kyle couldn\u2019t help but imagine his friends torment, the sound of peristalsis inaudible outside except for a low grumble would be deafening, each contraction pulling him deeper, extracting his essence and turning him brown. Finally he would be packed into a log with all the rest of Sora\u2019s food, indistinguishable apart from a few bones. That would be it, a boy with all his life ahead of him reduced to a lump of waste, the only confirmation of his existence a wrinkled nose and a giggle at the sound he made impacting the toilet water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile time stopped for Kyle, the giants continued to go about their business. Eventually, Sora was sent to grab some drinks, although the trouble he was having with this simple task made it seem more like an epic quest. Now that the spiky haired boy was out of earshot Hayner turned to Riku and spoke: \u201cWhy do you keep egging him on?\u201d. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fun\u201d came Riku\u2019s predictable answer \u201canyway the only reason your not on board is because messing with bugs grosses you out\u201d. \u201cWell they are dirty and you shouldn\u2019t be roping that idiot into it\u201d Hayner nodded in the direction Sora had set out. \u201cWell I think everything that comes of Sora is pretty dirty and you only have a problem because your sensitive\u201d Riku twisted the knife verbally with a knowing smirk. Hayner scowled as Riku pushed his buttons, adding \u201cIts okay you know, <br>\r\neverybody poops\u201d. Before Hayner could lunge at his manipulative friend Riku\u2019s eyes widened in surprise before narrowing. \u201cSpeaking of Bugs\u201d Riku pointed, expertly diverting Hayner\u2019s attention to the small black object on the carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment time started again for Kyle and he looked up at two gargantuan boys, both staring intently at him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a moment Riku considered using this bug in some sort of scheme, however, his plotting was interrupted by Hayner who leapt to his feet intent on crushing the disgusting bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the distance between Kyle and his attacker seemed vast, the giant cleared it in just a few steps. Despite the how dire the situation was, Kyle couldn\u2019t help but be amazed seeing the massive form above him. Legs and feet were now inspiring and terrifying structures, the change in perspective was even now still difficult to process. But luckily for Kyle instinct kicked in and he bolted forward, his new form granted him increased speed which allowed him to slip between Hayner\u2019s legs. The downside of this was that his scuttling, the beetle black form could not be anything but a bug to the giants. Kyle thought to himself if I can just make it past the table out the door then \u201cSLAM!\u201d. Kyle\u2019s vision was obscured by a massive object blocking his path. It took him a second to realise, that it was Riku\u2019s shoe. At his position, he couldn\u2019t see Riku smirk as he blocked off the exit. \u201cHere I trapped him, even you should be able to hit this one\u201d Riku called across the room.

Time seemed to stretch in his last moments, allowing him to absorb the situation. He couldn\u2019t say he thought his death would mean something to these characters, who had saved countless worlds and battled monsters. But to be nothing more than an annoyance, a stain on the ground, surely he deserved better than that? \u201cAt least\u201d he consoled himself \u201cI got it better than Jason\u201d. He imagined Sora squatting, his goofy face straining as he pushed out length after length of waste.

It was at that moment that Sora walked back in, clutching a can of soda his quest complete. \u201cWhat happened why I was gone,\u201d he asked as Hayner continued to dab his shoe with tissue paper. A sudden smile crossed Riku\u2019s face \u201cOh we found another bug who wants to have a good time, but he\u2019s stuck to Hayner\u2019s shoe\u201d. Hayner\u2019s face glowed red with anger as Riku spoke while Sora merely stood and listened with a goofy grin. \u201cSo you have to lick\u2026\u201d Riku was interrupted by Hayner tackling him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe echo of that tackle resounded throughout the house, alerting you to the giant\u2019s whereabouts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You curl up in a corner, your mind filled with hideous visions of what could have happened to your friends.

But every time you pluck up the courage a raucous laugh or a hearty belch freezes you in place and you're beset by more horrific visions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku yawned loudly as he surveyed his work. Both Hayner and Sora were passed out on the couch and floor respectively. He smiled, congratulating himself for so expertly pitting them against each other till they dropped from exhaustion, now the main bed was all his. He noticed one of Hayners legs was draped over the side of the couch, a tiny splotch of red still on his shoe. Riku was surprised he missed that and made a mental note to bother him about it tomorrow. For a minute he considered the creature\u2019s fate, he would have felt bad for anyone being trodden on by Hayner, but it was just a dirty little bug after all. His thoughts were interrupted by a deep gurgling from the boy spread out comically on the floor. If he was going to feel bad about anything it would be that, he\u2019d take Hayner\u2019s foot over Sora\u2019s gut any day. But the enjoyment he got out Sora\u2019s lack of knowledge outweighed any sympathy he could have for a bug. Unlike Sora, Riku had a basic understanding of anatomy, so by his estimate, the bug Sora swallowed should be nearing the end of the small intestine. Drained of any nutrients what was left would be pushed into the colon and formed into a thick brown log, ready to be evacuated from Sora\u2019s rectum the next day. Riku\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by a long low hiss, followed by a juicy pop. Almost on cue Sora had farted in his sleep, his face melted into a satisfied grin. Riku took that as his cue to exit before the smell of the quiet, at least by Sora\u2019s standard, fart caught up with him. As he left the room he swore he could hear Hayner mumbling angrily in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the hallway to the bedroom lit only moonlight Riku stared at the floor.

Suddenly he experienced a flash of inspiration and began to snicker. It was a mean plan, a gross plan that he normally wouldn\u2019t consider putting something through.

Finally, you lay down in exhaustion trying to ignore the immense pain in your back, as though something massive was grasping you. You felt the ground thunder with earthquakes, the tremors making you cringe. After what seemed like an eternity, you felt relief, the pain was gone and you were flying through the sky. Your heart soared for a moment before you saw the shimmering reflection of water below you. \u201cThe ocean?\u201d you thought yourself as you plunged down \u201cno it's too clear and calm, its\u201d. You were brought back to reality when you hit the water. You quickly pulled yourself to the surface, but to your surprise it was easy. There were no currents or waves, just a flat plane of water and, you shivered at the sight of massive white walls surrounding you. That shine was it marble? No, it was more like porcelain. Your sense of dread growing you looked up to see the giant Riku standing above you, his lower half just obscured by the white walls.

Riku considered the tiny struggling creature, desperately splashing in the toilet water, he was about to make its life considerably worse, but considering what the morning would bring, this was the least of its concern. Normally he would have someone else torment the creature and watch his handiwork from the sidelines, but it was late he was tired and his bladder was full, besides it wasn\u2019t like the bug could argue. Riku shivered slightly in the cold night air and with a soft sigh released a stream piss into the toilet. As Riku\u2019s pee stream descended it felt like time froze, you could only compare the urine bursting from Riku\u2019s dick to a geyser or waterfall. You were lucky the initial stream didn\u2019t hit you head on, you might have been forced under by the pressure of his pee and drowned, was Riku taking pity on you? The impact of urine on water felt like a meteor strike, as you were swept up by waves of now contaminated water. You tried to keep your mouth shut, but inevitably you felt the acrid and acidic fluid sting your eyes and nose. You tried to cough which only caused you to inhale more of Riku\u2019s recycled fluid. The silver-haired youth swayed ever so slightly as he relieved himself, causing his stream cut great swathes through the toilet water. Finally, the stream died down and you were able to surface safely. You took a great lungful of air, only to have your eyes water at the smell of this much piss this close. You opened your mouth to scream or puke, you weren\u2019t not sure which only to have a golden drop splash directly in your mouth. You spluttered more as Riku shakes out the last few drops with a satisfied sigh.

It was with this thought that what was left of your rational mind figured what was going to happen. Between Sora\u2019s cheeks, his windy valley was clearly visible, ornamented with tufts of brown hair, some of which still bore stains as testaments to his previous craps. Nestled in the centre, clearly visible from your position was a tight ring of wrinkly muscle, \u201cI\u2019m looking at Sora\u2019s anus\u201d you had to say it to yourself to confirm the situation was even real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove his victim, Sora rubbed the sleep from his eye\u2019s and shuffled around on the seat to get comfortable. It had been a good night and he planned to start another good day with a nice relaxing dump. There was something immensely satisfying about taking a dump to Sora, maybe it was the release of unnecessary weight, the cool touch of porcelain or the childish snickers he got with each poot and plop. With a relaxed face, Sora arched himself ever so slightly not actively pushing but merely telling his body it was time. Now given the okay by the rest of his body, Sora\u2019s large intestine began squeezing what was left of his meals further down filling his rectum with brown sludge. His body had done a good job on the mass, it was impossible to determine what he had consumed, the only distinguishing features were a few bits of difficult to digest material. It wasn\u2019t all solid, however, a fair amount of gas was also present and was moving towards his anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched with a combination of fascination and terror as Sora\u2019s Anus yawned open and pushed out with a deafening fart. The sound of a boys flatulence echoed off the porcelain walls and was almost deafening, but even worse was the smell. You could feel the heat as Sora ripped and swore you were actually pushed back by the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of this foul smelling gas was Jason, his body and soul transformed into a smelly wind used to unknowingly punish his friend. A stinky fart was Jason\u2019s last breath, a final cry before his rebirth from a kid\u2019s rear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sad fact was that in order to torment you, Sora would have to be aware of your existence, in fact, the ring of muscle was just doing the job its owner so frequently required. Having turned the toilet bowl into a gas chamber and relieved a little pressure, Sora was able to really relax and enjoy himself. You had no choice but stew in a combination of Riku\u2019s piss and Sora\u2019s gas as the boy above you relaxed, in no hurry to finish up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, gravity took its toll as the mass of crap in Sora\u2019s Rectum slid down, applying pressure to his anus begging for release. Somewhat annoyed he had to put the effort in, Sora relented and began to squeeze, giving his ass the okay. From your position, you could actually hear Sora\u2019s muscles contract and see the slight shift of his ass cheeks if that wasn\u2019t enough he gave an almost cartoonish grunt as he pushed. Sora\u2019s pucker began to stretch open revealing a thick brown log speckled with what seemed to be white chunks. Disgusted and horrified but unable to look away you focus in on a particularly large white object, standing out against the uniform shit brown. Your blood froze as you recognised it as a skeletal hand reaching out from the turd in a manner similar to that of a zombie clawing out of its grave. You would have been more shocked, but by now you were emotionally broken, you had accepted your friends were probably dead and one having endured Sora\u2019s gullet seemed natural at this point. You almost felt comforted, while he may be nothing but bones entombed in a stinking turd at least Jason was finally free of Sora, well almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another push the seemingly titanic turd slid further almost touching the water. The brown mass was now at eye level with you and you could identify several more bones speckled throughout it. With a sharp exhalation, Sora clenched his ass, pinching off the mammoth log and letting drop into the bowl below. You could feel the tremors as the piece of crap plopped into the water, barely missing you.

The madness of the last day along with your deteriorating mental state had left you unaware of how hungry you were. You felt a fullness in your stomach that as much as you hated to admit it wasn\u2019t unwelcome, the taste of post processed food was another matter.  Stuck in a faecal cocoon of hair and crap you couldn\u2019t reach your face to wipe off the smears of shit and despite spitting and swallowing as much as you could the utterly putrid taste remained strong.

However as you expected by this point, the relief was only temporary. From above previously the relaxed giant suddenly bent forward and grabbed his gut, as a loud \u201cGlorp!\u201d echoed audibly from his lower intestine. It seemed Jason was taking the only vengeance he could, being a literal pain the ass. In reality, it was just as likely Sora\u2019s less than healthy diet over the past few days had given him digestive trouble, however, the idea he\u2019d given his killer at least some discomfort might have given Jason\u2019s ghost some closure.

Chunks splashed into the water creating waves rocking the island of a turd you rested on as the soft stinking crap engulfed you sealing your body in a slimy tomb. Outside you could still dimly hear Hayner making a gagging sound as he heard the machine gun sound of plops and Sora\u2019s excessively happy sigh.

The gas was also a problem, you had been intimate with more than enough of Sora\u2019s rectal rips already but what you weren\u2019t prepared for was the constant release. For every fart Sora proudly identified, there were ten more, inaudible to even their creator. The wrinkled little hole would ease open letting puffs of gas, like a loose valve keeping you bathed in a constant fog of recycled air. You were sure constantly inhaling the heroic young adventurers butt fumes was giving you some kind of horrible high and keeping you in a constant state of delirium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should go out,\u201d Sora said from his laid-back position on the couch. Hayner's eyes narrowed and a vein in his forehead twitched as he replied \u201cfive minutes ago you said you were too tired to do anything\u201d. \u201cBut now the trash has been taken out\u201d Riku pointed out to the frustrated Hayner. \u201cCome on its getting boring,\u201d Sora said flashing a brief apologetic smile which quickly turned into a devious grin. In a single movement, Sora rolled back his legs in the air and his rear pointed at Hayner, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get out there\u2019s a gas leak\u201d he yelled dramatically pleased with his immature joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself tumbling as Sora twisted his body forcing you to hit several hairs slicked with sweat and other slimy material you could only assume had left Sora\u2019s insides recently. Half dried crap was the least of your concerns as your tumbling landed you face first against the furnace of wrinkly skin that was Sora\u2019s mighty anus.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt a cold chill of fear every time the rhythmic movement caused Sora\u2019s anus to twitch, not just because you were afraid of what was going to emerge that a tiny sick part of you was hoping for it. With the amount of gas you\u2019d unwillingly huffed you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019d suffered a bit of brain damage or maybe your brain had switched into survival mode forgetting any human pride. Whatever the case you were exhausted from being flung around with each of the giants movements and desperately hungry. Sadly the only food you had access too was second hand in the most literal sense and what little sustenance you had gained from the digested remains of Jason Sora had so graciously given you was already used up. Any turds you crapped out now would be insignificant to the mere specks of shit littering Sora\u2019s rear, if he didn\u2019t notice them what hope did you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartway to your destination your ride stopped and you heard Hayner mutter something quietly. From Sora\u2019s mischievous comments you quickly figured out what was going on. Hayner had stopped to relieve himself by few bushes and Sora was determined to be too close for the other boys comfort. From your crap encrusted residence, you could hear the zip and brief pause which so often preceded the act of urination. The sound should have made you deathly afraid since your last experience was Riku nearly drowning you in waste water, but your desperate fried brain instead signalled thirst. While you were able to gain enough substance from the muck around you, your body ached for water, particularly after being blow-dried with Sora\u2019s morning rip. It wasn\u2019t like Hayner was a bad guy, hell he was one of the good guys, he didn\u2019t even accidently eat your friend or fart on you. Would it be so bad to drink Hayner\u2019s pee you thought your eyes glazed as the last of your mind began to leave. \u201cI\u2019m so thirsty, please pee on me Hayner, Riku, Sora, I\u2019m a big fan and I just need a little\u201d you begged, the only reply to which was Sora\u2019s anus pushing out a silent puff of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside away from your suffering Hayner was chastising Sora, warning him to watch where his eyes were looking while Riku stood back holding up a phone and trying to get both his friends into a blackmail-worthy picture.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The haze of sweat and bodily gas didn\u2019t help either, you were seeing mirages in the forest of shit stained hair that was now your home. Your residence between the pale moon mountains just south of the pink geyser which periodically expelled its noxious steam. Connected to a foul set of caverns that went deep into the fleshy mountains, each time the geyser let fly its fumes you were excited. For small packages of preprocessed food were launched out with each burst and you were grateful for these gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, it had been less than an hour since Sora, Hayner and Riku had set off for the park. Hayner was grumbling as he walked, while somewhat embarrassed at Sora\u2019s inspection of his anatomy as he relieved himself he was more focused on how he would get back at the other boy. Sora, on the other hand, had already forgotten their \u201cgrudge\u201d and was strutting happily just enjoying the morning breeze. Riku had his phone out and was carefully saving away the picture of Sora peeking at Riku under his somewhat disturbingly full blackmail folder. He wasn\u2019t quite sure whether to file it under \u201cexposure\u201d, \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cpissing\u201d, whichever it was he had something to use on Hayner. Riku had considered deleting some of his Sora pictures as they were so easy to get, the kid really didn\u2019t have any shame. Even a photo of the brown haired boy naked and passed out on the toilet with unflattering images crudely drawn on his face had failed to elicit a satisfactory response, still he had to keep the photo, purely for posterity of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an excited leap unbefitting the rather unexciting situation Sora said \u201chere we are\u201d before rushing to the admittedly rather nice park. Some bare hills to run down and set up stunts, woodland to lose yourself in and occasionally find suspect packages, an old playground whose disrepair and age restriction Sora gave no notice and a ramshackle set of toilets for when those playing in the remote park who weren\u2019t willing to take the chance to relieve themselves in nature, it had seen little use over the years.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Giggling furiously with his pants around his ankles, Sora was caught off guard and immediately toppled over onto the grass, his body splayed out in an embarrassingly risqu\u00e9 position. Deaf to Riku\u2019s exclamation of glee and Sora\u2019s stammering Hayner leapt onto Sora and began striking him. Riku could hardly contain his laughter as he snapped picture after picture of Hayner Straddling Sora\u2019s half naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hayner leapt into action his gut shook with each movement. The process of digestion was put on hold as Hayner was fighting leaving you to be tossed around in the humid pink sack along with what little food and digestive juice was present. While Hayner wasn\u2019t as abusive to his gut as Sora was, the boy clearly didn\u2019t eat enough. While Sora\u2019s digestive tract was constantly churning to compensate for its owners diet, anything unlucky enough to end up in the depths of Hayner was due a long stay. For you that meant breathing in the thick smelly air destined to be expelled as gas from one end or another, feel the burning slime filled with half-digested mush trying to churn your mutated form like any other piece of food and listened to occasional muffled sounds of Boys just living their lives which would inevitably be drowned out by roaring gurgles and slurps. As your prison swayed you could occasionally catch a glimpse of the sphincter far above you, a twitching flower of flesh which acted as a portal to hell. Unknown to your addled mind, somewhere below the sloppy soup of acid and juices was another greedy portal, waiting to yawn open and drag you to an even lower level of hell.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a while the shaking stopped suggesting that at some point Hayner had given up on pounding Sora to a pulp for being so disgusting or noticed Riku was collecting more evidence. This seemed to be a blessing until you realised that Hayner abandoning his fight or flight stance allowed digestion to continue at full force. Even though the stomach was mainly empty the body continued to do as it was told, mercilessly churning and grinding while secreting yellowing mucous and acid. You should have died a hundred times over, but whatever magic or act of god had turned you into a tiny bug man seemed to have made you extremely resilient. A day ago this would have sounded brilliant, but now you longed to be dissolved by the painful juices. Sure being churned into waste to be squeezed out by a moody kid was disgusting and demeaning but at least you wouldn\u2019t be alive to think about it. As you continued to reflect on your horrific situation there was a loud grumble from deep below. The Wrinkled pink mass that served as doorway to Hayner\u2019s lower levels yawned wide greedily drinking in the stomachs contents. Desperate to escape you swam with all your strength against the current of the raging whirlpool of digested material. The action almost looked lazy as if the sphincter was casually yawning, but the force was incredible. Fighting with all your might you finally got your second wind, if you didn\u2019t count what Sora had so graciously blown over you. As the last remnants of fowl slurry were sucked away, you found yourself settling just shy of the sphincter. Your muscles aching you collapsed to your knees almost crying with joy. For the first time in what felt like years you had some semblance of cognizance back and you\u2019d been able to avoid something. Unfortunately being able to comprehend your \u2018victory\u2019 also left you able to comprehend the other horrors surrounding you. There was a sudden \u201cglorp\u201d followed by a whirlwind of dank air hurtling towards the sphincter high above you. Once again you were ready to celebrate, sure riding a burp wasn\u2019t exactly pleasnt but compared to everything else you\u2019d been through it was a vacation. However as your body was hit with gale force winds you tumbled back into the iron grip of the lower sphincter. Sensing your tiny movement the pink ring constricted around your leg holding you in place as the whirlwind passed with a relatively mundane belch echoing from outside Hayenr\u2019s gut. Before you could scream in frustration you felt the mass of muscle being to pull you down.</span></div></div>",

There is no escape, no good luck, you were going to be pulled down into Hayner\u2019s intestines and take the grand tour one way or another. Every organ in the teen\u2019s digestive tract was a megabeast compared to your insectoid form. you were fated to squeezed kicking and screaming into the depths of one only for it crap you into the mouth of the other, all without the slightest notice from the godlike entity they themselves inhabited and served. The stomach now finished with you had positioned you over the maw of the small intestine and the smallest amount of pressure was all it took to rouse the beast. Merely placing an appendage on the wrinkly mass of muscle caused a domino effect as the sphincter yawned wide, some of the remaining bile and juice trickling down into the depths. Desperate you latched onto the edge of the pink hole, frantically clutching at a gargantuan wrinkle. With the properties of your strange mutated form you were able to cling to a wall like an ant. The portal down twitched, bulging wider and you found yourself dangling as slime flowed over your hand loosening your grip. The stench emanating from the depths was even worse than the dank confines of the stomach and you knew that somehow even fouler things lurked deeper within. Finally your grip slackened and with a wet slap you let go, tumbling down into the sphincters centre. It happily accepted you, contracting once again and blocking your view of the stomach above. Outside a tiny insignificant and almost inaudible gurgle sounded from Hayner\u2019s lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe embrace of the lower intestinal sphincter was even tighter than the throat and the heat radiating off the muscle was almost scalding. The muscles squeezed you through your next hell gate painfully slowly until you felt your feet emerge into the duodenum\u2019s juices. You would scream if your face wasn\u2019t trapped in a sphincter as the intestine seemed to be even more hostile than the stomach and worse still you were forced into it inch by inch allowing ever part of your body to experience the hell. Finally with a sloppy pop, you were ejected properly into the first segment of Hayner\u2019s lower intestine. You\u2019re completely submerged in a foul slurry and surrounding you is what seemed like an endless spread of hungry tendrils, greedily slurping up anything of value. You can only hope you\u2019re as worthless to Hayner\u2019s body as you feel right now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least your energy would contribute to his wellbeing, although it was more than likely that the poultry amount you gave him would be burned off in single roll of the eyes or annoyed huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hundreds of villi and the microvilli which covered them sucked your essence away you finally took the time to consider your new body. It felt like you\u2019d spent centuries in this new form when in reality it had only been a few days at most. Aside from the size difference, the most obvious change was the silky black carapace which had stretched over your body and the bodies of your fallen friends. You were sure your internal body chemistry must have changed too since you had inhaled enough rectal fumes to overdose a hundred times, and even now as your shrivelled from was harvested you felt no closer to death. It was painful, disgusting and horrible in every conceivable way of course, were it not you might be grateful for the longevity some cruel deity had chosen to bestow on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deafening bubbly gurgle peristalsis pushed you further along the small intestine. While the stomach was also constantly churning loudly you could pick up some scraps of sound from the world outside Hayner, but deep in the boys personal catacombs the only sound was that of Hayner\u2019s innards busily working away. You had thought you might get used to the slime enveloping you after a while but as you were squeezed along the consistency and content of the intestinal slurry changed, forming a consistently disgusting coved. As thick sickly yellow blobs of what you assumed were bile slid across your body you could only wait for the next step. Never in your wildest dreams had the idea of being shit out by a moody teen been so attractive, but you had to wait for that privilege. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he tried something he wasn\u2019t good at he ended up making a mess Hayner had to clean up. This time Sora was trying his hand a being a chef, a practise which could only have disastrous results. The tabletop he was working on was covered in plates and utensils some of which clearly hadn\u2019t been washed properly and a number of mismatch ingredients in varying states of freshness. \u201cYou know you\u2019re going to poison everyone\u201d Hayner spoke bluntly as Sora dropped a hunk of badly sliced meat into a massive bowl. \u201cJust you wait, I\u2019m a food artist and the tummy is my canvas\u201d Sora articulated with a dramatic flourish and a goofy grin. Hayner rolled his eyes before muttering \u201cif by that you mean adding more crap to the crap factory\u201d. Hayner immediately regretted his comment as Sora began to snicker juvenilely. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to worry\u201d Riku\u2019s voice sounded almost making Sora jump. Riku had a habit of appearing quietly and suddenly, a skill which was very beneficial to his various schemes. \u201cLast time he made his speciality he was backed up for weeks\u201d Riku said point at Sora who didn\u2019t show the slightest sign of embarrassment. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we have to worry\u201d Hayner asked his silver haired friend exasperatedly. \u201cWell I assumed you wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to eat it\u201d Riku said with a shrug. Before Hayner could start arguing Sora piped up \u201cThis one\u2019ll be fine, come on give it a go\u201d giving the most heartbreaking pouty face he could managed. Staring expressionlessly Hayner simply said \u201cnot a chance\u201d.

The long low groan of peristalsis constantly echoed like garbled whale song being blasted through a megaphone.

Looking up Hayner scowled as he saw Sora already wolfing down his own portion his throat bulging out as lump after lump dropped into his belly. Cursing his weakness Hayner through caution to the wind and grabbed the eating untensil Sora had provided, which happened to be closer to a ladle than a spoon.

For some reason you felt different and this feeling accelerated as you felt a strange sudden series of rhythmic ground shakes. The ground vibrated more as the sound of something big collided with the ground. You were shocked as the booms stopped and a loud voice suddenly came from above as the area darkened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well what do we have here~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around you gasped at the sight before you. A giant pair of brown shoes with metal tips rested in front on you. Connected to the shoes were two long and tall black clothed legs leading up to a giant currently bending over. The giant had on a fine suit and a fedora over his bright green hair, his face had a smile like that of a snake as his yellow eyes looked to have cruel glee inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green giant suddenly squatted down and put his chin in his palms, all while observing you like a curious child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, I've never seen someone as small as you!\", the giant gave a toothy smirk as his yellow eyes seem to glow. He brought up a fingerless gloved hand to his fedora and lightly tipped it. \"Oh I haven't introduced myself! You shall refer to me as Hazama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to speak in a attempt to get answers but stopped as Hazama quickly held up a finger to stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name.......is not important. After all, I'd rather my playthings remain nameless~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sent a chill down your spine and froze your body as the smirking face was covered by Hazama's palm approaching. You grunted as you were imprisoned in a large fist with only your head sticking out. Color drained from your face as Hazama brought you to his eyes and you could see them narrow as he licked his lips and resumed his snake like grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm yes we are going to have a lot of fun. I trust you'll be a good playmate.\", Hazama's voice turned more sinister as he lifted his heel up and grinded his shoe into the floor. \"If not......well my shoes will look good with some red!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazama closed his eyes and giggled as if this wasn't a cruel situation. Question is will you be a plaything?</span></div></div>",
