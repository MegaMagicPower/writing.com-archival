He eats all the cake leaving not a crumb and then he is surprised as Sophie brings in a full cooked breakfast too!<br>\r\n'Wow, is that all for me?'<br>\r\n'Yeah, of course,' Soph said 'It is your birthday!'<br>\r\n'Well that is true' Matty says with a smile. He polishes off the breakfast and lies content in bed for 30 mins, getting frisky with Sophie even though he felt pretty full. Finally he decides he should get up and get dressed, after all he was arranging a party for the night and needed to fetch some supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the supermarket he cant resist picking up a bag of sweets here, and a soda here, and eats them in the car on the way home. He unpacks all the party stuff, and then decides to go out for lunch. He goes to a fast food joint and has the deluxe, after all it is his birthday! When he gets home he decides to have a sleep for an hour or two and wakes up at 5pm. He now has 3 hours to get ready so he sets up the house, putting crisps into bowls (and eating a good few bags himself, good job he bought plenty!) He then sets up the booze, has a couple of cans himself, and puts the pizzas, chips, burgers and wedges into the oven. Leaving them he goes for a shower. He gets out and gets dressed, puts on a new shirt he had been given for his birthday. It felt tight to him but guesses that its a 'Small' small. Oh well! He finishes preparing the food and starts picking at the chips and having a few beers waiting for his guests to arrive. The doorbell rings and Matty is alarmed because he had almost fallen asleep eating chips and drinking beer. He has finished the fries so gets rid of the dish and opens the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of the 100 guests to arrive is . . . .</span></div></div>",

After scarfing it down he looked at the clock and saw that it was five minutes to nine. So he ran up to his room and was looking around for his swimming trunks.<br>\r\nAfter finding them he put them on except they didn't go on very well. The size was a 32 and he had always fit in them. But this time they felt really tight on his thighs and they felt like they barely made it past his butt. Thank God there was a drawstring because if he would never have been able to button them. <br>\r\nMatty turned around and looked in the mirror. He couldnt belive what he saw. His trunks looked like they were suctioned to his body. There was no room inbetween his thighs and the material. And the back of the trunks looked like they were going to explode with his new bubble butt barely staying.<br>\r\nMatty figured that they had shrunk in the wash but then he realized that there was no cotten in his swim trunks. They couldnt have shrunk. He must have gotten fat. He turned around and looked in the mirror again.<br>\r\nHe was afraid to see what he looked like under his shirt. Matty slowly pulled the already tight T-Shirt off. He was shocked at what he saw. <br>\r\nHe had a belly! His gut was spilling over his tight trunks. Where once he had some definition in his abs, there was none. He had chubby love handles that he'd never had before. He slapped his new found pudge and it jiggled.<br>\r\n\"I need to lay off the beers\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n\"Should I face Brad and Kyle like this or just not show up to the hot tub at all?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wanna talk to you more, but I gotta go.\" Kyle writes down an address on a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Matty drove to the address on the napkin. It was a large buffet restaurant. He got out of his car and saw Kyle's SUV parked nearby, He was sitting inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matty, good to see you. Get here ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So what did you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Matty and Kyle got a table. Before they went to the buffet, Kyle grabbed Matty's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, listen. I brought you here because I know you can go through with this. Will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go through what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matty, I want you to gain weight with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatty was shocked. deep down, the idea excited him, but he wasn't sure how Sophie would react. He looked at Kyle. His life was going great, and he had to be around 210 pounds himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it. Lets go grab a plate.\"</span></div></div>",

Their server, a man who looked to be about 30 was constantly bringing them over more heavily buttered rolls.  Matty had several plates piled high with fried chicken, tater-tots, fries, mashed potatoes.  He also had several plates of cheesecake, 4 slices of pie, a large bowl full of ice cream from the soft-serve machine, and numerous glasses of coke.  When Matty was done eating he had to unbuckle his belt under the booth.  His belly must have expanded an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Kyle pigged out also.  He had several steaks, cheescake, ice cream, pie and of course about 4 full plates of french fries.  Kyle ate less than Matty.  He much more enjoyed watching his partner pig out than him pigging out himself.  When they were ready to go Matty struggled to get out of the booth.  He go up and saw his outer belly was strained on his T-shirt.  It looked as if he would have to go shopping for clothes.  They walked out of the Buffet and got into Kyle's SUV.

Normally around 180 pounds or so, plus the few pounds he had gained since high school, and the 24 pounds from the pills make him look huge, weighing in at over 215 pounds. His bloated belly had not gone down, even though he was hungry.

He sat on the bed next to him and watched him sleep for a little bit.  He then proceeded to rub his hand up and down Matty's thick arms and thighs.

He was a 1000 pound blob of fat with all of his clothes ripped off. His huge belly was all around the sofa, and he turned his head to look at Kyle. Kyle was worse than him. He weighed about 1200 pounds and he was also naked. His belly was stretching to the ground and all around him and Matty. his hand reached over to touch Kyle. The hand sank right into the soft flesh and he said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kyle, wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle opened up his eyes and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shook his head and looked at his now huge belly. They were both silent for a moment until Kyle blurted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatty thought and decided he liked his new body. He liked being big. Now, he didn't have to move or work or do anything again. He could eat all he wanted. With Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle...\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matty, let's keep getting fatter. Let's eat until we care 2000 pounds each. Do it with me, forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatty immediately shook his head in agreement and reached over to get atop of Kyle. It was a struggle, but he eventually got atop of Kyle, and they man boobs and bellys were touching each other.

The he said to himself, \"Well, I have been pigging out for the last month, now that I think about it.  Maybe it's finally catching up to me.\"  Soon he felt a rumble in his stomach.  \"I'm hungry again?  I just ate so much!  Oh, well.  What could it hurt?  I couldn't have gained that much weight.  At least I don't look like Brad or Kyle.\"  With that, he went to go weigh himself.  The scale registered 167.  \"Jesus,\" he exclamed, \"that's about 20 pounds since the last time I weighed myself!\"  There was no way he could face everyone in the hot tub with the way his gut was rolling over the swimsuit.  Instead, Matty got more chunks (not slices) of cake and washed them down with some beer.  After that, he finished off the rest of the chips and salsa...along with the bowl of guacamole sauce.  Finally, he had somewhere around seven brownies.  It was around 1:30 A.M. when everyone started to leave.  Brad came up to Matty and asked, \"Dude, why didn't you come out to the hot tub?  We had a blast.\"  \"I wasn't feeling so good,\"  Matty replied.  \"Yet you ate all those snacks?\" retorted Brad.  When the last of the guests said goodbye, he felt more than a little tired.  He passed out on his bed and got a good night's rest.</span></div></div>",

He went out to eat several times a week, and snacked quite a few times in between meals.  However, Matty was oblivous as usual to the effect that his greasy food cravings had on him.  He had gotten quite a bit chunkier, and didn't realize that fact until many weeks after, when Brad invited him to his pool party.  He was running a bit late, so he grabbed his trunks and headed to Brad's place, where Kyle and a few other mutual friends were waiting.  \"Change up and jump in,\" Brad shouted as Matty walked up.  \"The water is great!\"  He proceeded to find the bathroom to change into the snug trunks.  As soon as he pulled them up, he realized there was a problem.  He had to suck in just to get them past his butt.  It was a good thing that they stretched a little, otherwise he might not have gotten them on.  When he finished barely tieing the strings, he looked in the mirror and couldn't believe what he saw.  The swimsuit inched way up on his thighs despite his attemp to pull them down.  As he tried to walk around, he was afraid that they would rip on him.  An even flabbier belly hung lower down than ever before.  It jiggled as he walked to the scale.  This time it said 186.  \"Holy crap!  I probably weigh as much as Brad now!\" he cried.  Sure enough, he went to step into the pool and saw that Brad was looking much slimmer than he was.  To be quite honest, Brad had lost a lot since Matty's party and had obtained some more muscle tone.  As he compared himself to his friend, he flexed his hidden abs and poked his belly.  He could feel no trace of any solid muscle anywhere.  He knew that everyone must have been thinking about how much he had let himself go.  His new gut even jiggled and hung over when he sucked it in as much as he could.  Did he...</span></div></div>",

The party's just beginning.\" said Brad. Brad then started walking towards Matty. \"At your party, I realised that your belly started to get a cartain shapeness to it. You were packing on the pounds and you were oblivious to the consequences.\" Brad had reached Matty and started to pull off his shirt.\" And now, you are a big fat mass of blubber.

He tried on several pairs of pants once again, but they seemed a lot tighter since that morning.  He then realized that he had forgotten about his \"loose\" jeans that Clarrie had just washed for him.  In the laundry room, he tried on the last pair.  These were still too snug for his liking.  His butt and thighs felt very constricted in them, and his new stomach and love handles sprouted over the top.  Finally, he then put on a pair of sweat pants that were once very baggy, but now seemed to fit just right on him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for his shirt, he decided to wear his favorite that Clarrie had bought him last Christmas.  However, it seemed so tight that it took some effort for him to actually put it on.  Half an inch of his stomach peeked out from the bottom of the shirt, showing the thick happy trail on his newly developed flab.  \"This is not going to work,\" he said to himself.  When he tried to get it off, he found that he actually could not even attempt the task without ripping the shirt a little.  \"What's going on here?  I just wore this shirt about two weeks ago!\" Matty thought.  He decided he should keep it on at least to go shopping.  He would rip it off when Clarrie wasn't there to make him self-conscious about the weight gain (and the fact that he would have to ruin the shirt she had bought him).  To hide his pudge, he pulled up the sweat pants a little higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready yet?\" Clarrie yelled from the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's go,\" Matty replied, still thinking about the six pack that he just had not too long ago.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking through the store, he saw a lot of shirts that he really liked.  His normal size was small, so he tried on the mediums in the dressing room.  They were almost perfect.  He could still see a bulge beneath the current shirt, but it wasn't too bad considering that he still had the other one on underneath.  As he examined himself in the mirror, he could see the small changes that had occurred to his body in the past three weeks.  His cheeks seemed slightly swollen, and he noticed the beginning of a small double chin.  His wrist bones no longer showed quite as large as they had before.  Even his fingers looked like they had increased in diameter.  As he looked down at his flip-flopped feet, he saw that they looked wider than before.  His toes didn't have as much space in between each other anymore.  Furthermore, his arms lacked the definition he remembered them having.  They seemed to spread as he pushed them back to his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making these slightly troubling observations, Matty took that shirt off and tried on the next one.  It seemed a bit more snug than the last one did.  He took it off and compared it to the previous shirts.  All of them were the same size.  \"It must be my imagination,\" he said.  Now he saw that about an inch of his stomach was showing under his favorite shirt.  He pulled up his sweat pants once more, which left the sides of his feet uncovered.  This made him realize that he had pulled them up as far as he could without looking like he was wearing floods.  The pants and his shirt were both obviously high on his stomach, but he couldn't allow his gut to hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out of the dressing room, he saw someone he went to high school with, a guy named Tim.  He hadn't seen Tim in such a long time.  Matty remembered making fun of his skinny arms and legs back in his senior year.  Now, on the other hand, Tim really had filled out.  His weight, however, was distributed throughout his body as solid muscle.  He went through quite a transformation from the shrimpy kid in the class to what looked like a top football player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim:  \"Matty!\"<br>\r\nMatty:  \"Oh, hi!  It's been quite a while since I've seen you around.  How are you?\"<br>\r\nTim:  \"I'm doing great.  I just got married last week.  I'm doing some last minute shopping for my honeymoon.  I had to find some new swimming trunks.  I've gained a lot of weight since I wore my last ones.\"<br>\r\nMatty:  \"Congratulations!  You look great.  You've changed so much.\" <br>\r\nTim:  \"Looks like youv'e done some changing too.  Way to pack on the pounds.\"<br>\r\nMatty:  \"Thanks, I try my best.  Anyway, I have to get back to my girlfriend.  She'll go nuts if she doesn't at least get three things that she wants.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatty walked away from Tim, livid at the remark that his old buddy had made about his chubbiness.  He soon found Clarrie and persuaded her to leave the store after buying his new shirts.  Now that he was pissed, he had no desire to look for pants anymore.  He told her they would come back another day.  He still had a couple more pairs of sweat pants.</span></div></div>",

No wonder you're a little tubby now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought about it, he became a little sad that he no longer had the muscular physique he was known for throughout high school and college.

He thanked God that the fat had been distributed equally and not just to his gut.  It was then that he discovered his stomach now showed a full 2 1/2 inches of flab over the sweat pants.  He reexamined his body and became shocked that it seemed he had gained more weight since earlier that day.  His sweatpants no longer had space between the material and the skin of even his lower thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatty:  \"Weird.  I must be bloated from all that food I just ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got on the scale in the bathroom.  It showed a whopping 157 pounds that he now weighed.

Looking down at his belly, he could see he had gained a lot of weight. His stomach hung over his boxers about and inch and a half. His chest was looser and was starting to form man boobs. Love handles were slowly making thier way into his belly and another chin was making itself apparant. <br>\r\nWhat Matty didn't know was that Kyle and Brad were slipping him a weight gain potion  when he wasn't looking. A few drops and his metabolisim would slow down and he'd get fat faster. <br>\r\nAfter rubbing his gut for a minuet Matty says \"I think I kinda like it.\" <br>\r\nThe other two just said that was cool.

Matt finally finished all the food and put an excessive amount of all the weight gaining formulas in all the food. The food covered three large tables and the desserts alone took up another two! Matt called Kyle and Brad in and both their mouth's dropped when they saw all the food. Matt told them to start eating after they drank their shakes, which were stuffed with metabolism slower.

To Brad and Kyle's surprise they had finished the three tables of food and still had room for the two dessert tables. Although, their boxers were now uncomfortably tight and the elastic about to break they continued eating. A few hours later both Kyle and Brad had finished the dessert, all the food was gone.

Litterally waddling out of bed and into the living room, they were stunned to see that the tables used last night for the huge supper were once again completely covered with a heavy breakfast smothered with weight gain potion. Trying to sit down in the chairs was quite an ordeal, because the arms of the chairs made them too small for Brad and especially Kyle, their bellies overfludding them from above and their asses spreading out from underneath.<br>\r\nOnce breakfast was over, Kyle and Brad made their way back to the living room couch (a five minute affair), and spent the rest of day chowing down on watever they could their hands on. Around night time, both their boxers snapped. Both men, completely shocked made their way to the bathroom scale. Brad, going first, weighed a whopping 400 lbs, and Kyle, even larger than Brad, weighed 460. Looking at themselves in the mirror, they stould in awe at their reflections. Fat had made its way through their limbs and made their arms and legs look incredibly huge. Their cheeks were pudgy and rounded and were surrounded by a big double chin. Holding their ripped boxers with their bare hands to try and cover up what they still could, they were in such a state of shock that they stood frozen in front of the mirror for what seemed like years. They mountainous and gelatinous bellies unrolled over their boxers and sagged low, with two love-handles on each side resembling an over-inflated inner tube, and an enormous bubble butt.<br>\r\nWhen they both turned to you, you had a hard time hiding your satisfaction. Grasping the only possible solution of how they could have grown so much, Kyle approches you, you yourself taking a few steps back. A sadistic grin appeared on his face, as he pushed you to the ground and leaped over you, rendering you unable to move. You yelled for dear life in hopes that the neighbors might hear you, but just then Brad, who had previously left the room, came back in with five tubs of weight gain potion in his squishy arms. Blocking your nose, they forced the entire stash of weight gain products you had bought down your throat. You blacked out.<br>\r\nWaking up the next day, unaware of the time, you take huge amounts of energy in trying to get up. when you finally do, you realise you are still in the bathroom, with shreds of clothes and empty bottles of potion and mountains of boxes of pizza and junk food skattered all around the room and the house. Waddling up to the scale, something keeps you from seeing the scale's reading. you bend over and make out the numbers: 5-0-0 lbs.</span></div></div>",

By this time of the party, a fair amount of alcohol had been drunk, and despite the amount of food also consumed, it was having its effect. Matty and Brad were outside talking, about anything and everything. Matty didn't realise how attractive Brad actually was. Sure he had put on a little bit of weight, but nowhere near the amount that Kyle had. He had chiseled features and designer stubble with medium length blonde hair and blue eyes. The added few pounds suited his face. Matty started to feel really....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatty snapped out of it in a bang, he realized he was about to think that he actually quite fancied Brad, but that couldn't be the case, could it? He had never experienced any feelings like this before and it scared him.

As he stared at it, willing it to flatten out, he felt something strange. He felt like there was a slight tickle right behind his belly button. Something wasn't right, he stood up and looked in his 6 ft' mirror, and to his surprise, he saw that his stomach was growing!!! Infact, all of him was growing! He was getting fatter. Matty stared is shock as his belly pushed further out from his body. His tan bloated belly soon became a sagging gut. It looked like someone had attached a sack of water to his midsection. His chest pushed out too, and soon hung down in a pair of thick juicy moobs. He noticed that the extra fat made his nipples look darker, and thicker. His butt became thicker, and the swim trunks that were too tight for him before were tearing. They started at the back, where his butt was becoming large and jiggly. His thighs took care of the rest, and soon, his swim trunks were lying on the floor in pieces. He watched as his once angular face suddenly chunked out, his cheeks became rounder, and was soon framed by a double chin. Matt didn't know how to react, but, he noticed, now that he was naked, that beneath his sagging belly, his crotch was waking up. <br>\r\n\"What the heck does that mean?\" Matty said to himself. He found himself excited about this sudden, random change. He just didn't know how to react about it. He needed to do something, what should he do?</span></div></div>",
