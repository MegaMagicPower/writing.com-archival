Get ready to disembark we've made it to the Temple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew began making preparations to stop the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were docked Tetra and Link disembarked from the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra said, \"Here it is Link. This temple is said to hold a map to new land for us to build a new Hyrule plus who knows what other kind of treasure  we can find here. Let's move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink said, \"I won't let you down Tetra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began exploring the depths of the temple coming across several small monsters nothing the two couldn't handle alone. As they reach the deepest part of the temple. They were greeted by an extra large Moblin which Link easily handled. They spotted a treasure chest and opened it up. Inside the chest was some gold, a map, some strange looking device and a book attached to the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra said, \"I don't care for the strange device but the gold an map will be an important asset for us to set up a New Hyrule. Move it Link! We don't have all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink groaned, \"I'm coming!\" He picked up the small chest and managed to carry it back to the ship. Tetra immediately began looking through the map trying to pinpoint their location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink on the other hand was far mor interested in the device and book. He had never seen something like it before. He looked at the small rectangular device with 3 buttons on it. One was labeled AS and the other US and the third one was labeled with a P. He decided to check out the book with it and found it was swapping remote whatever that is. It could swap bodies between people. It kind of reminded him of the Command Melody but more advanced. AS stood for aware swap, but parties would notice the swap while US stood for Unaware swap no one but the person who fired it would notice. The possesion one let him turn a person into a spirit that could posses others while their own body acted normal.  He had to test it out. He had one target in mind and that was Tetra. She was pushing him around like a common swabbie after he saved her life. A little payback was in order. He decided to fire the remote at Tetra. Which button did he press?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The current hero of Hyrule, Link, was seen as an enigma to the fellow knights under Zelda and to the people he swore to protect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo some he was just as he seemed from a glance, a noble knight who swore to protect the princess with his life. One who would rise early and sleep late doing knightly duties like deliver medicine to the sick and keep the castle clean<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo others however he was anything but noble. There were rumors of him smashing pots for rupees, participating in illegal Bombchu racing, and doing any odd job for money. The times he was seen cleaning the castle were rumored to be because he was caught in the act of mischief. He must have been a hoodlum who didn't care about his knight duties at all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of these views on Link were wrong, however that didn't mean either of them were completely right. These two interpretations of himself came into his mind as he practiced his swlrd techniques on a training dummy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was devote to Hyrule, and especially to Princess Zelda. As the hero of the triforce he was prepared to give his life for her, thankfully the need hadn't come up during their last journey. He was also devote to Hyrule's people. He would always spend hours in Hyrule Castle Town listening to the people's needs and doing everything within his power to fulfill them. All the rumors about his positive deeds were true, well, nearly all of them. Link couldn't wake up at dawn if his life depended on it (Which it often felt like it did with Impa's training)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just because his positive rumors were correct did not mean the negative things people had said about him were completely untrue. While he enjoyed being a knight, the pay was abysmal, just enough to live. How could he go out and drink special milk on this salary? Who could really blame him for scavenging pots for extra rupees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis desire for extra rupees was also where the rumor of him being a man who would do any odd job came from. While Link would never charge people for potion deliveries or anything that could help people, he would charge for mundane tasks like cutting lawns with his sword or walking dogs. He had also accustomed himself with Hyrule Castle Town's gambling undeground. Many of his free nights were spent trying to win big in Bombchu races or guessing the correct treasure chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumors were rumors, only Link knew what was right and wrong about him and that's all he cared about. He was a devote knight with a bit of a reckless spree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis last sword strike broke the training dummy. He went to the shed where the knights kept the spares to grab another. However as he grabbed the dummy and was leaving, he noticed something strange on the ground. A case of what seemed to be around 30 bottles of a strange liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking a bottle up, Link began to examine it. While a liquid, it's texture was closer to that of a chuchu jelly than that of a potion. Link wasn't one to think before acting, if he wanted to know what this did, there was one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up\" Link said to no one and began to drink the strange liquid. As soon as he did, the hero passed out. However something was strange, after passing out Link was looking at his own body! He was a ghost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did that kill me?!\" Link yelled. He was panicking, did he just drink poison?! \"How could I do something so stupid?!\" As he looked at his unconscious body he noticed something that gave him hope. His body was still breathing! He breathed a sigh of relief \"Okay, good. Not dead\" Link said, he couldn't imagine ___'s reaction if they found out the hero of Hyrule had unknowingly drank poison and killed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that person entered Link's mind however, he felt his ghost body begin to travel at lightning fast speed out of his control, soon putting him in the body of.....</span></div></div>",

Watching the mages of Chrom's army be able to attack from a distance often made Donnel jealous. \"Henry won't mind if I just try out a spell\" he justified to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohee. This is simpler than I thought\" Donnel said cheerfully as he read how to do the spell, not checking the previous page that stated what the spell would do. \"All I gotta do is say what's on the page.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnel left the barracks, the reast of the fallen books left where they lay. He got a good distance from the Shepard's camp, just in case this spell was like an explosion or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go!\" Donnel said before reciting the spell as it was written \"Sreiht hyie ydob ym hctiws!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Donnel finished talking, he felt as if the whole world was being pulled out from under his feet. He saw the environment around him move at a flashing speed, however he was not moving himself, rather his soul was! Within a few seconds he saw a familar group, his fellow shepards coming back from their battle against Risen. His spirit flew straight forward until he flew into the body of an ally who happened to have been standing directly parallel to his old one, albeit miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose body did Donnel end up in?</span></div></div>",

Byleth was just staring blank faced as always at the papers when a voice came out of nowhere.  \"Rejoice!  For I have more good news for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth sighed, Sothis, the Goddess who shared their headspace seemed to have something to say, and she was very excited to share the news, whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just sit there with that blank look of yours, be happy, for I have recalled an ability that I have and now you can use it as well.\"  Sothis said with her usual air of superiority.  Byleth wanted to just brush this off, but her time travel ability had saved Byleth and their students more times than they could count, so Byleth put the grading quill down and listened to what Sothis had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have recall the power of Transferance!  You now have the ability to place your mind into the body of whoever you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"  Was all Byleth felt like responding with, this certainly sounded interesting, but how could it help as a teacher?  The use wasn't very obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dolt.  Of course the use is obvious.  You can swap into the body of an enemy on the battlefield and toss their best weapons away leaving them for easy pickings.\"  Byleth sighed at Sothis' complaints.  Byleth tended to forget that Sothis could read their mind.  So Byleth though loudly in Sothis' direction, \"Yes, it seems useful and I'll have to use it, but I'm more worried about how I can use this to help me teach my students, that's my priority right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...just use it!  And find out, and don't worry about how the students will react, when you swap I'll be the one in charge of your body unless you ask otherwise.  The person you swap with will be in an unconscious state within our subconscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's one less thing I need to worry about.\"  Byleth said getting up, Byleth decided to go ahead and try this crazy power on one of his students.  Perhaps a way to help teach them would pop up by doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing!\"  Sothis said as Byleth stood.  Byleth waited for the response but Sothis seemed almost embarrassed to say.  Finally after a minute Sothis said, \"I kind of forgot, are you a boy or a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth sighed, Sothis practically asked this once a month at this point, it was rather annoying.  Perhaps one day they'd say the opposite just to mess with Sothis.</span></div></div>",

You looked lightheaded for a second?  You about to pass out from excitement from the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth shook his head seeing two pink pigtails wave in and out of his vision.  There were other body parts such as said pigtails that could be very distracting but Byleth focused on Claudes deep green eyes.  \"Oh, it's nothing Claude, I just...spaced out for a second.\"  Byleth looked at the classroom doorway and saw...himself standing there with a cocky grin that he recognized from seeing on the child goddesses face.  It seemed she was right and was in control of his body while Hilda was asleep inside him or something.  \"I just wanted to make sure we weren't overheard.\"  Byleth said lowering his voice to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?  Teach?\"  Claude said, \"Sure Teach might try to dissuade us from our little plan, but he won't actually try and stop us.  It's not like we're going to blow up the school or something.\"  Claude laughed as Byleth looked unsure, \"We're not blowing up the school...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, it's just a silly little prank to see the look on someone's face when we get the better of them.  But Hilda, you're going to have to not be lazy and put in a little bit of work.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude looked at Byleth with his mischievous smile, Byleth could really see how he always managed to get out of trouble with teachers and students, he was so darn charming, and maybe it was Hilda's body but Claudes charms seemed even more powerful.  \"All right, just so I'm clear on everything, what's the plan again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude sighed, but didn't let this hiccup stop him from explaining his little plan to Hilda and what her key role in it was.</span></div></div>",

She's been bragging about how she was one of the best dancers at her opera company and quite frankly, that just makes me want to beat her all the more.  But I've got two left feet and let's face it, the judges usually give it to the girls so you're the best option Hilda.  What do you say we show some good old fashion Golden Deer spirit and make sure you win this thing?  I promise not to bug you for a whole month if you do this and win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth thought about this.  As far as evil scheming plots go, this was actually pretty innocent if not downright pleasant.  If Hilda won the White Herron Cup it would probably help her out not he battlefield and also give the Golden Deer House some extra prestige.  Byleth could swap back and offer some encouragement to Hilda to help her overcome her natural laziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Byleth didn't really want to admit this, but this sounded like fun.  He'd never really danced before being raised as a mercenary by Jeralt.  The idea of dancing in front of a panel of judges was a very interesting thought.  And it might be a good way to get closer to his Golden Deer Students if he was one for a few days before the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was another option, if Claude wanted to win this so bad, maybe he could do it...as Hilda.  With some assistance from Byleth and the Transferance power.  It was a prank worthy of Claude himself and Byleth was very tempted to go through with it.</span></div></div>",

He'd been thinking about telling her that it was Claude in Hilda's body, or perhaps even taking Manuela's body for a spin and teach Claude himself.  But when Byleth knocked on Manuela's door there was just a groan on the other end.  Byleth groaned himself, he knew what this meant.  Manuela had been drinking again, probably at the pub in town trying to pick up young knights, and knowing Manuela she probably failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and sure enough Byleth could hear the clinking of bottles and could smell booze in the air as Manuela passed by.  She muttered something along the lines of, \"Got note...dance...Hilda...\"  Manuela was straighten herself up to try and pass herself off as a responsible teacher as she went off to the courtyard to teach Claude how to dance.  Byleth just sat back and said, \"You know what?  Claude can get to deal with Manuela without me interfering.\"  And with that Byleth decided to take a break from swapping and teaching and spent the rest of the afternoon fishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straighten up Hilda.

He put a fierce amount of concentration into keeping an eye on this fish, those who had been lectured by Byleth or defeated on the battlefield hadn't seen him even close to this level of concentration<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, the fish seemed to get a bit closer to the durface. Good, that meant he wouldn't need to reel it in as much. Oh, it got even closer, and closer. That's when Byleth had a horrific realization, the fish wasn't getting closer to him, his vision was getting closer to the fish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Byleth could react he was pulled from his body and into the fish's. Once underwater he instinctively began panicking and swimming around like he was drowning, however he soon calmed down as he could now breath underwater as this fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above the water's surface Byleth heard laughter, coming from his own body \"Hahahaha! It would seem this ridiculously boring hobby has finally bit you in the behind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth wanted to talk back but could, this fish body had no way of making any noise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see if I can finally see what you find so entertaining about this\" Sothis said and Byleth went wide eyed, his own fishing rod was being used against him! Sothis moved it back and forth viciously, she wasn't trying to have him bote the hook, she was going to stab him with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth kept dodging the hook as if his life depended on it, this fish body could probably survive 1 hooking, but he didn't want to deal with that pain even briefly. He tried to focus on his body to swap back, but the water's surface was too cloudy from this angle to get a good look at it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodging the hook again Byleth got an idea, he would jump up with all his might above the water. Once in midair he would focus and get out of this body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Here goes nothing'</i> he thought to himself, his tail nearly being skewered. He put the full force of his body into swimmimg upwars to the water's surface. Once above the water he was in midair briefly, with no way of breathing.

Sothis in Byleth's body approached and gave a mock bow, \"Well <i>my lady</i> now that you've made your decision, what will be your first act as archbishop of the church of Seros?\"  Sothis asked with a mischievous grin, she seemed to not mind your wild streak.  It was a break from her normal boredom of watching Byleth grade papers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth gave this some thought.  With the power he now held he could now held, he could find out the truth about his mother and father from all those years ago, Byleth always suspected Rhea knew something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...or he could play pranks.  That sounded like a lot more fun without the weight of emotional baggage on his heart and mind.</span></div></div>",

For while finding the truth about his parents crossed his mind, he felt like he had a little Claude shoulder angel insisting he use his newfound power for another purpose: pranks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchbishop Rhea had the power to do nearly anything she desired, and he desired to pull a prank on EVERYONE at the monastery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, he needed to head to the Seteth's office. He slowly made his way there, Rhea's outfit still a sturggle for him to walk in \"How does she always wear dresses like this\" he said uncomfortably <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he reached his destination, Seteth looked surprised as the archbishop entered, soaking wet. Usually he would report to her, why had she visited his office? \"Lady Rhea, is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, you seeee\" Byleth wasn't acting very much Rhea right now, he was too busy winging a prank idea off the top of his head <i>'What would Claude and Hilda do?'</i> he asked himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude and Hilda, Claude and Hilda. That's it! The White Harron Cup in a few days. Claude was always pulling pranks on others, and while having to dance as Hilda was a good lesson, it could use a good dosage of prank on top<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking through some old historical records and found a holiday lost to time.\" Byleth began, trying to sound more lady-like. \"Thankfully I found out about it in time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lost holiday?\" Seteth was shocked, this was HUGE \"May I see these records, my lady?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Byleth immediately shot him down. He couldn't let the fact he was lying be exposed. \"These are the only records of this holiday, so I cannot let them be damaged. They will stay with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Seteth obeyed \"When is this holiday and what does this entail? I shall add it to the calendars at once\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth grinned, he had him hook, line, and sinker \"It seems we're in luck, this holiday happens the same day we ade holding the White Harron Cup.\" With that sentence Byleth may as well have sealed himself to the fate of being Rhea for a few days, after all if she went back to normal before the dance she could call off the holiday \"As for what it entails....\"</span></div></div>",

The lack of clothing would symbolize an equal lack of secrecy between allies\" he weeved a tale off the top of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeteth clearly thought the idea was ridiculous, however he had no way to argue against it. Rhea was the archbishop and his superior here. \"Alright. I'll have it added to the calendars and let all students know it's not optional.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the monastery students were complaining to their teachers about this ridiculous holiday plan. The female students were clearly a lot more annoyed about the idea than the male students. In particular Sylvain seemed extremely excited for the holiday<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaagh!\" Hilda screamed from Claude's body. The two of them had a good idea what was going on, professor Byleth must have been behind this with his weird body swapping power \"I cannot believe this is happening on the day of the cup! At least if this was happening on a normal day I could hide away in my room, but you're going to be dancing in my underwear in front of everyone!\" She pointed her finger at Claude <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I don't want to do it either! The whole crowd will be staring at me, er you, er you know what I mean!\" Claude yelled back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find a way out of this. I cannot let my body dance on that day!\" Hilda said and the two began to think of a plan to get back at the professor and turn back to normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth made his way to the Archbishop's bedroom. It was a lot more elegant and spacious than his own, a perk of being in power he supposed. He looked around the room and soon saw what he was looking for: a wooden box full of water that could only be classified as a fish tank. Inside it housed the fish Rhea. Byleth looked around the room for something to cover up the tank, finding something suitable he placed it over the tank. Fish Rhea no longer had any way of seeing \"I'll find a cover that lets some light in tommorow\" he reassured the fish<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rhea had no way of seeing he invited Sothis in his body into the room. He had lucked out at the pier with there being no way for Rhea to have seen he pulled off the swap. He didn't want to take any risks, of Rhea found out he stole he body she would.....he had no idea what she would do, but it would likely be horrible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis shook the box containing fish Rhea and began to shake it as Byleth was lost in thought, to which he stopped her</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Sothis was gone and the fish tank was covered to his liking, Byleth finally found himself with a moment of privacy. Naturally, he gravitated towards Rhea's mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... finally can have some fun.\" He hadn't had the chance to be in another person's body for more than a moment since gaining this power. He had switched Claude and Hilda too soon in fact - no time to appreciate a girl's body at all. He felt a chill run down his spine in excitement as he rubbed his hands up and down Rhea's hips. He had seen people stare at her before in awe, but also with more than a bit of lust hidden away. He imagined he had to be the only person who got to see her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stray hand squeezed her rear. Byleth couldn't help but blush at the sensation. \"Well... maybe I should celebrate this upcoming holiday myself... in private... before the students get their turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, Rhea's headress was thrown to the bed, her hair falling down her shoulders freely. Soon enough, her dress was flung off as well. Byleth stood in front of the mirror, staring at Rhea's mature and full form in nothing but silken, white undergarments. \"I didn't realize how comfortable her clothes were. She has to live a life close to a royals...\" The more he thought about it, the more appealing her life became. \"Think I made a good call staying put.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping his hands around the waistband of her underwear, he couldn't help but grin at the mirror. \"We're going to have a <i>lot</i> of fun, Archbishop Rhea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" Byleth sighed in satisfaction, enjoying his new sonorous voice. He was now sitting in contently in the academy's sauna the next day, clad in nothing but a towel. He of course used his power as the archbishop to ensure no one else was present so he could relax in utter peace. \"Never really had any privacy before, between the mercenaries, students, and Sothis. A <i>girl</i> can really get used to this sort of treatment,\" he chuckled to himself, grinning a bit as he snaked a hand under the towel, groping at Rhea's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never realized that doing nothing could be so much fun. Hilda was right.\"  Rhea's duties were mostly ceremonial - attending to events and sending knights to help out where needed. The country was at peace at the moment, so a bit of slacking off could be fine. She herself didn't have to make that many appearances. He could delegate quite a bit to Seteth at well. \"I guess the archbishop does have <i>some </i>work to attend to though... anyone with this much power would.\" With a groan, he got up from the bench, letting the towel fall off Rhea's body with little resistance. In a short amount of time he had made himself quite comfortable in the Archbishop's form. She'd probably be livid if he knew how casually he was treating her body, but for some reason he wasn't inclined to care. It was the oddest thing, but being in her body made him feel invincible. Like he was stronger and more confident than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on...\" he grunted in frustration as he struggled to attach a bra. Unfortunately, confidence didn't impart competence. Being a woman was a challenge he still needed some practice in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, he had on her undergarments and a casual white dress, and made his way out of the sauna. The guards gave a stiff salute as he exited, obviously not used to seeing the Archbishop so close up and even less accustomed to seeing her dressed so casually. \"Oh don't be so uptight. I appreciate your diligence. Until next time~\" He waved away with a sweet smile. His voice was a dry monotone, but Rhea's had a songlike and calming affect. While his voice commanded attention for sounding strong and affirmative, hers sounded gentle and caring. It was quite the contrast, but it seemed to always have an effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming to himself, he made his way back to upper floors of the monastery, where he could get to finishing up Rhea's duties for the day. A few heads turned as the casually dressed Archbishop passed by, but just as many people ignored her, likely not even realizing she was the Bishop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened then?</span></div></div>",

His daily routine for so long had involved his students and lesson plans that going too long without them felt wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the hall, Byleth was lost in thought. He knew he had to stay in Rhea's body at least until the cup to keep up the lie about discovering a new holiday, but he wanted to teach. Additionally he doubted Sothis was doing a good job in his place after the lesson plan changes she showed him yesterday<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an idea popped into his head. He had absolute authority in the monastery right now and could delegate most of Rhea's ordinary duties to Seteth. Why not give the Golden Deer class a special once and a lifetime lesson from the Archbishop herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth began to head over to the Golden Deer classroom, not even bothering to check with anyone if he was actually allowed to do this. As he got to the classroom, the students were shocked to see the Archbishop not only visiting them, but also wearing such a casual dress. Byleth motioned for Sothis to come out and talk to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? You get the power to become anyone you want and you choose to spend that time teaching?!\" Sothis reacted to what Byleth explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for the day, getting used to someone else's daily routine is hard. I only want to do it this one time and see my students\" Byleth said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis rolled her current eyes \"Fine, go ahead\" she went back in the classroom and stood behind the students, she mentally prepared herself to be incredibly bored with Byleth's lectures. At least when she was in charge of the class she could make it more entertaining for herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth went to the front of the classroom and the entire class was in shock at what they were seeing. Archbishop Rhea herself was teaching their class. Well, all but two students were shocked. Claude and Hilda knew exactly what was going on right now.</span></div></div>",

Before everyone goes, we need a quick house meeting,\" 'Hilda' suddenly announced to a mass of confused faces. Everyone knew Hilda hated house meetings. Did she even have the authority to call them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything quite okay Hilda? It's very unlike you to to make such a proclamation,\" Lorenz asked. \"I for one am quite glad to see you take leadership however. I know we lack it from Claude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well get ready for a surprise then,\" 'Claude' spoke up. \"Because -she- is Claude. And I'm Hilda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>One Long Story Later</i>-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Claude, I'm not particularly inclined to believe you,\" Lorenz said with a grunt to Hilda in Claude's body. \"But, this is a longshot of a gag, even for you. Getting Hilda on board is... impressive as well. So, I'll pretend to go along with it for the moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power to become another person...\" Marianne muttered. \"How frightening. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">But fascinating too.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true!\" Hilda replied. \"The professor used it on us as a punishment, so that Claude would have to dance in my place. He must have used it on the Archbishop too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we believe that's all true,\" Ignatz interjected, \"then who is the professor? We saw them both at once. Would that mean the Archbishop herself is in his body?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The professor admittedly hasn't been acting like himself either...\" Leonie commented. \"It could be possible he traded with someone else as well. Would that mean he's now the archbishop and this co-conspirator is him? Where's Rhea in that case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she had the professor switch her with a student, so she could observe the other teachers without them knowing. That would explain who is in the professor's body right now too - a Black Eagle or Blue Lion.\" A surprisingly reasonable explanation from Raphael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, but supposing all of this is true, what should be done about it?\" Lysithea suddenly broke the silence. \"If they aren't lying, then the professor is a better mage than we could have guessed. But it looks like everything is under control more or less. Raphael's explanation makes sense to me. So it seems like Hilda and Claude can just deal with it for a few days and move on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not letting Claude dance in my underwear for the White Heron Cup!\" Hilda shot back. \"There's no way the real Archbishop ok'd that idea! We have to get her back to normal so she can cancel it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, we best all break for now and investigate the rest of the students,\" Claude reasoned from Hilda's body. \"If Raphael is right, she's one of the eagles or lions. So, if we can discern who she switched with, we can get her to lean on the professor to make everything right. We all have to keep the illusion that things are normal until then though, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golden Deer reluctantly agreed. Whether or not they particularly believed Hilda and Claude, they weren't thrilled about the upcoming \"holiday\" either. Any possibility to get it canceled was worth pursuing, and thus they followed Raphael's red herring and went to mingle with the students of the other houses. </font></span></div></div>",

He had no particular destination or goal in mind, just walking around in Rhea's body and everyone who noticed having the upmost respect for him filled him with a kind of confidence he relished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking by the kitchen he saw an odd pair. Ignatz and Dorothea. The two of them never hung out before. The desire to spy on his students affairs overtook him and Byleth easedropped on the two from around a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to be an ordinary conversation for two people who hadn't hung out often. Ignatz was asking her questions, to which Byleth presumed was to get to know her. In reality he was asking her questions to find out if she was actually Rhea<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting bored of their conversation, Byleth moved on....after using some of his \"Archbishop authority\" to get some snacks from the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing his walk Byleth saw another strange pair. Bernadetta and Raphael. It was clearly a nervous conversation from Bernie. Raphael seemed to be asking her question after question. Weren't the two of them already friends? Why was he asking her so much stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth paid no mind to it. While suspicious, he didn't think he'd need to take any action. However he kept it in mind for later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth then passed the fishing pond, he shivered remembering the Sothis using his own rod to try to catch him <i>'Did I remember to feed Rhea today? Maybe I should have Cyril do it just in case'</i> his mind wandered. However before he could further contemplate the situation of the feeding fish-Rhea, he saw another Golden Deer student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonie and Sylvain were talking to each other, nothing too strange. However Byleth raised an eyebrow at their conversation. It was once again another volley of questions. Something was going on, and he needed to get to the bottom of it. Choosing not to confront Leonie and Sylvain right at this moment he moved on in his walk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around some more he saw yet another Golden Deer. This time it was Lorenz speaking with Mercedes. Byleth chose to easedrop on their conversation, once again an assortment of questions, however Byleth stuck around long enough to hear Lorenz sigh and reveal the reason for these questions. \"As ridiculous as it sounds, Claude and Hilda claim to be in each other's bodies, and that professor Byleth is in Archbishop Rhea's. So now our entire class is on this wild goose chase to see if any students are the real Rhea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth didn't know whether to be angry or proud. His students had figured out most of what was going on, the only thing they didn't know was that Rhea was currently a fish. He was proud of them for that, however he was mad that they could potentially spoil the fun he was having as the archbishop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth wondered if he should give them some....special punishment for this. He had the power to swap any bodies right now and they had conveniently all seperated into pairs. <i>Don't investigate something if you don't want to be a victim of it</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, he could just do nothing. They knew he was currently in the Archbishop's body, but they had no idea she was a fish or that he was keeping this swap a secret from her. So long as they didn't know that and use it against him he could relax.</span></div></div>",

Is it true?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... is what true?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"> you know</font> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">you're not really the Archbiship?\"</font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth's eyes went wide, surprised someone had come right out with it already. \"Where did you hear such a thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\",,,Claude and Hilda, ma'am. They said you were really the professor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Byleth supposed he shouldn't have been surprised. They already knew about his power - of course they'd be on the lookout for something like this. They were smart kids after all. <i>Will have to get them back for telling their fellow classmates though.</i> \"Come with me to my office, Marianne, we'll discuss it there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh... alright.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so you want me to switch you with someone then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Any reason?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne looks to the side. \"I'm not... a very happy person. There are people out there who envy me, or say I'm lucky, since I'm a noble. But I don't care. If they envy me, they can have my life. I'd like to live more free.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown came over Byleth's face. It hurt to hear one of his students was so depressed. \"Well, I have to hand it to you, it took a lot of confidence to just come and ask me. So... why not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really!? You'll do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth nodded. \"Atleast for a while, just to satisfy your curiosity.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightest of smiles broke onto Marianne's face. \"Thank you Arch- I mean Professor. But, who will you switch me with?\"</span></div></div>",

If being nobility is part of what's making you depressed, I can't just make you another noble. Hmmm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho to swap her with, there were non nobles at Gareg Mach. Who to swap her with though? Byleth wanted to keep a close eye on her while she was someone else, if she was feeling just as bad, or even worse as someone else he wanted the ability to swap her back at a moment's notice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth's first thought was Cyril. The past few days he had been able to rely on Cyril for minor conveniences could as of him as the archbishop. Keeping an eye on Marianne if she became him would be a simple task. He could also rely on Cyril to keep the power of Transference a secret if he told him. Cyril respected lady Rhea significantly more than most people, he would walk on hot coals if she told him too. If 'she' told him to keep his mouth shut about this power, he would do so<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother person Byleth could keep his eye on if Marianne were to become them was Seteth. Seteth's duties would always require him to return to his office afterward, if Marianne were to become him Byleth could periodically check in on her throughout the day. However swapping her with Seteth came with the danger of Seteth learning of this power and possibly suspecting that Rhea hadn't been herself for the past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Marianne who was silently waiting patently Byleth chose to swap her with...</span></div></div>",

Byleth decided he needed to come up with rationalization for his lie.  \"This is done to...show the nobility the hardships of the people and is meant to instill understanding and hard work upon them.  I think this is an excellent idea to bring back for the students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth was proud of his lie, and Seteth didn't suspect enough to counter 'Lady Rhea'.  And so Seteth went to work.  He added the new 'celebrations' to the calendar.  Ordered all of the needed uniforms.  And made sure all the students knew that this was not optional.

Byleth knew he had to stay in Rhea's body or else Rhea would undo his student servant holiday plans.  Plus he figured he'd caused enough chaos in the school and didn't feel the need to cause any more...for now.  No, he spend the last few days mostly trying not to trip on Rhea elaborate dresses and also being followed around by Seteth who updated him on the political Fodlan landscape.  Sothis in Byleth's body usually stopped by once a day to update him on how teaching students was boring to her so she was messing around with the lesson plan by trying to teach Raphael light magic and Lysithea axes and how much of a disaster that had been so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at last, the big day of the White Herron Cup had arrived.  Byleth was awakened on the much anticipated day by knocking on the archbishop's door at the crack of dawn.  <i>\"Oh your archbishopness.  It's time to start the day.\"</i>. A guy's sing songy voice came through the door.  Byleth got up and opened the door and was surprised at what he saw even if he'd instructed it.  Claude and Hilda were standing there still in each other's bodies with big smiles on their faces.  Hilda's body was wearing a rediculously pink maid outfit with a large bustle under the skirt.  While Claude's body was wearing a golden yellow tailored suit.  Whoever did the rush job on the outfits did a great job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting to be invited in, Claude and Hilda entered while giving an over the top bow and curtsy.  \"Oh great and might Rhea!  The two of us have been oh so lucky and fortunate enough to win a lottery drawing to have the pleasure of being your personal servants for the day.  Now don't you worry your holy head about anything.  Let us do all the work.\"  Byleth was slightly off put by how willing these two usual trouble makers were when it came to being servants for a day, but figured they were just rolling with the punches so any doubts went away as Hilda used Claude's hands to massage Byleth's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth sat back and enjoyed being pampered.  Although it wasn't as comfortable as he'd hoped.  Hilda put a bunch of painful pins in his head to make sure Rhea's headpiece didn't move, the juice that Claude gave him for breakfast had a weird aftertaste to it, and the shoes they selected had ridiculously big heels that were difficult to walk around in.  Things were going well until Hilda said, \"Ew, look at this disgusting fish, I'll just toss this into the lake for you, or maybe cook it up for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"  Byleth said practically tripping over his heels and dress to stop her from touching the actual Rhea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude chucked and twirled Hilda's pigtails as he said, \"Let me guess, that's the actual Rhea, Teach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth's eyes went wide, then he realized of course, they knew about his Transferance swap power and must have figured everything out, \"Ok, it so.  But I swear I'll swap back after the White Herron Cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll definitely want to swap back, especially after you start feeling the impact of this stuff by tonight.\"  Claude said shaking a bottle of clear liquid.  Byleth's eyes went wide, \"Did you poison me?  Did you poison the archbishops body?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, it won't kill her, just make her throw up a little.  Just something to encourage you to make sure you give her body back.  I'm sure throwing up for a few days will be a small price to pay for her getting her body returned to her.\"  Claude continued making the bottle disappear with a little slight of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you've got me.\"  What is it the two of you want?\"  Byleth asked his students who he had to admit, he was a little proud of for getting one over on him.  Claude and Hilda smiled as they revealed their plan.</span></div></div>",

However maybe it was because he was talking to Hilda's body, he suspected he didn't take every lesson very seriously \"And what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can swap bodies professor! Dorothea wouldn't be able to beat me if she wasn't actually the one dancing!\" Claude's eyes gleamed from his ingenious idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you become Dorothea and lose on purpose, there's no way we can lose!\" Hilda was excited at the prospect of winning her actually needing to put in a large amount of effort <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth immediately noticed something they had overlooked in the plan \"Okay, you have an idea for beating Dorothea, but what about the Blue Lions entree?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh\" Claude waved a dismissive hand. \"That class is full of people who don't know the definition of fun. All I need to do is put passion into my moves and the judges will pick me over them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth thought it over, this could work. Although he wanted his house to win fair and square, that seemed like an impossible request for Claude and Hilda. Evening the odds wouldn't be that big a crime<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Byleth was also annoyed with the two. They strutted in here first thing in the morning and ruined his experience in this body, and now they were making demands of him. Fine, if they wanted a prank war, they will get one  \"Alright, fine. I'll swap with Dorothea for the cup-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best, teach!\" Claude interrupted Byleth before he was done talking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-however.\" Byleth said sternly, Claude and Hilda gulped fearing what this meant. \"If you don't win, neither of you will be going back to your own bodies for at least a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude's fears were slept away \"Well, I think I can handle being Hilda's for a little while longer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth chuckled \"Oh, I didn't mean Hilda. I can make you whoever I want, and trust me there are much worse people to be then a pretty young lady. Like an archbishop who's about to spend a day vomiting, or a teacher\" Byleth smirked as the fear in Claude and Hilda's faces grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth tried to make a dramatic exit, however it was more comical than anything else as he had to make ridiculously big steps to move in the insanely high heels the two had given him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's what happened\" Byleth in his body explained to the goddess in his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiiiight.\" Sothis replied paying half attention \"and what exactly do you plan to do with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth looked in the corner of the classroom, he knew  he couldn't neither let Rhea back in her body and risk her ruining all of this nor could he have Sothis become Rhea, he didn't want Dorothea in his body during the cup for this plan to work. That left him with 1 option. Let the fish stay in Rhea's body for a bit. \"We'll turn the archbishop back later, for now the fish can be her. Let's just....make sure the door stays locked\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth put out a plate of fruit, to which the fish in Rhea's body ran over to the plater and began consuming. Byleth took this chance to run out of the room and lock the door, praying that the fish wouldn't figure out how to open a window and escape<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way over to the room where the cup was being held, Byleth saw Claude made it before him and was standing with the other two contestants. Dorothea of course, but also Annette from the Blue Lions house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Dorothea, Byleth could tell this was already rigged in her favor in one way. All three contestants were wearing maid uniforms of course, but Dorothea had taken the time to embroider a pattern that seemed to sparkle like gold, she already seemed more dazzling than the other two contestants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste any more time, Byleth focused hard on Dorothea to initiate another Transference </span></div></div>",

Byleth stood up and mentally prepared himself to throw the competition.  After all, if he wanted to rig it so Claude and Hilda would lose, he'd just let Dorathea dance on her own.  Now all Claude had to do was beat Annette, but that was up to him and his dancing in Hilda's body.  Claude apparently noticed Dorathea's change in demeanor as he gave Byleth a little wink and a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later, Alois, the jovial Knight of Seros stood before the gathering of teachers and students dressed as maids and said, \"Ladies and gentlemen!  My sincerest apologies for the wait, but my room just got a good cleaning thanks to some of the students of the academy,\"  Alois motioned to Caspar who was wearing a light blue butler suit and gave an enthusiastic thumbs up.  \"I swear my room hasn't been that clean since I swept my wife off of her feet.  Get it.  Swept!\"  The silence was deafening, but that didn't stop Alois from continuing.  \"Thank you for gathering here on the eve of the highly anticipated ball to bear witness to this year's academy wide dance competition.  The White Heron Cup!\"  There was a smattering of applause from the crowd eager to see the dancing.  Alois explained he, Manuela, and Shamir would be the judges this year and went over the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth was half paying attention when Claude whispered, \"Good luck Teach, or should I say bad luck?  Would that be too rude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth rolled Dorathea's eyes and when Dorathea's name was called he made his way to the dance floor.  Byleth did a few elegant movements, but made sure to trip over his feet a few times, which wasn't difficult in the heels Dorathea had decided to wear that day.  There was a polite applause once Byleth finished, but people were clearly disappointed.  When he went back beside Annette and 'Hilda' he whispered to the pink headed girl, \"It's all on you now.\"  And he concentrated on his body again and used Transference to give Dorathea her body back.  He looked at the slightly confused girl who didn't quite recall dancing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Annette and 'Hilda' had their chances to dance.  Byleth was pleasantly surprised, apparently Manuela's dance lessons had worked, Claude moved very gracefully and lady like during the competition.  He actually had a good chance of winning it all.  But finally it was time for the judges to make their decision.  Alois gave his vote to Annette of the Blue Lions.  Manuela votes for 'Hilda' of the Golden Deer house leaving Shamir as the tie breaking vote.</span></div></div>",

Byleth turned and saw Catherine standing there.  \"Just because the White Heron Cup is over doesn't mean the Student Servant holiday is.  Dorathea, I want you to clean up the dance hall.  There are scuff marks all over the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I need to...\"  Byleth tried to start, but Catherine cut him off, \"No buts, respect the holiday rediscovered by the great Lady Rhea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth could hear the laughing of Claude and Hilda as they made a break for it out of the room.  Byleth looked up at Catherine and considered using Transferance on her, but figured it would be a little too messy.  He made this mess with the student servant thing, he might as well clean it up, both figuratively and literally.  So the rest of the night he spent on his hands and knees in Dorathea's decorative red maid outfit cleaning the floor and grumbling to himself about people littering and not respecting school grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the cleaning was done and the sun was setting, Byleth knew he had to tie up some loose ends.  He went back to his room where Sothis was more than happy to laugh at his misfortune telling him he got what was coming to him.  He swapped back into his body giving a very confused Dorathea her body back, but thankfully she didn't ask any questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the not fun part.  Byleth went back to the Archbishop's room and was met with quite a sight.  The fish in Rhea's body had successfully made quite a mess with clothing and papers strewn about everywhere and the archbishop's body was currently rolling around on the ground making weird noises.  \"Yeah...I really need to fix this before it gets bad.  Hope the archbishop is in a forgiving mood.  Byleth was starting to really get the hang of the Transferance ability.  In a matter of seconds he had swapped into Rhea's body, then into the fish, and one jump later back into his own putting everyone in the proper bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archbishop stood up and seemed too mad to speak.  \"In all of my years on Fodlan, I have never seen such an abuse of power.  I swear that I'll get you back for this.  I'm going to...\"  But what Rhea was going to do, Byleth didn't find out.  There was a very loud rumble that seemed to come from Rhea's stomach and her face dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that was probably the stuff that Claude and Hilda drugged me with while in your body.\"  Byleth said trying not to laugh at the look of discomfort on Rhea's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...I'll talk with you tomorrow!\"  And Rhea ran off to her personal bathroom while Byleth went back to his room.  Tomorrow wasn't going to be pleasant for him, but at least he wasn't the only one living in fear as Claude and Hilda were themselves growing more and more nervous in their rooms at what tomorrow would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, tomorrow wasn't just going to be a day of reckoning for the pranksters, it was the day of the 995's Garreg Moch ball, when all the students would put on their best uniforms and dance the night away.  Some couples would even meet at the Goddess Tower and profess feelings towards each other.

Hiding in the shadows of the Goddess Tower, the meddlesome duo decided they were alone and it was safe to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that you actually poisoned the archbishop of the Church of Seros.\"  Hilda said holding in a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you were in on the plan too.  And besides, Teach was in her body at the time so technically I only poisoned my teacher.  And it should just give Rhea a bit of a tummy ache for. a few days...I think.  I probably should have tested it more.\"  The two friends giggled but shushed each other when they heard noises.  Making sure not to be seen the two saw Ferdinand (von Ayer) and Dorathea sneaking into an abandoned classroom holding hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!  I knew Dorathea liked him!  I bet that noble hating stuff is overblown too.\"  Hilda said fist pumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but who knows, if Byleth catches them, they might be the ones we have to swap with for our punishment.\"  Claude said with a sigh.  There was a few moments of silence.  \"Would it be that bad if we swapped with people who were going out?\"  Hilda asked breaking the ice.  Claude was surprised by this sentiment.  \"Well, it wouldn't be a bad thing.  I mean, it would actually probably be nice to be out holding hands with you...and other things.\"  Both Claude and Hilda did some uncharacteristic blushing.  Claude quickly added, \"But don't tell your brother I said that.  He'd kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's your brother right now.\"  Hilda joked.  There was another bit of awkward silence before Claude said, \"You know, if Byleth actually wanted to punish us, he'd swap us with people who don't, or can't hang out together.  I definitely wouldn't want that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either.  That sounds like the worst thing he could do to us.\"  Hilda said.  A few more minutes of awkward silence passed as the party seemed to beginning to die down inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\"  The ever plotting Claude said with Hilda's most confident tone.  \"There's one thing we could do to make sure Byleth can't punish us and separate us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could just drop out of school and run away together.\"  Claude casually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"  Hilda said, \"Don't even joke about that, we'd be stuck in each other's bodies forever if we did that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but there are worse things to do.  We could travel the world, I could show you Almyra and you could take me to meet your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's silly, that's the kind of things lovers do before they get married.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah it is.\"  Claude said plainly.  Hilda just stared blankly at her old face which was smiling a smug smile.  \"Claude von Riegan if you are joking or scheming right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joking,\"  Claude said, \"But I'm always scheming.  You know that, and there's no one I would rather scheme with for the rest of my life.  I came here to find a way to change the world, and I'm still not sure how I'm going to do that, but I've found someone I want to change the world with.  What do you say Hilda, do you want to get out of here and take on the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda didn't even hesitate as she kissed Claude beneath the Goddess Tower.  No more needed to be said as the two snuck off into the night.</span></div></div>",

Their surprise exit the night of the 995th Garreg Moch Ball would become the stuff of legend.  The two would wed in a small village in Alliance territory.  But despite leaving Garreg Moch, the two did not abandon their duties.  Hilda would go on to take Claude's place as the leader of the Alliance and with Claude as advisor, Hilda would go on to create unprecedented relationships with Almyra which would strength both continents.  The two would have a very large family who's lineage would go on to dominate the Fodlan and Almyra political stage with their schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth:<br>\r\nByleth would eventually leave Garreg Moch after 5 years having gotten bored with teaching and getting punishment work from Rhea.  No one knew exactly why Rhea made Byleth do so much work, but someone overheard the Archbishop muttering something about a fish as the cause of their rift.  Byleth would go on to become an advisor for Claude and Hilda.  He'd offered to switch the two back, but they turned down the offer.  Byleth would also offer as a wedding gift to switch with Claude and be the one to give birth to their children for him.  Byleth would eventually very much regret this offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela:<br>\r\nShe's still single and complains about it nightly with a beer in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea:<br>\r\nRhea worked amicably with Byleth for years before Byleth left, but Byleth left his mark behind.  It turns out Claude's poison had a much more severe effect on the Archbishops unique body.  She'd spend years dealing with stomach issues.  But inadvertently this would help Rhea.  As one day Edelgard came across the Archbishop in distress.  Edelgard saw a humanity and vulnerably in Rhea she didn't think possible and glanced within herself.  She determined the church wasn't the problem with Fodlan, it was Those Who Slither In The Dark.  She'd go on to lead a cool named Black Eagle Strike Force in order to take them down and free Fodlan from their clutches.</span></div></div>",

It's time to start the day.\"</i>. A guy's sing songy voice came through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get that for you, Lady Rhea.\" Seteth said as he got up, and went to open the door. Claude and Hilda were standing there still in each other's bodies with big smiles on their faces, before looking surprised to see Seteth there as well. Hilda's body was wearing a pink maid outfit with a large bustle under the skirt. While Claude's body was wearing a golden yellow tailored suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Seteth, we weren't expecting you, we were just coming to be take part in the holiday as the maid and butler for Lady Rhea due to the lottery drawing.\" Hilda said, shifting a little to cover his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Rhea wished to discuss something with me, so I stopped by for a bit.\" Seteth answered. Byleth happened to notice Claude discretely looking around, obviously trying to figure out where whatever Byleth was holding the real Rhea in was at, which Byleth had previously take precautions to have her hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've already prepared breakfast for her.\" Claude replied, halting the search to try to keep from seeming too suspicious as she stepped away slightly, and wheeled in a cart with a metal dish cover on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy that.\" Seteth said with a nod. \"That's just what we were talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\" Claude and Hilda questioned flatly, with nervous looks on their faces, as they could swear they saw Rhea's face give a sinister grin for a split second before going back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about it, and as a little gift for the students, that they'd get a taste of the food the person they're serving eats first, both for the eating of delicious food, and because of also playing the role of taste testers as it is a tradition that used to be widely followed in order to make sure the royalty isn't assassinated with poison.\" Both students started sweating nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thank you for this, Lady Rhea-\" Hilda began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-but we both ate already, and couldn't eat another bite.\" Claude finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, <i>I insist</i>.\" Byleth used a more stern tone. The two began to try to find some way out of the situation they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Seteth looked suspiciously at the students. \"Now I'm really concerned, especially since you two are notorious pranksters. I insist as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you Divine Pulse!' Byleth thought smugly.</span></div></div>",

Hilda looked at Claude in her body and he looked at her knowingly. While the effect of the food wasn't immediate, they didn't know exactly how many hours they had before it would take effect. If Hilda's body drank that drink and got sick during the White Heron Cup that could be a disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda stepped up in Claude's body \"sure, we'll test out the food.\" She took a few small bites of the non tampered food before spotting her target, the drink they had prepared. That drink would induce vomiting every few hours for a few days, they had planned to use it to blackmail their professor to swap them back before the cup, but they were outsmarted! She took the drink and took and sip, blech, the after taste was awful. \"Mmm, this tea is delicious, like always Hilda!\" She lied about enjoying it while also praising her own body. She then quickly downed the rest of the bottle, she could feel Claude's stomach grumbling as she finished <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claude!\" Seteth scolded \"Are you so selfish that you would take an entire portion of the archbishop's breakfast for yourself!\" Hilda had no words, it was hard to come up with a lie for this off the top of he2r head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No snappy comeback? Well, perhaps you'll feel like talking after your punishment.\" Seteth continued to scold \"You fellow students will be grateful to you, for now as opposed to a group of students cleaning the stables you can handle that all on your own\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda went pale, clean the entire stables hersel! \"B-but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. In fact, you can start immediately.\" Seteth turned to Byleth \"My apologies Lady Rhea. I shall be right back.\" Seteth marched Hilda out of the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dumbstruck Claude was left there with Byleth as Rhea \"How did you know?\" Was all he could ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth smirked \"Perhaps you're rubbing off on me, if only my lessons rubbed off as well on you.\" Byleth ate some of the non tampered food \"Let me guess, you and Hilda want to be swapped back before the cup and you were going to make me eat something awful as blackmail, right?\" Byleth pretended to guess their plan, knowing full well what it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude gulped \"Yeah, that was the plan\" he told the truth, he had a feeling he would be punished now for what he had planned to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can swap you back right now if you want. Instead of dancing in front of judges you can pick up the dung of horses all day\" Byleth offered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude put up Hilda's hands defensively \"no no no! I'll dance as her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good!\" Byleth said please he had countered their little plan. \"Now then. What should we do about Seteth\" Byleth grinned. Claude's fear began to die down, was the professor saying what he thought he was? \"I told him to come in here and talk as a way to throw you and Hilda off guard, but I didn't want him to punish you so harshly. Maybe we should teach him a lesson\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, uh, how will we do that?\" Claude asked a mix of nervous and excited<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhea's the archbishop Claude, Seteth will do whatever she says with no questions asked. If we just tell him to do something hilarious he will.\" Byleth explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude grinned \"All right, teach! I knew you were cool! So what's your idea?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth thought about what to do, however before he thought of what to make Seteth do, he had an idea \"I'll leave that up to you\" a sudden swap happened \"My lady\" Byleth finished in Hilda's voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude looked down at himself shocked, he was in Archbishop Rhea's body \"P-Professor!\" He said shocked, being in Hilda's body for a few days had made Claude semi-used to being a girl, however Rhea's body was a world different from Hilda's, it was almost overwhelming<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth in Hilda's body hopped onto the Archbishop's bed and continued to eat some of the breakfast they prepared. \"Now go on and prank Seteth, do whatever you want so long as he doesn't get hurt. Just make sure you return here before the Cup so we can swap back.\" Byleth ordered from the bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude grinned mischievously and left the room in Rhea's body. After he left Byleth took note of how he was acting. Sitting down and giving orders like this reminded him of Sothis and how she would treat him</span></div></div>",

Byleth motioned over to Sothis in his body, \"Stand over the fish so I can get a good look at you, I want to be able to do this quick.\"  Sothis agreed with the plan, she didn't seem to want anything bad to happen to Rhea either.  So Byleth stood over the panicking fishy priestess and concentrated on it's flopping body.  Byleth felt himself practically dive into the fish and soon was looking up at Rhea and his body.  Concentrating as quickly as he could, Byleth then focused on his body and sure enough he was floating towards himself and was back in control with Sothis still there in his head.  Everyone was back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth knew he had to try and cover, \"Rhea?  Are you ok...you looked like you almost fainted.  Did you have a bad daydream or something?\"  Byleth could hear Sothis groan at this sorry excuse for a lie in his head, but she wasn't offering any help so he ignored her.  Rhea had a slightly confused look on her before a light shone in her eyes.  \"That was Transferance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...what?\"  Byleth was started that Rhea had used the same term Sothis had for the ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an ability of the Goddess Sothis that hasn't been seen in centuries, and I have seen you use it first hand...and fin.\"  Rhea looked down at the poor fish, who she soon released back into the lake.  She turned back to Byleth and said, \"You can use the Sword of the Creator and also have the power of transference.  I have no doubt you are connected directly to the Goddess, perhaps a reincarnation of sorts.\"  Byleth thought about making a smart aleck remark about not wanting to be the reincarnation of a bratty green haired child, but chose to hold his tongue.  Rhea continued,  \"This isn't how I anticipated seeing Sothis on Earth again...but I accept it.  And I want to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me?  I don't know what you're talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sothis had other powers, abilities that I'm sure I can help you unlock.\"  Rhea said with a smile.  Both Byleth and Sothis were now very interested in what Rhea had to say.  \"Tell me more.\"  Byleth said as Rhea took him to her room over some tea to explain another one of the powers of the Goddess Sothis.</span></div></div>",

A strong warrior one day having the strength of a little girl the next, a beautiful woman who looked like an old man, king's who would be dressed in jester uniforms,\" Rhea went on to explain even more odd things Byleth seemed to understand where she was going with this <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is believed that Sothis had a second power of transference, one that would be unknown to anyone but the user. However there has never been a real way to tell, since other than these anomalies everyone else in the world's memories are rewritten so that transference is how things always were\" Rhea finished explaining this 'Unknown Transference' power <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth was amazed, this was on a completely different level from normal transference, he needed to confirm it with the goddess in his head <i>'Do you really have a power like this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis for her part sounded extremely boastful \"Well it sounds amazing so of course I can do it, after all, no being in the world is as amazing as me\" she clearly had also forgotten about this power and was acting like she knew<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you think I could use this power?\" Byleth asked the archbishop <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea nodded her head \"You must. You keep displaying traits of the goddess Sothis, using another of her poweds shouldn't be beyond your abilities\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth thought about it, amd even if he did have this power now, he didn't know how to use it, and he somehow doubted the forgetful goddess in his head remembered as well <i>'Maybe I could just wing it?

But I'm glad to see you, I'm wanted to say goodbye before I head out?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\"  Byleth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm just off to slay some of the bartenders trying to collect your dad's tabs.  Ha, that was a joke but really does need to stop putting my name on his bills.  Actually I'm going to spend a few weeks away from the monastery to spend some time with my wife and daughter.  I was just stopping by to say farewell to Lady Rhea before I head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you have a good trip.\"  Byleth said, but a rather impulsive thought struck him, why not just test the Unaware Transferance now.  As Alois waved and went to enter Rhea's room, Byleth concentrated on swapping bodies with Alois, but concentrated on the thought of nobody noticing.  The Transference worked differently this time.  Instead of feeling his consciousness fly into the other person's body it was like the reverse.  It was like in a flash he could see Alois's body move toward him.  It was a strange sensation, but as soon as Byleth felt the swap was done, he was standing in the same place in heavy armor now, and Alois was entering Rhea's room with Byleth's body as though nothing strange had just happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It actually worked.\"  Byleth said satis factually.  He gave a celebratory stroke to his new mustache, 'Maybe I should try growing one of these out myself.' Thought to himself, but a familiar sassy child like voice said, \"You'd look absolutely ridiculous with that facial hair on your body.\"  Byleth jumped higher than when Alois was told a scary ghost story.  'I thought you were supposed to stay in my body?'  Byleth though as soon as he gathered himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so too, but I guess with the Unaware Transference, I'm along with you for the ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lucky me.'  Byleth thought, but Sothis detected his sarcasm and fired back with, \"Oh Alois and his wife are the lucky ones now that he's got a body that's about 25 years younger.  I can't believe Alois is going to get your body more experience than you've ever gotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth felt his face turn red with embarisment and annoyance.  He really wished he could put mental earplugs in right now.  But Sothis' being sassy aside, he'd just done a successful Unaware swapping of bodies.  Now that the theory had been proven, he use it again and with purpose.  And as Byleth felt a creek in his new knee as he stepped he thought 'Maybe I'll grab myself a younger body perhaps one of the students.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it hit him, a way he could use this Transference power for practical use.  He'd only been a teacher for a few months and quite frankly he wasn't sure what he was doing.  Sure he could teach the students how to wield a sword well enough, but there were other parts of being a teacher that he wasn't sure how to do exactly.  And what better way to learn, then from Manuela or Hanaman.  He could do an aware swap with one of their students and while the Sothis would teach as him, he could learn as a student how to teach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again that might not help him teach things he wasn't great at, like reason magic for example.  Byleth figured if he did an Unaware swap with a magic user to teach magic class with that body it'd just help the students out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could just cause a little confusion and mayhem like Rhea had talked about and just swap everyone around aware and unaware alike causing chaos.\"  Sothis said, Byleth rolled his eyes and now really understood how that chaos hundred of years ago had happened.</span></div></div>",

Letting his impulse get the better of him, Byleth turned to whatever student he passed and focused for the Transference.  Byleth didn't even know who it was, although judging by the skirt it was definitely a female student.  Byleth flew towards the skirt wearer and after a moment of adjustment, the swap was done.  Byleth turned back to his body where Sothis casually waved to him letting him know the swap went well.  As he looked, he noticed some yellow hair, and there was only one student he knew with such long blonde locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ingrid.\"  Byleth said, and the voice that came form his mouth confirmed it.  He was indeed in the body of a future knight of Faerghus.  Byleth walked back to his body and said, \"All right, I'll go to Professor Hanneman's class and soak in life as a student and hopefully get some good teaching tips and be back in my body before nightfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis rolled Byleth's eyes, \"Oh yes, I'm sure you'll learn all you need to be an amazing teacher from one classroom session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was just hoping to get a pointer or two.\"  Byleth said meekly, he hadn't really thought about or planned being out of his body for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis grinned, \"Come on, live another life for a little while, you're the one who kept talking about being a better teacher and stuff, so go to multiple classes.  Hang out with your students as a student.  It'll probably help you or something like that.\"  Sothis said, but Byleth was a little suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...do you just want to be in control of my body for a while?\"  Byleth questioned the puny (height wise) goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis pouted, \"How dare you question my motives!  I'm just giving you the helpful push you obviously need.  Now you go be a student, I'll go teach and whatever else you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but first let's go over my lesson plan for the Golden Deer.  I want Raphael to focus on reading strategy books, make sure he doesn't nap.  And just because Claude is in Hilda's body doesn't mean I don't want him working on his sword skills.  And as for Ignatz...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!  I know, I was in your head when you planned out your lessons.  Sheesh, go relax in the sauna or something, I've got this.  What could possibly go wrong?\"  Sothis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth thought 'Many things,' but thankfully he didn't share a mind with Sothis so she couldn't read it this time.  \"Fine, but I want a full report after class from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just go!\"  Sothis practically had to start pushing Ingrid's body towards the classroom before Byleth finally started walking to class, interested in what his class as a Blue Lion would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sothis was licking her lips, \"Now, let's see what's in the cafeteria, I don't think I've picked out and tasted my own meal for almost a thousand years.\"<br>\r\n_____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Byleth walked into the Blue Lions classroom he was greeted by a waving Annette who was saving a seat for Ingrid which Byleth took.  Annette looked at Byleth and said, \"You were almost late for class Ingrid, I was starting to get worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to worry you I just...ran into Professor Byleth and we started talking about stuff and I lost track of time.\"  You said telling the truth minus the whole body switching thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, does someone have a crush on the newest professor?  I'm hurt, I thought you only had eyes for me?\"  Sylvain teased from the other side of Annette.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylvain!  No, absolutely not, I do no have a crush on....\"  You started to say coming to yours and Ingrid's defense, but at that moment Professor Hanneman walked into the room.  \"Now class, today we will be looking at the history of the Knights of Faerghus, how their style has changed, and where we can evolve it in the future.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth very eagerly took notes, he made a note he'd have to copy them and slip a copy into his room for later reading.  Hanneman definitely took a more historical and analytical approach to teacher as opposed to his practical and on the field brand of teaching.  After only one lesson Byleth felt he was learning a great deal on different teaching methods, he was so wrapped up in this thought, he almost didn't notice that he had been assigned a homework assignment and a partner.</span></div></div>",

She was enjoying her time in Byleth's body and just because class wqs about to begin didn't mean she couldn't continue enjoying modern sweets. Some students raised an eyebrow at this, however no one objected to it. Every Golden Deer student knew how devoted professor Byleth was to his job, so none of them would criticize him giving himself a treat <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis scannned the class. Good, everyone was in attendance. Even Claude and Hilda were there despite their now swapped bodies. Claude was surprisingly sitting like a lady, Manuela must have been doing a good job with their lessons<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what's the plan for today\" Sothis said aloud and bit into a donut \"Raphael, I need you to start focusing on your strategy books.\" She directed her attention at one student. Sothis made a boast earlier about memorizing the lesson plan, but in truth she hardly knew it at all. She only remembered that part due to Byleth mentioning it earlier \"Okay, Clau- I mean, Hilda. Today you will focus on your sword training\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sothis began giving out instructions for what the students would be doing, she got incredibly bored. Being in Byleth's head while he was teaching was boring, however standing in front of the class without knowing exactly how to teach herself was much more boring <i>'They should learn like Byleth. I tell him to do something and he knows it!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Sothis had an idea, thinking about things she had taught Byleth. If Byleth could use the power of Transference while she was in his head, she should be able to when controlling his body. It was her power after all! In fact, she should be even better at it then him and could swap people without getting involved personally, she was amazing after all. Was her thought process<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to teach, Sothis thought about how Transference could help, in her own point jumping way. Instead of teaching people things why not put people who know those things in their body!

'On one hand, it would be fun and I want to do it.  On the other hand, they're kids and will probably panic and do something dumb leaving me with a mess to clean up.  Plus Byleth will nag at me how irrisponsible I've been.\"  Sothis rolled her eyes thinking about her usual mental roommate and reluctantly did the responsible thing.  Well, at least more responsible than switching everyone in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\"  Sothis said sounding bored and disappointed, \"I want a 3 page essay on the weapon triangle and why it does or doesn't exist.  Except for you Lorenz, you're assignment is to figure out what tea compliments each of these donuts.  As Lorenz eagerly accepted his assignment and everyone got to work, Sothis thought to herself, 'There, I did the boring responsible thing...but that doesn't mean I can't find someone to swap around.'<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the class was over, Byleth immediately went to the library to do Ingrid's homework.  He assigned homework all the time, but since he'd been raised as a mercenary without real schooling he'd never had homework before so he was oddly eager to do it.  But he wasn't in the library alone, Annette and Mercedes were also being responsible students and getting their work over and done with.  Byleth actually breezed through the work.  He already knew most of the subjects covered in the work, but Hanneman had done a good job of explain it in an easy to understand way.  Once he finished up and began packing Mercede's politely raised her hand and called out, \"Ingrid!  If you're already done, would you mind helping us out a little, we've having trouble with the mapped out question near the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth being a good teacher and almost inadvertently a good friend agreed to help the girls out and explained the strategies Hanneman was teaching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, we finished all that much quicker than I thought.\"  Annette said happily, \"Thanks Ingrid, oh and I know just how to repay you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't have to do such a thing.\"  Byleth tried to say, but Annette was having none of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember how the other day you were saying you might start wearing some makeup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't recall.\"  Byleth said honestly, after all this must have been a conversation between Annette and the real Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking since we don't have any work to do, we could have ourselves a girls night!  We can all stay in my room, experiment with different makeups and maybe if we're feeling naughty,\"  Annette looked around to make sure nobody was listening as she whispered, \"We might even sneak into the kitchen and make some sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\"  Mercedes said as though she'd never heard Annette say something so scandalous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds fun but...\"  Byleth said trying to think of an excuse to get out of this and preferably back to his body, but Annette had none of it.  She grabbed Ingrid's arm with surprising strength and said, \"Come on, let's go!\"  And the two girls and lead Byleth to his first ever sleepover.</span></div></div>",

Since she knew Byleth would never stop bugging her if she just swapper his students around all willy nilly, Sothis decided to take her frustrations out on those Byleth didn't care much for.  And it just happens there was a bandit camp that had just been seen outside of the monastery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis under the cloak of night snuck past the Garreg Moch guards and made her way on foot to a small encampment about a mile away.  As Sothis peaked through the bushes she saw an almost familiar face.  The leader of the bandits was Kostas, the bandit who months ago had tried to kill Claude, Edelgard, and Dimitri and inadvertently awakened Sothis's divine pulse.  Sothis thought that Byleth had killed Kostas once and for all a few months later, but it seemed he'd somehow survived again and was building a bandit army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKostas stood in front of his bandit warriors and spoke, \"We've been taken advantage of for too long.  The empire, the church, everyone tries to use us and throws us away because we're just a bunch of swords and axes!  But no more!  We're more than that!  Because now...we've got magic users!\"  Kostas pointed out a few female mages who were in the camp as well.  They were very mean looking ladies who didn't seem to be know how to smile or enjoy anything Sothis noted.  And with a smile on her face Sothis thought, 'Maybe I should give their bodies to someone who would appreciate it...who am I kidding, I'm just gonna swap the losers around for the hell of it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first Sothis wanted to make a show of it, after all, Sothis thought it was more fun if her victims know who was about to devastate them.  Putting on her best Byleth stone face, Sothis stepped out so the bands campfire shone on her.  Kostas was the first to notice.  \"Its you!  The mercenary with the creepy face!  Oh, it's so nice of you to come here so I don't have to bother looking for you.  Everyone!  ATTACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits raised their swords and axes and the mages in the company opened their spell books.  If Sothis was as slow with Transferance as Byleth was this could be a tricky situation, but in the a matter of seconds Sothis was doing her work.  Without even having to leave Byleth's body she jumbled people around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to my sword?\"  \"Why am I holding a damned axe?\"  \"Ah!  Why-why am I a man brute?\"  Instead of fighting questions and confusion reigned supreme.  Everyone was unable to get a grasp on what had happened.  Some of the horses were freaking out, mainly because they had been human seconds beforehand.  A few barbarians dropped down to all fours and began eating grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally one fo the female mages tried to shout down everyone, \"It's EVIL MAGIC!  It's the stone faced kid!  I'm still in charge and I don't care if I have a book or my axe!  Kill him!\"  The mage who had formally been Kostas tried his hand at magic.  Not a brilliant move for the bandit.  As soon as he opened the book and poorly began to read a spell, a fireball exploded knocking the new 'her' out along with a dozen others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis didn't even need to raise Byleth's sword, she just looked at the chaos and walked away with a smile, very proud of the job she'd done.</span></div></div>",

He was tempted to go back to sleep for 5 more minutes, however his brain suddenly went into professor mode <i>Wait a minute. If the sun is high enough to come through the window, then that means.......it's nearly afternoon!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth couldn't believe what was happening as he rushed to change out of Ingrid's pajamas and into her school uniform. How could he possibly sleep in on his first day as a student? He was never one to sleep in normally, the mercenaries would wake up at dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been from staying up late being taught about make up from Mercedes and Annette, or from staying up even later to try and get some midnight snacks, or staying up even later getting lectured for what felt like after being caught by Hanneman <i>'How long did I even sleep for?'</i> Byleth wondered to himself, Ingrid's body felt completelt exhausted right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of you to join us, Ingrid\" Hanneman said as Byleth entered the room, the eyes of the class were on the late student. Byleth saw Annette had once again saved a seat for him, however unlike yesterday where she eagerly waved to him, she looked equally exhausted. Byleth sat next to her without a word<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't get much sleep, huh?\" Sylvain whispered and initiated a conversation from the seat in front of Byleth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell?\" Byelth whispered back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, either that or you completely forgot what a hairbrush is\" Sylvain snicked at the comment he made at who he thought was his childhood friend. Byleth realized he had forgotten to put my care into Ingrid's hair. He always had relatively short hair that needed only a few brushes, Ingrid's however was much longer and needed more care<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Byleth could come up with a retort Hanneman addressed the class again. \"Okay Class, please have your homework out on your desk. Dedue, please collect your fellow students work.\" Hanneman instructed the class. Byleth breathed a sighed of relief, thankfully he had finished all of his homework before the sleepover last night. Hearing the sound of the page of homework being filled out next to him, Annette wasn't as lucky <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the homework was collected, Hanneman addressed the class again \"Good, now while I grade these I want all of you to open your textbooks to chapter 15, Crests and how they effect modern social structure. Oh, and Ingrid, Annette, Mercedes. I want the three of you to write an essay on the chapter as your fellow students read it\" Hanneman delt out punishment for the three being caught last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette and Ingrid groaned, however Byleth was grateful for how light the punishment actually was. If he caught Claude and Hilda sneaking out of their rooms after dark he would make them run a lap around the monastery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the students read the chapter, Annette and Byleth heard a sound call to them \"Psst.\" They turned to the source of the sound, Mercedes \"You two are exhausted right? Here\" she snuck two sweets between her desk and theirs. \"It won't do much, but getting some sugar in your system will help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth and Annette thanked Mercedes, however although the sweets helped him stay up while reading the chapter, by the time he had to write the essay Hanneman had assigned them he felt like passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And done.\" He heard Mercedes say next to him. She had finished her essay already! Byleth was shocked, however then he noticed that Mercedes didn't seem as tired as him and Annette at all. He wondered why briefly then realized why. While he and Annette had back to Annette's room after being caught, Mercedes headed back to her own room after that. That extra hour of sleep must have made the difference<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Byleth nearly fell asleep writing the essay, he wondered if he should use Transference to help. Ingrid's body was way too exhausted to work on this, and he doubted that he would be able to stay up afterward when Hanneman went on another lecture. Looking at Mercedes, he wondered if he should unaware swap with her for now. She didn't look like she would pass out exhausted anytime soon like him and Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, Byleth chose to</span></div></div>",

Byleth said giving himself a little pep talk since Sothis wasn't there to support him...or make fun of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth again looked towards Mercedes and tried to focus on doing an Unaware Transference.  But it seemed Byleth had done something wrong in his rush to swap out of his exhaustion.  Because as soon as Byleth felt the strange divine magic begin to work around him, he instantly knew he had screwed up somehow.  He was definitely not in Mercede's Unaware swapped bodies as he had planned.</span></div></div>",

Byleth tried to ignore it, but he was highly irritable right now <i>'If that fly gets near me it's dead'</i> was his last thought to himself before the magic had activated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth knew this feeling, it was the same as when he had swapped with the fish yesterday, the feeling of no longer being human. Instead of sitting in the chair of the desk, he was now standing on the desk on 6 spindly legs. He felt a pair of wings on his back, he knew that the worst had happened. He had swapped with the fly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision was completely distorted, even more so than as the fish. When he was the fish the only reason he couldn't see was the water, the fly had a completely different set of eyes than a human being! He was seeing in what felt like a million directions at once! How would swapping back even work with his focus in so many directions at once? Being this creature disgusted him, Byleth wasn't one for hating bugs or anything, but becoming a creature this seperate in biology from a human being was unbearable <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, if he was the fly, did that mean? Oh no! He moved his entire fly body to face where the fly had last been seen. He saw Ingrid's body try to yank the bag of sweets away from Mercedes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth could do nothing but watch what happened next. Mercedes slapped Ingrid's body, from her point of view it was just a fly after all. Ingrid's body reacted in fear and began running around the room in a panic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now extremely loud fly caught professor Hanneman's attention. \"Would someone please open a window\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'No!'</i> Byleth thought to himself, but he couldn't rreact in time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it!\" Ashe said and opened the nearest window to him. The Ingrid-fly took this opportunity to jump out. Thankfully they were on ground level so the worst case scenario was avoided, but Byleth still had to watch as a student's body ran off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to go after her, it, Ingrid's body! He looked around, everyone was either paying attention to their work or distracted bt something else. Byleth began to fly out of Ingrid's seat, something that came as second nature to him, swapping into the fly's body somehow gave him knowledge on how to move in it, he wondered if the same had happened with the fishes body. He wasn't eager to swap with more animals and test this hypothesis however<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tiny body had at least one advantage, as he flew out the window no one took notice of him, tbey probably hadn't even seen that 'Ingrid' was leaving class. He needed to hurry however, they might not have noticed now, but once Hanneman finished grading homework there was no way he wouldn't be caught<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside Byelth flew around and searched for the fly Ingrid. Thankfully the fly had left a trail of muddy footprints after it jumped out the window. Byleth followed them, leading him toward</span></div></div>",

Kostas continued, \"We're gonna go in their, destroy everything they love and bzzzzz bzzz bzzzz bzzzzzzz!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of bandits didn't even miss a beat as they cheered for their bandit leader who they didn't even seem to notice or care now had the body of a fly.  Unfortunately for Byleth, they did notice a female mage appear in a corner where there used to just be a fly.  A few heads turned and looked at female mage Byleth and said, \"There!

So Byleth cast a lightning bolt into the crowd as a distraction and ran to the horse where the fly in Ingrid's body was sitting enjoying the smells.  Byleth hopped on and after a clutch unaware swap, now had Ingrid's body again leaving the fly with the random female mage.  Byleth kicked the horse (who Byleth didn't know was another swapped bandit thanks to Sothis) and the horse thankfully began to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  She's kidnapping Bertha!\"  One of the bandit's said.  \"Huh, that's an odd name for a horse, but whatever, let's ride Bertha!  To Garreg Moch!\"  And with some forcful leading, Byleth directed the horse back into the monastery's grounds.  Byleth was so distracted, he didn't even notice the fly was still riding with him holding onto Ingrid's waist.  As Byleth dropped Bertha off at the stables, \"You weren't bad, maybe I'll make you my regular mount.\"  Byleth said and the bandit turned horse just snorted in fear and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth turned to deal with the fly mage girl, but she was already gone when he turned, Byleth sighed, it had been a long day and didn't think this was worth dealing with, what trouble could a fly mage cause?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth breathed a sigh of relief, he'd managed to salvage an almost disastrous situation and got out of it with close to minimal damage, he'd only missed half a day of classes and had swapped a bandit with fly which he wasn't going to lose sleep over.

Byleth did his best to look upset, a difficult task since Byleth wasn't exactly Mr. Emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fake sniffle Byleth said, \"You see, just before class I'd heard by precious horse Bertha who I've grown attached to had slipped out of the stables and run off into the woods.  And I just couldn't bare the thought of waiting another minute until class.  I just had to leave right then and their, I'd already wasted enough time debating what to do.  Thank the Goddess I managed to find her before some bandits found her.\"  Byleth dug Ingred's nails into his flesh to try and force out a tear to get more sympathy.  Hanneman looked down at Byleth with a stern look before he finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingrid, while I admire you dedication to those you care about, it was still very foolish.  You could have alerted the guard and I'm sure they would have been willing to look for your Bertha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't it a knights duty to protect his steed?\"  Byleth said remembering Ingrid's obsession with knighthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it's also a knight's duty to know their responsibilities and how to rely on others when necessary.  Do you understand?\"  Hanneman sounded both stern and caring, Byleth was very impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\"  Byleth said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dismissed, but don't forget that extra work.\"  Hanneman said with an encouraging smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be done before class starts sir.\"  Byleth said and the two parted ways.  Byleth gave a fist pump in celebration of his fib actually working.  Sure he had homework to do and because of that he couldn't swap back for at least another day, but he was learning a great deal from Hanneman.  If Byleth had been in the exact same situation he'd have probably stared down a student until he got the truth or made them run laps around the monastery.  Sure he lied to him, but maybe it's not a bad thing to let a student lie everyone once in a while.  But tomorrow was going to be a fun day once all the homework was out of the way.  It was the day of the White Heron Cup, and Byleth was looking forward to enjoying the festivities as a student with no responsibilities.  As he entered Ingrid's room for the evening to start on that homework he chuckled to himself, \"I wonder how Claude's going to do dancing as Hilda tomorrow?\"</span></div></div>",

While 'Byleth's' behavior was a bit odd the past few days, it wasn't nearly odd enough that the two suspected the person in front of thek wasn't their proffesor. Sothis could actually do a decent Byleth impression when she felt like it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude and Hilda explained the situation to Sothis. She gave a nod and a smile, almost like she was hoping they would as for their help. \"Alright. I have a plan.\" Sothis said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A plan?\" Claude asked, wondering what his professor could possibly mean<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you can't dance well enough to beat Dorothea at the cup, all we need to do is even the playing field.\" Sothid gave a sinister smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-even the playing field?\" Hilda asked, what could her Professor mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll see. So, do you two want my help?\" Sothis offered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude and Hilda whispered amongst themselves. The proffesor wouldn't do anything too drastic right? Sure he would occasionally do something like how the other day he swapped the two of them, but he was a very restrained person. He wouldn't do anything too bad \"Alright, sure.

Byleth was clearly flustered and trying to come up with an answer from his body.

Plus the school might do something crazy and delay the Cup if such a thing occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen of course Sothis thought of unaware swapping Dorethea with someone with a...less graceful body through the Unaware Transference.  But Sothis paid enough attention to the students to know Dorethea was a former professional performer and even if she gotten the body of Raphael or a horse she'd probably still be the betting favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, there was only one sure fire way she could make sure Dorethea lost and still not give herself away.  So, Sothis did the responsible thing and went to bed.  Or at least Byleth's body went to bed, Sothis was a Goddess and had no need for sleep.  Hell, since she had awakened and practiced the Transference powers she'd figured she could literally do this in her sleep.  So with Byleth's body nice and unconscious for Dorethea to be put into without suspicion, Sothis did the swap and was standing in front of the panel of judges.  Looking down Sothis realized she was wearing an elaborate costume probably from Dorethea's closet and was being told by Alois, \"Black Eagle's house representative Dorethea, you may begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd begin she did, Sothis began to flail about like a mad little child.  In her 'dance' she even managed to kick and smack a few students and teacher.  Eventually time ran out and Dorethea was disqualified for flipping the judges table on the judges.  With her job done, she gave a nod to the surprised Claude and Hilda who couldn't believe 'Byleth' would do such a thing.<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude and Hilda were at least right about that.  Byleth wouldn't do that, and if he'd been there he probably would have tried to stop it.  But he had his own problems.  He'd been asked out by a male student and was trying to figure out what to do about it.  His first instinct was to turn the guy down, but Byleth didn't think that he opinion mattered in this situation, it was Ingrid's.  And Byleth was having an internal debate over whether he should actually accept the date for Ingrid.  For all he knew Ingrid might want to go out with this guy, after all Byleth was just in her body, not her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe that was the solution, Byleth had spent enough time as Ingrid to get a good idea how student life was and how he could improve as a teacher, maybe it was time to try and swap back with Ingrid and let her decide if she wanted to date this guy.</span></div></div>",

I don't want to ruin, or start, anyone's love lives\" he said and resolved not to be in any student bodies until after the ball <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way back to where the dances were being held, Byleth couldn't help but smile and clap as 'Hilda' was surrounded by Golden Deer students, all congratulating 'her' for winning. <i>'Looks like those lessons paid off'</i> he thought to himself, completely unaware of Sothis' interference<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis herself was currently wandering around in Dorothea's body. She knew if she swapped back into Byleth's body now she'd probably have to do some teacher work, which the goddess had learned she was not very fond of. Enjoying the current festivities as a student could be enjoyable<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth looked around the room for his body, but caught no sight of it. Sothis must habe wandered off was his thought process. He sighed, he wanted out of Ingrid's body right now. He walked off and began to make his way to his room, assuming Sothis would be slacking off in there. Along the way, a certain thought slipped into Byleth's mind <i>'What if she breaks Ignatz heart?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had accepted the date as Ingrid to avoid hurting Ignatz feelings, but if he shows up for the ball tommorow and she rejects him then, that could be more devastating. Byleth bit Ingrid's lip. Maybe he should stay as her for one more day? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just one dance, right? He could just go as Ingrid, swap back the next day, and maybe forget it ever happened. Sure Ingrid would have to deal with the aftermath, but that would be preferable to having one of his student's feelings hurt at the worst time. Giving it some final thought Byleth chose to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Byleth was just giving himself a headache going back and forth on the pros and cons of switching back with Ingrid and the many consequences it would have for himself, Ingrid, and now Ignatz.  Finally Byleth decided it would be for the best if he stayed as Ingrid through the ball.  After all, he's the one who had accepted the date, he was the one who should go through with it.  But it wasn't just that.  Byleth growing up had never had to deal with love advice.  The closed he got was the birds and the bees talk from Geralt when Byleth turned 13 and not much more than that.  And his experience as a student with Hanneman had taught him teaching wasn't just about knowing school materials and dealing out punishments.  He had to really know how to help his students.  He couldn't just keep telling his students to go hunt bandits and run laps when something was going wrong.  He needed to give actual advice from his not beating heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if going out with Ignatz as Ingrid could give him more insight he'd do it for the sake of his students.  No matter how weird and crazy an idea as this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Byleth walked his way he ran into a flustered Annette, \"Is something wrong?\"  Byleth asked and the blushing Annette said, \"Yes!  Well, no, but...it's complicated.  You see, when I was cooking up some sweets in the kitchen, since I was on my own I decided to make up some songs and sing them to myself.  But Felix overheard me and then he...he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he make fun of you?  Do I need to do something about him?\"  Byleth said clinching Ingrid's fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Well, I don't think he was making fun of me...but he asked me to the Ball tomorrow....and I accepted.\"  Annette seemed like she wasn't sure if she was excited or scared about this.  <i>'Well, I'm not the only one unsure how to feel about dating at school.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to make Annette feel a bitt more connected, Byleth said, \"What a coincidence, Ignatz just asked me to the Ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He actually asked you out!  Wow!  And what did you say!\"  Annette said eagerly all nerves about her own date pushed aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I said yes.\"  Byleth said meekly and Annette squealed.  \"Oh my Goddess!  This is amazing!  First thing tomorrow morning we need to start getting ready for the Ball.  I want you to meet me in my bedroom at 8 in the morning, we've got to work on finding the perfect dress, the perfect hair and makeup to go with the dress, and the best accessories!  Oh this is going to take all day if we're going to make it in time for the Ball!  I'd better go draw up a battle plan and schedule for tomorrow.  I'll see you bright and early Ingrid!\"  Annette cheered as she ran off leaving Byleth stunned at what just happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize dating was so complicated.\"  Byleth said feeling a little overwhelmed, but at least he knew what he'd be doing tomorrow, whatever Annette said.  \"Well, I guess it makes sense that with the dance around the corner love is in the air.\"  Byleth said making his way to Ingrid's room to get a good nights sleep before tomorrows big day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning Byleth was in Annette's room, having his hair brushed as Annette gushed about Byleth's upcoming date. Byleth himself was stiff as a board, he had never gone on what he would call a date before, and going on one while needing to also pretend to be someone else seemed like an impossible task<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette took note of her friend's nervousness, but completely misinterpreted the meaning behind it \"It'll be fiiiine, you and Ignatz are perfect for each other!\" She said as she finished brushing Byleth's long, blonde, hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now Byleth wanted to take his mind off of his own upcoming date, so he changed the focus of the conversation \"What about you Annette? Are you looking forward to your date with Felix\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stiff expression Byleth had a moment ago now took place in Annette as she tried to articulate her answer \"Well, he's nice, and I'm sure if we hung out more I'd like him more, but right now I feel like I'm going to the ball with someone I hardly know. \" She said shyly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth tried to think of something to say to comfort her \"I'm sure you'll have a great time. Felix is a great guy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette just nodded \"Yeah, I'm going in as optimistic as I can! But if he takes me over to the goddess tower I'll probably ditch the ball completely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth's face paled. How could he forget the goddess tower. Couples would meet at the goddess tower and confess their true feelings to one another, what would he do if Ignatz did something like that? Accepting the date while in Ingrid's body already felt like too much, experincing a confession for her would be going miles over the line<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to avoid panicking, Byleth just put those thoughts to the back of his mind, surely Ignatz wouldn't take Ingrid to the goddess tower, right? He gulped at the possibility<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Byleth and Annette were in matching yellow and orange dresses, Byelth felt weird wearing it, however the past few days had adjusted him to wearing girl's clothing. The sheer amount of makeup that Ingrid has applied to his face however would be impossible to get used to<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made their way to the mall, where Byleth's date was waiting for \"him\" Ignatz was wearing a nice suit, however he somehow looked even more nervous about this than even Byleth. The beginning of the ball was rather uneventful for Byleth, he danced with Ignatz however the two of them hardly had any conversation due to their combined nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth looked around the room, strange, where was his body? Had Sothis decided not to come? \"She's probably in the kitchen or something\" he said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----An hour ago-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, blue isn't really your color\" Sothis said from Dorothea's body. She had chosen to wear a blue dress to the ball in a shade that resembled the one she usually wore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Dorothea in Byleth's body was tied to a chair with socks stuffed in her mouth. \"MMMM. MMMM. MMMM\" She tried to argue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry kid, but I really don't want to do boring teacher work today. Enjoying two festivals two days in a row is the type of pamperment I deserve.\" Sothis said, however Dorothea was unable to respond<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----The present-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand had a hand on his cheek as he sat at a table, he was clearly disappointed. Dorothea had asked him to the ball two days ago, but now that they were here she was hardly paying attention to him. In fact she wasn't acting like she usually did at all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis was on the dance floor alone, she had no interest in anyone at the monastery so she made no effort to fulfill Dorothea's own romantic obligations. She was here to enjoy herself and no one would stop her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon in the corner of her eye, she caught sight of Byleth dancing with Ignatz. Both of them were clearly nervous around the other and didn't seem to be havinf a great time. She then looked next to them, Annette and Felix were also dancing and although Felix seemed to be enjoying it,  Annette didn't seem to feel the same way, and kept glancing over to Byelth \"Maybe I can....help them out a little bit\" Sothis snickered</span></div></div>",

The two of them had their arms as far apart from each other as possible and were hardly touching. Sothis has been watching them for quite a while and it had been several minutes since the two of them even spoke to each other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess couldn\u2019t bear the sight anymore, she decided to help out, in her own special way. Using her more powerful transference she performed and award swap between Ignatz and Annette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Ignatz was no longer looking at Ingrid\u2019s beautiful face, but at Felix! Something felt off, in fact everything felt off! Looking down he saw an impossible sight, he was now a wearing a dress, and clad in that dress was a girl\u2019s body! \u201cW-what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noticed the shocked look on his date\u2019s face \u201cis something wrong, Annette?\u201d He asked with concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, uh, yes, er, no, I mean\u201d ignatz struggled to articulate the right words, what could he say? That he wasn\u2019t actually Annette and he was actually someone else? He\u2019d sound completely crazy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d was all he could really say, he began dancing with Felix and hoping Annette would speak up and save him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette for her part was equally shocked. One moment she wasn\u2019t enjoying her night at the ball, the next she was dancing with one of her friends! She looked down at herself and it was clear what had happened. She had somehow ended up in Ignatz\u2019s body. She glanced over at her own body and saw it dancing with Felix, but much more nervous than she had been dancing before. He must be in her body too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette was considering going over to her body to talk with Ignatz, however as her hands grasped Ingrid\u2019s she had another idea, Ingrid seemed to not be having a good time at the dance either, but that was not because of her date but rather how nervous both she and Ignatz were. Annette decided to make this night more enjoyable for her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth\u2019s eyes got wide as suddenly \u2018Ignatz\u2019 brought them closer together, he began leading their dance with much more confidence than before. Byleth chalked that up to giving him enough time to gain confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance Sothis smirked at her work</span></div></div>",

Every once and a while he'd glance at Annette in his Boyd dancing with Ingrid just waiting for Annette to freak out like him and come save him.  But that wasn't happening.  What's more, Annette was getting more and more comfortable dancing with his date.  The two weren't awkwardly far apart like he was, they were dancing practically cheek to cheek.  'Annette makes a better me than me.'  Ignatz thought as he began to feel overwhelmed.  Everything was wrong, but nobody noticed and it was scaring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the song was over Ignatz said, \"I'm sorry.\" and just ran away from Felix.  He didn't get more than a step away though as he tripped on Annette's heel.  Luckily Felix had some of the best reflexes in the academy and caught Ignatz who was looking up at Felix while wrapped in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok Annette?\"  Felix asked.  Ignatz felt tears welling up, \"No, everything is wrong right now.\"  And kicking off his heels first, Ignatz ran off.  Felix let 'Annette' get a few steps ahead to cool off, but still chased after her.  The actual Annette in the meanwhile didn't even notice this.  She found she was lost in the moment dancing with 'Ingrid'.<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix finally found 'Annette' outside of the Goddess Tower, she looked like she was crying.  Felix sighed, \"I don't understand you.  You always seem to have this crazy bottled up energy you get out in the most absurd ways, but when this ball comes around, a time you're supposed to be having fun and letting that energy out you choose to run off on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz didn't even bother looking up at Felix, \"I really don't want to talk right now, you wouldn't understand.  I mean, I don't even understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least we agree on something.  You're being impractical and silly, you made yourself up so you obviously care some about this, but you just toss aside your shoes and you're crying and ruining that makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not silly, none of this is silly!\"  Ignatz said getting a bit unhinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was my dancing that bad?\"  Felix asked.  Ignatz just stared confused, \"Are you making fun of me?  This about more than dancing...but you weren't a bad dancer.  You're better than me at it.\"  Ignatz said calming down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like I can teach you.  Ballroom dancing was a part of my training growing up, and I was actually pretty good at it.  Don't tell Ingrid or Sylvain that, they'll never let me hear the end of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  I never would have thought you a dancer, you always only seemed to care about fighting people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dancing is good excersize and an excellent way to improve your footwork, hear, let me show you.\"  Felix took Ignatz's hand and helped him up.  Felix put 'Annettte's hand on his shoulder and put his hand on Ignatz's lower back and held their bodies together.  \"You have to move as one, otherwise we trip each other up and it's curtains for us on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 'curtains' for us?\"  Ignatz giggled at the odd turn of phrase, \"I think I've only read that in books on knighthood from when I was a little kid.\"  Felix groaned and continued his dance lesson.  Even though Ignatz was in the middle of a potential personal crisis, Felix's pressense seemed to calm him down.  As he danced for a minute he even forgot he was in the wrong body.  Everything just oddly felt right dancing with Felix.</span></div></div>",

He was having a much better time than when he was dancing with Ingrid, when with her earlier is was hardly dancing from their combined nervousness, which Ignatz blamed himself for. However right now with Felix taking the lead they danced wonderfully, well, from an outsider's perspective it wasn't that good, however from Ignatz perspective it was the one good part of the evening<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the dance came to an end. Ingatz was once again looking up at Felix, the moonlight and the goddess tower in view. What happened next wasn't something Ignatz could explain. Perhaps it was just because he sas following the mood? Maybe it was just the goddess tower in his mind? Maybe it was even Annette's body subconsciously influencing him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason, Ignatz pulled himself closer to Felix and gave him a kiss. After a second of kissing however Ignatz quickly pulled himself away. What had he just done? He kissed someone in another person's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears that had subsided began to well up again \"I'm sorry\" Ignatz said, Felix was the only one around to hear him say sorry but he was actually apologizing to Annette's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix for his part sighed \"You had finally cheered up and now you're back to crying again after a kiss? Are most people not overjoyed after their first kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a poor choice of words to tell Ignatz right now. First kiss? That must have been Annette's first and he just had it for her! It was also his first, but he was too busy thinking negatively about himself to think about that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed again and pulled out a handkerchief to wipe 'Annette's' tears. He looked at the goddess tower and figured he should say something. However he was completely out of his field when thinking about what to say, he much devoted his time to training and very little to the heart \"Annette, they say people come to this tower to take a pledge. Childish I know....but if it were true. Let's make a pledge to the goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz was awestruck, was Felix actually making a pledge at the goddess tower to him? Even if he was someone else right now Ignatz felt overjoyed \"Yes!\" Before Felix could speak any more Ignatz brought him into a hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two pledged themselves to one another, Sothis watched from a distance, satisfied with herself. Helping people out with 'small' problems like this felt better than she expected<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding further behind her was Ferdinand Von Aeger. He had a sour night at the ball, didn't even get to dance with the girl who asked him out once! Well he was determined to salvage this night. He walked up to 'Dorothea' and began to make his request \"Once they're done how about you and I take our turn?\" He said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis was just annoyed. She hadn't come to the ball to deal with Dorothea's actual life. Yet here she was being bothered for what felt like the 5th time \"Fine. You can take Dorothea to the goddess tower\" Sothis said and perfomed another Transference, putting herself in Ferdinand's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ferdinand was dumbstruck and grabbing at his new body Sothis walked off. Helping people out made her feel good, but her usual brand of mischief made her feel great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth for his part was also having a much better time than before. Once he and 'Ignatz' finished their dance, they began to talk. He was surprised at how energetic he seemed right now. As Ignatz's teacher the boy always came off as extremely shy and would apologize over the smallest things. Was this because the date? Had being around a girl he liked given him an extra confidence boost?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette for her part was having a much different night than expected, but she was still enjoying it. She had planned to mention the body swap after the dance had ended, but her own body had run off. She didn't want to bring it up without her own body around to confirm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she was in any rush to find it, while the beginning of her evening was awkward and she didn't know how much she would even enjoy being with Felix, now she was able to spend most of the night talking with one of her friends and dancing with her. Even if it was from a boy's body <i>'I wonder if I can fluster her a little'</i> Annette giggled to herself </span></div></div>",

My heart never beat like this.  Is it just Ingrid's body?  Does this mean Ingrid actually does like Ignatz like this?</i>. After all the dancing with Ignatz and now with the hand holding, Byleth had to admit that there was definitely a spark there, and he didn't want to be the one to put it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing his body and heart, Byleth managed to scoot even closer to Annette and put his head into Annette's chest, it felt comforting.  It felt like a warm hug from a friend and Byleth just wanted to stay there a little while longer.  Annette was surprised Ingrid was going this far, but had to admit, she kind of liked the feeling.  Before she knew what she was doing, she lifted Ingrid's head up and kissed her.  It was soft and sweet but as Byleth and Annette's minds took back control they suddenly backed away from each other at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm sorry, I've got to go.\"  Annette said while running off feeling a whole lot of confusion over what just happened and Byleth sat on the bench stunned, \"What the heck just happened?\"  Byleth said as he put his head in Ingrid's hands.<br>\r\n______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the kitchens of the monastery, Ferdinand was in a bit of state.  By what he could only assume was the power of the goddess (and he wasn't wrong), he'd somehow ended up in Dorethea's body.  His body had just walked off as though nothing was wrong leaving Ferdinand very confused.  So he did what he always did when he needed to calm down.  He brewed himself some tea.  As the leaves finished flavoring the hot water Ferdinand began to pour and the kitchen door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I thought I smelled a Bergamot tea being brewed but wouldn't have dreamed it be made by you Dorathea.\"  Lorenz said entering the kitchen.  Ferdinand von Ayer being the polite noble he was stood to greet Lorenz.  Just because he wasn't in his own body didn't mean he should forgo manners after all.  \"Yes, I felt the need to calm down after an...eventful evening and Bergamot is one of the best brews for such an occasion.\"  Ferdinand said deciding it best not to just announce the he had somehow ended up in Dorathea's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenz smiled and nodded, \"I quite agree, I must say I had a rather stressful night myself.  It seems Hilda has been spending too much time with that Claude, she's begun to take on some of his reckless mannerisms and when I asked her to spend time with me instead of him she turned me down, can you imagine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can not.\"  Ferdinand said, \"But nothing can mend a broken heart quite like a good tea, shall I pour you a cup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be honored Dorathea.\"  Lorenz said as he sat down for a glass.</span></div></div>",

MMMMM MMMM!\" Dorothea had been shouting for hours tied to a chair by Sothis. However finally her struggles had begun to bear fruit, as the ropes around her arms loosened. Once she got arms free she unbound her legs and mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was furious. She had just spent 2 days stuck in Professor Byelth's body while who she presumed was Byleth was off doing goddess knows what in her body. She stomped off in his body, she had no idea what to do about this, but she had a good idea of who would: Archbishop Rhea<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside Dorothea quickly found the archbishop, who appeared to be in the middle of singing or something. Too furious to care what someone else was currently doing, Dorothea went over and interrupted her \"Lady Rhea! There's an emergency!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea seemed to have some slight annoyance about being interrupted, however if there was an emergency it couldn't be helped. \"What's wrong, Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! I'm not professor Byelth, I'm just in his body!\" Dorothea whined, tears welling up \"I don't know how to prove it, but you need to believe me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Rhea of coursw believed her, after all, she was completely aware of the power of Transference now. She had no care if Byleth were to use such a power to defend the monastery, however using it on students crossed a line. \"Come. We'll handle this together, um...\" Rhea realized she hadn't gotten the name of whoever was Byelth now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dorothea Arnault, my lady\" Dorothea gave her name<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, follow me and we shall get your body back\" Rhea walked off with Dorothea in close pursuit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long for them to find Dorothea's body. It was leaving the kitchen when they walked by. Dorothea practically ran to confront who she thought was Byleth \"YOU! HOW DARE YOU?!\" She yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand was afraid, he had never seen any professor this angry before, let alone the stone faced Byleth \"W-W-what are you talking about?\" He stammered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking my body, tying me to a chair for days?! How could you stoop so low professor! My beauty won't last forever and you would take it from me?!\" Dorothea went into a rant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand began to put two and two together. \"Dorothea???\" He gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me you body stealing fiend!\" Dorothea shouted again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand! I'm not the one who took you body! I only just ended up in yours!\" Ferdinand defended himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea sighed at the sight in front of her, clearly another student was caught up in Byleth's transference joyride \"Tell us who you are, we shall get you sorted back into your own body right away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Ferdinand Von Aeger\" Ferdinand proudly said his own name from Dorothea's body <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance Sothis watched from around a corner. Drat, they had gotten the Archbishop involved. Byleth, and by extension her were in serious trouble now. Sothis tried to think of a way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would be searching for Ferdinand's body now to find her. She could jump to another body to throw them off, but that would leave a trail. She thought about rapidly swapping bodies with a ton of people, of she left a confusing enough trail maybe they wouldn't find her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be the most complicated solution, Sothis also considered just taking the Archbishop out of the picture altogether for a while. With her more powerful Transference she could easily put Rhea into a situation where she woupd be unable to punish her, at least until Byleth was in charge of his body again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing the power of Transference, Sothis....</span></div></div>",

The group of people now back in the proper bodies went their separate ways.  Marianne took Dorathea to the quiet stables since there were so many people outside of her room.

I guess maybe it's time I did what I probably should have done a long time ago and swapped back and give Ingrid her body back.  It's going to be a long apology and explanation, and I don't know if she'll forgive me, but it's time for the truth.  This way I can face my punishment with Rhea tomorrow with no regrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis had to admit she admired that Byleth was actually willing to face the consequences instead of run away, but this annoyed Sothis too.

The goddess had never used it before and even she had to admit she wasn't completely certain what would happen to her and Byleth if she used it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she had treated him rudely most of the time, Sothis had an admiration of Byelth and didn't want him to deal with the consequences of what she had done. However, she knew if Byleth were told about this power he would refuse to let her use it. So she didn't ask permission, this wasn't mischief, this was the goddess trying to help her best friend in her own special way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the goddess used this new power, she felt the current world fade away, and her vision got dark, like she was going to take a long nap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Ingrid woke up to the rising of the sun. \"Oh shoot, I'm going to be late!\" She said as she began to go through her morning routine.

Once she was ready for the day she rushed to class, carrying many papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the classroom, the entire class was there before her \"Sorry I'm late again everyone\" she said with the memory of being late for class two days ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, teach! We can do just fine without an extra five minutes of your nagging!\" Claude gave a thumbs up, finally back to his own body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid gave a glare \"Just for that you can spend an extra hour practicing your seord skills\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid looked at the lesson plans she had prepared for the day. Being the youngest teacher in the history of the monastery wasn't an easy task, but she loved her current life. As she looked over at Annette in Ignatz's body she blushed, remembering that night at the ball. She had to focus on teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world itself had been altered by Sothis, the man known as Byleth didn't exist in this new reality. Instead Byleth's mind and Ingrid's had been merged together, as well as their lives. No one had expected knight trainee Ingrid to become a teacher at such a young age, but after saving Claude, Dimitri, and Edelgard from a bandit attack she was assigned to that position. Her current personality was not that of Byleth's or of Ingrid's, but rather the two of them had become one person <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ingrid went through and gave the class their assignments for the day, she noticed that it was awfully quiet. Like someone was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if a memory she had forgotten had reemerged, she thought of a certain name \"Sothis?\" She questioned, not knowing why she thought of the goddess Sothis' name<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very tired voice spoke in the back of the mind \"What is it?\" The voice sounded weak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this voice, a strange set of memories began to form in Ingrid's mind.  This was the goddess Sothis, occupying her body. She had met tge goddess months ago and awakened to the power of divine pulse. What was strange though was although Ingrid had these memories, she also remembered not having them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaking of the world wasn't perfect, it was bound to not be. Sothis had done it on the fly, anomalies like Annette and Ignatz being in each other's bodies were bound to happen. As well as Ingrid's current memories<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something more important than memories were in Ingrid's mind \"Are you okay Sothis? You sound weak\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.\" Sothis said doing her best to sound strong \"Just, don't use Divine Pulse or Transference for a day.....or a week.....I need a nap\" and with that the goddess went quiet again</span></div></div>",

There were factions of unhappy groups across all of Fodlan and Claude and Rhea entrusted Professor Ingrid with the task of shutting them down.  With her army of Golden Deer (along with a few recruits from the other houses) Ingrid would take down the opposing forces without a single loss on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a part of that was the power of the Divine Pulse.  Sothis didn't seem to really speak up much to Ingrid most of the time, she always seemed out of energy after she expended most of her powers to help create the new Ingrid, but when he chips were down in battle Ingrid was able to call upon the Divine Pulse to save the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while Ingrid was confident in all things on the battlefield, there was one thing the Holy Hero Knight of Fodlan still got nervous about.  After her time as Professor at Garreg Moch, Ingrid began dating one of her former students/friends.  The two had been happily together for a while, but tonight at the millennium festival, Ingrid had a feeling her significant other was going to propose.  Ingrid got butterflies in her stomach just thinking about this, but she brushed it off as she came in for a landing.  She seemed to be the first one back at the monastery so she spent some time wandering around the campus for old times sake before finally ending up beside the Goddess Tower where a certain someone was already waiting for her.</span></div></div>",

Annette was there dressed in her finest clothes.  Or should Ingrid say Andrew.  Annette had decided to go with a name change that would match her new body, and she didn't feel right just taking Ignatz name, so she became Andrew.  Andrew was wearing a green version of the academies male formal wear, although she had a blue cape to go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver the gentleman, Andrew came over and helped Ingrid off of her pegasus.  \"Well well, you're actually the first one here for once.  At least I won't have to go to your room and wake you up this time around.\"  Ingrid said making fun of her favorite former student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could have played that game with you, but I wanted to be the first to greet you...there's something I want to say to you.\"  Andrew said as he took a moment to gather himself.  Ingrid just smiled at him, ever since the body switch both Ignatz and Annette had really found a new side of themselves.  When Annette became Andrew, she continued her study in reason magic, but along with Ignatz amazing eyesight (don't let the glasses fool you), she became the best magical sniper in all of Fodlan.  He was even in the middle of researching creating arrows imbued with magic.  But now Ingrid was seeing Andrew more nervous than he'd been since the fateful Ball those 5 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, this seemed so easy the first 100 times I said this in my head but...Ingrid.  You're my closest friend.  When we met 5 years ago I knew we'd be fast friends and after the swap, it could have been really awful for me.  But you made me want to try something new, I found I liked it a lot.  I loved being able to spend so much time with you, I love talking to you, I love cooking with you, I really love...you know...kissing you.\"  Both Andrew and Ingrid blushed bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like all of those things too Andrew, I'm just surprised we were able to hold off until after you graduated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, our first kiss was a pretty good graduation present I'd say.\"   Andrew said with a big smile as he remembered that glorious day and night.  \"What I want to say is, I want days like that to be every day.  I hope you feel the same way too.\"  Andrew got down on one knee and pulled out a beautiful golden ring.  \"Ingrid Byleth Galatea, will you marry...\"  Andrew didn't even get to finish he question as Ingrid jumped on him and started kissing him, in between kisses she yelled out, \"YES!  YES!  YES!\"</span></div></div>",

That's when she had an idea. Why not give that position of power to someone more.....incompetent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth thought back to the bandit camp from two days ago, that bandit leader had lost to Byleth on more than one occasion. Maybe Rhea would appreciate being him <i>'Oh wait, I guess she would instead be that mage I swapped him with'</i> Sothis reminded herself, unbeknownst to Sothis Kostas had been unaware swapped with a fly yesterday by Byleth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She'll still be in a position of power so it's not like I'm completely ruining her. It's just that she'll be in charge of a bunch of nothing bandits instead of the church'</i> Sothis justified to herself before perfoming the swap, focusing hard due to the distance between Kostas and Rhea <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment Rhea's body posture changed, her elegant and straight up posture was suddenly bent over and thuggish \"What the hell? Where am I?\" She asked in brutish way. Kostas looked down at himself, the first thing he had noticed was that he had two arms and two legs again. Thank the gods, he had no idea how that mage he swapped with before could deal with that body. Although he still percieved the fly body from before as a human one, living with it was far from comfortable. He tugged at his current body's dress, so he was a woman again? His current chest confirmed that. He hated this as much as he hated the last switch, he wanted his own body back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea and Ferdinand turned to the Archbishop, they had an idea what had just happened and were scared \"Lady Rhea, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKostas looked up at the two and a scowl formed on his face \"You! You're some 'uh them rich brats! I'll-\" he was about to attack them, but he thought about what they had said. Lady Rhea? As in Archbishop Rhea? Leader of that evil church?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word to the two students, Kostas turned around and began to run off, stumbling from his new dress and heels. \"Stupid things!\" He said as he threw off Rhea's shoes and ripped the hems of her dress to move faster<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ferdinand and Dorothea ran after the archbishop, Sothis laughed. That should keep them all distracted for the night. She felt with each swap she made she dug herself into a deeper hole, but she put those thoughts aside for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Kostas made his way to somewhere he could look at his reflection, the fishing pond. Looking in the water he saw Rhea's reflection shining in the moonlight. He punched at the reflection, how could he be put in this body of all things<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he heard a voice from behind him \"Are you okay Lady Rhea?! What happened to you?!\" A very worried Seteth asked as he saw Rhea's ripped dress and missing shoes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm no o-\" but Kostas stopped himself, he could take advatage of this. He may have been the evil archbishop now, but he had all the power that went with it \"Yeah, actually, but I need ya' to do something for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything, Lady Rhea\" Seteth replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a bandit camp not far to the south from here-\" Kostas began to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send someone to have them eliminated immediately\" Seteth interrupted him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ya' idiot!\" Kostas stomped Rhea's foot. \"I want ya' to bring them two cartloads of food, and not just rations either, bring them the good shit the rich eat!\" Kostas made his demand, his first thoughts being to the bandits who followed him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Lady Rhea, but why would you give that much to a group of bandits?\" Seteth asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of ya' damn business!\" Kostas said getting annoyed. He then saw Ferdinand and Dorothea catching up to him \"And you two! Ye' can pull the carts!\" Kostas said and stomped off, not wanting to answer any questions about 'Rhea's' behavior</span></div></div>",

Ignatz and Byleth were dancing a slow dance together with arms outstretched and next to no touching.  Their dancing was so awkward it was drawing a few giggles from the other students.  Sylvain was at the food table with Lorenz both laughing at the awkward dance partially to compensate for neither getting a date for the ball.  Claude and Hilda who were off in their own corner still in each other's bodies were deciding if they needed to step in and help out the awkward couple or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth who could see the look of pure terror in Ignatz face decided it was time to take charge, \"Come on, let's get out of here.\"  He said, he figured a change of scenery without a room full of people looking at him would help Ignatz out and not scar him for life.  Byleth grabbed Ignatz's hand and led the lime haired boy out of the side exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice and quiet outside of main hall.  The cool night air gave both young people room to breath and finally think more clearly again.  \"I'm sorry Ingrid,\"  Ignatz said, \"I shouldn't have even asked you to the dance.  I don't know what I was thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth couldn't stand to see Ignatz beat himself up like this, he was such a sweet boy who just got overwhelmed by the moment, \"No, no, it's perfectly fine.  I think we can both agree that a dance like that just isn't for either of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess.  But I really was looking forward to dancing with you.  I even asked Hilda for some dancing tips last night after she won the Cup.  And I couldn't even remember any of what she said when I was out there with you, I was just too nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth chuckled inadvertently at the thought of Claude in Hilda's body being a dance instructor but this chuckle was taken badly.  \"Oh, yeah, I know it was dumb for someone like me to try and dance.  I'll just leave and we can pretend this never happened.\"  Ignatz said and he ran off towards the church before Byleth could stop him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"  Byleth said and began to chase, but thanks to his heels and dress Ignatz managed to get out of Byleth's sight.  Byleth took the heels off and searched the church half of the grounds and after about 15 minutes managed to find Ignatz.  He had his painting supplies out and was painting the Goddess Tower by moonlight.  Byleth breathed a sigh of relief \"There you are!\"  Byleth said catching Ignatz off guard, \"I was worried sick about you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ingrid, I can't even break off a date ri...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\"  Byleth said shutting Ignatz down.  \"You will not talk down about yourself any more.  You are a fine and handsome young man who shouldn't care about what other people think.  If you want to dance you should dance.  Any girl would be lucky to have you.  I care about you and can't stand to see you like this.  You're amazing in so many ways.  You're the best archer in the academy.  You're art is absolutely stunning.  I mean look at this thing.\"  Byleth walked up to Ignatz Goddess Tower portrait.  \"This thing is off to an amazing start and you've only had, what, 15 minutes to work on it?  You are one of the most amazing people I know so stop doubting yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnatz stood stunned at Byleth's words forming from Ingrid's mouth, \"Wow, you really think all of those things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, how could I not?\"  Byleth said and before either realized it, Byleth was giving Ignatz a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingrid...\" Ignatz said, and without speaking he looked into Ingrid's eyes and kissed her with a surprising amount of passion.  The stunned Byleth froze as Ignatz broke the kiss and began to ramble.  \"Ingrid you are so beautiful and smart and I just always knew these things but the last day has shown me how smart and caring a person you are.  I thought I liked you before, but I just want to spend more time with you now.  I want to be your knight.  I want to fight for you.  No, that's not right.  I want to be a knight WITH you.  I want to fight at your side.  I've never been more sure of anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignatz I...\"  Byleth said at a complete loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more confident Ignatz didn't run away in shame this time, with an air of confidence he said, \"Think about what I said, I meant every word.  Let me know if you feel in any way the same.  I'll, um, see you.\"  As he left he turned and said, \"Oh, and the picture is for you.  I hope you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth picked up the picture Ignatz had just finished and looked up at the real subject matter.  \"Stupid Goddess Tower.  What the hell am I going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the shadows of the church watching everything from afar, Sothis, still in Dorathea's body smiled at what she just saw, \"Well well, things just got more interesting.\"</span></div></div>",

Until......next time I guess\u201d Sylvain said and gave a retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth couldn\u2019t help but smile as Sothis laughed and Bernadetta breath a sigh of relief.

As he got older days began to blend together. The excitement and hard work that the team\u2019s journey put him through also made the days pass fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, days were passing fast. Until the team decided to begin flying around the world and check on problems facing towns after gathering the elemental spirits<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the group had something much more important to be dealing with, Estelle was insistent on going around helping people first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were staying at Dahngrest for the night, Raven was about to complain, but then Yuri spoke up to him and the others in the inn. \u201cAlright everyone. I made enough.\u201d Yuri said and pulled out a white bag, it jingled, signaling it was filled with gald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-is that\u201d Raven stuttered, if it was what he thought it was, all this traveling would have been worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough gald to privately rent out the hot springs at Yumanju\u201d Yuri said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven whistled with joy. \u201cYuri, you\u2019ve done this old man proud!\u201d Raven put an arm around Yuri smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was too busy thinking about what he\u2019d try to see at the hot springs to pay close attention to what the others were saying. However it sounded like although Estelle and Judith were happy about getting another chance to relax, Rita was complaining about how Raven was likely to peep on them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the initial excitement was over. Raven left to spend some time at the bar. He ordered and drank a few drinks. After getting plenty drunk, Raven decided on a whim to go to the Don\u2019s study. Don had quite a few books, although Raven personally couldn\u2019t imagine his late friend spending much time reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA particular book caught Raven\u2019s eye. He took it off the shelf and began to flip through it. Nothing in particular interested him, but then he saw something odd on one page. Instructions for an arte. Apparently one that could swap bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh. As if that were possible\u201d Raven laughed at the thought. Although, the more he thought about it, the more he began to believe it. After all, if there were artes that could cause meteors to fall, why couldn\u2019t there be one to do something like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven gave it some more thought and soon came to the conclusion that he should at least try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, but whooooo do I want to switch with?\u201d Raven thought to himself out loud</span></div></div>",

Once he entered, he called out \u201cHey Rita. Come to town square with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita wasn\u2019t even remotely interested \u201cNo way, old man!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mooon!

It worked!\u201d Raven laughed in Rita\u2019s voice.<br>\r\nRaven\u2019s own body suddenly opened it\u2019s eyes and stared at Raven in horror. \u201cWhat\u2026.what did you do old man?!\u201d Rita nearly shouted in Raven\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little arte I learned.\u201d Raven said as he felt around his new body, much to Rita\u2019s discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn us back now, or I will make you paaay!\u201d Rita said, raising a fist to her own body. she was clearly off balance though, made sense, Raven\u2019s body was still drunk and Rita wouldn\u2019t mentally be able to deal with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. Do you really want to hurt your own body?\u201d Raven said. Rita then backed off, but not for long. Raven\u2019s hands soon made it to Rita\u2019s chest. \u201cEven from this angle they\u2019re small. Gotta be embarrassing to be going to Hot Springs with Judy tommorow\u201d Raven said with Rita\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the final straw. Rita threw a punch at her own body, but to her surprise Raven was quick to not only dodge, but to knock her on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour body is pretty agile too.\u201d Raven said, now standing above his own body, as he stretched out one of Rita\u2019s legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita rolled over to face Raven in her body. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your fun, old man.

Rita reluctantly accepted the fact she would need to talk him out of this if she wanted her body back. \u201cWhy not take Judith\u2019s body yourself? Then you can\u2026..feel them all you want.\u201d Rita\u2019s face blushed as she had to finish that sentence \u2018Sorry Judith, but I can\u2019t let him stay as me\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven laughed \u201cI thought about it, but if I do it as you, I have the benefit of seeing your embarrassed face when we swap back and the other girls ask you about it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita\u2019s facial expression turned to one of terror. She hadn\u2019t thought about that. What would Estelle think if Raven did that while in her body? Judith would probably tease he, but Judith would tease her no matter what. However she couldn\u2019t imagine how Estelle would react. She needed to swap back now. Rita tried to keep her cool before opening her mouth again \u201cI\u2019ll tell them that you\u2019re in my body.

I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll believe you.\u201d Raven said. He was getting a bit bored of the back and forth, and began to walk back to the inn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita pulled herself up again. There was only one thing she could think of doing now. She needed to find a way to swap them back on her own. Raven must have learned that arte from somewhere. She stumbled off into town, not even sure where to start looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Raven got back to the inn. He was greeted by Estelle waiting for Rita. \u201cRita, what did Raven want?\u201d<br>\r\nRaven put on his best Rita impression \u201cThe idiot just wanted to talk about some lame guild stuff. I was bored to death so I left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstelle seemed to believe him. \u201cWell, we got our room for the night ready. Let\u2019s rest up for tommorow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide smile appeared on Raven\u2019s face. He hadn\u2019t considered the girls would all be sharing a room at the inn.

It seemed like there was no limited to what alchemy could accomplish \"So, should we test it out to see if it works?\" Logy asked, both from curiosity and having skipped lunch today<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. It needs to cool down for half an hour.\" Escha replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Logy said slightly disappointed. \"Well, I need to step out for a bit anyway.

Have I got an opportunity for you!\" The friendly treasure hunter Reyfer had come by to tell Logy about a potential area in nearby ruins with treasure. However Logy wasn't there \"Aww, shoot. Guess I'll have to come 'round later.\" He was about to leave when in the corner of his eye he saw some pie left out \"Well don't mind if I do\" he grabbed the slice and ate it on his way out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReyfer went about his business for a while, deciding that he should stop by the Atelier again later. Eventually though he began to feel busy, unbeknownst to him someone else had eaten the other slice of pie.

He was hear to get rich, not learn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he came across a room with an object resting on a pedestal, that must be it! As he got closer, it became clear that this object was a lamp. He had a pretty good idea what this meant. He grabbed the lamp and began to furiously rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, from the lamp a genie emerged. The genie looked like a giant, fat, toad wearing watermelon pants. \"As rewars for releasing me from my lamp, you may get two wishes\" the genie spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah? Only two?\" Wario exclaimed \"Stupid cheapskate genie. There's no reason I shouldn't get three.\" He mumbled and began to stroke his mustache. He needed to think about this carefully. Wario was greedy enough to wish for everything in the world, but he was smart enough to know about genie's tendencies to twist words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly rubble began to fall from the ceiling, interrupting Wario's train of thought. He looked behind him and panicked. All the walls he had knocked over were now causing the pyramid to collapse! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario needed to get out of here, quick, but before he tried to leave, he shouted out his first wish almost on instinct, without giving much thought to what he was even saying \"I wish....</span></div></div>",

The genie snapped his fingers and suddenly Wario was no longer in the collapsing pyramid. He looked around and saw he was in a very fancy looking bedroom, it lookes fit for a king! ....save for the fact that it was pink, but he could get it painted later. The wish must have worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario put his hand on his hips and laughed \"Wah ha ha! Looks like that genie was.....worth.....it...\" Wario's joy began to turn to panic, that was not his voice! In fact, that voice belong to a woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario looked down at himself and jumped several feet in surprise, he was wearing a pink dress, and clad in that dress was a very feminine body. As he began to slowly float down to the floor Wario looked around the room for a mirror. Thankfully there was a full body one near the closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the ground Wario stomped angrily over to the mirror, in the reflection was not an image of him, but of Princess Peach, ruler of Mushroom Kingdom. That genie granted his wish alright, no one in the kingdom could possibly be richer than the ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaah! This isn't what I wanted. Stupid genie!\" Wario yelled in a tone that Princess Peach would never use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario turned and looked at his new body in the mirror and several angles, he was Princess Peach through and through. His attention was drawn to how petite Peach was, he missed how heavy his old body was. Peach was practically a twig in comparison. Her dress was uncomfortable to move in, he missed hus casual overalls. He sniffed her body too, gone was his pleasant odor of garlic, replaced with a smell of fruity perfume. This body was a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find that genie!\" Wario exclaimed. He couldn't stand being Princess Peach for even a second longer. He looked around the room, but it was clear that the lamp didn't follow him. \"It can't be back at that pyramid!\" Wario shouted in disbelief. It could be under a pile of rubble for all he knew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wario could think of the lamp any further, some toads entered the room. \"Are you ready, Princess?\" They asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready? Ready for what?!\" Wario snapped at the toads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne toad cowered behind the other \"F-for the party. Everyone is here to celebrate your rescue from Bowser's clutches. The cake is ready and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario looked at Peach in the mirror again. She did seem to be covered in more glitter and makeup than usual. So not only was he placed in the body of the princess, but he was placed in her body during an important party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how much stress Wario was currently under trying to get used to being in a different bidy, perhaps a relaxing body was just what he needed, especially the cake \"Might put a few good pounds on her at least\" Wario commented as he rubbed Peach's stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he decided to</span></div></div>",

I think seeing it in action would be a much better use of time then talking about it!\" And with that Reiji pushed Seijuro into the chair and activated the machine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaah, Reeeeiji!\" Seijuro said as the machine began to shake and steam filled the room, completely blocking his vision. Seijuro felt as if his spirit was being sucked out of his body and launched god knows where. He closed his eyes and waited for the vibrations to stop<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he no longer felt shaking, he slowly opened his eyes and there didn't seem to be any steam in the room anymore, in fact, he was in a completely different room! He had somehow ended up in the theater's main lobby<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Reiji build a....tele...porter?\" Seijuro's world was flipped upside down as he heard the sound of his voice, or rather, the sound of someone else's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose body did Seijuro end up in?</span></div></div>",

His eyes were drawn to the breasts currently hanging from his chest. As he stared his face grew red. Claris was an attractive woman, and he had been guilty of walking in on her in the bath before. Having her body all to himself was tempting. He felt his body moving all by itself toward either his room or the bath, but quickly snapped out of it \u201cNo!

He had no idea where this new play Claris had written was, or if she was even done with it. However he couldn't just stay silent as Anastasia stared at him. He decided to bluff \"Oh, I must have left it in the records room! I'll be back in one second!\" He had no idea if it was actually there or if it was actually done, he just needed to get away from this conversation <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away he made his way to the elevator to the hangar, ready to go down and ask Reiji to turn him back to normal.

Not wanting to make her mad he instead walked up the stairs to the records room <i>'Okay, first I get the play. Next I go back to normal'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the records room Seijuro began looking around, hoping his bluff was true and Claris had left a new play she had written somewhere around here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he had found something of Claris' but it wasn't a new play, it was a rough draft for a new story. Seijuro knew he shouldn't read it, Claris had gotten mad at him several times in the past for reading her unfinished stories. They were for her eyes only<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I have her eyes.\" Seijuro gave a dumb excuse as he opened the notebook and began to read. It was a rather simple princess romance story, but because of Claris' writing style Seijuro was getting quite engaged. Like her other drafts Claris seemed to name the characters after the people she knew. He had to admit, it helped him imagine 'Princess Claris' as a beautiful lady by association. Though he wasn't fond of the princess' ugly captor being named 'Seijuro'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Seijuro was getting engrossed with the story, he hadn't noticed a breeze beginning to pick up, circlimg around him.

He could feel the cold iron clamped around his delicate ankles.  He could smell the muck and dirt that of the castle dungeon.  He even had a hard time seeing because of the limited amount of light shining from the small barred windows above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro shouldn't be experiencing any of those things!  He was supposed to be in the Grand Imperial Theatre's archive room looking at Claris' writing, but that certainly wasn't where he was now.  Looking down Seijuro saw he was still in Claris' body, but instead of her green and white outfit, he was dressed in the same pink princess outfit that had been described in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where's the book?\"  Seijuro said, he'd only just noticed that the book he'd been reading, which described his current situation.  He tried to look around for it, but the iron chains on his legs didn't let him move very far.  \"That must be it, I accidentally used Claris' Libromancy and...got stuck in Claris' story.\"  Seijuro was glad to have figured this out, but that didn't help him out much.  He'd only gotten a few pages in right before the introduction of the ugly captor Seijuro bursting into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH HA!\"  A familiar voice rang out, the door to the dungeon opened and a familiar body entered.  It was Seijuro's body, but it was wearing a black suit he thought he'd seen in the costume room and he was wearing a mask that covered half of his ugly face.  <i>'Wait, my face isn't ugly.'</i>. Seijuro thought as evil Seijuro started to gloat, \"Princess!  I have captured you and you shall stay here for all of eternity!  Your prince will never be able to save you!  MWAH HA HA HA!\"  Evil Seijuro closed the door after giving his piece of exposition dialogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that confirms it, unless this is some crazy dream or elaborate joke, I got sucked into Claris' story about a captured princess, with me in the princess role.\"  Seijuro sighed as he unsuccessfully tugged at the chains.  \"How the heck am I supposed to get out of here?\"  Seijuro wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the non book world, Claris was having her own episode.  Reiji had successfully explained to her that he was testing out his device on Seijuro and her being in Seijuro's body was the result.  She took it relatively well.  She only screamed for a minute.  And after slapping Reiji a few times, she went on the lookout for her body and Seijuro.  She eventually ran into Anastasia who seemed rather annoyed that 'Claris' hadn't gotten back to her with the new play.  Claris went ahead to the archive room to grab the script she had just finished writing.  And while she was there she saw that her...personal side project was out and open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  I can't let anyone read that yet!\"  She grabbed the book and pocketed it Seijuro's jacket (having pockets seemed a good perk of having his body).  \"Good thing nobody read that, especially Seijuro.  It's such an unfinished story right now. \"</span></div></div>",

Will someone save the fair maiden?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kind of story had an obvious outcome. Prince charming would come in and save the day and would live happily ever after with the princess. However, Claris was unsure if she wanted such a cliche outcome. She wanted the prince and princess to live happily ever after of course, but did the prince need to be the one to save her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the story Seijuro was trying as hard as he could to break the shackles around Claris' ankles. He tried everything from running, to hitting them, to biting them, but they would not budge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwahahaha. Struggle all you like princess, but there's no escaping!\" The dastardly masked Seijuro laughed. Having not moved the whole time Seijuro was here<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything to do other than watch me?!\" Seijuro said annoyed during another attempt to release the shackles <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my princess, I have no hobbies outside of stalking girls!\" The dastardly Seijuro said.

Just write me out now and write your ending later!\" Seijuro shouted back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, do you know how hard it is to go back and write after you write the ending? I need to finish this story the right way!\" Claris said back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro sighed, he had no way to argue. She was the one writing the story after all. \"Fiiiiine, come on Peanut.

She couldn't just jump to the ball and happy ending.  There needed to be more build up.  More romance.  Claris felt her hand move across the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So what's the hold up?  Let's do that ball thing and get this over with.\" Princess Claris said while poking at her savior's trunk to see how fluffy it was.  The answer was it was very fluffy.</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris looked down at what she was writing.  \"NO!  No no no, this isn't how the story is supposed to go at all.\"  She tried to write down 'Princess Claris jumped into her saviors arms and gave him a kiss.'  But no matter how hard she tried, she found she couldn't write it down.  It seemed that while Seijuro was in her story, she had no control of the Princess Claris character.  \"All the more reason to finish the story and get him out of there...but I don't want to have a rushed ending!\"  Claris wined to herself as her hand moved again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So if Peanut is the prince, does that mean the king and queen are also stuffed elephants?  How does that work in the canon of this story.\"  Princess Claire asked the prince as she circled around him in confusion.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOO!\"  Claris said looking at what Seijuro had made her write.  \"Don't bring up questions like that!  I can't just leave plot holes like this, I've got to find an answer!\"  Claris did some quick thinking trying to create a logical and enticing canon for her book before Seijuro could make other observations and completely derail the story.  Finally Claris had a brilliant idea for why Peanut was there, at least that's what she reasoned.  She took pencil to paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the book, Seijuro was just waiting for Claris to teleport him and Prince Peanut to this ball thing so he could get out and get his body back.  He'd found the key to his chains on the smashed body of Evil Pervy Seijuro and freed himself and was thinking about just leaving the dungeon and Peanut behind when Prince Peanut's body rotated to Seijuro and said, \"<b>BWOOOOOOOOOT!</b>  My sweet Princess Claris, you are right, I am under a dreadful cures that had made my body like this, and there is only one way that I can return to my true form, but I can't do it without you my love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris looked down satisfied with her explanation, and Seijuro responded as Claris felt her hand move on it's own.  \"Oh yeah, that's fine I guess that can make sense or something.  What do we gotta do before we go to the ball and get me outa here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClairs groaned at the lack of any sense of wonder or romance in Seijuro and wrote about how to break the curse.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately Seijuro didn't seem to have a romantic bone in his body, so she would need to think of a situation that would be romantic no matter what he would do. That's when inspirstion struck her and she began to write<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'You see, the wicked magician who turned me into this is holding a singing contest now, the prize for winning is a cure to my curse' The once handsome Prince Peanut told the fair maiden</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris stared at her writing hand, waiting for it to move on its own again at Seijuro's next response <i>'Really? Your one chance to get back to normal and you stop to save a princess first? I mean, Claris is beautiful, but she could wait right' Princess Claris questioned the prince's schedule, complimenting herself in the process</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris shook her book hoping that maybe it would knock some sense into Seijuro, but it didn't do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro stared at the elephant, from his point of view it was an honest question. Soon the elephant spoke up \"Elephants are forbidden from singing in this land\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro tilted his head \"Wait, so this magician turned you into an elephant, and then made the only way to get the cure be something you can't do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BWOOOOOT!</b> stop asking questions like that! Don't you want to get back to normal?! I mean, get me back to normal?!\" Claris spoke through Peanut again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine, let's go\" Seijuro said and climbed on the horse Prince Peanut had launched into the wall via catapult \"Hey how do you ride this with your stubby han-\" before Seijuro could finish asking another logical question Claris wrote Peanut to cover Princess Claris' mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claris began to write Prince Peanut and Seijuro arriving at the singing competition, she thought about how perfect it was. It was a nice romantic scenario, upon seeing the Princess singing a song about love and hope Prince Peanut would fall for her not just as a princess but because of who she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was such a simple scenario, even Seijuro must understand where she was leading things. He would probably try to sing a song her body usually sang, which were almost all love songs! She smiled at her idea that she hardly noticed her hand moving to write Princess Claris' next bit of dialouge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hey, how are we here already?!\" Princess Claris gasped \"We only just got on the horse to leave the dungeon!</i> Claris grumbled, she didn't want to write a pointless scene of just horse riding. Not bothering to answer Seijuro's question she had the host of the singing competition call up Princess Claris as the next singer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Huh, we just got here. I haven't even signed up yet' The Princess asked another logical question</i> No! Now the book's 3rd person narration was agreeing with Seijuro! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Before Princess Claris could ask any more questions she was dragged on stage by the people running the contest.</i> Claris wrote and gave a relaxed sigh. Now she just had to wait for Seijuro to sing a love song, turn peanut back to normal, and then fall in love!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris watched in anticipation as her hand began to move on its own again, making its way to the page and writing...</span></div></div>",

But it was no use.  Seijuro's 'singing' went on and on and on filling out multiple pages of the book.  It seemed that being tone deaf could be portayed by words.  Claris could practically picture Seijuro in her body seeing it and giving it with all his heart...but if she could actually hear him it would probably make her ears bleed.  She could only take solace in that no living person had to listen to this song.  And after Seijuro got out of this story Claris was considering burning this book just so that these pages could never been seen by human eyes ever again.  After Seijuro stopping singing Claris rubbed Seijuro's poor wrist which was on fire after writing all of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro seemed to be waiting for something, Claris felt herself pick up the pencil again and wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So...where's the standing ovation?  Do I just need to get the antidote and me and Peanut can get out of here?'  Princess Claris asked as the audience stood in silence at the mesmerizing performance.</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris had to think quick.  This was supposed to be easy, Seijuro sings a love song and gets the cure for the curse.  But Claris had to look within herself, could she really reward that...for lack of a better word, disaster she had just witnessed?  She was sure Seijuro tried his best...but THAT was the best he could do?</span></div></div>",

Claris turned to her friend, worried \"I wanted to practice with my katana, but I need someone to throw the bamboo for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Claris feared, someone had come to take her away from her writing, but she needed to get Seijuro out as soon as possible!

Shouldn't you be saying I gave a perfect performance and giving me the cure?\" Seijuro asked in Claris' voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response came, the crowd remained silent \"Hellooo? Claris? Are you there?\" He called out to the sky, but Claris did not respond \"She probably went to get a snack or something. She'll be back in a minute.\" Seijuro reasoned to himself, not wanting to imagine being stuck in a paused word for more than a minute <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes of sitting on the stage, Seijuro began to feel parched. All that singing really drained him \"Wish someone would give me a soda.\" He said to himself. Suddenly, Peanut was walking up to him with a non-period accurate can of soda in his hand \"Thank you, Peanut!\" Seijuro said and took the can from the elephant and began to drink in a very non-princess fashion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Seijuro spit out his drink, had Peanut just handed him the soda? \"Claris, are you there?\" He called out to the sky again, but there was no sign of a response anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he controlled the story? Maybe because Claris wasn't at the book as the writer right now control of the story moved onto him. There was only one way to test this out \"And then Princess Claris went backstage to find a massage chair\" he narrated to himself as he walk backstage, and like magic it was true. Turning on the chair, he smiled. Controlling the story himself would make turning back to normal easy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris rushed upstairs with the book, instinctively going to her own room instead of Seijuro's. She thought Sakura would need her help for five minutes tops, not two hours! She hoped Seijuro hadn't fallen asleep or anything as Princess Claris, she wanted him out of the story as soon as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the book and things appeared to be exactly where she left off at first, however as soon as she grabbed her pencil her hand began writing on its own again. She gasped in horror as she was suddenly writing about a can of soda and a massage chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as her hand kept writing to catch up to where Seijuro had taken the story. In the story itself Seijuro noticed he no longer had omniscient control over the world, Claris must have been back.

He was sure he could will his own entertainment and force the end of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Seijuro knew Claris, her stories were important to her, and because they were important to her, they were important to him too.

How they came across a rooftop mechanism and held hands for the first time.  Seijuro even ended the date in the same place with a romantic stroll through the park with Prince Peanut showing his chivalry and saving a child.  It was then that Claris felt herself stop writing, she had caught up to Seijuro in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seijuro...that was beautiful.\"  Claris wrote for Prince Peanut to say, she was so overcome with emotions she almost forgot to add a, \"<b>BWOOOOOOOOOT!</b>\" at the end.  Claris felt her hand move as Seijuro respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Princess Claris smiled up at her prince and said, \"I'm glad you're back.

Hah, I'm sorry, I guess getting asked out by your own body must be a weird experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh yeah.\"  Claris said, her body doing the asking wasn't the reason she was blushing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the elevator ride ended and the two entered the workshop to look for Reiji to swap them back.</span></div></div>",

The two didn't ask, they didn't want to know.  They just asked if they could turn back, and although Reiji wanted to keep them like this to run a few tests, although a few well worded arguments along with Claris pulling out Seijuro's double swords managed to convince Reiji to swap them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd thing happened after they swapped back.  Seijuro asked if Claris would use her Libromancy on him to put him in one of her stories again sometimes.  He always loved getting to read her work, but actually getting to live through Claris' words sparked more joy and enthusiasm than he could imagine.  Claris tried to talk him down saying she didn't have any ideas for stories right now, so Seijuro decided to try and inspire her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro asked Claris out and they started going out on real dates.  Every few weeks in between writing plays Claris would write a special story for Seijuro to experience either as Princess Claris, Prince Seijuro or a number of other characters.  It didn't matter who he was in the story, as long as Claris was along with him to give him a guiding hand if he got too lost in the plot.  And Seijuro's constant asking of questions logical or dumb, helped Claris write better stories.  She even started to publish her own work under a label created but the theatre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a year later, Seijuro gave Claris a gift.  It was a ring and a blank book that said the story of Seijuro and Claris.  The two would spend the rest of their lives writing stories for it.</span></div></div>",

Any reason you made me her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji rubbed the back of Sakura's head \"That's the thing. I told you I only put the machine together in a week.

You could have trapped me in a new life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relaaax. The machine's range isn't that big. It can't launch your spirit any further than the theater.

He had been there nearly a million times on his usual walks around the theater, but right now at this moment it seemed like a new world<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if his feet were moving on their own he walked toward the dressing room and locked the door behind him. Inside he was greeted by rows and rows of clothing that the girl's would wear during their performances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always thought the girls looked beautiful when wearing costumes on stage, but he never spent too long staring as to prevent looking like a creep. However now he alone in Anastasia's body with an entire wardrobe of clothes that he could look at as long as he wanted \"Reiji can wait an hour to fix this\" Seijuro reasoned to himself as he looked through the outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first that caught his eye was easily the most risque in the entire theater. Anastasia's arabian themed outfit from one of the year's earlier shows, with the amount of skin it showed it was hardly even an outfit at all. Looking at Anastasia wearing it for even longer would be impossible if not for this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next outfit to catch his eye was not one of Anastasia's but rather one of Claris'. It was her Alice outfit back from when they put on Alice in Wonderland. However many people saw the costume and thought ot was a maid outfit. It may be a little tight, but Seijuro reasoned that Anastasia could fit in it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third outfit to catch his eye was one that looked like it had been around the theater for longer than he had. It was a pink, glittery, dress. He had heard from Sumire that the old Flower Divison had once performed Cinderella, this must have been that outfit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally his eye caught an outfit that was much less eye candy and much more humor, it was a cactus costume with a hole for the human head to pop out of.

Sumire had him on Peanut promotion duty so much to promote this show that he had never gotten the chance to watch any of the girl's rehearsals.  He thought about just making a run for it and making Hatsuho switch back with him, but then he remembered the look of joy on her...well, his face.  Seijuro sighed, \"I can probably lie my way through a rehearsal with Anastasia, after all, it's just a rehearsal, it doesn't matter how bad I screw up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Seijuro hit the stage, and Anastasia was waiting there with kendo sticks in hand.  She tossed one to Seijuro and got into a fighting stance, \"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intense look on Anastasia's face sent chills down Seijuro's spine.  He was practically shaking in Hatsuho's hakama.  \"Say Anastasia, why don't we just go over the basics of what I'm supposed to do.  One step at a time.

All right, let's do this.  Step one, I thrust and you parry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour Seijuro learned all the steps to Hatsuho's on stage fight.  It was quite invigorating and good exercise for Seijuro.  Although he did feel uncomfortable feeling Hatsuho's chest bouncing around during the more active parts of the fight.  Finally the two went at each other with full force for one last practice run of the fight.</span></div></div>",

Getting close he closed his eyes and....Sakura moved away as he got really close<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro opened his eyes as he heard Anastasia clapping. \"That was perfect Sakura, you're going to dazzle the audience tonight.\" Sakura practically squealed at the compliments from Anastasia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro didn't know if he should breath a sigh of relief or of disappointment. Whichever it was, he sighed. Anastasia continued to direct the other \"Okay, Sakura next I want you and Claris to go over your conversation from Act 2 again. Hatsuho....\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, Anastasia started speeding up expecting Hatsuho to match her speed.  But since Seijuro was in Hatsuho's body, that wasn't going to happen.  As Anastasia sped up, Seijuro panicked just enough for disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro took a bad step backwards and tripped over Hatsuho's hakama and hit the ground screaming.  \"Hatsuho!\"  Anastasia cried as she dropped her sword to check on her fellow Flower Division member.  \"It's my ankle.  It's bad!\"  Seijuro said.  Anastasia cursed silently, \"It's already swelling, don't try to move, I'll get Seijuro to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Oh man.\"  Seijuro said, he hadn't had Hatsuho's body for more than an hour and he'd screwed up and gotten her body hurt before the show tonight.  Soon Anastasia came back with Hatsuho in Seijuro's body.  Hatsuho looked concerned as she bent down to check on her captain.  \"Are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it hurts.  I'm sorry, it doesn't look like you...I mean...I will be able to go on stage with this.\"  Seijuro said grimacing.  Hatsuho closed her eyes and thought for a moment, finally she turned to Anastasia and said, \"Go get Reiji, he knows where the stretcher is.\"  Anastasia did as she was told leaving the two mismatched bodies alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so so sorry.\"  Seijuro said again fighting back tears from both the pain and anger towards himself.  \"We'll have to delay the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatsuho shook her head, \"That can't happen, the theatre needs the income from the show.\"  Hatsuho, even though the situation was dire, smiled down at her captain, \"Don't worry.  It'll be ok, I think I've got an idea on how the show can still happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was almost scared to hear what Hatsuho's idea was.</span></div></div>",

More than enough time for Seijuro and Reiji to get bored and begin playing cards<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da!\" They heard the familar voice of Seijuro say as Hatsuho in his body came in the room, fully dressed in her costume for tonight's show<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji was on the floor laughing, and Seijuro was just left awestruck. \"Th-this was your plan? Dress my body as a girl?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just a girl, as me! You messed up my ankle, but still know all my lines and all the choreography! Sorry captain, I'm going to need your body for a while longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was once again left at a loss for words, Reiji meanwhile stood up done laughing \"I'll get the other Flower Divison members, this plan is great\" Seijuro couldn't tell if he was being genuine or just wanted to see him dressed as a girl for longer <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all the members of the Flower Division had gathered, all of them utterly shocked at 'Seijuro's' current choice of clothing. Hatsuho began spinning a tale of how 'Seijuro' felt really bad about 'Hatsuho's\" injury, so he would take her place in the show tonight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, um, very kind captain, but it takes a lot more than a costume to take over someone's role in a show.\" Anastasia said, clearly not amused <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh, I know that!\" Hatsuho waved a dismissive hand. \"Watch this!\" The next few minutes were spent watching Hatsuho in Seijuro's body perfectly perform several scenes from the play. The rest of the Flower Division was impressed, they hadn't known their captain had seen any of their rehearsals at all, let alone paid close enough attention to replicate their performances. It was as if they were watching the real Hatsuho right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastasia gave a slow clap, 'Seijuro's' performance surprisingly impressed her. \"This could actually work. Sakura, Reiji, carry Hatsuho out of here. I want to spend the next few hours with Seijuro rehearsing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Reiji gave a nod and began to carry Seijuro out on the stretcher. Once he was laying on Hatsuho's bed, Seijuro gave a sigh \"Well, I guess being stuck like this for the day won't be so bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji looked confused at Seijuro's word \"Uh, a day? Shows don't get just one performance then get packed away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro's eyes widened, how hadn't he thought about that? \"S-so how long will this show be running?\" He asked, afraid of the answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two weeks.\" Reiji told his injured friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two weeks?! I can't be stuck like this for that long! Hell, I probably won't be able to leave bed for a few of those days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cogs began to turn in Reiji's brain as Seijuro said the last part of that sentence \"You're right. You won't be leaving that bed for a few days, or at least, Hatsuho's body won't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro saw the devilish smirk on Reiji's face \"What are you getting at?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji pulled a whiteboard from seemingly nowhere and began drawing plans. \"So, we just make you someone else for a few days. So long as you're the one to bring Hatsuho's body her meals, everyone else should be too busy with the show to notice, but first we have to find the perfect person.\" Reiji began to write down everyone in the theater, trying to find who would be the best potential swap candidate for Seijuro to swap with for a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, Claris, Klara, and Anastasia were immediately thrown out as possibilities. They had major roles in the play, and Seijuro had no chance of filling their shoes. Kaoru and Komachi were the next possibilities thrown out, they had a ton of work at the theater that Seijuro also had no chance of accomplishing. Sumire was never even considered, Reiji was too afraid of what she would do to him if he used her. That left them with two people<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" Reiji turned the whiteboard to Seijuro \"Do you want to be Itsuki or Azami?\" The only two people who hadn't been ruled out were them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItsuki was always hanging around the theater, so swapping him with her would be easy. She also had no current responsibilities so her could relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami meanwhile did technically have a role in the play, but it was a bit part with only a few lines, even Seijuro could take her place! Plus he could keep a much closer eye on Hatsuho in his body as Azami<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Reiji's arms getting tired from holding the whiteboard, Seijuro chose to...</span></div></div>",

He needed the body of a Flower Division member in order to keep up with his battle training....plus he REALLY wanted to make sure Hatsuho wasn't doing anything too embarrassing with his body.  \"You grab the body swapping device and Azami, I'll tell her everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One ninja coming right up.\"  Reiji said as he threw away his white board and pulled out a portable stove.  One roasted marshmallow later and a yellow flash dropped from the ceiling stealing the sugary snack.  \"I'll grab the device and let you explain everything.\"  Reiji said leaving Seijuro to tell Azami the truth about how he was in Hatsuho's body and needed to borrow Azami's in order to keep up with his duties as captain.  At least that was the motivation he told her.  Azami followed with a stone face before she said, \"Village Rule #5: Always help if are asked nicely.  I accept Captain.\"  Seijuro breathed a sigh of relief, but Azami had her own conditions,  \"But if I am in Hatsuho's body, I will need to make sure it has the proper nutrition.  While I'm in her body I will require sweets in order to keep her body healing.\"  Seijuro smiled, of course that was Azami's demand, but you could work with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a deal.\"  Seijuro said as Reiji entered with the device.  He twisted some screws and flipped some switches and the next thing Seijuro knew he was standing in front of Hatsuho's body and found he now had to look high up in order to look Reiji in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I knew Azami was short, but I never really realized how short.</i>\". Seijuro thought looking down at his legs and yellow and purple dress that wouldn't look out of place on a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing Captain.\"  Hatsuho's voice said.  Azami pointed at Seijuro and pulled a kunai seemingly out of nowhere.  \"Don't go to the baths in my body or I will have to finish you to save my honor, no matter what body you are in.\"  Seijuro gulped, it wasn't exactly on his mind but still respected the threat.  He and Reiji left Azami in Hatsuho's room with a fresh supply of manju and Reiji said, \"Well, I'll let you get back to observing your body.  I've got to work on a special project for Hatsuho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what kind of special project?\"  Seijuro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asked me to help her out with something to make her look like she'll fit in on stage, you don't need to know any more.\"  Reiji said deciding Seijuro probably didn't want to here what he was working on, which just got Seijuro curious.</span></div></div>",

Put me down!\" Seijuro struggled but before he could break free of Reiji's grip he found himself hanging off a coat rack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, man. By the time of tonight's show you'll know exactly what I was working on\" and with that Reiji walked off toward the hanger again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of hard effort Seijuro got down from the coat rack, he began to run off toward the elevator, only to trip face first on Azami's shoes. An ungraceful move unbefitting of his ninja body. When he reached the elevator he began to press the buttons to go down to the hangar, but it wouldn't budge. It was then he noticed a piece of paper on the elevator door <i>Elevator can't go down all the way, sorry</i> there was a cartoonish caricature of a sad Reiji on the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro sighed, clearly he wouldn't get to know what Reiji was working on until it was done. He supposed he would have to do what he had originally planned to do in Azami's body, spy on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way to the theater, he saw the entire Flower Division was in the middle of rehearsals, specifically of scenes where 'Seijuro' would now be taking the lead. It appeared that they were now rehearsing some kind of scene where Sakura and his body talked to each other<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh prince, if you truly love me please show me a sign!\" Sakura said dramatically and looked up at Hatsuho. Wait, why this a kiss scene?! Seijuro was panicking and considering intervening. Was Hatsuho about to kiss Sakura in his body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there in shock as Hatsuho leaned closer and his heart dropped as it looked like they actually kissed. Thankfully Anastasia spoke up and dispelled his fears \"Beautiful you two, that almost looked like a real kiss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was red as a board \"T-t-thank you.\" She breathed a sigh \"When he got so close I actually thought Sei was about to kiss me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatsuho then slapped Sakura on the back from his body, making Sakura leap in surprise \"Don't worry, Sakura, I was never going to actually kiss you!\" She laughed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone but Hatsuho got silent,  it took all of Seijuro's willpower to keep his screaming internal. Sakura turned her head away \"Well, if that's how you really feel.\" She stomped away, Seijuro couldn't tell if she intentionally of accidentally stepped on Hatsuho's foot on the way out, but he was glad he wasn't on the receiving end of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatsuho grabbed her now throbbing foot \"Ow, what gives?!\" She asked but Sakura had already left the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastasia sighed \"Oh, captain. You have a lot to learn in the ways of the heart\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it looked like the acting was going fine at least, but Seijuro didn't know if any of his relationships would survive two weeks of Hatsuho being him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the three hours Seijruo looked over the script for Azamo's lines. Thankfully Reiji was telling the truth when he said Azami had a bit part, he had only 5 lines he needed to memorize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe occasionally glanced over to his body, it seemed that aside from the incident with Sakura all was going well. Soon enough Anastasia did a clap and everyone gathered around her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everyone. The show is in two hours. You can all have a one hour break to relax, we'll all meet in the dressing room then to prepare. Me and Seijuro are going to spend this final hour doing some final rehearsing to make sure that he has everything down.\" Anastasia explained, Hatsuho groaned to herself about not getting an hour to relax before showtime<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone left the stage and Seijuro was left alone in the theater lobby with no idea how to spend this remaining hour. He couldn't check on Reiji until the elevator could go down to the hangar again and he doubted Anastasia wanted anyone else in on the private rehearsal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking Azami leg's, a kunai fell out of nowhere, and Seijuro had one idea for how to spend time. Azami was very athletic and had a ton of ninja tools and weapons, it was honestly both amazing and terrifying. Now that he was her maybe he could have some fun as a ninja, jumping incredible heights, throwing kunai. It was probably all muscle memory to her body right? How hard could it be<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind also went to his fellow Flower Division members, maybe being Azami could give him the chance to interact with them in a whole new light, one where he isn't their captain but a fellow actress/pilot</span></div></div>",

What the heck was that mad genius Reiji up to?  Seijuro knew he couldn't use the elevator, but simple things like 'facts' and 'physics' hadn't stopped Azami from doing some pretty crazy things.  So if he had Azami's body, why couldn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the lobby Seijuro did the first thing he could think of when it came to Azami's ninja abilities.  He squatted down and jumped as high as he could hoping he'd somehow end up in the workshop.  Sure enough Azami's legs may have been short, but they were strong.  Seijuro jumped up and up and BANG!  Slammed into the ceiling, luckily he caught the railing of the second floor so he didn't fall and injure another of his teammates while in their body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing a bump on Azami's skull Seijuro said, \"Ok, there's more to the trick than just jumping up.  Got it.\"  Seijuro then thought about other ninja like things Azami had done.  Taking a deep breath Seijuro closed his eyes and tried to picture the workshop and started making a bunch of hand signs.  That seemed like a ninja maneuver.\"  After about a minute of this, Seijuro heard a <i>CLICK</i>, he opened his eyes assuming it had actually worked, but was surprised to see he was still in the lobby and Komachi was standing in front of him with a freshly made bromide.  \"Great pose Azami!  This will definitely be a best seller.  You were so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't cute.  I was being a ninja...\"  Seijuro said meekly as Komachi walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ninja teleportation doesn't work.  Maybe I'll just have to threaten Reiji with Azami's kunai not to mess with my body.  Yeah!  That'll work!\"  Seijuro looked into Azami's large sleeves for her knives, but there wasn't anything there.  \"Did Azami take them all away before we switched?  Normally all she has to do is move her arm around and GAH!\"  Seijuro moved his arm the way Azami did and what do you know, out popped....a pigeon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  How did...was that in my clothes?  How?!  Ok, it must be a secret compartment or something.\"  Seijuro waved his arms again and out came a candy bar.  One snack break later and Seijuro tried again but only got out a bunch of tied together handkerchiefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to ask how her ninja powers work.\"  Seijuro said now having even more respect for what Azami did on a regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Seijuro could try more ninja tricks, Anastasia came and called for Azami.  Seijuro made his way to the changing room where Claris and Sakura were already waiting.  Anastasia announced, \"Now, as you know Seijuro has made amazing progress in his work to take on Hatsuho's role.  I feel confident in saying he's ready to go on tonight.  But as we know, men aren't aloud on the stage, it is tradition and our regular customers would be displeased even if it was an emergency like now.  So Reiji has been working hard to find a solution and this is what he's come up with.  The door opened and Hatsuho entered in Seijuro's body and Seijuro saw what Reiji had been working on.</span></div></div>",

What had Reiji done to his body?! Standing before them was a girl wearing Seijuro's clothes, but her body proportions were almost exactly like Hatsuho's, even her hair was the same length the only difference being the color and it wasn't styled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hatsuho?!\" Sakura was the first to speak up \"Your leg is better already?! And what happened to your hair?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Hatsuho\" Hatsuho lied \"It's me, Seijuro! Since I'm taking Hatsuho's place for the show, Reiji threw together a machine that combined mi- I mean Hatsuho's DNA with my own. So I look just like her, except for my hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were amazed and confused at this, Seijuro put Azami's head in her hands. He couldn't believe Reiji would do this, actually he could totally believe it, this was the third time today he has made him go through a body changing experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can you go back to normal?\" Claris asked cautiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she can!\" Seijuro took his head out of his hands as the familar voice of....Azami(?) spoke up! The next to enter the room as what looked like Azami, but wearing a smaller version of Reiji's jumpsuit with his hair color! \"This transformation only lasts for, I'd estimate around three weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Three weeks?! But the show only lasts for two! Reijiiiiiii'</i> Seijuro yelled internally<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, but why do you look like Azami!?\" Sakura said mouth agape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatsuho was the one to speak up first \"We couldn't just test it on me first, if it failed and injured me then we'd be out another actor! Reiji volunteered to test it on himself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully little Azami here-\" Reiji motioned to Seijuro \"-was around me before I was ready to begin testing. Grabbing a strand of her hair as DNA was easy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls were clearly uncomfortable with 'Seijuro' currently having a body exactly like Hatsuho's, but it was for the good of the theater, so none of them voiced any complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into costume was embarrassing for Seijuro, he kept his eyes closed for the sake of Azami's privacy, but that made putting on something as elaborate as a theater costume impossible. Thankfully, Sakura was eager to help him. Azami had never asked her for help before and Sakura was delighted to help the younger member<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the play had begun, watching the acting from on stage was a completely different experience from watching in the seats, Hatsuho's performance was as stunning as the audience expected, the only ones surprised by her flawless delivery were the fellow actresses who thought the girl on stage right now was their captain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Seijuro, things didn't go so well for him. As he watched Hatsuho perform he heard something in his ear \"Pssst Azami, that's your cue!\" Sakura was slightly off stage and noticed Azami forgot to say her line. Right! He was one of the actresses right now! He read out what he remembered the line being in a very nervous voice (How did they act with all these bright lights?) and left the stage at the end of the scene, looking at the disappointed look on Sakura and Anastasia's faces, he didn't do very well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the show had ended and everyone was congratulating 'Seijuro' on his first performance ever. Acting as she natural did Hatsuho gave out a laugh \"Haha! Let's all go down to the bath to celebrate!\" Her congratulatory party turned into a slapping contest as the others didn't appreciate 'Seijuro's' suggestion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro marked a day off on a tiny calendar \"One day away from my body down. 13 to go. Way, or is it actually 20 to go?\" Before he could think too hard he put the calendar away in Azami's seemingly infinite space sleeves<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone left the dressing room back in their normal clothes, Seijuro wondered what he should do now</span></div></div>",

Seijuro crawled onto Azami's tatami mattress and drifted off to sleep.  The next day got off to a fun start.  Seijuro decided it was time to be a good captain and have a meeting.  A secret meeting.  He pulled Reiji and Hatsuho into Hatsuho's actual room where Azami was still laying up in bed with Hatsuho's hurt ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4 had a conversation to make sure everyone was on the same page.  Although it got off to a rough start when Azami saw two copies of her body enter the room.  Reiji and Seijuro were lucky she couldn't jump out of bed or they might have been in deep trouble.  Instead she just threatened them with throwing knives before Seijuro managed to explain Reiji's DNA transformation device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami nodded, \"So now, there are two Hatsuho's, two Azami's, and no Seijuro's or Reiji's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it in one.\"  Reiji said with a grin and a thumbs up which looked really odd coming from Azami's body.  \"And that's how it's going to be until the transformation wears off in a few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I'll have to make changes to our plans.\"  Azami said, \"What changes are you talking about?\"  Seijuro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body is going to need to bath.  Neither of you will bath my body.  So we will switch me into both of my bodies and I'll take two baths a day before coming back to Hatsuho's body.  I'll need the bath energy to help heal this body faster.  And more manju.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatsuho flipped her black hair back which she had styled into her traditional style this morning and said, \"She's got a point there,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro sighed, \"Fine, we'll keep switching around each day...but if we're just switching around anyways, I can just take Hatsuho's body and Azami can keep hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami shook her head, \"No, my healing powers will be able to help Hatsuho faster than you.  You might accidently make it worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was about 90% sure Azami was just using this as an excuse to lay back and eat sweets all day with the occasional bath break, but he didn't want to risk being wrong and ticking off Azami, \"Fine, I'll keep doing. your part in the show, and I promise I'll get the cues right.\"  He added to Hatsuho.  \"Don't worry captain!  You'll have plenty of time to get it right.  Anastasia called a special rehearsal just for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\"  Seijuro sighed.<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next week actually went pretty well.  In a weird way Azami, Reiji, and Seijuro switching around each day became a normal part of the schedule.  Reiji worked in the shop all day til he had Azami bath time, and Seijuro did rehearsals and performances until he had his hour or so in Hatsuho's body.  Seijuro was actually a little weirded out how normal this was becoming for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he'd wish it had stayed normal when a week in something went a little wrong.</span></div></div>",

They wanted to learn how both for scientific and fun purposes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter banging his head on the hangar cieling for the fifth time, Seijuro knew they had to take a break.

They heard the sound of stampeding steps and by the time they jars turned to their direction, the Flower Division's biggest fangirl Itsuki was standing right there \"Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my gawd!\" She began hyperventilating<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji began whispering to Seijuro \"What do we do?\" This was the first time someone outside of the Flower Division had seen the transformed Reiji \"Just follow my lead\" Seijuro told his friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azami! You have a twin, and she's dressed just like you!\" Itsuki commented on Reiji's current outfit. Although he was satisfied with just wearing smaller jumpsuits, Azami said some village rule he was convinced she made up about how a ninja should always dress as a ninja, always dressing him in her own clothes when she was in his transformed body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro braced himself to put on his best Azami impression \"Cousin. Training visit.

And a new piece of information I didn't know about the Flower Division!\" She said and began to write down Azami's newfound family relation on a piece of paper to remember for later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry. No more talking.\" Seijuro said, hoping he could get Itsuki to leave, he was sure the real Azami would disappear in a puff of smoke right about now. Sadly neither he nor Reiji knew how to do that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme just take a few pictures!\" Itsuki said and pulled out a camera, to Seijuro's annoyance.

She had insisted on taking all sort so bromides, both non ninja Azami's tried to escape, but Itsuki had better reflexes than your average girl, she'd always seem to hug the Azami twins in a death grip hug each time they tried to jump away.  Finally Seijuro came up with the excuse that the Azami's had to go to rehearsal and Itsuki let them get away.  Although she did ask if she could 'keep' one of the Azami's for a little while.  Seijuro thought about letting her keep Reiji, but figured he'd need him at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro and Reiji escaped to the internal yard portion of the theatre.  \"Ok, new rule, we need to make sure nobody sees us together.  It will just cause too much trouble and raise to many questions about what we're doing in the Flower Division.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji nodded in agreement but his eyes went wide as he looked up.  High up in the sky a giant snake seemed to be floating in the air above the theatre.

I mean, my...our grandfather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seemingly crazy old man who raised Azami and taught her everything he knew looked between the two Azami's.  Seijuro figured he probably wasn't going to buy the 'cousin on a training trip' lie.  As Seijuro tried to figure out what to say to the old man.  Azami's grandfather Yattansai looked between the 'girl's and said, \"I came here to check on you and that captain of your to make sure he was treating you right, and what do I find?\"</span></div></div>",

To onlookers who didn't know the pair of Anastasia and Azami, it looked like an aunt treating her niece. To Yattansai, it was a chance to see his grandaughter having fun. Even if it was Seijuro in her body, he loved seeing Azami's happy face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Seijuro dug in, Yattansai had a few sweets himself. This was as much a treat to him as to Seijuro-Azami, because this was the first time in years he got to eat with real teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Seijuro had consumed the entire plate, he was beginning to understand Azami's near addiction to snacks now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Hatsuho's room of the theater Azami sneezed.

But the longer the two of them stayed their, the more attention the two famous members of the Grand Imperial Theatre drew.  From outside the shop a small crowd was gathering as they pointed and whispered about the two theatrical celebrities.  Finally after finishing his second plate of treats that filled him with sugar and joy, Seijuro noticed the growing crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, shouldn't we get out of here?  We might need to leave now if we want to get through the crowd to get to the theatre.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYattansai laughed very oddly with Anastasia's body, \"Oh ho ho, don't worry.  I'm obeying Village Rule #13.  Always have an escape plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro had no idea what the old man was talking about, but their escape just got slowed down by a bit.  A large group of fans were beginning to approach.  A couple of women approached Seijuro and a couple of guys approached who they thought was Anastasia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Azami!  You're even cuter in person than on the stage!  Can we have some autographs?\"  Seijuro felt he had no choice but to say yes.  He looked at the blank piece of paper and tried to copy Azami's style of calligraphy writing, but by the time Seijuro finished it looked like it was written by a child.  Thankfully the fans didn't find the fake autograph suspicious.  Meanwhile Yattansai was smiling and laughing at what the guys around him were saying and had started signing autographs himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with that costume?  Is it for that new show at the theatre?  I'm coming to see it tonight!\"  One of the guys said.  Yattansai just laughed, \"Don't worry about it, and if I seem different at the theatre don't act surprised.\"  Yattansai handed back the autograph to the excited guy who just looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why does this say 'Village Rule #13' on it?  What's the mean?\"  The guy asked confused.  Seijuro's eyes went wide, he knew what it meant.  A lot of things happened at once, Yattansai clapped Anastasia's hands together and the autograph he just sighed exploded in a colorful plume of smoke that covered the whole shop.  Seijuro felt Anastasia's arm once again wrap around his waist and one ninja jump later Seijuro found himself somewhere else.</span></div></div>",

More specifically, in Hatsuho's bedroom where Azami laid<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by the sudden appearance Azami pulled out a kunai and pointed it at Anastasia \"Who are-\" she began to question, however just like before with Yattansai, Azami seemed to see through the changed body immediately \"-Grandpa?!\" She broke her deadpanned demeanor and nearly fell out of bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYattansai laughed \"In the flesh\" Seijuro and Yattansai spent the next few minutes telling Azami exactly what had happened and why Yattansai was currently in a body that looked exactly like Anastasia's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how we escaped the tea shop unscathed\" Yattansai finished explaining, although he had exaggerated the tea shop incident to Azami. What was just a group of fans became enemy assassins in his story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooah. Grandpa you're amazing!\" Azami said amazed at her grandfather's story. Seijuro didn't have the heart to tell her that he was exaggerating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two laughed, Seijuro left the room. The two of them deserved to spend some alone time together as family. Unfortunately for him, he wasn't around to stop what as about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beginning to set and it would soon be time for tonight's show. Meaning that Yattansai's visiting day would be over soon. \"Can't you stay longer, Grandpa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Azami, I-\" he was about to say no, but the sad look on Azami's borrowed face made him brainstorm. \"You know what, stay here. I have an idea.\" And with that Yattansai jumped and disappeared again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room Anastasia was reading when suddenly she felt a presence sneaking around. \"Hello?\" She asked, wondering if Azami had snuck into her room or something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up she looked around, trying to find out what was in her room. Nervous she began to reach for her gun, but before she could grab it she was suddenly knocked out from behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That takes care of the double\" Yattansai said as he began to take off Anastasia's clothes and put them on himself. Thanks to his hair color and Anastasia's difference only being visable in good lighting, he effectively looked exactly like her \"Now to get rid of her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Azami saw what appeared to be Anastasia jump down from her ceiling. Only know 'she' was dresses just like Anastasia \"Hoho. So here's the plan Azami\" her grandfather began to explain \"This transformation is only temporary, so while we wait for me to turn back to normal, I'll just take Anastasia's place\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami had the obvious question \"How are you going to take her place? You hardly know her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Village rule #93. A ninja must be perfect in any disguise. I'll learn to be exactly like Anastasia in no time\" Yattansai explained, ready to be her for a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Seijuro wasn't around to tell Yattansai that this transformation wasn't for a day or two, but for three weeks. He would be Anastasia for much longer than he thought <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Yattansai said upon remembering Seijuro \"If any of your friends ask, I went home already. Too happy with my new youth to say goodbye\" Azami nodded, amazed at the ninja ability's of her grandfather<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastasia opened her eyes upon hearing the  sound of ocean waves. She looked around and it seemed she had somehow ended up on a beach chair on a tropical island. In her right hand laid a note that said 'Sorry for the rough trup' and some hotel rooms keys. It seemed the ninja who had knocked her out was kind at least </span></div></div>",

I'm the one who got it injured, I'm the one who should stick with it.  And I trust Hatsuho with my body.

Hatsuho's shirt felt very loose on him, so he pulled Hatsuho's blankets up over his chest so he couldn't be tempted to look where he shouldn't.  Seijuro felt Hatsuho's body heating up from the extra blankets, sweat was starting to drip all over him.  Hatsuho's blankets were sticking to her chest, arms, and legs.  Seijuro did his best to ignore all this and just try to relax, but it was hard to relax when he realized that he'd be in Hatsuho's body for 2 weeks probably, or at least until Hatsuho's leg healed.  Meaning at some point, he was going to have to take a bath as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be the right thing to do, I mean, I can't just let Hatsuho's body get filthy over the next two weeks.  In fact, I'm sure Hatsuho would be happy if I took a bath right now!\"  Seijuro tried to step out of bed and run straight to the baths, but the pain that shot through him when he put weight on his foot told him no.  Seijuro climbed back into bed and closed his eyes and hoped that maybe he'd wake up in 2 weeks back in his body.  But alas he only woke up about an hour later when someone came into Hatsuho's room.</span></div></div>",

Blinking a few times to make sure he was alive, Seijuro noticed he was actually in Sumire's office and Reiji was standing beside the leader of the theatre Sumire.  The lovely red head opened her fan and smirked, \"Ah, it's good to see you awake Seijuro, I was afraid that Reiji might have done some harm to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to make sure he looked cool in confident in front of his lovely boss Seijuro smiled and said, \"Reiji will have to try a lot harder to take me out.  Like this one time in school he had this engine that blew up and...who's saying that?\"  Seijuro was confused because it sounded like some girl was saying the exact same thing as him, it was very odd.  Seijuro looked around and the room, behind the curtains, under Sumire's desk, in the cabinets but Seijuro couldn't find the girl who was talking earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Seijuro came to a revolution, \"Wait a minute!  This is my voice!  Reiji!  You gave me a girl's voice!\"  Seijuro pointed an accusing finger at the mechanic who shrugged, \"You got me, I gave you a girl's voice...among other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  Seijuro said, and for the first time he actually looked down and noticed it wasn't just his voice that had changed.  \"REEEEEIIIIJJJIIIII!!!!\"  The voice of a young woman cried out.  The year old captain of the Flower Division had been transformed somehow by Reiji into a woman.  He still had his messy black hair, but it was much longer, it was going down past his shoulders.  He also noticed two big additions, his chest was large enough that it might even make Annestasia jealous.  Seijuro also noticed at this time he was no longer in his dress shirt and vest, but was instead wearing a white female naval uniform that the ladies had worn back when he was at sea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reiji!  You turned me into a girl just so you could play dress up with me!\"  Seijuro accursed, Reiji was taken aback and defended himself, \"Hey now!  I didn't touch you outside of carrying you here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks correct, my secretary Kaoru and myself were the ones who dressed you.  We thought you'd like the nautical theme of your outfit to help make you more comfortable with this change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  But why did I change?  Is this because Reiji can't get a date?  Well I refuse to go out with you, he is no gentleman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  Reiji interjected, \"I only look at the classiest and fanciest in engenire's gentleman's magazines!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumire closed her fan and both Seijuro and Reiji knew it was time to stop arguing, \"Actually I'm the one who suggested you become a woman, I threw out the idea and Reiji said he could whip up something in a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..but why?\"  Seijuro asked completely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because as you were, you were not displaying the leadership required as Captain of the Flower Division. But you are still an asset to the division as a part of the theatre staff and as a fighter.  So you have been demoted to a member of the Flower Division, and since only women are allowed in the Flower Division, this had to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what have I done that was unbecoming of a leader?  I've done everything I can to help the Flower Division and all of Tokyo!\"  Seijuro said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumire sighed and opened up her desk and pulled out a stack of papers.  \"These are all the complaints I've received about your behavior.  I've gotten complaints from not just employees, but people around town that about you just saying odd and off putting things including the random battle cries you make before going off to battle.  I've received a complaint from all 5 team members about you entering the bath while it was occupied.  And each member of the Flower Division has also complained that when you entered their room and were alone with them you would stare at them uncomfortably for minutes at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt uncomfortable too if that makes it better.  Plus those times in the bathhouse were all just humorous misunderstandings!\"  Seijuro tried to say, but it came off as very meek and was just stared down to by Sumire.  \"So what happens now?  What are you going to tell the rest of the Flower Division\"  Seijuro asked Sumire who revealed her plan. </span></div></div>",

I was worried the new girl wouldn't be aware of who I was.\" Arthur began \"yes, I have been assigned as the Flower Division's captain in Seijuro's absence. I hope we can all get along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was dumbfounded at this revalation. Arthur should be in Londom right now yet he was here. Had Sumire and Reiji been planning this for a while and flew him out here ahead of time? Did they tell him about this whole gender swap thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Seijuro could ask any questions, Hatsuho slapped their new temporary captain on the back \"Glad to have ya' on board, golden boy! Hope you got plenty of exercise back in London, because I'll need a partner for my training\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was clearly uncomfortable from the sudden contact, with his noble presence he was clearly unused to someone casually touching him \"Yes, I'll do my best to fulfill the Flower Division's needs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hatusho!\" Sakura pulled back her friend, seeing Arthur's discomfort. \"Welcome to the Flower Division, Arthur. Our theater probably isn't as extravagant as your base was, but it's a great place once you get to know it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur laughed \"I'm sure it is, and do not worry. I'm not that high and mighty about where I stay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the girl's greeted Arthur in their own ways, Sumire whispered to Seijuro \"Now, I want you to keep Reiji's invention a secret.

Seijuro then noticed that it had been a full 10 seconds where he was just silently staring at Arthur's face.  A little embarrassed and flustered he said, \"Well, even though I'm totally new and haven't been here for long, I want to welcome you and thank you for helping out.\"  Seijuro offered a hand to shake which Arthur took and much to Seijuro's surprise, he kissed the back of Seijuro's hand.  \"Thank you for your hospitality Setsuko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeeehhhhh!\"  Seijuro couldn't stop himself from saying as he pulled his hand back and jumped back about 10 feet.  Arthur had just kissed him!  On the hand!  Was this some kind of weird formal English greeting?  Or was Arthur just a shameless flirt?  If it was the later then he was being very smooth about it.  Much more subtle than Seijuro who upon greeting each member of the Flower Division had seemingly lost control and asked each of them out on dates as practically his first words to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur seemed to realize he'd flustered the black haired girl, \"I humbly apologize, I did not mean to offend you.\"  Arthur said as he bowed down.  \"I would appreciate it if you did not mention this to Sumire or the others.  I would not wish to be thought of as a cad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, it's no problem, relax, it's ok Arthur.\"  Seijuro said stepping back to Arthur about to give him a friendly slap on the back.  But Seijuro probably stood to close as when Arthur stood up straight from his bow, his head accidentally brushed up against Seijuro's new breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PERVERT!\"  Seijuro said without thinking and if by instinct he slapped Arthur and walked off.<br>\r\n_______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro went upstairs and found that his room had changed.  Arthur's name was on the door to his old room, and after some looking Seijuro found 'Setsuko Kamiko's room beside the (other) girls in the hallway.  Inside of the room was similar but different to his.  There were still nautical themed decorations that were slightly different than his own.  He also noticed a calendar with a 'hunks of the navy' theme on his desk.  Before Seijuro threw it out the window he noticed that someone had glued Reiji's head to all the model's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro lept onto the bed and felt his chest jiggle as he landed.  \"That's going to take some getting used to.\"  He said to himself.  Seijuro realized this was really his first time alone since he'd been transformed by Reiji's device.  Seijuro sighed, \"If only I'd paid attention when he used it I might be able to turn myself back.\"  But such an idea was dangerous, not only because he didn't know how any of Reiji's machines worked, but because Sumire might punish him severely if he turned back before she wanted him to.  And this just made Seijuro stress out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Seijuro unconsciously bounced his boobs around like a stress reliever he continued to think aloud, \"I need to relax, if only I was aloud to use the bath.  I could sure use a good soak...wait a minute.\"  A smile spread across Seijuro's face, \"I CAN use the women's bath now!\"  The idea of finally being able to enter such a previously forbidden place was certainly very enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Seijuro pushed that thought out of his mind for at least a minute, there was a very important part about being a member of this theatre troupe, and that was the shows.  \"Am I supposed to act, sing, and dance on stage in front of all those people?\"  Seijuro wondered, he'd always fancied himself an actor...but that was just when he was by himself saying dramatic monologues.  He'd never done anything like that in front of a lot of paying customers.  Seijuro was feeling very stressed again as he thought about what his future held as 'Setsuko Kamiko', Flower Division member.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Seijuro's mind was wondering what should be his next step, his body was already at work.  Almost as thought his body had some sort of magnetic attraction that couldn't be denied, Seijuro found himself going to the Flower Divition's bath.  Seijuro like so many times before tried to stop his body from going but his body would not be denied, but as he entered the elevator Seijuro remembered, \"Wait, I'm not Seijuro now, as far as most people here know I'm Setsuko Kamiko.  I'm supposed to go to the bath.  In fact, it'd be considered weird if I didn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a newfound rationalization Seijuro made his way with confidence into the bathhouse in the first basement.  Seijuro wasn't sure if he was happy or disappointed when he got there that there was no one else there, but Seijuro didn't come this far to second think.  He didn't even change by the lockers.  He just walked into the bath and threw all his clothes on the floor behind the curtain.  Although it did take him a minute to figure out the bra that Sumire had picked out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon it was finally time.  Finally the moment he'd been waiting for.  He dipped his new body into the hot water and felt his troubles melt away.  \"Now I see why there's always a girl here when I'm walking by here.  This is heaven.  I don't want to leave this place ever!\"  Seijuro simply closed his eyes and let the steam take him away.  That overpowering steam ruled all in this land with it's humid yet comforting feeling.  It was so thick Seijuro couldn't see what his own new naked body looked like, but there would be time for that eventually maybe.  For now all that mattered was nothing could ruin this moment.</span></div></div>",

He had no clue how long he was soaking for, it could have been anywhere between a few minutes and an hour as far as he could tell<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there with his eyes shut Seijuro heard the sound of footsteps and the first door of the bath opening. On instinct he stood up and looked around for a hiding spot, afraid of being caught in the bath. However he soon came to his senses, he was a girl now, he was allowed to be here, and if another girl wanted to join him then that was okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro had a goofy grin as he watched the second door of the bath, waiting for whoever would enter and join him. He just hoped it wouldn't be Azami or Klara<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever to Seijuro's shock the one to enter wasn't Anastasia, or Sakura, or Hatsuho. It was Arthur, clothless. Arthur grew stiff as a board \"Oh, Setsuko, I didn't mean to intrude on you\" despite his embarrassment of walking in on 'Setsuko' Arthur tried to keep his cool gentlemanly demeanor,  covering his eyes as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro felt his face growing redder and redder every second he looked at Arthur in here. Both out of embarrassment and out of anger. This was the man Sumire decided could take his place as captain? He was peeping on a girl his first day! Sure Seijuro also went to the bath on his first day and was called a pervert, but no one was there so it doesn't count (at least in his mind)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight smirk formed on Seijuro's red face, he had been on the recieving side of what he was about to do many times, being the one to do it was going to be sweet. He picked up one of the bath buckets \"PERVERT!\" he yelled in his best impression of the other flower divison girls as he threw the bucket full force at Arthur's head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bucket hit Arthur he tumbled onto the ground. Seijuro wanted to laugh, but then he realized he may have gone a bit too far. Arthur was unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro sighed \"I guess bathtime is over\" he got out of the bath, he was tempted to just leave Arthur laying there, but he didn't want him to deal with the consequences if one of the girls found him on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Seijuro dragger Arthur's naked body into the other room of the bath, he wondered what he should do with him.  Dragging him was already getting too close for Seijuro's liking, so dressing the British captain was completely off the table. Seijuro then spotted what felt like a godsend, one of the Great Peanut platforms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Sumire put the Peanut button in Seijuro's new clothes. Putting Arthur in the Peanut suit was an easy task from there<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the disruptuon taken care of, Seijuro sighed. \"I'm going to write him up for this. Maybe seeing that the new captain is also like this will make Sumire reconsider\" Seijuro said and made a mental note to write up a complaint about Arthur later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro began to put on 'Setsuko's' clothes. \"Come on stupid thing, listen to me and clip!\" He yelled as he struggled to put on his bra. After a terrible stuggle he was finally dressed and left the bath, leaving Arthur behind in the peanut suit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the elevator back to the first floor Seijuro was greeted by....</span></div></div>",

But towel tying didn't seem to be a power that came along with his new gender as he ultimately just left the towel hanging on his head.  As the elevator stopped on the first floor, Seijuro was surprised to see the head honcho Sumire standing their with arms crossed and hand fan out showing she wasn't exactly happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you come to my office please <i>Setsuko</i>?\"  Sumire said, it wasn't a request.  Seijuro followed head hung and dripping, of course the minute after he stepped out of the bath he ran into Sumire.  In the office Sumire didn't talk for a while, she just waved her fan and looked to be in thought.  Finally she broke the horrible silence, \"Seijuro, I wish I could say I was surprised the first thing you do when you are given free time is go to the bath, but I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefending himself Seijuro gave the same rationalization he gave himself, \"Hey, if I didn't bath it would be weird.  Girls are supposed to bath, I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do.\"  Seijuro could tell Sumire wasn't amused but she ultimately sighed before saying, \"You didn't do anything wrong in a vacuum, I would have assumed you would take some responsibility and try to become more integrated with the Flower Division.  None of these girls know 'Setsuo' and you just walk into the bath like you own the place first thing.  Again, you didn't break any rules, but I'm just a little disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro stagger and went to one knee, it was as though Sumire had cut him with a knife, but he had information that should make him look good.  \"I'm sorry, I should have maybe done something else, but get this!\"  Seijuro stood up and with his significant chest puffed out he belted, \"I'd like to formally accuse Arthur of unbecoming behavior of a captain!  When I was in the bath, the girls only bath, he came in naked with the intend of bathing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumire looked as though she was waiting for some real news, but when nothing else came she said, \"It is Arthur's first day here and he made a mistake.  As I recall you made the same mistake your first day here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I was called a pervert and had a complaint filed against me!\"  Seijuro said defending himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumire shook her head, \"You were called a pervert by someone who doesn't work for me and no complaint was filed.  Everyone who heard of the event knew it was an accident.  You didn't get bath house complaints until the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and I could go on.\"  Sumire said as she once again pulled out the stack of complaints again Seijuro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...but...Arthur might have seen me naked!\"  Seijuro said making his final stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And did Arthur stare or did he turn away?\"  Sumire asked to which Seijuro meekly said, \"Well...he covered his eyes and said he was sorry....before I knocked him out and stuffed him in the Peanut costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumire didn't even blink, she just closed her fan and stood up from her desk.  Somehow this made her feel 20 feet taller than Seijuro as she looked down on him.  \"You will apologize to Arthur and spend time with him to show there is no hard feelings.  You must be a better person Seijuro or you will be 'Setsuko' for a very, very, long time.\"  Seijuro gulped as he went back to his room and wondered what was going to happen when Arther got there.</span></div></div>",

Why should he need to applogize to the guy who was basically taking his job. After some more indistinguishable grumbling he finally knocked on Arthur's door<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temporary captain answered almost immediately \"Ah, Setsuko\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Arthur could continue Seijuro began giving his half assed apology \"Look, it wasn't right for me to knock you out, I shouldn't have stuffed you in the peanut suit, and I just came here to say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" The two said in unison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What why are you apologizing?!\" Seijuro said shocked \"I'm the one who came here to apologize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I shouldn't have walked into the bath in the first place. I should have asked the theater manager if it was woman's only\". Arthur bowed in apology <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro felt his eye twitch, he had come here to apologize to Arthur and here Arthur was giving his own, better and gentlemenly apology. He wanted to kick him badly right now, but restraimted himself. He needed to please Sumire right now \"No, no, it's okay! There's no hard feelings!\" He said, but he had a feeling that words wouldn't be enough to please Sumire \"How about I give you a tour around town? That should strengthen the bond between us or whatever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur thought about it for a second, before noddimg \"That would be lovely, I was in Tokyo earlier this year but a tour from a local would give me an entirely different perspective\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Seijuro said arms wide \"Come down to the lobby in ten minutes and we'll go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later Seijuro was waiting impatiently in the lobby for Arthur. Once he was done showing him around he planned to avoid him until his time as Setsuko was over. While waiting in the lobby he heard the nearby whispering of two familiar voices<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear, Setsuko asked Arthur out?\" He heard Sakura whisper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On their first day here? Man, I guess love at first sight is real\" he heard Hatsuho whisper back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro went pale, a date?! No, no he had not just got himself a date with his replacement. Yeah, this was just a tour of the town, nothing more. Finally Arthur came down to the Lobby \"Shall we go, Setsuko?\" He asked and extended his hand <i>'Noooooo'</i> Seijuro internally screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo take his mind off things Seijuro took them as far away from the theater as he could think for their first tour destination. Unfortunately for him, it was the ferris wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot realizing the implications Seijuro began to talk about what it was unenthused \"This Ferris Wheel has only been running for a short time, so you probably didn't ride it yet. I've only ridden it once myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur looked at the steam powered contraption \"It's amazing. Maybe you and I should ride it sometime\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro almost chocked on his own spit. The only time a pair of people would ride this together were if they were in a relationship, and Arthur just asked him to ride it with him! Was the captain of the London Division a womanizer, or did he just not understand what he said! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are your okay, Setsuko?\" Arthur asked noticing the growing red on hid companion's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Let's just go somewhere else.\" Seijuro said and stomped off to their next destination.....</span></div></div>",

Seijuro knew for a fact that the last time Arthur had been tot he park, he had to hide away from all the women who were all over him.  Before Seijuro even helped out Arthur by not helping the weird stalkers, but now those stalkers might save him from this accidental date.  Seijuro and Arthur left the Farris wheel unridden and Seijuro led the way to the park where Arthur might meet his demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden boy seemed a little hesitant to go back to a place with such a sorted history, but he didn't want to disappoint Setsuko so off he went without a complaint.<br>\r\n____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lovely in the park.  The gazebo was practically shining in the sun, smell of the freshly cut grass and ocean were an intoxicating mix, and view was just plain perfect.  No one was around, it was as though a guardian angel was looking down on Arthur and 'Setsuko' to make this evening as perfect as possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the annoyance of Seijuro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro kept walking around the park for way too long hoping for one of Arthur's stalkers to pop out of a bush and kidnap him or something, but alas that didn't happen.  All that happened was Seijuro and Arthur walked side by side through the park and had a lovely time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Setsuko, there is something truly special about you, I hesitated to come here but you seemed to enthusiastic about it, but all my bad memories of this place have been replaced with good ones of you.  I guess you could say you're my good luck charm.\"  Seijuro turned to look at Arthur and took a step back, Arthur was bowing down and presenting 'Setsuko' with a four leaf clover he had apparently just found.  Seijuro took the lucky little plant and sighed as he thought, <i>'Of course he finds one of these without even trying,'</i>.  And not wanting to be rude, and not knowing when he'd need to go on a quest to find another 4 leaf clover himself, stuck it in his officer's jacket pocket which made Arthur smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro smiled back but was secretly plotting a way to ruin this 'date'.  \"Let's go into town, there's still a place or two I want you to see.\"  Seijuro said enthusiastically to not let Arthur in on his plan.<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Meanwhile in the Mikasa Memorial Park bushes</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of the Flower Division quietly watched Arthur and Setsuko on their date.  Azami appeared out of nowhere to give an update on her mission.  \"Setsuko's competition has been subdued.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris smiled, \"Thank goodness, we don't want anyone interfering with Arthur and Setsuko's date.  Setsuko was so brave to ask out Arthur and make the first move, we need to do everything we can to support her in her pursuit of love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Arthur gave her the four leaf clover there was an audible gasp.  \"What was that?  Did...did he just propose!?\"  Sukura said almost falling out of the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think it was a weed or something.\"  Hatsuho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is no mere weed, it is a four leaf clover which represents faith, hope, love, and luck.  And Setsuko has already seemed to have accepted this gift.\"  Anastasia informed the other girls as 'Setsuko' pinned the clover to her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they going to kiss?  If I was writing this, then they would kiss at this part!\"  Claris said unable to look away.  But alas, a kiss did not happen and the two newest members of the theatre went off to their next location.  Sakura had a determined look on her face, \"Come on, we have to support Setsuko, we need to help give Arthur a little push.  He's almost as hopeless when it comes to matters of the heart than Seijuro.\"  Sakura gave a frustrated and sad sigh at the thought of her childhood friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, and I have a plan on how we can help give those two a push in the right direction.\"  One of the girls said with a smile.</span></div></div>",

Hoping to find it's way into port.  And you have shown to be my guiding light.  Lead me where you may.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's still not good enough!  Setsuko is a tough chick, I can tell.  We need to let Arthur know she's not a girl he can just fool around with.\"  Hatsuho said grabbing the doll away from Anastasia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro felt his fist ball up and was afraid of what he was about to do to Arthur, but thankfully his fist only hit the tree beside Arther's very confused looking head.  Once again Seijuro heard his voice speak, \"I want you to know I'm serious about this.  I need you to bring 100% of yourself to everything and I promise that I'll do the same!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what needs to be done.\"  Azami said, and a puff of smoke surounded Hatsuho.  When the smoke cleared she saw she was holding a log in her hand instead of the doll which Azami now manipulated with kung fu grip action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro jumped up into the tree, something he'd never knew his body could even do, and popped back down in front of Arther.  This time his body was making karate chop and kick motions and now he found himself saying, \"You must prove yourself.  You should fight for my honor here and now.\"  Arthur just looked at the bizarre behavior trying to analyze the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n\"Ah, you guys are being so clueless!\"  Sakura said taking the doll from Azami.  \"Setsuko just needs to speak from the heart when it comes to the one they love.  I just wish someone would talk to me like that.\"  And Sakura closed her eyes and pictured herself speaking to someone like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro sneezed oddly enough and now found his body becoming less aggressive and more demure.  He held his hands together and walked up to Arther.  Seijuro wasn't sure if his fear and confusion came out through his eyes, but it sure didn't come out through what his body was saying.  \"Arther, I just want you to be honest with me.  I have feelings for you and I need to know if you feel the same way about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight over the doll was over.  They put it down and just watched in anticipation of how Arthur would respond.</span></div></div>",

They were practically leaning out of the bush now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro for his part was incredibly dizzy. Having his body manipulated and thrown around in addition to the emotional turmoil of not being able to control himself was incredibly exhausting. Exhausting enough that the instant he had control again he passed out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eager looks on the Flower Division's faces all turned to disappointment \" Aw phooey\" Sakura expressed her disappointment out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur for his part was breathing incredibly fast, what had just happened?! One moment everything was going fine, the next moment Setsuko seemed to be professing her love, and the next she's going crazy. The only reason he hadn't lost his cool was because he didn't want anyone to see him like that, now that he was alone (as far as he could tell) he collapsed to the growd in exhaustion <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few minutes to catch his breath, Arthur looked at the unconscious Setsuko. Being a gentleman he carefully picked her up and began to carry her back to the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Flower Division also began to head home, disappointed with how things went. All except one however, Claris was quickly writing in a small idea notebook <i>And then the noble knight takes the princess in his arms and carried her home</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris put the doll in small magical box, it was still linked to Setsuko and the Flower Division could control her again if they wanted, but so long as it was in this box it shouldn't affect her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Seijuro woke up in his room. \"Oh thank god it was just a....dream\" the sound of his voice destroyed his hopes, everything that had happened earlier actually happened and wasn't a horrible dream<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking outside it was currently the middle of the night. He sighed and laid down again, he wanted to go to Reiji and tell him what had happened with his body, or tell Arthur to pretend that yesterday hadn't happened, but he couldn't do either of those this late at night. Well, he supposed he could talk to Arthur now, but after losing control of his body he didn't want to go anywhere near Arthur's room at night</span></div></div>",

The next morning Seijuro woke with renewed vigor, he took the elevator to the hanger where Reiji was working on something as usual and didn't notice Seijuro come in.  Seijuro pouted in an unintentionally really cute way and walked up the workbench and slammed his fist down before shouting right into Reiji's ear.  \"WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BODY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeehhhh!\"  Reiji screamed out before he fell out of his chair.  He scooted away while still on the floor as he quickly said, \"I swear!  I never touched you!  I only carried you to Sumire's office, she and Kaoru were the ones who touched you to dress you up!  I only watched!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I was...wait...YOU WATCHED THEM DRESS ME?!!?\"  Seijuro started throwing tools at Reiji at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a GAH second I OUCH no I just AAWWW they kicked me OOOUUUUT!\"  Seijuro ran out of tools to throw and was debating getting in his Mugen to finish off Reiji, but no, Seijuro needed Reiji in order to turn back, plus there was still the quesition he came to get answered.  Seijuro allowed Reiji to stand up and tend his wounds before getting back to his questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Reiji, I want to know what you did to my body with your machine.\"  Seijuro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd like to think it was obvious what my invention did.\"  Reiji said looking Seijuro up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IDIOT!\"  Reiji said throwing a hammer out of nowhere at Reiji.  \"No idiot, my body did something that it would normally have never done unless you mind controlled me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind control?  Oh no, I don't mess with that stuff, the only thing I changed about you was your chromosome.  Your body right there is just what you would have looked like if you were born a girl.  By the way, I was just wondering, do you have a sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro left a bloodied and bruised Reiji down in the basement and went to the dining area for a nice pot of tea.  As he poured he began to go over what he knew.  \"Ok, if Reiji's to be believe, and I guess I have to, then my mind is just my own.  I just have estrogen instead of testosterone in my body.  Those hormones must have been what made me say and do those weird things with Arthur.  I'm not being mind controlled, I must be in love with him.\"  Seijuro took a nice long refreshing sip of tea before his eyes went wide and spit the tea all over the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WWHHHHHAAAAATTT!?\"  Seijuro screamed, causing everyone in the area to give the new member of the Flower Division an odd look.  Seijuro sprinted off to his 'Setsuo Kamiko' room and laid face down on the bed.  \"This is nuts.  It can't be possible.  Do I really...love Arthur?\"  He took a moment to picture Arthur in his mind.  Sure Seijuro had always thought he was a good looking guy (certainly not better looking than himself) but was he attracted to him.  Seijuro felt his spine shiver at the thought of...kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro thought that he was about to throw up at the thought of kissing another guy...but was the disgust?  Maybe that's just how girls experienced love?  \"Girl emotions are so confusing.\"  Seijuro said to himself slamming his head into his pillow, only succeeding in getting his new long hair in his mouth.  One coughing fit later Seijuro was back to thinking about his problem with his confusing feelings towards Arthur and how his body had reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that crazy way my body reacted wasn't love.  Maybe my body just does stupid things around the other sex.  I know my body may or may not have done some dumb stuff as a boy towards the girls.\"  Seijuro flashed back to the multiple times he'd gotten himself slapped or punched, some of which he blamed his body more than his mind.  \"Maybe I should spend more time with Reiji and see if my body does dumb and crazy things if I spent time with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro paced around the room a bit more before finally thinking, \"Ahhh, I'm just avoiding the main problem.  Maybe I just need to have some one on one time with Arthur in his room, maybe that will make things clearer for me.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seijuro spent some time thinking it over. Thinking about meeting Arthur in his room, going over what happened yesterday and his feelings toward him, getting even closer with him.... he shook his head rapidly, sending his new hair flying around. No way, that would be an absolute last resort for him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep one should be finding out if it's just his new body reacting to the opposite sex or if it was around Arthur specifically. Seijuro thought about who to spend time with, the first to come to mind was obviously Reiji. Imagining Reiji's reaction and the inevitable teasing from taking him on a date made Seijuro want to rip his pillow up. No, Reiji was the worst possible option<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro thought about other guy friends he had, only to realize that the list was incredibly short. Actually he had barely any friends outside of those he met at 'work' in the Flower Division. He supposed he could call up Yang of the Shanghai Division, they were still in town running their restaurant. However Somehow he doubted calling Yang up and saying \u201cHey it\u2019s Seijuro of the Flower Division and I\u2019ve been turned into a girl, want to go out with me?\u201d Would yield positive results. A shiver crawling down his spine, Seijuro knew he only had one option. He needed to go on a date with Reiji<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter puking out the window at the mere thought of doing it, Seijuro marched his way back to the hanger to talk to Reiji. \u201cLook Reiji, we need to test something\u201d he spat out and went on his long explanation of what he wanted to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne explanation later Reiji summed it up from his perspective \u201cSo we go on a date so you find out if your current body can control itself around men, and in exchange not only does it look like I actually went on a date with an attractive woman, but a girl that the ever so popular Arthur was seen dating?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it in one, man\u201d Seijuro sighed, he couldn\u2019t believe he was actually going through with this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then!\u201d Reiji suddenly ripped off his jumpsuit to reveal a black suit underneath with a white rose pinned to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro\u2019s mouth dropped \u201cWhat, you, how did, you did plan this didn\u2019t you?!\u201d Seijuro was seconds away from strangling his friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot everything. I\u2019m smarter than I look, man. After your questions this morning I figured you would want to test your body in a way like this. Plus as the most handsome single man in Tokyo I always have a suit prepared in my closet\u201d Reiji gave a confident smirk <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro\u2019s urge to kill Reiji was rising by the second. \u201cUgh, fine. Let\u2019s just go!\u201d He stomped toward the elevator<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you mademoiselle\u201c Reiji was going to have too much fun with Seijuro today<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Setsuko and her new date left the theater, the other members of the flower division watched in shock. Yesterday she was out with Arthur and they assumed it was a date, but this time she was with Reiji and he was in a suit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we follow them again?\u201d Sakura asked, much less sure of herself than yesterday<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we do! Sure we probably had wrong guesses yesterday, but this has to be a real date! Look at his suit!\u201d Hatsuho was eager to follow them again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris already had the Setsuko control doll ready, after their experience yesterday her mind was practically overflowing with romance story ideas, she needed to try it again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami was equally eager to follow them again. Stalking people was a ninja\u2019s duty, plus controlling Setsuko with the doll was a lot more fun than she expected. Something about making someone else act like a Ninja was tempting to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar to Sakura, Anastasia was against it \u201cGirls, we should let Setsuko handle this on her own. Clearly she already had the courage to ask Reiji out, we should let her handle this on her own\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnastasia\u2018s right. Let\u2019s just stay here and wait for them.\u201d Sakura tried to be the voice of reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her (and much more unfortunate for Seijuro) Claris, Hatsuho, and Azami left halfway through her sentence to keep pace with Setsuko and Reiji<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two most reasonable members of the Flower Division staying behind, this was going to be a long day for Seijuro </span></div></div>",

Seijuro looked at Reiji with narrowed, \"You would really take a girl out on a date and get a nudie magazine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the best ones.\"  Reiji said giving Seijuro a thumbs up which was returned with a sigh.  Seijuro hated to admit it, but he admired Reiji's brashness and forwardness about his likes...wait was that love?  Seijuro shook his head and thought, <i>'No no, I've always thought that about Reiji.  At least my body isn't doing anything weird this time.'</i>. Seijuro thought as he curiously took a peek at the issue Reiji was browsing through.<br>\r\n_________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Seijuro, he wasn't the only one paying attention to this date.  Thanks to some ninja powers, Azami, Claris, and Hatsuho were on the roof across the street with binoculars watching every page flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't believe this!  He's looking at a magazine like..that...with Setsuko right there?!\"  Claris said practically mortified at what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Village Rule #60, one must punish public displays of perversion.\"  Azami said raising her kunai in the air to throw, thankfully Hatsuho saved the mechanic from death via ninja.  \"No Azami!  We're not here to kill Setsuko's date no matter how pervy he may be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami retracted her kunai into her dress again and nodded, \"True, but I can not let it go unpunished.  It's a village rule.\"  Azami said as she took the doll magically connected to Setsuko and raised it's arm and brought it down hard.<br>\r\n___________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert!\"  Seijuro screamed out as he sent a karate chop down onto Reiji's head sending him crashing to the ground.  Seijuro gasped and covered his mouth.  Once again the same thing that happened with Arthur is happening again with Reiji.  Seijuro came to the only possible conclusion, <i>\"Oh no, do I love Reiji too?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives?\"  Reiji said rubbing the bump on his head, \"I didn't think you would be the needy type of date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't either.  I don't know why I did that!\"  Seijuro said with wide eyes.<br>\r\n___________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Hatsuho's turn with the binoculars as she watched Setsuko seemingly in shock at what Azami had done for you.  \"You see Azami, you've gone and upset her.  I think I get it.  Setsuko is a rough and tough navy girl and spent time at sea with a bunch of pervy guys.  She's probably used to guys looking at magazines like that and is probably cool with them.  Here, give me the doll, I can fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro helped picked up Reiji from the ground and was helping brush some of the dirt off of his nice suit.  \"Sorry about that, I don't know what happened, I'll split the cleaning bill with you and....\"  Seijuro suddenly felt like he couldn't control his body once again.  \"I promise I'll make it up to you.  How about I pay for your magazine.  But you have to get me a copy of Hunky Mechanics.\"  Seijuro felt his arm give Reiji a playful punch to the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji looked very confused, \"Are you sure you want me to get you that?  You know the kind of pictures that magazine has right?\"  Seijuro looked at the cover of Hunky Mechanics and sure enough it had a muscular guy wearing nothing but a tool belt on the cover.  \"I...NO!  I'd never want a magazine like that...I think.\"  Seijuro was very confused by what his body and mind were doing.  Did girl him really like these things?<br>\r\n___________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris seemed disappointed by Hatsuho's decisions with the doll.  \"Yes, it seems Setsuko is a girl who...is ok with those magazines, but we're trying to help her on this supposed to be romantic date.  Getting...those magazines...is something two very close friends would do, but there's no romance.  I think I have the best solution for Setsuko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for their copies of 'Steamy Paradise' and 'Hunky Mechanics' Reiji and Seijuro decided to sit down on a bench across the street just under the roof the girls were hiding on.  Seijuro just looked at the cover of the nearly naked man and put it away.  Whatever had compelled him to say he wanted that kind of thing had gone far away and he was fine with it.  But Reiji was perfectly comfortably looking at his girly magazine out in public.  Seijuro found himself looking at the girl on one of the pages who was covered in nothing but thick steam in just the right places and was contorted in a pose that Seijuro had never seen an actual person stand in.  When Seijuro suddenly got the all to familiar feeling of losing control of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>mon cher</i>,\"  Seijuro's body said sweetly, \"Why look at a picture of a body when you can look at the one before you.\"  And before Seijuro knew it, his body was contorting itself in ways he never thought possible.  At one point he was pretty sure his arms were twisted backwards as his back arched pushing out his breasts and his legs were doing the splits.  Fortunately the magic of the doll prevented Seijuro's body from being damaged.  Unfortunately the same couldn't be said for Setsuko's clothes as the buttons on the naval jacket and shirt popped off revealing the bra beneath causing both Seijuro's and Reiji's noses to bleed as the girls gasped in horror from the roof.</span></div></div>",

It started doing that again now, and stop staring!\" Seijuro yelled back, his friend's eyes leering him in that way was making him uncomfortable<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji started thinking fast \"there's a clothing store nearby, I'll pay for you. Consider that getting even for turning you into a girl in the first place!\" Reiji took Seijuro by the hand and began to carrying him off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio on the rooftop watched the scene unfolding before them \"After them!\" Hatsuho yelled and the three were suddenly jumping across rooftops to keep the pair in view<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the clothing store Seijuro breath a sigh of relief. There was a nice outfit similar to his old one right near the entrance. He could buy that and pretend this whole clothing scandal never happened <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately his current puppet masters didn't agree. Seijuro suddenly found himself walking further into the store and browsing more clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a date, so Setsuko needs to wear something cute and feminine\" Claris said as she made Seijuro walk over to some fancy dresses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! Setsuko's a navy girl, she probably never wears stuff like that. We need something that shows off her muscles\" Hatsuho took the doll and made Seijuro walk over to some tank tops<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninja rule 79. Date fashion must make the wearer look cool\" Azami had taken the doll again and Seijuro found himself looking at completely bizarre outfits<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making Seijuro walk back and forth for what felt like an eternity to him, Claris spoke up \"Alright, clearly we all have different ideas for how this date should go. So how about we compromise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Reiji was on the ground laughing as Seijuro exited the clothing shop. Seijuro had no idea why his body had decided he wanted to wear <i>this</i> but he wasn't able to resist it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuko was currently wearing a blue skirt that went to her ankles, ridiculously large red heels, a white tank top with a purple heart on it, a yellow straw hat, and for some reason his hair was tied in pigtails. He wanted to die of embarrassment right there. No part of this outfit matched another. It was as if a different person decided how his bottom half, top half, and head should be dressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji finally got done laughing \"So, is that enough testing for you? Or do you want to keep the date going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't even a decision that deserved consideration to Seijuro, clearly he couldn't control his new body around men. He needed to go back to the theater right now and end this nightmare. Maybe if he explained the situation to Sumire she would change him back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever to Seijuro's horror the next words out of his mouth were \"Heck yeah! We just got started! We have so much to do today!\" Hatsuho put the doll down satisifed that the date would now continue <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I don't mind being seen with a beautiful lady some more!\" Reiji said, not noticing that the last sentence from his friend was against his will. \"So do you have anywhere particular you want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Too my room until the end of time'</i> Seijuro thought internally, however the current holder of the doll had a completely different destination in mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is deciding where the date goes next?</span></div></div>",

Take me to the tea and cake shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro said this at the same time thanks to the dolls magic and was surprised at his suggestion.  He'd been to that little shop a number of times but have never actually eaten there. but at least his body was suggesting something relatively normal.  Seijuro started walking in front of Reiji but thanks to the heels he'd been compelled to wear, he found himself almost tripping over every step.  \"Uh, let me give you a hand there.\"  Reiji said and he put his arm around Seijuro's waist to keep him upright.  \"Eeeehhh!\"  Seijuro said trying to back away, but he stumbled again.  Thankfully Reiji's arm was still there to prevent him from face planting.  Reluctantly Seijuro looked up at his old friend and said, \"Thanks I guess.\"  Meanwhile on the rooftops looking down, Azami, Claris, and Hatsuho celebrated silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the small shop, they found it was relatively empty, the lunch rush hadn't started yet, so the waiter made sure to give the oddly dressed girl and her date the nicest table in the corner and even put out some freshly picked flowers for atmosphere.  It was a nice atmosphere, very romantic.  <i>'That girl subconscious or whatever has been controlling me sometimes must be loving this.'</i> Seijuro thought as he and Reiji looked at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd love it the troublemakers did.  They had a view from behind some newspapers just outside the window the couple were beside.  Things seemed to be going well, they didn't have to do anything to help Reiji start holding Setsuko close and now they had the most romantic spot in the store all to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after being given some alone time to awkwardly stare into each others eyes...and to laugh at Seijuro's choice of clothing, the waiteress came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll just order a small sandwich and a muffin on the side, and my date here will have a salad.  She's watching her figure, she just got it after all.\"  Reiji joked and Seijuro rolled his eyes.  \"Very humorous Reiji, I'll have a...crepe.  Girl's like crepe's right?\"  Seijuro acted the waitress looked confused at the question but eventually nodded in agreement.  \"Now will there be anything else?\"  The waitress asked.  And Reiji and Seijuro didn't want anything, but they weren't the only ones listening in on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami held the doll to her mouth and had Setsuko say, \"I'd like a peach manju to go for Azami.\"  Hatsuho also grabbed the doll and shouted for Setsuko to shout, \"And a Taijaki for Hatsuho as well!\"  Claris sighed at this abuse of power, but she desided she might as well join since the other two had, \"And <i>un</i> croissant for Claris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the restaurant, Seijuro was more confused than ever.  Previously all his crazy outbursts had been some sort of weird declaration of love towards Arthur or Reiji, but now he was taking food orders for members of the Flower Division?  <i>'Is my girl brain just really considerate towards the girls?  What in the world was that?'</i>. Seijuro thought as he looked out the window above Reiji's head.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully it seemed to be in a non-intrusive way. He was slowly cutting the crepe with a knife and eating small pieces at a time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden away, Claris was the one currently controlling Setsuko's eating behavior. Trying to make the date as simple and romantic as possible. Unfortunately for Seijuro, she wasn't the only one there<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Claris. Reiji isn't the kind of guy to sit around and watch a girl slowly eat, we gotta show him the Setsuko is just like one of the guys.\" Hatsuho took the doll again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was enjoying his current eating behavior, however that enjoyment ended as his body once again changed puppet master. Suddenly he was practically stabbing the crepe with his fork and taking gigantic bites at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris was unamused \"You're making her look like a pig, that isn't romantic at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatsuho supposed Claris did have a point, however it was too late, the crepe had been completely devoured<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is more food. Let me try\" Azami said as she took the doll <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro looked at Reiji, he was too focused on his own food to notice the changing his changing behavior as he ate his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro felt his body move again as he suddenly did a backflip over Reiji (Something he didn't even think was possible) and grabbed his sandwich from him in midair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Reiji pointed as his friend \"If you're still hungry eat some of the food you ordered for the Flower Division, that's mine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three puppet masters didn't take too kindly to the suggest of eating their food. A beaten and bruised Reiji was left on the table, Seijuro at his sandwich<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce lunch was over, the two of them exited the tea and cake shop, once he had control of his own body back, Seijuro paid for all the food as an apology to Reiji<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji rubbed his jaw, which had been on the recieving end of a roundhouse kick from the Azami controlled Seijuro. \"You're new body needs to learn to control itself, for my sake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what's going on, is girl me some sort of physco?\" Seijuro said. He looked at the time, it was still early afternoon. He wondered how long his body would keep this date going for. Neither he nor Reiji noticed that they had left the Flower Division's food in the cake shop after the confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls playing with a doll sat on a roof, eating their snacks which Azami went down to grab \"Hmm, where too next? The ferris wheel?\" Hatsuho suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris put her foot down at the suggestion \"No, we must save the ferris wheel for last! Oh, to be in a close space with the one you love, illuminated by only the moonlight. It's too romantic to put in the middle of the stor- date\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami and Hatsuho nodded, Claris did have a point. The ferris wheel would have to wait for last. Since there was nothing going on in the date at the moment the three of them could more civilly discuss where the date should go next. The one who made the next decision being...</span></div></div>",

Apparently his internal girl mind had a bit of a tomboy streak to her.  Ever since demon attack had dropped off significantly, the combat arena where Seijuro and the Flower Division had fought for the right to exist in their Mugen against the other combat revues the arena was turned into an all around sports arena, and today there was a big baseball game being played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Seijuro and Reiji made their way to their seats, Seijuro started up a normal conversation since he'd been in control of all his action for a good half hour.  \"I don't think we've been here together since we were on the academies amateur baseball squad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji smiled reminiscing, \"Those were some pretty good times.  You striking out, and me saving the day with the bat as the crowd chanted my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro did a spit take with his soda Reiji had bought him, \"Saved the day?  You were the worst member of the team, you might as well have been the bat boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?  Well how about you and me settle this in the parking lot, right here, right now.\"  Reiji said ready to fight his friend/rival at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on,\"  Seijuro said about to reach down to take off his heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunalty for Seijuro, the trio of troublemakers were just a few rows back of this and were watching the whole thing.  They didn't know what they were talking about but their body language implied the date wasn't going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>non</i>!  We have to do something to stop them fighting!  I knew this was a bad idea, these's no romance in baseball.\"  Claris said getting out the doll to try and 'fix' Setsuko and Reiji's date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's absolutely a place for romance here, I say let them fight.  All good couples have fights sometimes, it will make them love each other more or something like that.\"  Hatsuho tried to reassure Claris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hatsuho, love is something to be cherished and nurtured and we can't do that here.  We'll have to go straight to the Farris wheel after this to fix your mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistake?!\"  Hatsuho was about to have her own parking lot brawl, but with both of them distracted, it gave Azami the opening she needed to grab the doll.  She had her own idea on how to end the fight.  Using her ninja training as inspiration she waited for the perfect timing and it soon came.  With the crack of the bat a baseball flew high overhead into the crowd.  Azami put Setsuko into jumping position and before Seijuro could figure out why he was squatting, he jumped 20 feet into the air and caught the baseball.  He landed back in his seat by Reiji and still not in control of his body, he offered Reiji the baseball simply saying, \"For you.  Let's stop fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji took the baseball and sat back down as the crowd cheered for the mysterious, and oddly dressed, girl.  Seijuro waved to his adoring fans who cheered Setsuko on, this event even got the attention of the people in charge as they put Setsuko and Reiji on the Jumbotron with two dreaded words beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Kiss Cam</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatsuho let out a rare \"Squeee!\"   As she made a grab for the doll, \"We have to make them kiss, we must respect the Kiss Cam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Claris was squarely against this, \"NO!  We are not having our climactic kiss with them surrounded by sweat and peanut shells!\"  Claris and Hatsuho began to once again fight over the doll which made Seijuro weirdly jerk back and forth on camera in a very odd looking dance before someone finally had their way.</span></div></div>",

He was currently being seen with an attractive, outfit aside, woman in front of a large crowd with all eyes in him. \"No man would pass up this opportunity. Sorry Seijuro\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Seijuro was once again rocked close to Reiji, Reiji made his move. He grabbed Seijuro by the waist and brought him in for a kiss. Seijuro's eyes were as wide as dinner plates<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two seconds Reiji released Seijuro and waved to the crowd, who cheered for the lovely 'couple' who caught the ball and kissed in celebration<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatsuho did a fist pump as Claris hung her head. It seemed her perfect date plan wouldn't come to fruition. However she didn't give up hope for the perfect romantic moment and still had plans to bring this date to the Ferris Wheel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the kiss cam was no longer on the duo, Seijuro took the opportunity to excuse himself and vomit. He couldn't believe Reiji actually kissed him! He thought his new body not immediately going in for the kiss was lucky, but Reiji acted for his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuffed peanuts in his mouth, hoping to get the taste of Reiji out. Reiji then came walking up to Seijuro laughing \"Sorry man, but with all those people watching I had to kiss the pretty lady. Hey, do you think anyone from the theater was watching? Would be nice if people thought I was dating the new girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro rolled his eyes \"I would rather this body be dating Arthur than you\" realizing what he said Seijuro hastily corrected himself \"I mean I wouldn't date anyone like this, but not you especially!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I understand. Dating a man completely out of your league is hard\" Reiji said with a wink, only to be met with a heel thrown in his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just finish watching the game. Maybe then my body will let us go home.\" Seijuro picked up the thrown heel so they could make their way back to their seats<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the baseball game was uneventful for the most part. For some reason Seijuro's body felt compelled to buy various snacks and leave them down by a bench that wasn't even in view from his seat. After the 5th walk to buy snacks he wouldn't even eat himself he was positive that girl him was some sort of masochist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami, Claris, and Hatsuho all sat in there seats, eating their free snacks. Only Hatsuho was paying attention to the game and Claris was partially convinced that Hatsuho had brought them here so she could watch it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris was writing down ideas in her notebook for how she could salvage this whole date after this baseball game. She was planning out the perfect way the ferris wheel should go \"Okay, so we have her buy some roses, no, daises and....\" she trailed off on many tangents <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami had to be stopped from catching a ball herself by Claris and Hatsuho many times, they couldn't let Setsuko and Reiji know they were there, but Azami wanted to see if she could jump as high as she had Setsuko jump<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the baseball game came to an end and the sun was setting. Seijuro breathed a sigh of relief, surely his body would be ready to go home by now. However to his horror his mouth began to move again \"Oh mon cheri, the sun is setting. Now would be the perfect time to ride the ferris wheel, just the two of us alone.\" He wanted to slap his mouth closed but he didn't have control of his arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distance away, Claris was estatic. After Azami and Hatsuho's diversions she was going to direct this date in her own perfect romantic way</span></div></div>",

She made sure to wrap Setsuko's arms around Reiji's as they walked all the way to the rooftop Ferris Wheel.  Meanwhile Seijuro was gagging internally, not just because his body was making him look like s lovey dovey schoolgirl, but because her face was right next to Reiji's armpit and he hadn't put on any deterrent today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Claris was directing traffic with Hatsuho and Azami.  Hatsuho had already gone ahead of everyone to the Ferris wheel and was making sure it would be just Setsuko and Reiji there as she chased off all potential distractions away with her hammer.  While this was happening Azami got some roses from a flower stand and with ninja like speed, dropped them in front of Setsuko and Reiji on their walk.  Reiji looked around for whoever dropped them, but when he didn't see anyone just shrugged and picked them up.  \"Hey, you want these?\"  Reiji said in not the most romantic way which disappointed Claris, but she could still save this romance scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For <i>moi</i>?\"  Claris had Setsuko said.  \"They are beautiful, I can tell that the redness of the rose represents your heart and it's abundance of love for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuhhhhhhhhhh,\"  Reiji said, he seemed almost as disturbed by Seijuro's supposed girl brain as Seijuro himself was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris pouted from afar at Reiji's lack of romantic instincts towards Setsuko.  \"Am I going to have to write his half of the script too?\"  Claris sighed in disappointment.  But the climactic finale was still to come as Reiji and Setsuko were soon welcomed onto the Ferris wheel by a totally not suspicious red headed person with a fake mustache and glasses and a hammer not so subtly hidden behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the sun finished it's decent over the horizon and the sky turned a beautiful shade of purple, disaster struck.  Mysteriously some kana got stuck in the gears of the Ferris wheel and Setsuko and Reiji were stuck at the top together sitting across from each other with nothing but each other and a romantic view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris, Azami, and Hatsuho exchanged knowing nods, their plan for the perfect end to the date was going perfectly.  Now it was up to the Reiji and Setsuko now.  Claris used a clairvoyance spell to get a special look inside of the Ferris wheel so she could see love blossom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut love was not blossoming when she looked inside, instead Reiji was just complaining about the shotty work of the mechanics of the wheel.  He was ranting and raving about gears this and engine that.  \"Well this won't do.\"  Claris said as she grabbed the doll and moved Setsuko so that she was sitting practically on top of Reiji and whispered through the doll.  \"It's ok Reiji, I'm not scared because I'm here with you.\"  Although if Seijuro had control of his mouth he'd say that Reiji was the last person he'd want to be stuck in a tight space with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji looked down at the girl who was giving him clear signals thanks to Claris and said, \"Well you should be a little worried, because technically the structure of this Ferris wheel is sound, if it's been forced to stop like this there is probably some sort of catastrophic mechanical error and there could be any number of consequences to this.  It could mean...\"  Claris was practically steaming.  She was trying to write the perfect romantic end to this date and Reiji was ruining it with mechanic talk.  \"I guess he just doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.\"  Claris sighed as she thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

How he had ordered food for the other members of the Flower Division, how he bought snacks for seemingly no one at the baseball game. Was Claris responsible for those? He hoped so, knowing that someone else was controlling him was somehow a comfort at this point<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris was nervous as the badly dressed girl marched over to her, she knew she had to admit to sabotaging the ferris wheel, but she wondered if she could keep the doll secret at least</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was her aura from her similar naval training, but Clairs felt like she should open up to her and be honest.  And so for the next hour Claris confessed everything that had happened over the last few days from the Ferris wheel to the start of her interference with the doll and Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I just wanted to try and make you comfortable and happy and you were spending so much time with the boys I thought you just wanted help in your love life.  And I...I was being selfish and using you.  I thought I was writing a real life perfect love story, but I was just being a manipulative monster.  I'm so sorry.  I'm a horrible person who doesn't deserve to be in the Flower Division.\"  Claris was in tears confessing everything to Seijuro who took everything in and made his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hugged Claris, giving her the biggest hug he could give her.  \"Claris, your heart was in a good place, you just let yourself get away with your stories.  But we're here in the real world, and I'm here for you.  Don't live in your stories so much.  You are Claris Snowflake.  An important part of the Flower Division.  You make me proud to be a part of it.  But you were really scaring me and making me think I was going crazy with my girl brain...whcih I total have always had....because I'm a girl.\"  Seijuro added reinforcing his cover story as Setsuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rii Crampphhh reaaaahh!\"  Claris said unintellectually.  A confused Seijuro looked down and realized he'd been smothering Claris with his breasts during his entire speech.  Releasing Claris from her fleshy prison, she took a few gasps of breath before saying,  \"I promise I'll never hurt you or anyone with my magic again.  I was already scared I would do this.  I fulfilled my own worst prophecy.\"  Claris said looking at her spell book with horror.  She looked like she was about to throw it away.  But Seijuro stopped her, \"No, you caused problems, but more importantly you fixed them.  Don't throw that away.  Keep it...after all.  You'll probably need some magic in order to help clean up this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris smiled and Seijuro turned to try to plan out a clean up plan.  But his jaw dropped, \"WHHHAAAAATTT?!\"  he screamed out.  The Farris wheel which had fallen to the earth was already back on top of the rooftop and was running again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly jumping off of the roof were the giant robots of Azami and Hatsuho, and riding in Hatsuho's hand with his work uniform and wrench in hand was Reiji.  \"Sorry I took so long with the repairs, but Azami had to stop for snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro walked up to Reiji and out of confusion and frustration just slapped him.  \"How did that happen so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you two have been talking for like 20 minutes and it seemed like you didn't want me to intrude, so I went to work.  I couldn't have done it without Hatsuho and Azami, they probably saved me like half an hour of work with their help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...nevermind.\"  Seijuro said.  He'd given up trying to figure out all of Reiji's tech mastery.  As Reiji walked away Claris came up to Setsuko.  \"Maybe I was wrong about Reiji, he does have a certain charm about him.  I can see why you're dating him.\"  And Claris walked away as Seijuro just stood there so stunned by the already fixed Ferris wheel he didn't even bother telling Claris that Reiji wasn't his boyfriend as everyone drifted off to their own beds for the night wondering what adventures tomorrow would bring.</span></div></div>",

Once it was far enough away from Seijuro he was independent of its movement for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being blown away by the wind the doll was picked up by a bird and put in its nest. Where it laid for a few days, forgotten<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next three weeks of 'Setsuko's' life were bizarre to Seijuro, but nowhere near as chaotic as the previous two days. Reintroducing himself to the Flower Division went relatively smoothly, they were some of the kindest people he knew and they accepted Setsuko into the group with open arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately they were all convinced he was dating Reiji, when he tried to dispell that rumor half of them were convinced he actually loved Arthur. He was caught between a rock and a hard place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExplaining to Arthur that the strangeness of the other day was caused by his body being controlled didn't go smoothly at first, however after a demonstration involving Claris making a Reiji doll and having Reiji contort himself into a pretzel he was convinced. The Reiji doll was safely disposed of afterward<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had spent some time with each of the girl's, he may not have been captain right now, but they were all his dear friends so he spent just as much time with them as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even tried to reform some relationships from outside the Flower Division as Setsuko. Itsuki practically fainted when a new member of the Flower Division wanted to talk bromides with her, he had also reintroduced himself to Hiromi when he went with Azami to pick up some manju<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two people outside of Reiji, Sumire, and Kaoru who learned of Seijuro's current gender swapped situation. One day he had gone to the Shanghai Division's restaurant as a new customer for the first time over again, he had no intention of telling them he was actually Seijuro however after eating just a few bites of his meal Yang and Yui confronted him about it. Apparently he was the only customer they every had who had beams of light shoot from his eyes and mouth after eating<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest surprise came when one breakfast Claris came down with a script, she had written a play about a girl who wants to find love, but three ghosts pull her in seperate directions leading her to different men (Seijuro couldn't help but notice the inspiration of the play). He nearly spit out his morning tea when the Flower Division unanimously decided that Setsuko should play the lead<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent two weeks learning the basics of acting on stage and singing, he thought he was getting pretty damn good at it, Sakura agreed, Anastasia did not. He still had a lot of practice left to do before he could go on stage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time the doll laid in the bird nest, completely forgotten. As time passed the magic in the doll slowly changed its appearance, what was once as featureless as a mannequin now had a perfect resemblance to the girl it controlled, it somehow had even mimicked 'Setsuko's' current clothing, morphing whenever she changed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day a gust of wind and a misplaced leg of a mama bird sent the doll falling down to the street below. Many people walked by, most not even seeing the doll and those who did not bothering to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon however the doll had a new owner, as someone bent over and picked it up, recognizing the person it resembled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho picked up the doll?</span></div></div>",

She was practically skipping as she went to the Grand Imperial Theatre to spend another wonderful day basking in the presence of the Flower Division.  Hopefully she'd get the chance to talk to some of them!  She especially wanted to see the newest member, the mysterious Setsuko Kamiko.  In a totally not stalker way, Itsuki tried to do an extensive background check on this mystery girl, but all she found was that she used to be in the navy.  \"So strong and mysterious, I can't wait to get her bromides!\"  Itsuki squealed as a bird flew overhead and something fell on her head.  When she saw what had hit her, Itsuki almost passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\"  Itsuki screamed out in a pitch that only dogs could hear.  Itsuki picked up the doll and said, \"I don't believe it!  It's a Setsuko Kamiko doll!  Komachi doesn't even have one of these in the store yet!  Oh oh oh, this must be a prototype!  Lucky me!  It's so beautiful and lifelike.\"  Itsuki poked and prodded every inch of the doll, but luckily she wasn't in range of Seijuro for the dolls magic to take hold.  Not yet anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcstatic about her rare find, Itsuki made her way to the theatre.  She was greeted by Komachi by the front door, but had to admit she did miss old the ticket taker.  Once there, Itsuki made her way to her special corner by the stairs.  But what most people didn't know, was that there was a reason she stood in that spot all day.  That place had a secret to it.  There was a small door by the stairs she'd asked Reiji to build for her (it's good to be friends with the maintenance guy), it took her to a secret room where she kept her prize collectors pieces.  Inside the room were bromides of all of the members of the Flower Division both past and present.  There was every collectable the Wind division had ever sold.  And in the center of the room was Itsuki's prize possession.  A model with perfect precision of the Grand Imperial Theatre.  Every room was perfectly measured out and even had every single costume, prop, and piece of furniture in the theatre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItsuki knew that Setsuko must be rehearsing right now, so she put the doll in the room and began to move it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the rehearsal room, Anastasia was trying to teach Setsuko the finer points of acting to help her make her debut soon.  And it was...well....Seijuro was trying his best and Anastasia ran some lines with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoic actress made perposful and subtle movements with her head and hands as she looked at the novice actress and said the cue line, \"Don't you understand?  I know better than you do about how you should love.  I will lead you to the path of light if I have to do so by force.\"  Anastasia clincher her fist intently waiting for Setsuko to respond.  Seijuro heard the line, closed his eyes remembering what the next line was supposed to be and shouted, \"MY LOVE IS MY OWN!  YOU SHALL NOT CONTROL ME!!!!\"  Seijuro shouted his line believing that was the best way to convey emotion.  Anastasia closed her eyes in pain before giving constructive criticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't just have to shout, you must give the audience credit.  If you draw them in with subtle movements your voice will find the right level you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately this was the exact moment Itsuki had started to play with her new doll.  Seijuro stretched his arms out and found he couldn't speak, <i>'Oh no, not again!'</i>. He thought, but thinking wouldn't help him now.  He began spinning uncontrollably until he actually accidently slapped Anastasia in the face.  Seijuro kept spinning and tried to apologize, but couldn't control his speech yet.  Anastasia just looked at the chaotic actress and said, \"If you wish to get serious about the craft, I will be in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro couldn't talk yet, but he finally stopped spinning around.  But Itsuki wasn't done playing with her new doll yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, where does Setsuko need to go next after rehearsing?\"  Itsuki wondered as she pondered where she'd direct the magical doll.</span></div></div>",

He suddenly jumped in the air from the stage and landed in the wardrobe. Was this how Azami moved around? Did that doll Claris told him about have teleportation powers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he needed to confront Claris, but he was currently at the doll's mercy. \"Oh whatever shall I wear for tonight's performance?\" His voice spoke in a very playful way <i>'There's no performance tonight, what are you talking about?'</i> Seijuro's thoughts questioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her little room Itsuki took off the dolls clothes and began looking over the other outfits she had for it. \"Hmm, what kind of show should she be putting on. Oh, I know!\" She grabbed a doll sized recreation of one of her favorite Flower Division related outfits, a Cinderella costume from the days of the old Flower Divison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro tried all he could mentally to resist, but nothing could stop him from putting on the glittery, pink, dress. His body began spinning again and swishing the dress around<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItsuki wasn't satisfied with her own 'pretend' however \"Nooooo, how about we go with this one instead!\" She didn't have any outfits specifically for Setsuko as Setsuko hadn't done any performances, so she figured she could substitute it with another Flower Division members <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a show of it by having her doll move over to it, Itsuki once again spoke in a playful voice which Seijuro repeated \"Now that I have the perfect dress for the show, what should I wear while greeting my adoring fans?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was sweating, something told him that his current puppet master wasn't going to keep him contatined to his current room while wearing this next outfit. Wearing any of these outside of this room or the upcoming show would be unpleasant, but he didn't have a say in it, all he could do was look at the outfits on the rack he was approaching and wonder which would be the lesser of five evils<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was Sakura's Aladdin outfit, complete with an adorable little hat, Seijuro thought it would be one of the better ones to wear, but after applying some logic he realized what would be wrong with it. The costume was snug on Sakura and showed off her midriff, with his body's significantly larger chest that tight fit could be disasterous! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Hatsuho's blue Shinsengumi costume. That was easily the least painful option here, showing next to no skin, not being particularly girly, and would probably fit fine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third was probably the worst he could put on. Azami's Red Riding Hood outfit. Under normal circumstances his current body had no hope of putting it on without ripping it, it was child sized! However he had seen multiple times how the doll could manipulate the laws of physics, putting that on might ne possible. He prayed his current puppet master wasn't about to choose it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth was Claris' Alice outfit. That one wasn't too bad compared to the ones it was sandwiched between, he didn't want to wear the skirt, even as a girl he chose to wear pants all the time, but he could deal with it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final outfit might be as bad the Red Riding Hood one, it was Anastasia's Arabian themed outfit, if you could call it an outfit. It showed enough skin to leave nothing to the imagination <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his current puppet master had him change clothes, Seijuro heard a knock at the door and a familiar voice \"I'm sorry for bothering you Setsuko, but Anastasia told me you slapped her, as your captain I ask you to apologize to her. However if you're stressed I'm willing to talk\" Arthur's voice came through the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n\"-I ask you to apologize to her. However if you're stressed I'm willing to talk\" Itsuki heard from her little room. The walls of the imperial theater were infamously thin, to the point where Sumire had her office door replaced with a thicker one, apparently knowing how thin it was from how she would eavesdrop in her youth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItsuki grew a wide grin as a new idea for how to roleplay with her new doll came to her. She would listen to whatever was going on im the theater and have her doll react like so \"I bet I could do a great Setsuko impression!\" Little did she know, 'Setsuko' would be the one doing an Itsuki impression <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe directed Seijuro's body to open the door. Arthur's jaw dropped upon seeing Setsuko wearing</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Seijuro was being dragged against his will by his body to all the different costumes of the Flower Division, whoever was controlling hims seemed to have finally made a decision.  Seijuro stared down his opponent, it was Anastasia's magenta Arabian outfit.  It consisted of a top that was basically a bra, a skirt that left most the front half of the body exposed, some sandals that laced up past the knees, and a bunch of jewelry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Seijuro felt his body taking the clothes off the rack he was at first horrified at the thought of potentially wearing something so exposing out in public like it seemed his controller wanted.  But as the top fit a little snuggly in place and the skirt went around his waist he breathed an internal sigh of relief, <i>'Well, at least my frame matches Anastasia the most.  My boobs actually fit into this top thankfully...WHY AM I HAPPY ABOUT BOOBIE CLOTHES!'</i><br>\r\n_________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile with a delicate hand in her secret room Itsuki was carefully putting on the sandals and jewelry to perfect Setsuko's look.  It was as she finished when she heard Arthur, \"I'm sorry for bothering you Setsuko, but Anastasia told me you slapped her, as your captain I ask you to apologize to her. However if you're stressed I'm willing to talk\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nItsuki's eyes went wide, this was great gossip inside of the theatre she could only dream of!  And she did and shared her dreams in the forms of blogs and fan fiction.  But now she could base her stories on secrets she heard from her special room.  With a childish enthusiasm and a creative spirit Itsuki continued her doll role play as Setsuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the costume shop Seijuro felt his body moving in an over the top and melodramatic way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My HEART is torn asunder!  I'm sorry for the wrongs I've DONE!!!!  Oh my handsome LOVE I promise my spirit and my all to YOOOUUUUU!!!!\"  Even thought Itsuki had never seen Setsuko in a show, she had heard a rehearsal or two and thought she had Setsuko's wonderfully melodramatic action style down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was pleading internally for Arthur to notice that something was wrong and to go get Claris, but if Arthur thought 'Setsuko' was acting too weird, he didn't let on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're practicing for the show...I believe.  Yes.  I'm so sorry Setsuko, I will leave you to it.\"  With that Arthur left Seijuro alone again.  <i>\"Hey!  Do people really think my acting is that hammy?\"</i>. Seijuro asked himself as Itsuki began to plot her next branch for her story in her little theatrical doll house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd heard Arthur say Setsuko had slapped Anastasia!  \"How scandalous!\"  Itsuki said to herself.  \"But why would she do that to one of the best actors in the country?\"  Itsuki's eyes went wide as her imagination went wild, \"OH!  I bet Anastasia and Setsuko are in a love triangle with Arthur!  I'd heard rumors Setsuko and Arthur were a thing, so why else would Setsuko slap Anastasia?  Ooooohh or....what if, WHAT IF Setsuko and Anastasia are secret lovers!  And they got in a lovers quarrel!  What should I play out?\"  Itsuki asked herself still completely unaware of the magic chaos being dealt to Seijuro thanks to the doll.  Itsuki placed a non magical collectors edition Anastasia doll in Anastasia's doll room equivalent and moved Setsuko there to begin the next chapter of her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Seijuro felt himself jumping into the air, somehow not crashing into the ceiling, and jumping down into Anastasia's room where she was laying on her bed.  Anastasia stood up, \"Sorry, I didn't see or hear you come in.\"  Anastasia had a rare look of real surprise on her face, \"Why in the world are you wearing my costume?  Is this some kind of joke?  First you slap me and now wear my outfit?  What game are you playing Setsuko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm wondering that myself.</i>\"  Seijuro wondered as Itsuki decided the motivation for doll Setsuko.</span></div></div>",

Heads, rivals it is<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going to say something or are you just going to stand there?\" Anastasia questioned the newest Flower Division member<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Seijuro felt his arm winding up in a cartoonish way as the all too familar feeling of his mouth moving out of his control coursed through him \"How DARE you steal Arthur's gaze from ME!\" He said in an over the top fashion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking abou-\" Anastasia was interrupted as Seijuro suddenly punched her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'NO! Oh no! No no no! That didn't just happen.

In reality 'Setsuko' was throwing random punches, kicks, and slaps in random directions, none of them anywhere near Anastasia. Anastasia meanwhile was defending herself and beating up her assailant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, but not soon enough for Seijuro's liking, Itsuki was satisfied with her play fight. As Anastasia grasped the arms of 'Setsuko' to try to restrain her and ask what was going on, Seijuro once again jumped through the cieling, landing in the downstairs hallway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaten and bruised he prayed that he would run into Claris so she could fix this.

Hey Setsuko!\"  Someone called out, Seijuro could tell by the voice that it was the theatre's shop runner and Wind Division member Komachi.  Seijuro hoped his lack of being able to respond would set off some alarms for Komachi, but sadly that didn't seem to cross the young capitalists mind when she saw a money making opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Setsuko, you're looking fantastic in the costume!  You're really pulling it off!  Do you mind posing for a few bromides for the shop?  It'll be great advertising for your first leading show.\"  Komachi said this as though it would be a treat for Seijuro, but the last thing he wanted to do was have bromides made of him, especially in the very revealing Arabian costume.  Seijuro again hoped his lack of response would imply something was very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again it was bad luck for Seijuro since Itsuki could here this exchange from her hidden room and it was making her fangirl out.  \"AAAAAAAAHHHH Setsuko's getting her first official bromides made right now!!!!  I wish I could watch it happen!  Aww, but there are too many people around, I can't leave my spot without getting caught.  Oh well.\"  Itsuki said holding the Setsuko doll, \"At least I can pretend.\"<br>\r\n________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro felt himself turning to face Komachi's general direction and felt his mouth say, \"I'd love to pose for you!  We can spread my bromide all over the world and show everyone what the Flower Division is made of!\"  Seijuro was not saying that internally, <i>NOOOOOOOOO!!!  I don't want anyone to see what I'm made of in this outfit!</i>\".  But the enthusiastic answer is what Komachi heard and so she got to work and while she took real bromides of Setsuko, Itsuki was posing her doll in all sorts of alluring poses that the fans would absolutely go nuts over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Komachi had finished and was actually blushing a little as she said, \"Thanks for that Setsuko.  I don't know how many of these we can actually put on sale for the public eyes, but I'll make sure to send you the ones we can't use for your own private collection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Itsuki daydreamed over what Setsuko's actual bromides would look like and Seijuro felt a level of shame he didn't know was possible after what his body had just done, someone else came by looking for Setsuko.</span></div></div>",

Oh well, at least she had the model theater for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A star should advertise herself outside of course!\" Itsuki didn't have a model of all of Tokyo, just the theater itself.

He landed directly outside the theater, still within the doll's range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there stiff as a board as people began to walk by, many staring at the woman dressed in the strange costume. Why wasn't he doing anything? Had the person controlling him just not decided what he should do yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cursed himself for thinking that, as whoever had the doll now had made their decision.

Eventually whoever was controlling the doll had him stop and he was forced to say \"Make sure to come see my show!\" He also winked at the end to the crowd, he supposed the doll made him do that too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the crowd had dispersed and few were left standing there Seijuro saw that one of the people who had come to watch him was an acquaintance of his, although not from the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice dance\" ____ said to Seijuro, either genuinely or jokingly</span></div></div>",

The captain of the Shanghai Combat Revue, friend rice master, and one of the few people who knew that Setsuko was actually Seijuro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang walked up to Seijuro who was still being controlled, but was stiff as a board at the moment and told his favorite customer, \"I've got to admit, I'm impressed.  When I figured out who you were AND that you were going to be the lead in the next show I just assumed it was going to be a disaster.  But you're really committed to this being a woman thing 100%.\"  Yang gave Seijuro a thumbs up, \"That's what makes you a great man and a great leader.  I know the girls don't know what you're doing, but if they did know I'm sure they'd be proud of their captain for his commitment.  That dancing just now and in THAT costume?  Wow!  I never in a million years would have guessed it was you doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Because it wasn't me.</i>\".

You go Setsuko!\"  Yang said before walking off in admiration of Seijuro's commitment to the Flower Division and Seijuro just saw one of his hopes of help walking off leaving him to wonder, \"<i>Do I really act so strange on a normal day that nobody notices I'm behaving out of character?</i>\".

While playing with this new Setsuko doll was real, her true passion laid with Bromides and she needed to ask Komachi if she could pre-order all of Setsuko's now. She was the Flower Division's biggest fan, so she should be the first to order them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling out of her hidden room, doll still in hand, she saw Setsuko standing in the lobby. Not only that, she was in the same outfit she had put the doll in! See, she knew Setsuko perfectly already! She even knew exactly what outfit she would want to wear today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabid fangirl ran up to the newest member of the Flower Division to gloat about her knowledge. \"Squeeeee! Setsuko, Setsuko! You wooon't believe what happened!\" Itsuko began to go on a fangirl speech, however Seijuro's eyes were on something else, the doll in her hand! \"So like I was walking to the theater, because it's the most amazing place in the world and a bird dropped something on my head, SPLAT! But it was actually good luck and not bad luck, because it was this doll of you!\" Itsuki began to go over her day and the pieces all began to fit together for Seijuro<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I see you wearing the same outfit I put your  doll in! I'm like, the best Setsuko fan ever already! I even guessed what you would wear!\" Itsuki had finally finished her story, Seijuro couldn't get mad at her, she clearly had no clue that her playing around was controlling the real him. Now he just needed her to realize she did and put it down so he could go back to normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey, Setsuko, say something!\" Itsuki was waiting for Setsuko to compliment her for being such a devoted fan, but she just stood there stiff. Itsuki held the doll close to her \"Are you mad at me for having this prototype doll?\" Both Itsuki and Seijuro said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking in confusion, Itsuki decided to try something crazy. She moved the doll's arm, and Setsuko did the same! \"Woooooah!\" Was all she could say, this doll didn't just look like Setsuko, it controlled her! However, upon this realization, Itsuki made another \"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for you to actually fight Anastasia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Good, good, now free me! Wait, that's the only thing you're sorry for?!'</i> Seijuro thought, still unable to move<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItsuki looked at the doll, she knew the right thing to do right now. She had to stop controlling Setsuko and probably get rid of the doll. However, something about being able to control a Flower Division star was very alluring, it wouldn't be too wrong if she controlled Setsuko for a while longer, would it?</span></div></div>",

That was unbecoming behavior for their #1 fan.  So Itsuki took one last look at the one of a kind doll and gave it to Seijuro who for the first time in too long had control of his body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooo HOOOOO!  I'm back baby!\"  Seijuro did a little victory dance for a second before he was reminded of his clothing and body situation by some unexpected jiggling.  He immediately stopped and ran behind a certain to cover himself.  Itsuki followed and said, \"Oh, I guess I'm sorry for having you dress like that, but you look so beautiful!  You're like a diamond in the crown that is the Grand Imperial Theatre!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks Itsuki,\"  Seijuro said, \"But I'm going to go back to my room and change.\"  <i>'And forget today ever happened'</i>. Seijuro swore to himself.  Itsuki heard the embarrassment in Setsuko's words and it broker her heart.  \"Did...did I...Oh no!  I made you sad!  I made the latest greatest member of the Flower Division feel bad!  I'm the worst!  I'm the lowest of the low!  I'm worse than the dirt on your shoes!  I'm worse than Reiji!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's not go that far.\"  Seijuro said, he was a bit annoyed at everything Itsuki had made him do today, but it wasn't malicious or even on purpose.  Seijuro sighed, he knew what he had to do.  Mustering up all of his energy and will power from his very spiritual core he looked at Itsuki with fire in his eyes and said, \"NO!  You are our number 1 fan!  You're a big and important reason why the girls go perform out there for every show.  And I promise when I make my debut, I'll be thinking of YOOOUUU!\"  Seijuro did his best to mimic some of the poses Itsuki had put him in earlier.  Suddenly sparkles seemed to light up Itsuki's eyes, \"Oh...oh Setsuko!!!!\"  And she gave Seijuro a big hug that Seijuro kindly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Itsuki finished letting it all out, she looked up to Seijuro and asked, \"Hey Setsuko...if it's ok with you, with your permission of course...could I play with that doll again sometime.  Just for a little while.\"  Seijuro wasn't sure, if he wasn't afraid of magic consequences he'd throw it the doll in the furnace right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could answer Kaoru approached him, \"Whatever you did while advertising worked, we've had a huge spike in ticket sales over the last half hour.  Whatever you did I want you to do it every day until the show opens, got it?\"  It wasn't a request.  Kaoru didn't even wait for an answer as she walked off.  Realizing the mess he was in he turned to Itsuki, \"You can work with me using the doll.  Just to advertise like 5 minutes a day.\"  That was all Itsuki needed to live out her fantasies through Setsuko and she ran off as though she were floating.<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few weeks before the show opened the city was abuzz.  Thanks to the unorthodox almost crazy dancing outside the theatre each day (thanks to Itsuki), people were hotly anticipating the debut of Setsuko on stage.  And Seijuro was nervous about it himself.  Every day was a full day of learning lines and choreography.  Even when he was taking bath, sometimes with some of the other girls, all he could think about were lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife wasn't just different and crazy for Seijuro.  Arthur was adjusting to his new role. He thought he'd just be the captain of the Flower Division and fight demons.  But demon attacks were at an all time low thankfully so Sumire had him on other duties including janitor, ticket taker, and his least favorite role as the brand new Mrs. Peanut mascot, which was just Peanut with lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls of the theatre were having a great time bonding with Setsuko, sure she didn't really talk about her origins a lot, but that just left room for the girls to gossip which most of them did enjoy quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the day had arrived.  Seijuro was in the changing room with the girls (Karou was there standing over Seijuro to make sure he didn't peek).  The theatre was sold out, what could possibly go wrong?</span></div></div>",

This wasn't uncommon, the girls would always recieve gifts from adoring fans. To his surprise however, there were two gifts for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first wasn't too noteworthy, it was a box of assorted chocolates from Itsuki. Every show she would send a box of various snacks to each members of the Flower Division. She must have thought Setsuko was a chocolate person<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second however, sent chills down his spine. It was a bouquet of flowers, a small box, and a letter. Not wanting to keep the contents of the box and letter a mystery, he opened them. Starting with the box <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a gorgeous broach with a green jewel in the center. Seijuro couldn't believe it, in the past he had only seen expensive gifts like this sent to the theater's top star, Anastasia, and here he was receiving one before his first show. Hands shaking he opened the letter to read it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dear Se***o</i> the letter began. The name was smudged. While it more likely than not said Setsuko, Seijuro couldn't help but notice the possibility of it saying Seijuro as well <i>'I have been thinking about asking you out for a while now, but haven't been able to bring myself too. However after seeing your dancing the past few days I thought I should at least try asking like this. Please come to the front of the theater wearing the broach if you want to try one date'</i> the letter ended without saying who it was from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was panicking. 'Setsuko' had just been asked out on a date! He knew this was always a possibility, but he wasn't ready to accept it. Who could have sent it anyway? There was always the chance it was a stanger, but Seijuro chose to narrow his thoughts to people he knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur, Reiji, and Yang all came to mind. Yang had not only shown up the first day 'Setsuko' was out dancing, but many of the following days as well! Arthur was on duty as Mrs. Peanut for a few days,  and Reiji had come out one day to laugh at him <i>'Ack, and each day Itsuki had me blow a kiss! What if that sent them the wrong signals!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Seijuro could think about the mysterious secret admirer, Sakura and the others called for him. It was show time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Setsuko's' first performance was met with applause, after all that training Seijuro was able to put on a fantastic show. He would be proud of himself if his mind wasn't racing a million miles a minute trying to solve the identity of the secret admirer <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fellow Flower Division members congratulated Setsuko, but his heart wasn't into it. He needed to find out who this secret admirer was as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the broach from the box and put it on, shaking <i>'Relax Seijuro, it's not a date, it's not a date. You're just going to figure out who this guy is and go back to your room to die'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro made his way to the front of the theater, the night sky shining with starlight \"Wow, how romantic\" he found himself saying \"No, no, no! Don't think about romance! Keep your head together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro looked around and finally the identity of the secret admirer was revealed....</span></div></div>",

Anyone else I'd get, I was amazing tonight, but you know...the stuff.\"  Seijuro said looking around making sure nobody could hear his true identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's me, let talk where it's quiet and I'll explain.\"  The two walked around town until the found a nice and quiet secluded bench.  They both sat down next to each other silently as though waiting for the other to talk.  Finally Seijuro asked, \"Well?  What's the big deal?  Why ask me out on a date when you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get to it, I just have to find the words.\"  Yang said, he seemed to be holding something in.  He looked at Seijuro with fire in his eyes that didn't match the tone Seijuro expected.  \"Seijuro...I really didn't like you.  In fact I hated you and what you represented.  The Flower Division used to be a disgrace and instead of me getting acknowledge for picking up their slack, you get hired to try and save them.  I thought you and the Flower Division were a bunch of kids playing pretend, but then something happened.  You beat me.  I thought I was at the top of my game and just a few weeks into the job you surpassed me.  And then you lapped me by saving the freaking world!  But that just inspired me, I had a goal, and I wanted to get there and pass you.  Or at worst be by you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro felt uncomfortable, he'd never been good with talking about feelings so he let Yang talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the craziest thing happened.  All the crazy stuff you did finally came back to kick you in the butt and you get demoted and have your sex changed.  To be honest, when I found out I wasn't worried, I knew you'd still be a great fighter.  But now I see it's not just your fighting I've looked up to.  It's your passion.  The way you danced in the street for all to see.  It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever sen.  And tonight the way you acted on stage leaving yourself all out there, it was inspiring.  It made me...jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous?\"  Seijuro wondered what the heck Yang was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you've shown you have a passion and spirit that is off the charts, I thought I could compete with you as a fighter, but spirit wise?  I'm not even in the same league.  So that's why I asked you to come out here with me.\"  Yang stood up and got down on one knee and grabbed Seijuro's hand with a death grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the most amazing person I know Seijuro.  Your very aura excites me!  I want you to rub off on me!  I want us to become on as partners on the field of battle and life!  And who knows, maybe you'll find a little bit of me inside of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro's felt like he was about to pass out, \"Excite?  Rub off?  Partners?  Inside me?\"  Before Seijuro's brain could completely short circuit Yang finally got to the big question.</span></div></div>",

The only thing to drop faster than Yang was Seijuro's heartrate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeeeeeh?!\" Seijuro shouted in surprise and ended up on the ground himself. \"That- that's it?! That's all you had to ask?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, is that all?! It took every fiber of my being to ask something that serious!\" Yang shouted back in retaliation <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but don't you think with your wording, and the flowers, and the atmosphere it looked like you were going to ask something completely different?!\" Seijuro pointed out all the obviously romantic things about this scenario<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I wanted to marry you?!\" Yang stood up shocked \"Fat chance Seijuro! You're not that good a tipper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bickered back and forth for a while, what seemed to start as a romantic meeting almost ended in a brawl. Before fists flew however, Seijuro had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you can be my apprentice\" Seijuro finally answered Yang's initial question<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Chinese man was estatic \"Thank you! I promise I'll learn from you the best I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll learn from me, but first there's something you need to do. A lesson in humility\" Seijuro smirked remembering the words Sumire had told him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I'll do anything!\" Yang was completely oblivious to what Seijuro meant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to the theater and tell Reiji to 'use the machine on you'. He'll know what you mean. I'll meet you there.\" Seijuro gave instructions, to which Yang nodded and ran off. Once Yang ran off Seijuro pulled out his Kimeratron and began to text Yui <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Do you have any spare outfits?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, why? I don't think they'd fit your new body Setsuko'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They're not for me, I got a new waitress for your restaurant?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really? Thank you! We have been short handed lately'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Meet me at the theater with the clothes in twenty minutes'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the next part of Seijuro's plan was set in stone. It was time to teach Yang a lesson in playing with someone's heart.</span></div></div>",

It's not that crazy girl obsessed with your theatre is it?  I don't want her scaring off our customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Itsuki's not crazy she's just...enthusiastic. And as for the new girl she'll be ready...\"  Suddenly Seijuro received a message, he pulled it out and read a bunch of curse words from his new apprentice.  \"She's ready now.\"  Seijuro smiled and escorted Yui into the theatre's workshop where Chinese girl brown hair and a long ponytail was treating to kick Reiji's head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is supposed to teach you humility.  Killing my friend is not humility.\"  Seijuro said as he entered.  Yang turned and started yelling, \"I wanted to learn how to be a stronger leader and fighter from you, not how to put on lipstick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, not sounding very humble.  I'm thinking this lesson is going to take a long time to learn.  Ah, I believe introductions are in order, Huang Yui meet...Yan Xiao.\"  Seijuro smile as Yui approached the new girl.  \"Yang?\"  She asked and he reluctantly grumbled yes.  The next few minutes were spent trying to get Yui off of the floor as she laughed her head off.  Literally, her mech was being stored in the workshop and she knocked it's head off in her laughing rampage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finally calmed down she offered Yang the outfit she brought, she stopped sniggering long enough to say, \"Here's your uniform...mam...ha. Thank you for joining the Shanghai Combat Revue waitress staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waitress?  What is this, some kind of joke?\"  Yang asked Seijuro since Yui was once again out of commission with an over exhorted funny bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro shook his head, \"No joke.  When I got here my first jobs were ticket taking, clover picking, script reading before I eventually was...drafted into taking a role on stage.  You don't start at the top as head chef, you were already there.  You need to work your way back up from the bottom and learn to appreciate every single aspect of your craft even more than you already do.\"  Seijuro said these relatively wise words (considering where they were coming from) and Yang saw his argument.  This in a sense, was what he was asking for when he asked Seijuro to be his master.  A decision he was already regretting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll do.  Yui!\"  Yui finally managed to stand up on her own two feet with some help from Reiji.  \"You're in charge of the kitchen, I'm counting on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui saluted positively to her captain in Chinese, \"<i>Shi!</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang reluctantly unfolded the waitress uniform and held it up to his body and sighed, Yui smiled at Yang and said, \"Don't be glum, it'll be fun!  We'll be dressed the same, I'll even do your hair like mine so it doesn't hit the customers.  We'll be like twins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a big difference between you two.\"  Reiji said with a perverted smile as he looked at the two brown haired girl's chests.  Yang, like Seijuro, in the transformation had proven to be rather gifted in that area.  Yui suddenly stuttered and blushed hot red before shouting out, \"PERVERTS!\"  And she slapped Reiji, Yang, and Seijuro on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd I do?  Oh boy, I'd better catch up to her, I don't want her to be too mad at me during the breakfast rush.\"  With that Yang left the theatre to chase after Yui leaving Seijuro and Reiji alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro squinted at Reiji suspiciously.  \"That device that transformed me and Yang.  It just changed our genders.  You didn't add any other...enhancments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  No!  I'd never do such a thing!\"  Reiji said as he innocently walked back to his workbench.</span></div></div>",

Did Sumire know he just had Reiji change Yang's gender too? Was she going to punish him for it? Without a word he hung his head and walked silently to her office. When he got there he was ready to be reprimanded <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock though, Sumire didn't start criticizing him or give him some new punishment \"Seijuro, a month ago when you underwent your transformation you took it as an opportunity to use the baths with punishment.\" She started with the bad he had done \"However since then you have grown. You've been taking your duties as an actress seriously every day at rehearsal, you were willing to use your own body to help the theater's sales, and you seem to have taken the lesson well enough to heart to try teaching it to someone else.\" Sumire smirked and went over Seijuro's positives, Seijuro was just grateful she didn't realize half the reason he transformed Yang was payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfolding and pointing her fan Sumire spoke again \"I believe it is time for Seijuro Kamiyama to make his return to the theater!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WA-HOOOOOOOO!\" Seijuro yelled ecstatically, however he realized something was wrong \"Wait, but tonight was only Setsuko's first performance. What about the following shows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohoho!\" Sumire did her trademark laugh \"Naturally you'll have to become Setsuko every night until this show stops running. That should also give you plenty of time to think of 'Setsuko's' goodbye to the girls\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes Seijuro was in the hangar hugging his male body \"Home, sweet home!\" He said happily. Before Reiji could make any snarky comment Seijuro ran back to the elevator and to the theater lobby \"I'M HOME EVERYONE!\" He yelled to the Flower Division <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of his voice made everyone run to him to greet him, every member of the Flower Division was estatic that their captain was back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, where's Setsuko? She should be here to welcome you back!\" Sakura looked around for her onew friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I actually met her on my way out.\" Seijuro began spinning a tale \"She had some kind of family emergency and needed to go. She'll be back before tomorrow's show however\" Sakura was sad about Setsuko leaving without a word, but at least she would be back soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his welcome back party, Seijuro caught sight of Arthur. Part of him wanted to kick him out for being the replacement captain, however Seijuro instead extended his hand for a handshake \"Thank you for watching over everyone while I was gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur accepted his handshake \"The job was more difficult than I expected, but it will he worth it for the reward?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reward?\" Seijuro asked confused, he had never heard anything about this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in exchange for being the Flower Division's temporary captain, she said I could have the chance to fight you one on one with our spirit armor\" Arthur explained. Seijuro smirked, of course his self proclaimed rival wanted that \"I will be in Tokyo for another week, before I leave I want that duel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll get it.\" Seijuro released the handshake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Seijuro did his theater rounds, Arthur was still staying in his room, so for the next week Seijuro would have to stay in 'Setsuko's' room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done with his morning duties, Seijuro decided it was about time he went to check up on his new apprentice.  He wondered if he should go alone or bring another Flower Division member with him. Both as a way of bonding with one of them after being 'gone' so long and to see if Yang could keep his gender swap a secret<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Seijuro chose to....</span></div></div>",

He'd gone with Sakura, and although she didn't enjoy the food she shot lasers out of her face like him, she seemed to still love the food a great deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, how about to celebrate me being back, how about we go get some that golden fried rice we love so much?\"  Seijuro asked his childhood friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeehh?  Me?  Oh, yes, yes of course I'd love that.\"  Sakura said with pink cheeks.  As the two walked to the resteraunt Seijuro was excited to see his apprentice and Sakura had her own thoughts on her mind.  <i>'He just got back and asked me out to eat!  Just me, one on one!  Does that mean anything?  Did he finally remember the promise he made all those years ago?' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the restaurant, Sakura was surprised to not be greeted by Yui, but some new girl.  She too was short and with brown hair, but her uniform seemed to barely fit.  The top half had to be opened up to show off her cleavage which Sakura didn't want to admit made her a little envious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at Seijuro and pointed, \"Ahh, you're you!  And you're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro gave a victorious pose, \"Yes I'm back, and I'm here to check in on you.  One table for two please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked wide eyed at Seijuro, he was talking like he knew this mysterious girl with big boobs.  How long had he known her.  Are they...seeing each other?  Was Seijuro rubbing her in his face?  Sakura's mind was racing a mile a minute as new girl Yan Xiou sat Seijuro and Sakura down and called to the back, \"TWO OF THE HOUSE SPECIALS!\"  As Sakura and Seijuro sat down a mad laugh came from the kitchen.  \"AT LAST THE DRAGON OF FIRE IS MINE TO CONTROL!!  FLAMES!  INFUES EACH GRAIN WITH YOUR HEAT!  HAVE THEM ABSORB ALL OF MY LOVE!  ALL OF MY FLAVORS!  MWAHHAHAHAHA!!!!\"  Seijuro smiled, at least Yui seemed to be making the most of her time in the kitchen.  Yang sighed but didn't say anything else as he went off to help the other customers.  Seijuro was pleased by Yang's work effort.  The restaurant was even busier than normal, probably because word of a new beautiful waitress had spread, and he was working his butt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sakura couldn't help but notice how much Seijuro was staring at the waitress.  Her eyes were starting to narrow with fury, if Seijuro wasn't carful he was about to be in for a world her hurt.</span></div></div>",

Last night?? Did?? Playing?? Body?? Those words in sequence were the last straw for Sakura. She slammed her hands down on the table and excused herself outside. Seijuro was about to folloe her, but a glare from her sent him right back to his seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Sakura felt like crying. She couldn't believe that not only did Seijuro seem to have a girlfriend that he hadn't told her about until now, but he was practically rubbing it in her face. Their first meeting just <i>had</i> to involve this new girl wearing a cleavage exposing outfit, huh Seijuro?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of waiting outside Sakura looked back in the window, she couldn't hear what was going on but she saw Seijuro laughing to himself about something as the new girl walked away from him. Sakura's sadness was slowly turning into anger as she looked at Seijuro and the new girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura was putting her focus on the two of them, she hadn't noticed a strange feeling bubbling up inside of her, a warmth she would often feel when piloting her Koubu. Spiritual energy was piling up inside of her and a pinkish glow surrounded her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the bubbling energy released and Sakura was temporarily blinded by a flash of light. When the light faded, something was undeniably different, but an outsider wouldn't be able to tell.

Somehow she had become Seijuro's waitress girlfriend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking outside she saw the girl in her body freaking out, she knew she should probably go out there and try to fix this. However, out of the corner of her eye she saw Seijuro gazing at her. That must be a lover's gaze! (It wasn't). For now, she decided to be a little mischievous and just wait the tables as if nothing was wrong. Being Seijuro's girlfriend for a day, or two, or a month wouldn't be too greedy of her would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Yang was panicking, one moment he was delivering the specials and the next he was outside in another girl's body!

However, before he did he caught glance of Seijuro. Although disappointed, he didn't seem to realize that a swap had happened. It was then that Yang got an idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could get out of this waitress lesson in 'humility' by having Sakura stay as him for a while, although it was still humiliating to have her in his body. He could also get back at Seijuro for turning him into a girl against his will, he had suspicions Seijuro and Sakura were dating.

Heh, maybe it's my manly charms now that I'm myself again.'</i>. Seijuro thought jokingly.

Yang rationalized his crazy motivations, it seemed the gender swap followed by Sakura swapping his body might have made him more reckless than he normally would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's eyes were filled with Yan's usual fire as she saw the occupant of her body all over Seijuro.  It didn't matter who's body this...pervy girl was in, she was going to be all over Seijuro!  At least that's what she thought.  She marched over to Seijuro's table and unfortunately tripped throwing steamed buns all over the place.  Seijuro was both amused and disappointed by what he was seeing.  \"Yan, would you like to have a little talk in the back room to help get your head on straight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"  Both Sakura and Yang said not wanting to give the other private time with Seijuro.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stared daggers at Yang while he simply stuck his tongue out at Sakura to show he wasn't bothered by the body switch (he actually really was).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Seijuro was clueless as usual, when it came to reading the signs of the women who seemed to be fighting over him.

Was she aiming for him?! \"What is wrong with you?!\" He stood up, prepared to fight Sakura if he had too<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?! What were you thinking?!\" Sakura yelled back, also getting ready to fight this girl in her body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro had no idea what was going on, but he onew he had to step in and stop this fight. Before he could ask why Yang and Sakura were being so hostile toward each other however, Yui began to yell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yan! Look at what you've done!\" Yui had finally exited the kitchen and saw the restaurant, covered in spilled food, broken plates, and now soup from the amount of times 'Yang' had tripped up. The morning rush hadn't even ended yet, but a majority of customers had left after not receiving their food on time. Those who remained did so because they saw a cat fight brewing \"Clean this up right now! I thought you cared about this place!\" Yui practically rhrew a broom at Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but\" Sakura stammered and was about to explain the body swap, however before she could Yang had grabbed Seijuro by the arm and pulled him out of his seat. If Sakura wanted to burn him in her own body just to get back at him, he was going to make her regret it. \"Let's get out of here, Seijuro. I need some new clothes after <i>she</i> ruined this outfit.\" Putting on his best Sakura impression he motioned to the soup all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did some of Sakura's long hair got in his face \"Oh, and maybe we can even stop for a haircut on the way back to the theater\" he stuck his tounge out at Sakura as he walked out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Sakura yelled and tried to go after them, but Yui held her back. The only thing she could do was watch that new waitress girl walk away with Seijuro</span></div></div>",

Sakura was just sweeping mindlessly, after sweeping a puddle of soup for a few minutes Yui came over, \"Hey?  Are you ok?  You seem distracted.  Are you really that mad at Seijuro for all of this?

Arthur from the London Division was currently here, having been temporary captain when 'Setsuko' was still around. Seeing his girlfriend flirting around with a rival captain should make Seijuro freak out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, how to get Seijuro to come to the lobby \"Oh, I know! Azami!\" Yang had said his idea, but upon saying her name the little ninja appeared out of nowhere. He yelled and jumped back on surprise <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need?\" Azami asked, awaiting an order<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining his composure, Yang told Azami \"Tell Seijuro to be in the lobby in five minutes. Oh! And don't tell him I was the one who called you!\" If Seijuro knew then the fact that it was deception could become clear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Azami nodded and jumped out of the room, Yang made his way to Arthur's temporary quarters. Thankfully Arthur was in his room and answered Yang's knocks \"Sakura, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me to the lobby right now!\" Yang said and practically dragged Arthur out of his room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two were in the lobby Arthur spoke up again \"What is it you need, Sakura?\" He asked politely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stand there and wait, you'll see.\" Yang said less politely back as he watched the stairs and door, waiting for Seijruo to appear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter far too long a time of awkwardly standing around with Arthur silently, Yang finally saw Seijuro coming downstairs to the lobby. Once he was positive they were in Seijuro's sights he grabbed Arthur by the arm like he had done with Seijuro in the restaurant \"Oooooh, Arthur! You're such a manly man. The <i>best captain</i>\" I've ever had. Putting extra emphasis on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-Sakura?!\" Seijuro and Arthur both exclaimed in shock at Sakura's behavior. Did she have some kind of doll controlling her like 'Setsuko'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Se- Se- worse captain! I was just telling Arthur about how cool he was and how any girl would be lucky to have him!\" Yang might have been laying it on too deep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur soon pushed Yang off him. He nearly stomped off in rage but kept his cool, instead walking away calm. This was the second time a member of the Flower Division was grabbing onto him and suddenly proclaiming love, and he wasn't having it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro for his part was just as taken back, what was wrong with Sakura? Her body movements didn't seem to imply she was being controlled by a doll, did he offend her somehow?</span></div></div>",

We have our second performance tonight and even though Setsuko won't be here til performance time I can still work scenes with you.  Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was about to complain saying he didn't have any idea how to act, but that might just be perfect.  He could go on stage as Sakura and either embarras her or do well and REALLY fool Seijuro so badly he'll admit defeat when the reveal will be made.  Yang put on the sweetest smile he could, which looked more like an Cheshire grin and said, \"Of course Anastasia, lead the way.\"  And so Yang went off to his own private acting seminar with Anastasia.<br>\r\n___________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust moments after 'Sakura' left, Arthur and Seijuro were standing in the lobby confused by what had just happened.  \"Sakura's behavior just now was rather unbecoming.  You don't think Claris has created another of her special dolls do you?\"  Arthur asked.  Seijuro shook his head, \"I doubt it, she promised never to make one without permission again, and I doubt Sakura gave her permission to make her act like that.  No, something odd is in the air.  I was just at Yang's restaurant and he...I mean the waitress there was acting odd as well.  Maybe it's something in the food, I should go check.\"  Seijuro was about to leave the theatre when the door swung so violently from the outside it knocked Seijuro into the wall so hard it left a Seijuro shaped mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she?!\"  An angry Sakura said looking around the theatre for her body.  As she looked around she saw something that made her gasp.  She ran up to Komachi's store and saw all of her Kimonos were on display.  \"What's going on?  Why are my...I mean those Kimonos here instead of the closet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKomachi couldn't hide her grin from all the capitalism, \"It's great isn't it?  Sakura donated all of her clothes to the theatre to sell!  This will be a huge boon for the Wind Division.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeehhhh!\"  Sakura said stunned by what this pervy waitress had done to sabotage her, well two could play that game.  \"Well I want you to sell all my clothes too!\"  Sakura said and started to tug at the very tight waitress outfit that was barely covering her body as it was.  Komachi stopped Sakura from doing this, not wanting to get the police called for a naked girl running around the building, \"NO!  I'm sorry miss, I appreciate you wanting to help, but I don't think we should be selling random fans clothing...I think.\"  Komachi stopping to think for a minute before shaking her head, \"No, I definitely can't get away with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right there?\"  Sakura heard the voice of Arthur.  He was helping up Seijuro from his encounter with the door.  Suddenly Sakura figured out another way to enact her vengeance upon the pervy waitress who was still doing who knows what with her body.</span></div></div>",

If Seijuro was willing to be all lovey around another girl in front of her, then she would show him how it feels to have someome you love fooling around with someone else! Thankfully she was in the body of Seijuro's girlfriend and in the perfect position to do just that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Arthur had pulled Seijuro off the ground he heard the sound of rapid footsteps. He turned to see an unfamiliar chinese girl running at him full throttle. Before he could react or even gasp the girl jumped at him and he was on the floor being hugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned her head to Seijuro to make sure she could keep an eye on his reactions \"Oh, sweet Arthur! This is like love at first sight! I cannot believe there used to be others who caught my eye!\" Her words may have been directed at Arthur, but she looked at Seijuro the whole time, who just stood there unable to comprehend what was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmlp me\" Arthur tried to call to Seijuro for help, he was being smothered by this strange Chinese girl's breasts. He had somehow gone his entire visit here without needing to deal with stalkers only for this to happen on his last week<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing his friend/rival's plea Seijuro stopped being dumbstruck and tried to pull Sakura off of him \"Get, off Yan!\" Seijuro said desperately <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Yan! So that's this harlot's name!'</i> Sakura mental  note of that \"Why, because you can't stand to see me so close to him?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What on earth is Yang talking about?!'</i> Seijuro couldn't understand why he was acting like this, he already ruled out another doll being at play. Was this some strange way for Yang to get back at him for turning him into a doll? However there was something much more important in his mind right now \"No! Just look at him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned her head away from Seijuro and back to the man she had in a tight hug. Arthur had turned purple from lack of air! \"AHHH!\" Sakura released him \"I'm so sorry Arthur!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was laying on the ground unconscious, Seijuro thought for a second he saw winged teacups flying around his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just look at him!\" Anastasia and Yang heard Seijuro yell from the stage as they were about to begin rehearsing. Hearing the captain yell they hurried to the lobby <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Sakura hugging Arthur, Yang could tell she was trying the same thing that he was! It seemed two could play at this game, however he could play better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clenched a fist as he saw his body and Seijuro arguing about knocking out Arthur. Sakura didn't seem to say anything that gave away the body swap, but all the girly stuff she was spouting from his body was making him mad. What did Seijuro think about how he was acting, it clearly wasn't normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting Sakura out and no longer embarrassing him, Yang thought of an idea to scare her into silence. He walked over to her, she gasped upon seeing her own body wearing a theater costume, Yan really had given away all her kimonos!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's about time you left\" Yang said with no nonsense \"But, you were an excellent waitress today and I am soooo sorry for my behavior my the restaurant\" Yang started lying \"So why don't you come to tonight's show, it'll be one of the most memorable performances of my career\" Yang gave a devilish smile and Sakura was scared stiff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing the true intention behind 'Sakura's' words Anastasia agreed, seeing the temporary captain knocked out \"Yes, it would he best if you left for now. You're lucky that Sakura is kind, most establishments would have banned you for life for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked at the two girls in front of her, she knew she had to say <i>something</i>, but her mind blanked and she just retreated from the theater afraid of what Yan would do in her body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Sakura returned to the theater as a customer. Most people were here to enjoy the show, but she was here to see what her body would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't all she was here to do. She had brought a big jar of money and Komachi was about to have the greatest sales day ever. This seemed to be all the waitress' savings and she was ready to use it to buy back her kimono.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her Yang had planned to renovate the restaurant with that money, a whole year worth of savings was now giving him a private kimono collection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcstatic, Komachi went to deliver all the kimonos to the Shanghai Division's restaurant. Sakura sighed, at least after the show she would be able to wear something other than this revealing waitress uniform</span></div></div>",

Both of them were ready to put an end to this and were about to shake hands for an apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just before peace was made, Komachi walked by counting all her profits and saw her knew favorite customer \"Ah, it's you! Thank you so much for ya' business!\" Komachi began \"I delivered all the kimonos to the address you said. That Yui girl nearly burst when she saw how much you bought! Hey, is this a bad time to tell you about my no returns policy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang couldn't believe what he was hearing, Sakura bought all her kimonos back as him? Where did she even get the- he was halfway through his thought when he realized exactly where she got the money. She must have used his renovation savings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang put down the hand he extended to Sakura as a peace offerment and began to shout \"How could you spend that money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura put her hand as well, Yan must have been crazy if she didn't understand why! \"Me?! How could you give away those kimonos in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you get all over Arthur right in front of Seijuro!\" Yang voiced another frustration he had with Sakura in his body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you get all close to Seijuro in front of me!\" Sakura yelled back, unaware that Yang had also flirted with Arthur in her body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro sighed as the two argued back and forth. He had no idea why they were so mad at each other, but clearly he was going to need to he a mediator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step closer to the arguing pair was a mistake for Seijuro, as once Yang saw him he gave Sakura a devilish smirk \"Watch this.\" He marched right up to 'Setsuko', and grabbed her face. Bringing her in for a kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro's eyes were as wide as dinner plates. Why had Sakura just kissed Setsuko?! Did Sakura have feelings for Setsuko that he was just oblivious to?? Did Yang tell her Setsuko was really him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason people stared as 'Sakura' kissed her fellow Flower Division member. The show had only just ended so there were still people around the theater. Yang released Seijuro from the kiss as soon as he heard a camera click, he could imagine the newspapers talking about 'Sakura and Setsuko's' relationship now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could believe Yan had just kissed her friend! This perverted waitress had just had her first kiss for her and probably stole Setsuko's first kiss too! How would she explain this to Seijuro? Would Seijuro even want to be with her now or would he be offended being the 'second choice'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if this waitress was going to put her in a bad situation with Seijuro, then she would as well! Once Setsuko had recovered from the sudden kiss, Sakura grabbed her and gave her her own kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was about to pass out. Yang was kissing him now?! Why?! Sure his Setsuko body was very attractive if he did say so himself, but if Yang wanted to kiss it why wouldn't he do so the other night?? And wasn't he mad at him earlier?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura heard another camera click as well and imagined tommorow's news herself <b>'Stupid boobed waitress steals kisses'.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang and Sakura didn't say another word to each other, the stomped off in seperate directions, Yang to Sakura's room and Sakura to the Shanghai Division's base. She had thought earlier that this body swapped rivalry would lead to their mutual destruction, now all she was thinking was how to make Yan give up first<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura thought of ways to get back at Yan ranging from quitting her job to having Claris use some magic, Yang thoughts of ways to get back even harder at her ranging from an embarrassing haircut to going to Mikasa Park in her underwear <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Seijuro just sat on the ground in a feeble position, wondering if he had somehow ended up in one of Claris' romance novels</span></div></div>",

He started by going into the Grand Imperial Theatre's kitchen and actually cooking some decent meals that probably never came out of there.  He'd never even seen a chef in the theatre now that he thought of it.  He was enjoying himself so much in the kitchen he made breakfast for everyone who walked by without them asking or without even thinking about it.  Soon a small crowd was in the dining area not talking, but either moaning with pleasure, sending sparks into the sky, and for one poor soul their clothes exploded off of them.  But Yang didn't really notice, he was just doing what he loved for the sake of doing it.  It had been a while since he'd cooked so much when it wasn't his job it was very...nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he did notice Seijuro wasn't coming by.  \"Heh, he's probably avoiding me after that kiss last night...oh god...I kissed Seijuro...\"  Yang proceeded to cook twice as hard and fast in order to try and get his mind off of that memory for as long as possible.  And Yang found that cooking that hard and fast was igniting his cooking passion in a way he hadn't expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm having a really good experience as Sakura.\"  Yang said to himself almost feeling bad he wasn't sabataging her right now, but then with a smile he turned the logic around.  \"Heh heh, since I cooked so well today, people will keep expecting Sakura to cook for them and she never will be able to match the cooking might of the Dragon shaming her!  Yes!  I'm getting revenge without even trying.\"  He continued cooking for a while until Kaoru informed him Reiji just delivered his new clothes to Sakura's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to finally wear some clothes he was comfortable in Yang ran off to Sakura's room.  Tossing off the old Alladin costume, Yang slipped into his new male Chinese clothing like they were an old shoe.  \"Ah, that feels much better.\"  Yang said as he did a few kung fu moves in his new green and black outfit.  After a few minutes of working out Yang took a few deep breaths.  \"Ah, just like old times in my old body.\"  Yang said as he wiped Sakura's bangs from his eyes, \"Well, almost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was at the moment Yang came up with his latest 'brilliant' idea on how to sabotage Sakura, all he needed was the right tool for the job.</span></div></div>",

He almost felt a bit bad about what he was planning to do as he saw her reflection in the mirror, but he had a good feeling she was doing something equally as bad to him. So long as he wasn't causing physical harm her was willing to take this as far as he could<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Yang to reach his destination \"Ah, perfect\" he said as he entered a hair salon. The stylist sat him down, seeing a girl with such nice hair they spoke of a standard shampooing and styling, however Yang interrupted them \"No, I want this.\" He held up a picture to them, the stylist went wide eyed with confusion, however Yang paid for the haircut and they went along with what the customer wanted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour a majority of Sakura's long, beautiful hair moved from attached to her head to laying on the ground. Once the deed was done, the stylist held a mirror up to Yang, still unsure why a girl who had spent so long growing her hair out would ask for this. \"It's perfect.\" Yang said with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the salon, Yang couldn't help but feel he didn't particularly resemble Sakura much anymore. In addition to his chinese men's clothes he was now sporting a fohawk instead of her normal hairstyle. It was too late to go back on either of those decisions now though <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what to do now, Sakura.\" Yang wasn't feeling done yet. He wanted Sakura begging for him to stop and make peace, and while a haircut was a good first step, he didn't feel like it was enough yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his first thoughts was interacting with Seijuro in front of her again, however after that kiss last night he wanted to stay as far away from Seijuro as possible for now, he was getting very reckless when around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa Memorial Park came to mind, it was a very public place and if one of the Flower Division's stars did something crazy there word would spread fast, she'd probably find out within the day and beg for peace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he thought about some of her personal relationships, he wasn't planning to ruin friendships or anything, but maybe making some members of the Flower Division mad at Sakura would be some nice payback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even if he didn't choose to do either of these things there were a million ways he could embarass Sakura in her body, he could think about this all day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it some thought Yang chose to....</span></div></div>",

So I think hit up Mikasa Park for a little while.  Sakura's new look deserves to be seen.\"  Yang said to himself as he ran his fingers through Sakura's lack of hair.  On his walk to the park Yang couldn't help but smile at all of the looks, points, and whispers he was getting.  \"If this keeps up, Sakura will here about this before I even get to the park for my performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the park, everyone there seemed to be going about their own day doing their own things.  Some people paying attention to the waves.  Some people paying attention to each other.  Something else would catch their attention very soon.  Yang went up the the gazebo in the middle of the park and climbed up their in a few seconds getting a few odd looks, but that wasn't enough attention to ruin Sakura's reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang took a deep breath and shouted from the bottom of his lungs, \"HEY LOOK UP HERE!!!  HEY!!  My name is Sakura!  I'm a star at the Imperial Theatre Review!  And I'm a big jerk!  I like to steal stuff from hard working people!  I like to try and ruin peoples lives!  I'm such a ditzy dummy!  I even like to kiss all the boys!  Tell everyone you know!!!!\"  Yang then proceeded to do an interpretive dance that looked like a drunk monkey swatting bugs out of the air.  Yangs plan seemed to work as everyone in the park was staring at him and leaving while talking about what they had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this doesn't make Sakura give up, apologize, and give my body back, I don't know what will.\"  Yang thought as he danced the day away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang kept repeating his little speech a couple of times throughout the day, more people would come by just to watch the weird performance that most people thought was some strange advertising for the theatre.  After a while, Yang finally saw someone he recognized who came to watch 'Sakura's little performance of a lifetime.</span></div></div>",

She was wearing one of her own kimonos on his girfllified body, but it seemed she hadn\u2019t thought about the difference in the chest area. The top of the kimono was loosened and a bit of cleavage could be seen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping down from the gazebo Yang cockily strutted up to Sakura \u201cWhat do you think of my new look?\u201d He asked with a pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was shaking with rage \u201cHow could you do that to my hair?! And what are you wearing?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh these?\u201d Yang motioned to his clothes \u201cYour clothes were just too girly for me. I thought I should have something much more comfortable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo girly? Sakura has no idea what this pervy waitress was talking about! She was a girl too, and the waitress outfit from yesterday was anything but masculine.  Suddenly a thought came to mind, she recognized the outfit her body was currently wearing, and there was someone who was mysteriously missing from the restaurant yesterday. \u201cWait, are you Yang?!\u201d She gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it!\u201d Yang said joyfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura breathed a sigh of relief that the person in her body probably wasn\u2019t a romantic rival for Seijuro\u2019s love. However, this relief didn\u2019t calm her anger. If she had learned this yesterday she may have calmed down, but after kissing Setsuko and the shouting in the park, she still felt the need to take this sabotaging all the way. If anything this just made getting back at Yang even easier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are you ready to beg forgiveness. Just ask me to stop and admit I\u2019m the better person and I\u2019ll stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop? Better person?\u201d Sakura asked \u201cNot a chance.\u201d She said determined to win this \u2018game\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019ll take months to grow my hair back! And maybe even longer to convince everyone I don\u2019t love Setsuko! I can\u2019t let you get away with this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Sakura knew who he was Yang got a new idea for how to get back at her, he did an obviously fake yawn \u201cMan, all that performing was just exhausting. I think I\u2019ll need a nice, long, bath to cool down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sakura yelled not wanting a guy to see her body naked, as she yelled her body appeared to be glowing pink again, how a body switch back did not happen, for Sakura wanted to stay as Yang longer to get back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura\u2019s mind raced as she thought about Yang in her body. How he wouldn\u2019t wear girly clothes like her, how he would act in public, how he was about to go to the bath as her! It all made her mad and her spirit energy focused on one aspect of it all as a light engulfed Yang <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The awesome silk Chinese outfit he had just gotten that felt so comfortable had been replaced by a green and black version of Sakura's kimono.  Yang let out a wine, \"What they heck Sakura!  I just got those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grumbled and said to herself, \"I wanted to do worse, but his will have to do, at least I don't look as much like a tomboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang moved around getting used to all the loose clothing again and complained, \"This is no good!  I can't train in my style with these clothes!\"  Yang started doing some martial arts but his hand motions kept getting caught in the clothing and when he tried to do a high kick he was practically tackled by Sakura.  \"You're not wearing pants!  You can't do that anymore!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?  What are you going to do to stop me?  All you've got to do is admit defeat by swapping us back and I won't do anything else to make you look back.  I promise.\"  Yang taunted, he felt like for sure he had the upper hand and would get Sakura to admit defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura glared at her tormentor, now was the time for her to settle this once and for all.  She had the power to end it, she knew it.  But that power was proving to be unpredictable, could she really rely on it to achieve victory over Yang once again for all.  Did she even need that power or was it considered unhonorable?  But then Sakura looked up at what Yang had done to her poor, precious hair and any thought of honor was just about thrown out the window.  Sakura thought long and hard about what she was going to do to end this and finally made the call.</span></div></div>",

Yeah! That's probably why he was around Seijuro in the first place! In her anger Sakura hadn't thought about how that didn't make much sense in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang gasped as the pink light didn't surrond him in Sakura's body, but rather Sakura in his body! What was she going to do to his body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded, Yang was in shock to see himself standing there, not his girlified body, but his male body! He should have been happy, this should have meant that he would be a boy again once Sakura swapped them back, but three things were in his mind <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, what would Seijuro think? Seijuro had turned him into a girl to teach him a \"lesson in humility\" if he saw that he had already turned back to normal would he no longer be his master?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Sakura was in his body and now looked like him. Other than the spent money Sakura's sabotages were almost completely harmless (Yui's bruised head would disagree) after all she would only harm the reputstion of a girl who didn't exist two days ago, now anything she did would be embarrassing him personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird, and related to that previous point. She was still in her kimono! His body was dressed as a girl! \"Hey, you can't wear that on my body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura pointed out the irony in his words \"Never stopped you!\" She climbed on top of the gazebo as he did before and started shouting \"I'M YANG XIAO LONG AND I LIKE TO STEAL AND WEAR GIRL'S CLOTHES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was freaking out, he needed to get Sakura to stop and get his body back!

She'd call any second begging Yang to stop...but she wasn't calling back for some reason.  <i>'She probably just hasn't seen the message yet.</i>'  Yang thought getting down to Sakura's undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the warrior from Shanghai was being honest with himself, he didn't really intend to actually get naked in Sakura's body and take a bath.  He was possitive Sakura would give up before that had to happen...but he wasn't going to let it be an empty threat.  '<i>If I have to go through with it, I will!</i>' Yang thought hyping himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris did not see this internal argument, she just saw her friend acting oddly.  In the last 24 hours she'd witnessed 'Sakura' kiss Setsuko, get rid of all her clothes, and cut off her beautiful hair.  She looked like she needed to relax so Claris had offered the bath, but now 'Sakura' seemed reluctant to strip down and get in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I hope Sakura's doing ok.'</i>. Claris thought.</span></div></div>",

One second he was thinking about getting back at Sakura and the- wait why was he trying to get back at Sakura? She was his dear friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the spell was done, Claris put down her spell book.

Claris smiled, but with a resolved voice said, \"Let's go to my room, I'd like to speak with you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yang' cutely nodded and agreed and skipped ahead of Claris across the hall to her room.  But when Sakura opened the door and saw Yang still in her body, whatever spell Claris had cast on her broke, and the same seemed to happen for Yang.  The two pointed at each other and proclaimed, \"What is she/he doing here!\"  Claris entered the room, spell book in hand and didn't even answers she just cast quickly and efficiently.  Yang and Sakura were almost nose to nose just growling primally at each other with dislike, but were pushed back from each other by a green wall.  Claris had cast a spell that had put each of them in a green orb that wouldn't dispel for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you two, but you're my friends and you've been acting awfully towards each other.  I'm going to leave this room for 10 minutes and when I come back I want you two to have worked out the cause of this and put it behind you.  You can't go on sabotaging your own lives like this.  And if you can't figure things out...well, I don't know what I'll do.\"  Claris tried to sound like a disciplinarian parent figure with her speech, but she broke down a little at the end before she left the room leaving the two body swapped people alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at what you did!  You made Claris cry!\"  Sakura yelled with Yang's powerful lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?

Well I only charged into the bath because you were being a total pervert with my body!\"  Sakura came back.  The two of them went back and forth like this for minutes bringing up every little slight they had made against each other over these last very long 24 hours before they got back to the root of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh yeah?  Well I only flirted with Seijuro because I was mad you <i><font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">gasp</font></i> swapped our bodies!\"  Yang said started to get a little out of breath from yelling so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh yeah?

I was trying to be a good waitress!\"  Yang said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why were you a secret mystery girl and a waitress to begin with?\"  Sakura asked, somehow the question of why was Yang a girl yesterday had never really crossed her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...it's dumb.\"  Yang said some of the heat of the argument leaving him replaced with a bit of shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's face softened as she looked at her body looking embarrassed, \"What's wrong Yang?  You can tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's stupid...I was...jealous of Seijuro.  He's become such a good leader and even surpassed me.  I wanted to become better and he told me I needed to start from the bottom.  Like he did when he first joined your theatre, you guys were pathetic, but because you had to work that much harder you were that much better and surpassed me.  So Seijuro inspired me and I thought I'd start from the bottom and work as a waitress for a little while.\"  Yang said deciding not to reveal the part about Seijuro being Setsuko when he suggested this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...all of this was just a big misunderstand?\"  Sakura said feeling a bit bad about what she'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was.  And I didn't help matters by escalating it, I was just so mad...and probably a little scared.  But don't tell anyone that!\"  Yang ended with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled and nodded, \"I won't tell anyone.  And if you want to be a waitress to get strong, I'll stop by every day and give you the biggest tips!  I've got to make up for taking from your restaurant funds somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sakura, I'll decide if I want to try being Yan again later.  Right now I'd love to just have my body back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that too.\"  Sakura said as she closed her eyes and tried to concentrate all of her spiritual power on making herself and Yang feel like they were in the place they belonged.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately opening the door during this spiritual moment was a mistake as Claris was engulfed in light as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the light faded Yang and Sakura looked down at themselves, both of them overjoyed to be back to normal. \u201cFeels good to be back.\u201d Yang said patting himself down, it had been two days since he had been a boy, and even though he would have to become a girl again for Seijuro soon being in his correct body even for this moment was a joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura hugged herself just as she had done when under Claris\u2019 spell \u201cOh body, I\u2019ll never leave you again!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Sakura happy in her body, he looked at her absence of hair. In the moment cutting it seemed perfectly rational, but now that everything was over it seemed a bit overkill to make a big change to her like that \u201cHey, I\u2019m uh,\u201d Yang struggled to find the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry about cutting your hair\u201d Yang finally apologized sincerely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura felt the top of her head and the missing hair, she was still mad about it, but right now the last thing she wanted to do was go back to fighting  \"Don't worry about it. I'm sure Claris can fix it, or maybe I can wear a wig!\" She just smiled before getting to her own apology. \"I'm sorry I spent all your renovation money on getting my kimonos back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rubbed the back of his head \"It's fine, I'll probably need those girly clothes when Seijuro makes me a girl again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can turn him into a girl sometime as payback\" Sakura giggled to herself, still unaware of Setsuko's true identity <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeeeeeah\" Yang said, keeping Seijuro's secret<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy everyone's friends again!\" A voice who hadn't been in the conversation said through tears and brought the two of them into a sudden hug. \"Hey, now that you've two made up, how about all three of us have that sleepover?\" The newcomer to the conversation asked \"If what you said is true Yang we can turn you back into a girl and have a proper all girl's sleepover!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how they were speaking Sakura and Yang knew the person hugging them right now must have been Claris, but she must have been too overjoyed by the end of the fighting to notice her own change in body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Claris...\" Sakura didn't know how to break to her friend what had happened, so she just pointed to Claris' mirror to show her what had happened</span></div></div>",

Unsure of what she was about to see, Claris looked at her visage in the mirror and what was looking back stunned her.  It was a boy.  A very...there was no other word for it, cute boy.  Claris still had her wonderful blonde hair done up in a hairband, but now it was much shorter and looked closer to Arthur's hair style.  Claris touched her jacket which was now flat against her chest, her hand slowly moved down and her eyes went wider in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't scream.\"  Yang asked as Claris became certain that she'd turned into a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatjahappenandiaontunderstandnican!\"  Claris rambled unintelligently.  \"She's handling it better than I did, I tried taking Reiji's head off.\"  Yang said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura put her hands on Claris' deceptively broad shoulders and said slowly and calmly, \"Claris, it's ok, when my spiritual powers go wild like that, crazy changes happen.  But Yang told me Reiji has a device that can fix you and make you a girl again.  Doesn't that sound great?  And then Yang can use it and we'll have that sleepover we were talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Why do I have to be a girl again.  In case you haven't noticed Sakura, the guys in this room outnumber you 2 to 1.  So if anyone is changing for this get together, it should be you.\"  Yang said not quite ready to get rid of his manhood yet after just getting it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, just.  No, that's silly.  Besides, we'd look silly being guys in our clothes.\"  Sakura said looking for an excuse to not go with Yang's proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's a good think I got those men's clothes in your closet.  You're welcome.\"  Yang said with a cocky grin getting rid of that excuse for Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I say we let Claris decide.  It was her idea in the first place so she should get to pick the theme of our little get together.\"  Sakura said possitive that Claris would make sure she'd turn back into a girl as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris meanwhile was still staring at herself in the mirror still stunned by her appearance.  After a minute Sakura and Yang managed to pull her away so that she could have the final say on the plans for tonight.</span></div></div>",

Yang and Sakura went over their ideas again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris spent a moment thinking, as she did she paced around the room. Being in a guy's body was uncomfortable, but she had to admit something about it felt empowering. Maybe staying like this for the night wouldn't be so bad? \"I think....I want to be a guy for the sleepover\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang cheered, happy to be keeping his gender while Sakura hung her head. \"Better luck next time Sakura. Hmmm, I wonder how you'll look as a boy?\" Yang put a hand to his chin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang should have held his tongue, as Sakura glared at him after that taunt \"What was it you said, Yang? The guys in here outnumber the girls so I should switch? Well the number of gender swapped people are about to outnumber you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang gulped at what she said, it seemed like Sakura fully intended to turn him into a girl \"Yeah, well. Two guys can't sleep in a small room with a girl. It just wouldn't be right\" he fished up an excuse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right! This room would be too small for a sleepover!\" Claris chirped in. \"How about we do it in the wardrobe instead! It's big and spacious, oh and we can even use some old costumes as extra pillows!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang felt a cold chill as Sakura grabbed his shoulders \"And it's large enough that a girl can sleep away from the guys.\" As Sakura guided Yang out of the room she turned to Claris \"Claris I'm going to become a guy, grab our sleeping bags while I do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later 'Yan' had returned, as busty as ever and wearing that green and black kimono that Sakura had transformed his clothes into. He already missed being a guy again, but his focus was entirely drawn on the person currently entering Reiji's machine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready Sakura?\" Reiji called, about to pull the lever<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Sakura pumped her fist, she was still nervous about this whole thing, but at least she wouldn't be alone. Claris and Yang were dealing with the opposite gender, it would be unfair if she didn't do the same<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the steam cleared a new man exited the machine. Yang's eyes went wide as he saw the new male Sakura. Her current hair hadn't changed at all, but with her new masculine face it seemed perfect, Yang even noticed signs of a growing beard. Her body build was much different than Claris'. While Claris was still a dainty boy Sakura was very muscular. All that practice with wooden swords really showed with this body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how do I look?\" Yang and Reiji watched the muscular man ask in a girly way. This machine could change bodies, but on the inside Sakura was still Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding her a hand mirror, Sakura gasped upon seeing her knew face, but she was amazed at how handsome she was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just....get out of here.\" Reiji said, not wanting to admit he was a little jealous of Sakura's current look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way to the wardrobe, Claris had already prepared their sleeping bags and a makeshift tent of costumes. A pair of the clothes Yang had ordered for Sakura was there too for her to change into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls turned guys giggled, Yang knew this was going to be a long sleepover.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No No!  Absolutely not!  I refuse!  This is some kind of torture!\"  Yang said to the two boys who were looking at him as though he was a doll.  For the last hour Yang had done nothing but try on different costumes and different hair styles all to the girls choosing.  He'd already worn a little red riding hood dress that had belonged to Azami, an Alice in wonderland themed blue dress with thigh high socks that Claris claimed was hers, and he was currently in a yellow dress that Yui had actually worn when she had performed on stage with the Flower Division after their big victory earlier in the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Yang seemed to be drawing the line at an Arabian outfit that apparently belonged to Anastasia that looked like it was basically a thin top and a skirt that was split open wide so it didn't cover anything.  \"Not in a million years am I even touching that thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pleeeeeeeease!\"  Claris begged with puppy dog eyes that fit her weirdly adorable male face, \"I know you'd looks so good in it, it fits Anastasia and Setsuko perfectly up top and I just know you'd look great in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to look great!  I want to keep my manly price!\"  Yang said puffing out his chest which kind of already put a big dent in his 'manly pride.'  Sakura grabbed the costume from Claris and tried to push it into Yang hands, \"Come on, it will only be for a few minutes then we'll pick you out another costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was really regretting to this sleepover thing, he ran to the door and banged on it, \"GET ME OUT OF HERE THESE TWO ARE CRAZY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura with her bulky frame pulled the short girl away from the door with ease, \"Sorry Yang, but we're in here for the long hall.  To stop anyone from interrupting us and asking questions about who we were or what happened to our bodies Reiji put a special soundproof lock on the door that he's not going to take off until tomorrow morning when he gets us to change us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang resigned himself to defeat and looked at the purple Arabian themed outfit and shuttered, he couldn't do it.  \"It's times like this when I really hate you guys are an all girl theatre and have no guy costumes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we have costumes for guys.\"  Claris said casually.  \"We have to play guys in the show sometimes and get real mens costumes for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why aren't I trying on any of those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because those are the ones I used to make the tent.\"  Claris said, but Yang had already made his move.  In a flash of quick fists Yang had grabbed a bunch of guys costumes.  \"There!  If I'm going to play along with your dress up idea, I get to pick some of my costumes...NOT THAT ONE!\"  Claris had tried to sneak the Arabian costume into Yang's pile but failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute Yang had managed to put on a black suit that came with half of a mask.  The girls said it belonged to Seijuro who had to wear it as ticket taker for a show.  Yang definitely felt more manly, even if his chest was very tight in the shirt and the pants were too long for him.  But now that Yang had destroyed the guy costume tent, Sakura and Claris started getting in on the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris put on a sweatshirt that didn't look like a costume at all, Yang just assumed one of Seijuro's lounge wear clothes that had gotten mixed up in the wash.  While Sakura put on a roman like costume that Anastasia had worn for her first show at the theatre.  Claris gave a chuckle.  \"We could actually run some of our scenes where we play guys now and it'd be perfectly natural.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I don't think the two of your could pull of all the subtitles of being a guy on the stage.\"  Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you could handle pretending to be a girl, you made yourself look like a pervy flirt your first day by accident.  And when you were me you were an awful actress.\"  Sakura said glaring her eyes a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  I was a great actress as you when I tried thank you very much.\"  Yang said with confidence as Claris and Sakura gave each other a look deciding it was best to just bite their tongues.</span></div></div>",

I did that perfectly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, a real guy on stage wouldn't be raising the pitch of his voice like that. They would try to use the deepest, commanding tone they could, and your footwork was all wrong.

Thinking one up he began to act \"Oh deary dear me, however shall I confess my love. Oh, what is the best way to use my feminine wiles to get my man\" Yang did super exaggerated movements to draw attention to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Sakura said, having enough of this performance. \"There's more to acting as a girl than showing off your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang held up the Anastasia Arabian outfit \"This disagrees!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Costumes to look good don't take away from the performance!\" Sakura countered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris figured she would need to be the medium and stepped between the two. \"Alright you two, I know how we can settle this. You'll both give one more performance and I'll judge who is better\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Yang looked to each other and nodded, that seemed like a fair arrangement. However, a certain someone was too sure of his victory and decided to make this friendly competition a bet. \"Okay, but if I win....I want Sakura to stay a guy and be my sparring partner tommorow!\" Yang put down his wager<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gasped, she was enjoying being a guy for one sleep over, but she didn't know if she wanted to spend an entire day as one \"Well, uh, if I win you have to go on a girl's day with me! We'll go shopping, and cake tasting, and have lots of fun!\" It didn't sound very fun to Yang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris was fine with them adding this bet to her suggestion. Compared to yesterday when they were trying to sabotage each other, no matter who won right now she had a feeling both of them would have fun tommorow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang and Sakura spent the next ten minutes preparing their scripts, the perfect costumes, and practicing. Both determined to prove they were good actors </span></div></div>",

Then and only then...your story will be yours to write.\"  Sakura leaned in and parted her lips, and Yang actually did as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was enough for the judge.

Sakura and Claris had spent an hour dressing him up last night and now they were going to have him try on even more clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yan, you need some clothes of your own\" Sakura said, wearing some of the male Chinese clothes that Yang had got for her body \"I'm letting you keep my kimonos, but they're not very you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris nodded in agreement \"Yeah, blue and pink aren't your color\" she said, pointing out how odd it was for Yang to be wearing one of Sakura's kimonos right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then give me those!\" Yang pointed at Sakura's outfit \"I don't want to keep your stupid kimonos anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura shook her head \"No way! A body as beautiful as yours shouldn't be wasted dressing as a man. Don't forget, you promised you'd do any girl things with us today\" despite being the one who was talking about doing girl things, Sakura actually looked the most masculine of the group now with her short hair and new clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang grumbled to himself \"Fine.\" And the three girls made their way into the store. Yang didn't want to admit it, but he was having fun. The first few minutes were agonizing as Claris and Sakura dragged him to seperate sections of the store saying \"Try this! No, try this\" however once the initial excitement had cooled and he could start picking his own outfits he began to have more fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how about this?\" Yang said while looking at a cute skirt in his size, something he would never be got caught doing before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that's lovely Yan, but how about this one?\" Claris said as she handed him a similar skirt in the color black<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, yeah, that looks better\" Yang agreed, now that Sakura and Claris were giving helpful advice as opposed to treating him like a doll them handing him clothes felt a lot nicer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually with an outfit picked out, Yang came out of the changing room. Sakura clapped seeing Yan's new outfit. Sakura had asked him to dress in a feminine way, and he actually listened to her request. Admittedly she wished he dressed more modestly so she could avoid the feeling of embarrassment when looking at his new body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was currently wearing the black skirt he and Claris had been eyeing earlier, for a top he had a green spaghetti strap top, covering the rest of his top was a this green jacket with a dragon logo on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had paid for Yang's current outfit the three of them exited the store, Sakura looked at Yang with anticipation and excitement \"So, how was your first shopping trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was....fun I guess\" Yang said, not wanting to admit he had as much fun as he did. His attention was brought to an extra bag Claris was carrying \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Claris giggled as they pulled a glittering green dress out of the bag \"We thought 'Yan' need a nice dress if she ever got a date\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang turned red \"No way, that is never happening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura giggled \"I dunnooooo\" she turned around and slowly began walking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it, we should return that right now in fact, I am never going on a date as a girl!\" Yang protested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just save it for a rainy day\" Claris said with a smile as she put the dress back in the bag.

Yang back off grabbing his precious long braid and said, \"I said I was sorry about the hair cut, please don't make me cut my hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura laughed, \"Well, I could probably make you if I guilted you into it...but no.  I just want you to get your hair styled.  Your braid is lovely, but it's more Yang than Yan if you know what I mean.  Plus when was the last time you actually combed your hair?  The braid in the back is the only place that looks like you've put any care into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang grumbled something about braid being all he needed but it wasn't a good enough excuse for the girls as they dragged Yang into the salon.  When they entered the barber saw Sakura and asked, \"Ah, you're back, and you've brought friends.  Please don't tell me you want all of their lovely hair removed too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura shook her head, \"No, but my friend here has never had a proper salon day.  Can you remove the braid and make her hair as beautiful and full as I know it can be?\"  The hairdresser was much more enthusiastic about this request as opposed to yesterdays sheering.  He dropped what he was doing and sat Yang down in a chair and got to work.  \"Miss, your hair is lovely, but you really need to wash it regularly with shampoo and conditioner in order to have it live up to it's full potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I do a good job and wash it once a week, that's good enough.\"  Sakura, Claris, and the hairdresser were mortified at this declaration and proceeded to chastise Yang for the rest of the appointment about proper hair care.  And the parts Yang didn't zone out during, he did learn something about proper hair care.  After about an hour of combing, cleaning, styling, and scrubbing, Yang was turned to a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not recognize himself.  And it wasn't just because of the girl thing.  His hair had never been this combed and clean.  His top, side, and bangs of his hair had been tamed for the first time maybe ever and were framing his face perfectly.  His braid had been undone and his hair was set free running down his shoulders and back like a beautiful sea of brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"  Was all Yang could say and Sakura and Claris both looked at the gorgeous hair with a bit of envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris paid and the three left.  Yang looked like something out of a magazine as the wind blew his hair back perfectly, but Yang just mashed it all down to keep it out of his eyes, \"So, are we done? Can I go home yet?  I think I've done enough to qualify this as a girls day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Claris disagreed, they had at least one more destination for Yan on her first day out in public.</span></div></div>",

There didn't seem to be anything they could do here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was the one to answer \"Well, you may look the part of a girl and spent the day with us, but here comes the real challenge of the girl's day out.\" She began to explain, with Claris finishing the explanation \"We want to see if you can act like a girl in front of strangers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang waved a hand dismissively \"Easy, I spent two days perfectly pretending to be you.

Nobody even realized I wasn't you!\" Yang countered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but that's only because no one knew body swapping was a thing! If they knew my spirit powers could do that they would have seen through you immediately!\" Sakura gave her logic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rolled his eyes \"I bet you're just jealous that I was a better you than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smirked at his cockiness \"Okay, Mr. World's Greatest actor. If you're so confident, how about we do another acting bet.\" Sakura said, confident that Yang would screw up acting like last night<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, double or nothing?\" Yang asked, he hadn't actually gotten a chance to act last night, but he was sure he could be a convincing girl. Plus he didn't have to deal with the hurdle of needing to go against Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you can't act like a convincing girl around enough people here before sunset, Yan gets to stay around and room in the Imperial theater for a week.\" Sakura named her terms. The real reason she started this second bet wasn't to show up Yang or anything, she had a really fun day today and wanted to spend even more time with him as Yan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Yang said confident. \"But if I win I get to spend a week.....as Sakura Amamiya\" he smirked naming his terms <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's jaw dropped \"Why would you want to spend a week as me?! <i>gasp</i> you're not thinking of sabotaging again are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang shook his head \"No, of course not, but you're so confident I did a bad job pretending to be you, I want to prove you wrong. I'll be the best Sakura Amamiya the world has ever seen!\" Yang defended his pride <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura giggled \"It's a deal, but you better hurry. Not much time before sunset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Yang ran off to start talking to strangers, Sakura and Claris watching him from bushes to judge his girl pretending </span></div></div>",

They had half expected him to do what he had done last night and start showing of his.....assets as girl acting. However he was actually acting like a normal girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang\u2019s two observers were on the edge of their seats as a man started to hit on Yan. His reaction here would be the deciding factor in whether or not Claris decreed him a good girl actor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang wanted to barf as this guy hit on him. On any other occasion he would have busted out some Kung Fu on this guy, however he kept his current judge in mind: Claris. What would she want to see that would qualify as girl acting? Yang began to respond to the man\u2019s flirting with forced giggles, he just hoped they seemed real enough for Claris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy soon asked to exchange numbers with Yang \u201cTotally\u201d <i>\u2018day chance\u2019</i> Yang said and thought as he pulled out his phone and gave the man Seijuro\u2019s phone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the guy was gone Yang felt proud, he totally seemed like a real girl. When the sun began to set he went over to the bush that Claris and Sakura were obviously in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Claris had brushed the leaves off of her clothes she began to congratulate Yang \u201cYou seemed like a real girl, you even handled a romantic first encounter with grace!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang put his hand behind his head \u201cTold ya\u2019 I could do it, now about our deal Sakur-\u201c before Yang had even finished his sentence he and Sakura were once again engulfed in pink light and he was her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in Sakura\u2019s body felt more comfortable currently than his Yan body. Other than Yan\u2019s large boobs getting in the way and jiggling slightly as he walked, Sakura\u2019s current wardrobe of men\u2019s clothes were a lot more comfortable to him than what he got as Yan.....even if he had to admit it was fun wearing and shopping for those clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you really just want to be me to prove you can act like me?\u201d Sakura asked from Yang\u2019s body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rubbed Sakura\u2019s nose \u201cWeeeeell, that\u2019s part of it. You are between shows at the theater aren\u2019t you? That means I can relax in your body while you go do my job as a waitress to please Seijuro\u201d Yang revealed an extra reason he wanted to be Sakura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re almost right. We are between shows at the theater, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can just start slacking off. Tommorow is a busy day, Seijuro and Arthur are going to have their duel and afterwards we\u2019re going to have Arthur\u2019s goodbye party!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang waved another dismissive hand \u201cNo sweat, I can set up a party just fine. I\u2019ll even act just like you at the party, and just so you can watch I\u2019ll invite my \u2018waitress friend\u2019 over\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris and Sakura were skeptical to say the least, there was a world of difference between acting like a girl and acting like a specific person after all</span></div></div>",

The three agreed that an hour in the park would be a good amount of time to judge Yang's performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out pretty well.  Yang stood by the rails by the ocean made some small talk with some random people who passed by.  He even blushed and said thank you when a little girl came up to him and called him pretty.  Sakura was surprised, it was looking like she was going to lose the bet to Yang, but then the monkey wrench came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome young hotshot decided he wanted to pick up the prettiest girl in the park, and since Sakura and Claris were hiding in a bush, by far the best looking girl around was Yan.  He sauntered up to Yang as he played with his hair (not him acting by the way), and complimented Yang on his looks.  Yang smiled politely and said thanks before looking back out at the ocean waiting for this guy to get the hint and walk away.  But this dude didn't get hints and kept complimenting Yang talking about how he was the hottest girl around, and how she should hook up with the hottest guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow most girls in this case would may simply walk off, brush the guy off, give him a fake phone number, there were any number of reasonable solutions.  Yang punched the guy out and was about to toss him in the ocean before Claris and Sakura emerged from the bushes to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl's don't commit fellonies against guys who hit on them...even if sometimes they deserve it.\"  Claris said acting as the judge.  \"Sakura wins the bet!  We'll go ahead and get a room ready for 'Yan' at the theatre.  Oh this is going to be so much fun!\"  Claris said as she went off to make the preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang groaned, \"Sakura, are you sure girls don't beat up jerks like that?  I've seen you swing around a sword, don't tell me you haven't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura shrugged innocently, \"I don't know what you're talking about.  Besides, the judge already ruled, you lost.\"  Sakura said as she playfully stuck out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang sighed, well, he guessed there were worse fates, at least he chose to be in this body this time around, that would make this a lot easier and maybe even kind of fun.  But that optimism went away as soon as Sakura said, \"Oh and good news!  Yan will get to wear her new dress tomorrow for the first time!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"  Yang asked as Sakura filled him in on what was happening tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Can you imagine being alone while an entire group of people is cheering for you to lose?!\" Sakura finished, showing concern for her temporary-captain's feelings<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had to admit, he saw where she was coming from. He could imagine the same thing happening if he was the one called in as temporary captain instead. The entire Flower Division cheering on Seijuro while he was left alone. He kicked his feet \"Fiiiine, I'll do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Sakura gave him a thumbs up \"Now let's go get your room set up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later Yan, Claris, and Sakura watched as Reiji moved boxes of things into one of the spare rooms at the theater. It took a little convincing, but Sumire agreed pretty easily to letting a \"new member of the Shanghai Division\" stay at the theater for now. The three of them didn't know how they would explain Yan disappearing in a week, but they'd cross that hurdle when they came to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, hey!\" Was all he could say as Reiji wheeled in Yan's wardrobe. It was nothing but the kimonos that Sakura had bought when she was in his body \"Where are <i>my</i> clothes?!\" Yang asked as the girls began filling his closet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, right here!\" Claris said as she put Yan's new dress in the closet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's not what I meant!\" Yang stomped his foot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sakura has the 'male Chinese clothes' look down. It'd be weird if two people at the theater wore the same thing all the time.\" Claris nonchalantly told him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then just trade with, Sakura!\" Yang pleaded, only for Sakura to stick her tounge out at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Yan, but you just looked so cute in my kimonos, I can't let you go back to your clothes now\" Sakura then motioned to her current outfit \"You were right though, the silk in these is so smooth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours involved Yang trying to bargain to wear his own clothes for the week, but Sakura and Claris were firm in not letting him wear boy's clothes for the week<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day everyone in the Flower Division had gathered at the old battle arena for Seijuro and Arthur's duel. Originally it was planned to be a private affair, but Komachi saw a money making opportunity and sold tickets to the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Why is she here?!\" Arthur practically hid behind Claris as he saw 'Yan' show up the next day, wearing her dress. He wasn't too enthusiastic to see the girl who had nearly suffocated him days prior show up for his duel with Seijuro<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rubbed the back of his head, unsure how to apologize for something someone else had done in his body \"Look, I'm uh, sorry for what happened. I'm just a, uh, massive fan of the London Division\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's response didn't help Arthur's nerves at all, now he just seemed like another stalker fangirl. Sakura knew she had to step in \"Yan here is actually one of my friends, I invited her to watch your duel with Seijuro. Don't worry, I gave her a lesson in personal space.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill practically behind Claris, Arthur spoke up \"Fine, just make sure she doesn't grab me again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that girl will do much worse than grab you.\" The four of them turned to see Seijuro \"Push her buttons and you'll end up with a kick to the head\" Yang felt he lucked out with Seijuro never finding out about him turning back to a boy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur looked at Seijuro and stepped out from behind Claris \"Seijuro Kamiyama. You may as beaten me last time we fought, but today I shall reclaim my glory and put a commoner like you in his place.\" Arthur said, the kind personality he would put on when talking to the girl's and Reiji seemed to disappear when interacting with Seijuro. Replaced with the determination to beat his rival<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, we'll see. I hope you're ready though. My mech has been upgraded quite a few times since then.\" Seijuro laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As has mine\" and with that the two rivals walked down seperate hallways. The Flower Division followed Seijuro to their launch area and Yang followed Arthur to his<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang tried his best to keep up the facade of being a London Division fan, both to keep up with his lie from earlier and because it was fun to watch Arthur squirm in fear of being alone with a stalker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Arthur launched in his mech and his duel with Seijuro had begun. Yang could see the fight from a large monitor in the launch area. The duel was very close at first, however it didn't take long for Arthur to gain the advantage, having Seijuro's mech pinned with his sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Flower Division's launch room Sakura and the others watched the fight on their own monitor. \"Come on Seijuro, you can win\" she prayed, not noticing the pink light surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something had happened, Arthur seemed to lose his balance for a second, giving Seijuro a chance to counter. However what appeared to be Arthur tripping up brought his sword down onto Seijuro<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the winner is.....Arthur!\" Komachi announced through her microphone. The audience cheered for the comeback of the London Division. Seijuro was a good sport and gave a wave to the crowd as he exited his mech. Arthur's own mech opened as well, giving the crowd their first real look at who had won the duel</span></div></div>",

That clearly wasn't Arthur. However Yang, Sakura, and Claris knew it must have been. Sakura's spirit energy must have caused more mischief<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the crowd's silence toward the mysterious little girl turned into even louder cheering than before \"Can you believe how skilled she was?\" \"So young and already piloting\" \"A little girl beat the Flower Division's captain\" the crowd talked among themselves as the mystery girl ran toward the Flower Division's waiting room, practically drowning in her clothes, Seijuro following close behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the waiting room, the Flower Division was just as shocked as the crowd \"A-Arthur, is that you?\" Seijuro asked his temporary replacement/rival<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was still flabbergasted at what had happened to him and gave only a silent nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you? You turned into a shrimp!\" Hatusho said astonished, she was towering over Arthur now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I have no idea\" Arthur squeaked out adorably, before turning his attention to Seijuro \"You did this, didn't you! You wanted to sabotage our duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro held up his hands \"Are you kidding, I have no idea how this happened!

Were the Flower Division the type of people to trap someone in a different body for a while. Little did he know, they were<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumire pointed to the monitors that were repeating the highlight of the fight, the reveal that a little girl had won. \"Many people were watching the fight, it won't take long for word of this mystery girl to spread. If we made her disappear immediately, people would grow suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro saw what Sumire was leading to \"So you're saying we keep Arthur this way until thinngs cool down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumire nodded \"Yes, that's the only way to avoid arousing suspicion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur looked up at Sumire \"I object to this, I cannot remain a litt-\" he was interrupted by Sumire handing him Azami's red riding hood costume \"Put this on, we can't have you going around in clothes that can't fit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur merely obeyed what Sumire told him and put on the outfit, Azami may have been the youngest member of the Flower Division, but even this was too big for his current body. It would have to do for now though <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was the one to ask the obvious question \"Wait, why one of Azami's costumes and not her ordinary clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumire opened her fan \"Ohoho.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though he'd just won the duel, Arthur seemed a bit discombobulated as he exited his own mech.  He appeared to be looking around, at himself, and at Seijuro as though something were wrong.  The Flower Division and Yang all left the starting area and met up with the boys in the middle of the arena.  As Yang ran he was trying to figure out what was the right balance of showing support without seeming like a crazy stalker girl.  Finally deciding on an approach, he ran up beside Arthur and started pumping him up, \"Way to go Arthur!!!  I knew you could beat that dummy Seijuro!  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\"  Yang felt a bit silly cheering like this as he cocked his hip out and gave the v for victory sign, but he was happy to see the mighty Seijuro was indeed still human and was capable of losing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut weirdly enough, it was Seijuro who responded to Yang's cheering, \"Thank you for the support Yan, but the two of us need a moment to discuss something.\"  Seijuro said as he walked with an almost royal air of dignity that he never really had.  \"Yeah, I need to discuss who just won, that ending was....kind of a crazy blur.\"  Arthur added, but why would their be confusion?  He had clearly won decisively.  As Yang watched Arthur talking to Seijuro with a bit of a dumb grin on his face that he only saw one person do regularly, Yang ran up to Sakura and Claris and had a little aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?  You switched Seijuro and Arthur?  Why would you do that?\"  Yang asked with an intense whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know.  My spirit powers have just been acting so weird lately, I'm having a hard time controlling it.\"  Sakura said as Claris tried to play the cheerleader for Sakura, although without the WOOOOOOOOOOing.  \"It's ok Sakura, I know I had trouble with my libromancy for so long, but with some support from my friends it became much more manageable.  Let's just focus right now and we can fix this before it becomes a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your powers seem pretty amazing, but I doubt you could switch them back if Arthur, or at least his body is in England.\"  Yang added to try to put a bit of a fire under Sakura, Arthur leaving today meant she only had a limited amount of time to swap Seijuro and Arthur back.  The stress on Sakura's face told Yang the additional pressure wasn't helping so he tried to switch things up and try to motivate Sakura another way, and remembering how Sakura's powers had activated with anger and passion before he decided to be daring and go all in on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mischievous look on his face Yang whispered to Sakura, \"Although you might want to leave Seijuro in Arthur's body for a little while to let him experience London, I always had a feeling if he spent enough time with Lancealot something might happen between them.\"  The look Yang saw in Sakura's eyes sent chills down his spine, normally when he played with fire in the kitchen he got a rush of adrenaline, but now with Sakura it was just scaring him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough this bit of (slightly jealous) motivation was all Sakura needed as her spiritual energy started to flair up again.</span></div></div>",

However his attention was soon grabbed when the girl next to him began to speak \"Don't worry Sakura, even if your spirit energy can't swap them back I'm sure I have some libromancy that can fix this\" Claris said, eyes too focused on her spellbook<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura meanwhile was still seeing red thinking about what would happen if Seijuro was alone with Lancelot for who knows how long. Oh, why did Yang need to bring that up?! She was mad at him for even suggesting it. As Claris spoke up Sakura's spirit power released and the familiar pink light surrounded Claris and Yang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pink light faded from Yang's vision, he noticed the whole room had seemed to shift to the right. Wait, what that his own body? With horror he looked down at himself, he was now in Claris' body. Not only had Sakura messed up who to swap, but now their potential backup plan of Libromancy was kaput. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Arthur firmly asked Seijuro<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I was about to ask you! I thought you swapped out bodies to rig our duel\" Seijuro said in a tone completely unbefitting of Arthur's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if I would need petty tricks to defeat a commoner like you.\" Arthur said in a tone that carried much more authority than Seijuro normally had \"Besides, I would have won if not for this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro was confused \"Uhhh, you did win. Didn't you hear the whole 'the winner is Aaaaarthur'\" Seijuro did his best Komachi impression from Arthur's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what they saw, but I know the truth. This is the second time in a row you have defeated me!\" Arthur said unsatisfied at his 'victory'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro rubbed the back of his head, the only reason he had defeated himself, er, Arthur was because he had dropped the sword onto his mech out of being unused to Arthur's cockpit controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sakura, fix us. Or fix Arthur and Seijuro\" Yang pleaded from Claris' body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\" Sakura said desperately as she tried to focus her spirit energy for a third time today, but it wouldn't manifest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all confused, but after a few more attempts Claris had an idea what was wrong. Before Sakura had only used this strange spirit power once a day, now she had used it twice in one day. It was possible that she had exhausted it for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was nothing but horrible news when Arthur's flight home was tonight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it doesn't matter who won. There's something much more important we need to handle\" Seijuro said from Arthur's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, we need to switch back right away. My flight home is in four hours.\" Arthur got down to business<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have nothing to go off, we're going to need to delay your flight home.\" Seijuro suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur shook his head \"That's not as easy as you word it. Lancelot was very insistent on me coming back immediately after I won\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro took out Arthur phone \"Well that's simple, I just need to talk to her and say that you need to stay longer. Don't worry, I'm great with wom- wait but what if you lost\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was never a possibility\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro began texting Lancelot from Arthur's phone. Saying that he needed to stay longer than planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's the situation?\" Arthur asked as Seijuro recieved a message back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good...\" Seijuro said, it seemed like delaying the flight wasn't going to be as simple as they hoped</span></div></div>",

Seijuro feeling a little melodramatic grabbed his own old hand and said, \"Arthur, I swear to you as a man and a fellow captain that I will go back in your place and fight side by side with Lancelot and protect your home.  I swear to you that London will not fall.\"  Seijuro finished his manly vow with an intense handshake which Arthur returned.  \"I would expect no less of my rival.

Are you not going to be satisfied until I've been each member of the Flower Division?

I'll swap you back when I can, but I need to focus on Seijuro and Arthur now.  We can't let Seijuro go to London with my rival.\"  Sakura said unable to get the image of Lancelot's lips moving closer to Seijuro out of her wild imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris wasn't happy either, but she was trying to keep the situation calm, \"Yang, Sakura, let's all take a deep breath and calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time to calm down!\"  Sakura said as she tried to force the swap between Arthur and Seijuro to happen once again.

It seemed Sakura was trying every day to meditate and activate her spirit powers to swap Yang and Claris back, but it seemed she was still too drained to do something like that, especially from so far away.  It didn't help matters that things were so back in London that She, Seijuro, and Lancelot were fighting demons just about every day.  Sakura was having to use all the power she could muster just keep fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she at least seemed to be successful with the most important part about protecting the people of London.  It seemed every day she was sending the Flower Divisions the celebratory bromides with the London Combat Revue.  Although weirdly enough Sakura seemed to keep 'accidentally' cutting Lancelot out of the images with only the occasional hand or shoulder of Lancelot making an appearance.<br>\r\n____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Claris and Yang were adjusting to each other's lives as well as they could.  The two had decided it was probably for the best if Claris remained as 'Yan' instead of turning back to Yang.  Not only because Claris was more comfortable being a girl, but also because Yang figured Yui could use more experience as head chef and would need 'Yan' as a waitress in the meanwhile.  Claris was doing a good enough job in her waitress duties, she was even getting inspiration for a show about a waitress in a diner, but sadly with 'Yan's schedule she didn't have the time to write this show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang on the other hand was doing everything he could to not have the time to write something.  He was trying to adjust to being Claris while also being respectful.  He always only went into the bath with Claris there and always put on a blindfold.  It was actually kind of nice since this meant Claris had to was him which was an unintended boon.  After a few days of this however, he had tried to ask Claris if he could just turn Claris' body into that pretty boy form she'd had during the sleepover in order to make things a bit easier, but Claris while not saying no, didn't love the idea of being missing from the theatre at the same time as Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was having a bit of a rough time with the theatre stuff as Claris.  As Claris he was volunteering to do every odd job around the theatre to avoid having to write a new play or act in a show.  Yang had finally learned his lesson after two lost bets that he probably wasn't the best actor around and vowed to avoid the stage at all cost.  However it was getting harder to avoid these responsibilities as Anastasia and even Sumire were starting to pressure him to write or find a new play to perform.</span></div></div>",

Eventually they were able to work together to create a play about a girl who challenged others to kung fu battles, proclaiming that only the one who defeated her could marry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Yang showed the script to the others. They seemed a bit confused about why the main heroine only had the minimum amount of dialouge, but they trusted in Claris' writing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These looks great, Claris!\" Hatsuho said as she read the script \"I'll do my best as the lead this time\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Yang raised his arm, he needed to be the lead. As the other members looked at him he coughed \"I mean, I want to play the main part this time\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastasia spoke up confused, the main role had many action bits, Claris would rarely do roles like that \"Are you positive, Claris? Azami or Hatsuho would be much more suited to the part\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang nodded rapidly \"Yes, I need to play the heroine\" he knew deep down if he had to play one of the others roles that had mode dialouge he'd be completely out of his game<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing 'Claris'' devotion to playing this role, the rest of the team gave into 'her' request. They all took a copy of the script to study with Anastasia informing them that rehearsal would begin in four days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they all left Yang gave a fist pump, hopefully by the time they needed a second play from him all these body swapping shenanigans would no longer invovle him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Claris' room the body swapped duo gave a high five \"Are you sure you can pull off the kung fu scenes in my body?\" Claris asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can, watch this!\" Yang said and began to demonstrate some Kung Fu fron Claris' body. He actually did it perfectly, compared to when he tried to in Sakura's body and kept getting hung up on her kimono <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris clapped as he finished, she hadn't seen her body act so agile before. However she made a note to have Yang remind everyone that this part would require pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the play set in stone things began to look up for the body swapped duo. \"Now that I helped you write a play you can do, can you help me with a personal project?\" Claris asked Yang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure thing!\" Yang said still enthusiastic about getting a role he could perform <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris then pulled out what looked like the rough draft of a book. She showed him various bits and Yang seemed to get a good idea what this book was about. A guy gets swapped into the bodies of different girls and has to live their lives, for some girls he would try to ruin their lives while for others he would try to better them. The inspiration was obvious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you need me to do?\" Yang asked unsure what Claris could want<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need some inspiration for where this story should go next, so could you....\"</span></div></div>",

Is there anyone in this theatre he won't date?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris tried to think of anyone else, but there weren't really a lot of guys that she knew who would be a good candidate to go out with, she threw out the idea of Yang asking random guys out that he found cute, but Yang shut that idea down quickly.  Yang then had the crazy thought that maybe Claris could turn his 'Yan' body back into Yang and ask her out then...but that would be too weird.  Right?  As Claris revue her notes, Yang made a decision about who he should go out with on this date thingy.</span></div></div>",

He could either go on a date with Arthur in Seijuro's body and go through the awkward situation of feeling like he was on a date with two different guys, or he could ask Claris out and try to think about how he was actually on a date with a girl even if she currently had his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing himself he looked Claris in his own body in the eyes trying to think about how to word this \"Uh, Claris. Would you like to...spend the day with me in my body\" he said the last part fast<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris was flustered, she hadn't expected Yang to ask her out. However, this was perfect.

He was actually enjoying browsing around the store looking for interesting books to browse through.  But as he was off on his own looking Claris appeared with a book in her hand.  She passed eagerly handed it to Yang and insisted, \"I think you'd just love this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'You mean it's something you'd love'</i>. Yang thought as he looked at the book and tried not to look disappointed, it was a romance story of lovers from different cultures and how they overcome their differences and Yang was already bored reading the back cover.  He'd already accepted that he was playing the part of Claris on this date, but he was getting annoyed that he didn't have a say in the date at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can even start reading it on the Ferris wheel, let's go!

It was bad enough she was reading him this story he had no interest in, but now she was reading it to him in French?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang stood up and yawned before telling Claris, \"Ok, I've reached my limit.  I give up.  This going on a date as you has not been fun.  And want. your note for you book?  I'll tell you exactly why I'm not having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris blinked a few times in what seemed to be confusion, \"Oh mon Dieu, je ne t'ai jamais entendu parler chinois avant Yang, quelle est l'occasion sp\u00e9ciale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis second use of French just annoyed Yang even more.  He started pacing back and forth in front of Claris to let out just a little more of his frustrations, \"Seriously?  Enough with the French!  You know, that's just one of the problems with this date.  You just assume that I like the things you do because I'm in your body.  But guess what?  I don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang sighed for a second, after venting for a second he was instantly afraid he might have come off too harsh, and maybe he had.  When he looked at Claris she had a smile on her face, but that went away quickly.  It was replaced by a wide eyed look on her face as she looked between Yang and the romance book.  Claris holding the book came up to Yang and with a worried look on her face said, \"Yang, peux-tu comprendre ce que je dis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big deal with the French Claris?  You're acting like one of the stupid characters from that book and...\"  Yang's eyes went wide as he came to the same conclusion as Claris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Libromancy!\"  They both said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Claris POV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and then he took her into his arms and told her exactly how much he loved her.'  Oh how romantic!\"  Claris hugged the book close to her absolutely loving the newest addition to her library.  The idea of two cultures who can not connect through words connecting through the universal language of love was so romantic to her.  She looked down and sighed at Yang who seemed tobe be waking up from a nap as he yawned and said, \"H\u01ceo de, w\u01d2 y\u01d0j\u012bng d\u00e1d\u00e0o j\u00edxi\u00e0nle. W\u01d2 f\u00e0ngq\u00ec.

He'd never done anything like this before, it just made no sense.  Claris actually chuckled to herself as she thought, <i>'It's almost like we're the characters from the novel.'</i>. But then a scary thought crossed her mind.  She immediately picked up the book about a couple who couldn't understand each other and held it up to Yang as she asked, \"Yang, can you understand what I'm saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang looked annoyed as he said, \"F\u00e0gu\u00f3 de Claris y\u01d2u sh\u00e9 me d\u00e0b\u00f9li\u01ceo de?

I was afraid the two of you were going to pull a Sakura and Seijuro and run off somewhere together.\"  Hatsuho laughed and gave Yang's body a hearty pat on the back which made Claris shudder, her eyes going wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong you two?  Wait...don't tell me I was actually close to the truth!  Are you two...a thing?!\"  Hatsuho was so shocked at this news she convinced herself she discovered she dropped her cleaning supplies all over the grass.

They could tell that Hatsuho was speaking Japanese, a language they could speak flawlessly, but they couldn't understand it now.

Claris approached Hatsuho and spoke slowly with her mouth and tried to talk with Yang's eyes as well, \"Hatsuho, can you understand what I'm saying?\"  Hatsuho looked at Claris with a moment's confusion before it looked like a light went off.  Claris felt relieved for a moment thinking she had understood, but Hatsuho's response didn't quite get that point across as she said, \"\u0100, wakarimashita, kurarisu, anata wa Yan ni sorera no hadena furansugo no tango no ikutsu ka o oshiete kimashita. \u0112 to, 2-ri ga shinobiyotte iru riy\u016b ga wakarimasu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris backed off feeling defeated but Yang wasn't ready to give up quite yet as he approached Hatsuho and almost shouted in her face, \"Seriously!  You need to understand something is wrong and help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again, Hatsuho didn't seem to get the message at all as she just responded with a smile, \"Wakatta, wakatta! Kurarisu ni mo kurejitto o agemasu! Ch\u016bgokugo o hont\u014dni j\u014dzu ni benky\u014d shite iru y\u014ddesu ne. Sore wa tsugi no sh\u014d de no anata no yakuwaridesu ka? Uwa \u0304 ! Anata wa hont\u014dni subete o ikimasu, watashi wa shitto shite imasu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang and Claris realized they weren't going to get the spiritual help they needed and deciding it was best to walk away.  Yang crossed his arms in frustration.  \"Maybe if you'd listened to me we might be closer to figuring out how to fix us, but no, you just push push push with what Claris wants to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Claris heard was, \"Y\u011bx\u01d4, r\u00fagu\u01d2 n\u00edn t\u012bngle w\u01d2 dehu\u00e0, w\u01d2men k\u011bn\u00e9ng g\u00e8ng ji\u0113j\u00ecn y\u00fa zh\u01ceo ch\u016b r\u00fah\u00e9 ji\u011bju\u00e9 w\u01d2men de w\u00e8nt\u00ed, d\u00e0nsh\u00ec b\u00f9, n\u00edn zh\u01d0sh\u00ec \u00e0nzhe Claris xi\u01ceng y\u00e0o zu\u00f2 de tu\u012b tu\u012b tu\u012b.\"  and it just made her more depressed about the situation.</span></div></div>",

Instead she opened the notebook and showed Yang her idea. Inside the notebook were three drawings. Someone drawing a picture, someone showing that picture to someone else, and a third person reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang sat up, quickly getting Claris' idea. \"This....this could work!\" Yang said and grabbed the notebook himself, drawing a thumbs up to show he understood what Claris was suggesting. \"You know, you're a much better writer than an artist\" Yang joked as he looked at Claris' drawings again, the people being crudely drawn stick figures.</span></div></div>",

If this were any other day with any other type of acting contest, Sakura would beat Yang 99 times out of 100.  But, Claris had to admit, there was a reason why Anastasia and Hatsuho usually played the more masculine roles in the theatre.  Sakura, despite being a someone who could kick someones head off, still carried herself with a feminine grace and beauty, even as a guy.  And while Claris didn't want to award Yang and his super flirty and show off poses, Claris did think Yang did a better job acting as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Claris said, \"I'm sorry Sakura, but Yang wins.\"  Yang jumped for joy, ironically acting more girly then when he was trying to act, and Sakura looked crestfallen.  \"But...this isn't fair!  Yang's been a girl for two days!  He had an unfair advantage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad!  You accepted the bet.  Looks like we'll be training tomorrow.  I gotta admit, I'm looking forward to it.  I've never trained with you before, and with a body like that I definitely won't hold back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you won't know what hit you!\"  Sakura said already brushing off her defeat as Claris smiled glad that those two finally weren't at each other's throats anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning after falling asleep on a pile of clothes, they heard a machine running outside of the door.

Yang ran up to her and asked, \"What in the world is going on here?  Why are there so many people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami's eyes glistened when she saw 'Yan'.  She pulled out her kunai and slashed it at Yang.  Yang did a few backflips narrowly dodging Azami's slashes.  Azami finally threw the blades and Yang caught them in his fingers and threw them back at Azami who caught them in her sleeve and pulled them out again.  As she prepared another throw she said, \"Village Rule #66, death to all those who make your friends sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang realized very quickly why Azami was trying to kill him, \"I made up with Sakura last night!  We're friends now!\"  He cried out as he prepared to catch another thrown knife.  But thankfully Azami stopped, \"I believe you, your eyes aren't lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang caught his breath as he tried to broach the subject of the resteraunt again, Azami explained, \"Yui has invented a new sweet fried rice.  It's sweet and filling and sweet.  I've had 3 already.  I'd have had more by now but Yui made me go to the back of the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this fresh info in mind Yang entered the restaurant where he saw Yui working like crazy in the kitchen and...Setsuko was in a waitress outfit?!  Yang went up to Seijuro and asked, \"What the heck are you doing here like...that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro put down the 4 dishes of rice he was carrying to his customers, \"Well, when you didn't show up yesterday, Yui called me and told me I had to step in for you.  I tried to explain I had nothing to do with you no showing but she wouldn't have it and said she'd tell everyone in town I went into women's baths unless I turned into Setsuko and helped.

You hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....\"  Seijuro said unsure of how to take this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as for me acting weird, long story short I had a fight with Sakura and we're friends again, you don't need to know anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really think you should explain the kiss part...\"  Seijuro said meekly but before he could continue he was hit by a ladle from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two ladies going to chat all day or get to work!  Yan Xiou, your uniform is in the kitchen, let's move!\"  Yui shouted out as she poured what appeared to be a full bag of sugar into a wok of rice.  Yang was pretty sure why he understood why women and children were so addicted to this dish now.  He ran to the back and got changed into his uniform and got to work.</span></div></div>",

On the plus side, they were already well on their way to filling up the renovations funds again.

He messaged her he was on his way to the park to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang wanted to hit up the theatre to change out of his Yan form first, but didn't think he had the time.  But he was good enough to train with Sakura even in this girl body.  When he got to the park, Sakura actually seemed annoyed at seeing Yan.  \"Hey!  Why are you still a girl?  I thought you wanted to train with me man to man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I couldn't change back yet, but don't worry, I can handle you even with this body.\"  Yang said confidently as he started to get into a starting fighting pose.  Sakura got out her wooden sword, \"Just because I'm a girl on the inside doesn't mean you don't get to come at me with less than your best, I won't forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't forgive me either, trust me, my style doesn't depend solely on muscle size and strength.  And he meant it, in the blink of an eye he was already out of Sakura's sight.  She tried to look for Yang, but only found him when it was too late, she got a foot land on top of her head daintily.  \"Are you sure you can hang with me?  Maybe I was wrong about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura growled a low and manly growl and swung the wooden sword up barely missing bother her head and Yang's feet.  Yang landed on top of the gazebo, \"You'll have to be a lot quicker than that to catch meeeeeeaaaahhhhh!\"  It turns out Yang was much more tired after a 12 hours shift on his feet at the resteraunt than he'd realized, he had a dizzy spell for a second, but that was long enough for him to loose his balance and fall from the top of the gazebo!</span></div></div>",

Let's have some fun like this for now\" Sakura began to give him puppy dog eyes, the intended effect didn't come across in her masculine body</span></div></div>",

As he walked out of the elevator he heard a voice call out to him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, Sakura, there you are.\" Kaoru called out to Sakura, not looking up from her clipboard. \"I need you to do some advertising for the theater. Nothing major, I just need you to go out and tell people to come to our show personally, a star personally talking to fans can have a great effect on revenue\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang gave a chesire grin. This could he perfect, going out as Sakura and making her look bad in front of her fans would be the perfect sabotage \"Sure thing! I'll go out right away!\" Before Kaoru could say anything or look up and see how Sakura had changed Yang was running out of the theater like a speeding bullet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang began walking around town looking for the perfect public place to embarass Sakura. As he walked he noticed that he was getting a lot of looks. It was like every man in the city was staring at him \"Geez, Sakura's pretty, but not <i>that</i> pretty\" Yang mumbled to himself, getting increasingly uncomfortable with the stares<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang soon arrived at his destination, the ferris wheel. People were always gathered around here so getting a crowd to embarrass Sakura should be easy. Yang prepared his lungs and readied himself to give a shout \"HEY EVERYONE I HAVE SOME<i>thing special to say about my next show~</i>\" as he finished Yang put a hand to his throat. Had he just sung the end of his sentence? He just wanted to yell but a certain feeling in his throat made him adjust his voice so it cane out as singing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a large crowd had gathered around Yang, much larger than he was expecting. He recgonized some of the people in the crowd as people who were looking at him as he walked down the street. Had they been following him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Yang put those thoughts out of his mind. Now was his chance to embarrass Sakura in public and hopefully win this arguement. However before he could speak several people in the crowd shouted \"I LOVE YOU SAKURA!\" Yang rolled his eyes, \"yeah yeah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again before Yang could speak he was interrupted. He jumped back as some grabby fan brushed his hair \"Hey, hands off!\" Yang yelled at the fan, only for another to start sniffing him \"Back off!\" Yang shoved the fan. However for every action Yang did more and more people got into his personal space, entranced by Sakura's beauty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting creeped out Yang began to slowly back up, embarrassing Sakura could wait until later. He needed to get away from this crowd! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more fans grabbed at him Yang began to ran, he had no set destination in mind he just needed to get away from these creeps! After a few minutes of running Yang ran into a building and encounted a familar face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Yang run into?</span></div></div>",

Whatever that pink light was had once again turned him into a girl. He looked down at his once again female body and sighed in disappointment. Although he had once again swapped gender's, this body didn't have the same figure as Setsuko's, his breast size was closer to Claris' than Anastasia's (not that he knew the sizes off a of memory).

Things weren't too different than his time as Setsuko, he was a member of the Flower Division and would rehearse for a play when not training. However, this was an entirely different Flower Division and the theater looked sparkling compared to in his time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of convenience, while he let everyone know he was from the Flower Division of the future, he never said a word about the fate of the old Flower Divison. Kanna and Maria had asked about their future selves, but Seijuro lied and said they had retired. He had no plan on what to do if Iris asked him, being a child she would still be young enough to still be in the Flower Division during his time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though his time in the past had been enjoyable so far, he wanted to get back to his own time as soon as possible. For help with that, he went to the old Flower Divison's resident scientist, Kohran. She had invented video chatting and Sumire had told him once about Kohran's own body swapping machine she used on some guy named Kayama and her. Perhaps she could invent something to get him back to his own time, or at least back to his own body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking her to build a time machine Kohran's reaction was \"Keh he!\" And she went to work all night. Once she was done called Setsuko to her room, where the machine rested under a blanket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Setsuko. Time travel seemed ridiculous and impossible at first, but then when you told me how you were sent here by spirit power, so I got to thinking. Why don't we try linking the spiritual power from someone in the present with someone in the future? Normally this would be impossible for a human, until now. I present.....Toraberu-kun!\" Kohran gave a speech about her new invention and pulled off the blanket revealing it \"Now Setsuko, just hold onto this and focus your spirit energy. The machine will connect to whoever is currently using the most spirit energy in the future and bring you to them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro had to admit, it seemed solid. He grabbed the device and began focusing the little spirit power her had. As he did he noticed Kohran had put on a blacksmith's mask \"Uh, what's that for?\" He asked nervous<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Protection. Toraberu-kun explodes whenever it's used\" Kohran said in a casual muffled noise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.....wait it WHAT?!\" Before Seijuro could get an answer the room was filled with black smoke from Kohran's invention. Something had happened</span></div></div>",

Kohran coughed and blew away the smoke as best she could, and when she could finally see again she saw Toraberu-kun was in pieces on the ground, but 'Setsuko' was no where to be found.  After examining all of the remains Kohran came to a conclusion, \"Well, she didn't shrink, so she was either vaporized or she's back in her own time period!  I'm pretty it's the later.\"  Kohran picked up the pieces and got back to work on another project to hopefully pull Sumire back to her time period.<br>\r\n____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Seijuro was on the ride of his life.  He felt like he was in a tube and was being squeezed out of it by a vacuum.  The energy and smoke surrounding him was absolutely insane, he was actually starting to get a little motion sickness from this crazy trip.  But he managed to hold it in, figuring that vomiting into a energy portal void might be a bad idea.  After what felt like an eternity, Seijuro started to hear voices.  They were muffled, but he could for certain hear voices he knew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes!  It was Sakura, young Sumire, and Yang talking to Claris, Reiji, and older Sumire about what was going on.  As if in slow motion Seijuro felt himself falling from the sky into the conversation and he realized the source of the 'vacuum' he was feeling.  He was being attracted to the strongest spiritual source around the only question was out of everyone in the room, who was that, and what would happen when he reached them?</span></div></div>",

With his experience as 'Setsuko' in his time period he was able to join the Flower Division not only in demon fights, but also as a performer on the stage.  He was glad to have something to do besides worry about the future.  Kohran even tried her best to make a device that would send him back, or at least would make it so he could communicate with his time period.  But every attempt ended in failure.  Kohran eventually started to explain her theories on time travel and how because 'Setsuko' had traveled back in time the timeline he was from had already split off, and now they may be too far off to communicate with or send him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dropped Seijuro's spirt for a few days, but the Flower Diviton and all the other people around the theatre did everything they could to make the 'future girl' more comfortable.  And Seijuro did enjoy himself.  He loved getting to know the original Flower Division in person.  He'd only seen the bromides of them and read a few brief snippets about them.  He had heard that overseas they had actually made a series of video games about the Flower Division that had gripping stories, characters, and gameplay, but for some reason those never came overseas so he never got to play them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few weeks Seijuro got some time off and tried to find someone who could at least make his stay a little bit easier.  He went to look for Reiji to see if he could make the gender changing device again so he could at least have his own body while in the past.  But when he found him, he of course was just 9 years old.  Seijuro approached him to see if he had a fraction of his technical knowledge yet, but after he ate a few boogers he just looked at 'Setsuko' and asked her to marry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a freshly slapped child in his rear view, Seijuro decided to make the best of his new life.  He became a full on member of the Flower Division and loved spending time with them.  He even got to use the baths without getting beaten up!  Although he did have to hand a few beatings to Ichiro who seemed to have the same if not worse luck than Seijuro when it came to talking to women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why Seijuro found himself bonding with Ichiro more than anyone else.  He could relate to being the only guy surrounded women and it seems like out of all the choices of things you could say, you say the most embarrassing thing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few years of hanging out with Ichiro on a daily basic, one day he asked Setsuko if she'd like to make it a lifetime.  By then she'd already decided there was no going back.  And she was more than ok with that.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ve been looking for it everywhere, but I can\u2019t find it!\u201d She apologized repeatedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro waved a dismissive hand \u201cthat\u2019s fine.

Anyway, I finally thought of a way you can make it up to me!\u201d Claris looked at him confused as Seijuro started putting on some fake tears \u201cYou see....Yang of the Shanghai Division....he....he.....he broke my heart!\u201d Seijuro was crushing his toes with his shoe to keep up the fake tears<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris let out a stream of French curses, how dare someone break her friend\u2019s heart! She pulled out her spell book \u201cThe heart is special and shouldn\u2019t be played with!

Yui stopped laughing and gave him a kick to the stomach. He may have had the larger boobs, but she was physically stronger now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two left the theater Seijuro called out to Yang \u201cJust remember, having a new body can be unpredictable! You might start doing things you would never have dreamed of before!\u201d He planted the seeds for how he planned to use the doll tommorow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro wondered how he should use the doll, he had plenty of things happen to him to give him inspiration, but he wondered if he should do it alone? Azami and Hatsuho were reckless with his own doll, maybe he could rely on them to help him control Yang? Then again, he could probably ask the whole Flower Division for help on this if he gave them the same story of Yang breaking \u2018Setsuko\u2019s\u2019 heart<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over as he slept, Seijuro decided to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claris, Reiji, and Azami debated back and forth in the lounge for a few hours before Seijuro on Elise's behalf ordered the three schemers to get to bed.  The three grumbled to agree to meet tomorrow afternoon as 'Setsuko' saw them off.  And with his assignment of the day from Elise complete Seijuro let out a sigh of relief and went to 'Setsuko's new room in the flower division hallway since Elise had gotten his former captain quarters.  As he squeezed out his way too tight pants Elise had gotten him as a part of his new uniform and slipping into a way to short and almost see through night gown Reiji had been oh so generous to provide, Seijuro reminded himself as long as he kept his nose clean, followed Elise and Sumire's instructions (and stayed away from the women's bath) he'd be back to himself in no time at all.<br>\r\n______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day the troublesome trio of Claris, Reiji, and Azami met in the kitchens to discuss what they were going to about Elise now that they had a night to sleep on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I've got a pretty good plan to deal with Elise that I think we should go with that I spent a good deal of the night scripting out, but I'd like to hear what the two of you have come up with first.\"  Claris said putting a small pile of journals, formulas and hand drawn maps on the table.  Reiji looked at Claris with a confused look before said, \"Oh yeah, I knew we were doing something, last night after I increased the Spiracle Armor's energy capacity I actually started working on a database of all the pictures...I MEAN THE ARTICLES from my important work magazines so that Elise can't just take them away from me anymore.  So I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris looked disappointed at one of her comrades lack of resolve but she still had Azami on her side, \"Well Azami, what did you come up with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzami nodded and smiled as she laid out what she did, \"This morning I visited Hiromi and told her Elise had taken all my manju, so she made me a larger fresh batch at 1/2 the cost because she felt so bad for me.  I've already had my sweet revenge.  And savory.  And there was a lemony one that was a little sour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris sighed, \"Well, it looks like we're going with my plan, and it's probably for the best, but I still need the two of your help.\"  Claris laid out her charts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out a majority of Claris's plan involved a heavily scripted debate and a fight scene involving the Mecha's but Reiji vetoed that, so Claris went with her 21st plan.  Elise tended to have a brief 15 minute tea break for herself and Setsuko.  Claris plan involves casting a spell on Elise's tea that would cause her to be more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that when Elise drinks this tea she'll be 'relaxed', but what in the world do you exactly mean by that?\"  Reiji asked not quite sure what the end result of this plan was supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaris was a bit stumped by the question, but didn't want to show it, \"I just mean she'll be more relaxed, it could take many forms.  She might just loosen up on the rules and hang out with us more, she might get a less stuffy wardrobe, she might even...\"  Claris's eyes lit up, \"She might even fall in love!!!\"  Claris made some sort of noise that Reiji could only describe as 'Squeeee!'  The odd look Reiji and Azami gave Claris seemed to shake her back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first, we need to make the tea for the spell!\"  Claris said enthusiastically.</span></div></div>",

The shaking seemed to finally fade however Seijuro's conciousness faded with it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world went white for what felt like minutes until his vision finally returned. However he was not in the hangar like he expected, instead he was in the record's room. \"Huh, how did I get her-\" Seijuro began but became shocked by his own voice. Putting a hand to his throat, Seijuro recognized the voice that had come out of his mouth, that was Claris\u2019!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to realize what that meant Seijuro looked down at himself. He was wearing Claris\u2019 outfit, and said outfit was currently on her body. He felt something tickling the back of his neck and instinctively grabbed at it, only to reel back as he had just grabbed his own hair, or rather Claris\u2019 blonde hair. That machine turned him into Claris!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to run to the hangar to demand Reiji turn him back, however he had to slow down after the unfamiliar breeze between his legs distracted him. He started slowly walking to the hangar tugging at Claris\u2019 skirt the whole time <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the stairs even more of the differences between his own body and Claris\u2019 became apparent. His eyes were drawn to the breasts currently hanging from his chest. As he stared his face grew red. Claris was an attractive woman, and he had been guilty of walking in on her in the bath before. Having her body all to himself was tempting. He felt his body moving all by itself toward either his room or the bath, but quickly snapped out of it \u201cNo! If Claris found out she would kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat....what the hell is this?!\" Seijuro shouted in a tone nowhere nesr as calm and composed as Anastasia's usual voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijruo looked down, and to his shock his view was blocked by Anastasia's ginormous breasts! Reiji's machine had somehow put him into Anastasia's body! Seijuro looked around the lobby and noticed he was getting looks from people, the star of the theater yelling randomly must have looked strange to an outsider <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro tried to excuse himself by walking to the stage, but the surprise of Anastasia's high heels in addition to his new center of gravity cause him to trip in front of everyone. Once he got up he began to take slow awkward steps, once he was at the theater stage he held onto the seats to keep his balance until he finally made it backstage. Once backstage he looked into a mirror, the walk and everything before that made it clear whose body he was in, but to see a different face looking back at him in the mirror was a whole other level of surreal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A, E, I, O, U\" Seijuro tested his new voice, getting used to a voice famous for singing come out of his mouth would be impossible to get used to. \"Reiji needs to fix this immediately\" he told himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro looked around, he was unmistakably in the theater kitchen now. Did Reiji build a teleporter? Amazing if it was true, how Seijuro didn't like being the guinea pig for it \"I better get down to....\" Reiji looked around, Hatusho began to speak but he didn't see her \"Hatusho?\" He asked, only to hear Hatsuho's voice again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to realize what that meant Seijuro looked down at himself. He was wearing Hatusho's outfit, and said outfit was currently on her body. He felt something brush against his shoulder and instinctively grabbed at it, only to reel back as he had just grabbed his own hair, or rather Hatsuho's red hair. That machine turned him into Hatsuho!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reeeeiji!\" He yelled out and began to stomp his way toward the hanger. As he walked to differences between his own body and Hatsuho's became prevalent. The new weight on his chest moved sliightly as he walked and kept gaining his attention, her hakama pants were also much looser than his own<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even on a situation like this Reiji thanked his luck. If he had to be forced into any Flower Division member's body, Hatsuho was probably one of the more comfortable choices. Becoming a child like Azami or Klara, or wearing Claris' skirt were things that had never crossed his mind as wanting to do, not even once<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-eeeeeeeeeh?!\" Was all Seijuro could say as he looked in the mirror of the theater costume room. Thay reflection wasn't his, in fact it cluld be considered the anthiesis of his! Staring back at him was Klara, the newest and youngest member of the Flower Division<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do, Reiji?!\" Seijuro yelled to himself and began to stomp off to the hangar to try and force Reiji to fix this immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-help?\" Seijuro in Azami's body asked to no one in particular. As soon as he regained vision after Reiji's machine worked the world seemed upside down. Unfortunately for him it wasn't the world that was upside down, but him. Azami was on the ceiling before he ended up in her body and now he was desperately hanging on to it. He was sure the fall wouldn't injure her or worse, but pain was pain and he desperately wanted to avoid that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-S-Sakura!\" Was all Seijuro could say as he looked in the mirror. Not only had thay machine Reiji made turned him into her, but it did so at the worst possibly time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro's mind was completely blank, not knowing what to do. He was on Sakura's room and it looked like she was in the middle of changing clothes as he became her. Her kimono was half off and next to him was a folded clean one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaah!\" Seijuro said and rolled on the floor on anguish \"Do I finish changing for her, do I stay in this one?! What should I do Sakura?!\"</span></div></div>",

However Seijuro forgot to take into account his body didn't always do what he wanted it to do, and that still applied even in the bodies of the 6 girls.  Each Seijuro started moving in a jerky robotic motion as he tried to fight back with his mind.  He knew was happening.  Once again, against his will, he felt his body dragging itself into the women's bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I must resist!\"  Sakura-Seijuro said as his body forced itself into a secret passageway that lead to the Bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll never forgive me!\"  Claris-Seijuro said as he tried to fight his legs from going down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll probably actually kill me!\"  Hatsuho-Seijuro said praying to the spiritual stone for spiritual power to fight his body's will.  Alasy, Hatsuho-Seijuro too found himself on his way to the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go to the bath if I'm locking in here!\"  Azami-Seijuro said using his last bit of strength to throw a kunai at Azami's door to break the lock and get him stuck in the room.  However Seijuro felt his body subconsciously squat and jump, the next thing he knew he too was in front of the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be stronger than this!\"  Anastasia-Seijuro said doing everything he could to stop his hand from pushing the Bath button in the elevator.  In and epic struggle for that ages Seijuro tried to pull his seemingly possessed hand away towards the Workshop button, but alas Seijuro didn't take Anastasia's bosom into account as it managed to push the Bath button as Seijuro let out a wail knowing he was beaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't happening this isn't happening!\"  Klara-Seijuro said just closing his eyes and shaking his head trying to wake up, however when he opened his eyes he was already in front of the bath and 5 other Flower Division Members were around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 6 Seijuro's looked at each other, no knowing they were all the same man split into 6.  Azami-Seijuro spoke up first, \"Ah, hello...fellow girls...you guys can go in the bath I'll just leave.\"  Azami-Seijuro tried to jump away but couldn't make himself leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's ok, you girls go to the bath, I have to uh...read.\"  Claris-Seijuro said not wanting to be in such a situation, especially afraid of what would happen if somehow the girls or Sumire found out who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 6 'girls' awkwardly stood around waiting for the others to make the first move into the bath.  They stood still not even making small talk for over a minute as each Seijuro tried to figure out what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seijuro's body could barely take a step forward and was jittering in every direction possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now Sakura I hey stop right foot ow!\" Absolute gibberish came out of Seijuro's mouth as the 6 current occupants all tried to control the body at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here they are. It took a while to figure out if all six of them were there but everyone is safe and accounted for! Emphasis on safe, I have done nothing wrong and this was an unforseeable accident!\" Reiji once again tried to push away any blame he could get for this situation. However it seemed that the Flower Division didn't agree with his blamelessness and acted in unison to punch Reiji<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumire sighed both from relief that everyone seemed to be okay, but also exhaustion that this nonsense was even happening \"And where is Seijuro right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue.

What the heck was that!  Gah!  I can't see a think and my voice feels funky.\"  Seijuro felt like his voice was weirdly high as he tried to cough up whatever was making his voice sound weird.  Reiji managed to turn on a vent to send the smoke out of the workshop, but when he saw Seijuro his eyes went wide.  In a bit of a panic he turned off the fan and tried to wave the smoke back into Seijuro's face so he couldn't see what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!  Seriously Reiji!  Are you trying to kill me?\"  Seijuro coughed as he waved the smoke and hit his hair, which was weirdly longer than he ever remembered it being.  \"Not trying to kill you, I just want to...finish this test.  Now get back into the machine and I'll fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not getting into that death trap...wait...fix?  What needs fixing?  What did you do Reiji?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing needs fixing!  Everything is perfectly fine.  I mean just look on the bright side, you've got four limbs, two eyes, what else do you need in life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REIJI!\"  Seijuro shouted very shrilly, as Reiji gritted his teeth and went to a closet and pulled out an old mirror.  \"Now Seijuro, before you look, I want you to know this wasn't on purpose, can probably be undone, and has actually made you cuter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuter?  What did your crazy machine do do...what?\"  Seijuro was looking at himself in the mirror, but it wasn't himself.  Well the face was his mostly if you looked past the bright green eyes and long brown hair the fell in front of it.  But the body was definitely not his, for one it was shorter than his normal tall and lanky self, and the chest was most certainly that of a woman.  A very gifted woman.  After staring at the mirror for a minute, Seijuro turned to Reiji who was attempting to tip toe out of the room unnoticed.  Seijuro grabbed a hammer off of the work bench and tossed it meer inches away from Reiji's head.  \"Explain.  Now.\"  Seijuro said glaring daggers at his old friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this was not what was supposed to happen.  I have another device I was going to test on you if I wanted to turn you into a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?!\"  Seijuro said, but Reiji continued, \"This device was supposed to teleport you to members of the Flower Division, or whoever's DNA I put into the machine.  It was supposed to help you get to them in time for attacks easier, but there seems to have been a malfunction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think!\"  Seijuro said motioning into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Maybe the teleporter can't handle 5 different types of DNA at the same time?  Maybe I crossed a wire somewhere?  I'll figure it out eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figure it out now!  What happened to me!\"  Seijuro asked stomping his foot trying to intimidate, but judging by the flush on Reiji's cheek it came off as more cute than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\"  Reiji pointed Seijuro to the mirror.  \"Don't you recognize it?  The long brown hair is Sakura's, the eyes are Claris, your oddly strong arms are Hatsuho's, you have Azami's hight, and you have Anastasia's...torso.\"  Reiji said actually being somewhat tactful.  \"The DNA I used for the teleport somehow fused with your own making you the vision of beauty before you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro stared in shock at what his body had become and looked at the smoking mess of a machine that had made him this way and probably wouldn't be able to undo it.  Seijuro knew what he had to do.</span></div></div>",

Seijuro considered asking Reiji what any of them actually did, but if a teleporter malfunctioned to the point of making him a fusion of the Flower Division, he doubted Reiji's descriptions of what these were supposed to do would be helpful<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeine, meenie, miney...\" Seijuro said as he randomly picked up an invention of Reiji's off the table. It was some kind of helmet with a bunch of steam tubes and a screen to cover the user's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on and turning on the helmet, Seijuro saw some words appear on the screen. <i>Speak your name for voice recognition</i> \"Um, Seijuro?\" Seijuro said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Voice pattern does not match</i> the screen said. Seijuro sighed, he couldn't argue, it wasn't his own voice after all. Actually, what was his voice now? He hadn't gotten a good listen before as he panicked \"A,E,I,O,U\" He tested it again. \"Hmm, I guess I sound a bit like Azami, Klara, and Claris, but I don-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Voices regonized. Welcome Azam- Voices recognized. Welcome Claris. Voices recognized. Welcome Klara. VoicerecovoiceClarAzamVoi</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't look good!\" Seijuro said and tried to take the helmet off, but it was too late. The helmet fastened itself on tight and began to bellow out steam. He was in for the long run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the helmet doing to Seijuro?</span></div></div>",

The helmet he'd gotten attached to his newly feminine head was shaking, sputtering, steaming, and smoking up a storm as it seemed to be breaking trying to decipher his mixed Flower Division voice.  As the smoke started to get worse, Seijuro started to feel his head was burning up, he tried to take off the helmet but it was too hot to touch.  \"REIJI!\"  Seijuro cried out, and Reiji unable to turn down a damsel in distress grabbed the fire extinguisher and doused Seijuro's head with the life saving white smoky substance.  Reiji grabbed a wrench and with a quick turn, detached the locking mechanism and ripped it off of Seijuro's head before flinging it into the hanger before it blew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro coughed and sputtered as he tried to catch his breath.  Looked up at the tall mechanic with his (literally) new eyes he said, \"Thanks Reiji, you saved.  I guess you can get some things right sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  I get a lot of things right!  And shouldn't you be more grateful to me?  I'll accept payments with a year long subscription to Steam Powered Beauties Monthly.\"  Reiji said putting the fire exstinguisher down after it's second hanger saving operation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?  Well I wouldn't have been in danger in the first place if you hadn't invented an exploding death helmet.\"  Seijuro snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not a death helmet, that was a state of the art combat simulator...or was it a memory jogger...maybe it was a hair styler...\"  As Reiji pondered this he looked at Seijuro and chuckled, \"Well if it was the hair styler you might want to give it another shot, Sakura would kill you if she saw what you'd done to her hair.\"  Seijuro went back to the mirror and saw that Sakura's long beautiful brown hair on his head was now messing and obviously singed in places.  If he cared about his appearance he'd definitely have to go to a salon or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji poked at the remains of the helmet as Seijuro looked at Reiji's other devices and debated whether it was worth another risk to try and find something that would get him his body back.  He really wasn't looking forward to explaining to everyone who he really was.</span></div></div>",

Sliding along the theater floor took much less energy than walking, maybe he should make himself a pair of these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the pair reached the costume room. Reiji turned off the lights and grabbed a flashlight.

Most didn't hear it, others thought it was just the sound of the wind. However one person's ears twitched as they heard the last word. Itsuki's eyes practically became stars as she heard about Bromides and followed the sound to its soruce<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Seijuro was backed against the wall as 'Komachi' held costumes up to him \"I can't wear those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Reiji's hands were Anastasia's Arabian outfit that left nothing for the imagination and Azami's red riding hood outfit that would be much too small for Seijuro to wear. \"Well, I guess you don't want the bath house bromides\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeijuro grumbled and grabbed his head, very conflicted on what to do. \"Fine!\" Seijuro said and grabbed the Arabian outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji had to suppress his laughter as he made Seijuro pose in the outfit and even put on a little dance. He wished Komachi had a camera on her, this would have made great blackmail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you happy? Can I have the bromides now?\" Seijuro pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji shook his borrowed finger. \"Sorry, but that's only half the test.\" He held up the Red Riding Hood outfit \"It's time for you to go public in this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No no no no no!\" Seijuro protested. That wasn't happening, it wasn't worth it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bath house bromiiiiiides\" Reiji said in a sing-somg voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAAAAAAH!\" Seijuro yelled, it was worth it. \"Fine.

However, a wrench was about to be thrown in his plan as an ominous presence loomed behind him \"BATH HOUSE BROMIDES!\" The voice of Itsuki yelled from behind him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!\" Reiji jumped in surprised and fell again, unsure how to land with wheels on his sandals. \"Where did you come from?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always arrive when I smell new bromides. Now give me 'em!\" Itsuki the bromide momster got too close for comfort, Reiji also took note of how she was now taller than him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not-\" Reiji was about to spill the beans that they weren't real but stopped himself. If he told her she could tell Seijuro and ruin the whole plan, and he couldn't get away with telling her she needed to prove theater loyalty. No one was as loyal to the theater as her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not what?! Cheap?! I can pay!\" Itsuki said in preparation for Komachi to scam her and make her pay a ridiculous amount<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReiji sighed. He needed a way to deal with Itsuki while also keeping her from telling Seijuro that the bathhouse bromides weren't real</span></div></div>",

Seems that man didn't like my services. Kiryu knew that this would lead to some trouble, so he began to walk away, only to be stopped by the fortune teller. \"Wait, young man. Allow me to thank you for saving me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't any thanks.\" Kiryu said humbly, he was just doing what came naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, at least let me express my appreciation. I'll give you one free use of my service.\" The fortune teller said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need my fortune told.\" Kiryu said bluntly, the last encounter he had with a fortune teller was nothing but complete nonsense afterall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho, young man. I don't give simple fortunes, I do something much more special. I give people a whole new perspective on life.\" The fortune teller explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiryu's interest was peaked. \"Alright, I'll try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" The fortune teller said as they began to do something with their hands \"You're lucky I was feeling generous, usually I charge up to 1 billion yen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kiryu could express how aghast he was at that outrageous price, his vision began to fade, what was this persin doing to him? Soon he saw nothing but black for several seconds. Soon his vision returned, but something was wrong. Not only did he feel different, he was in a completely different place. He was still outside, but he was on a completely different street. He saw his reflection in a nearby building and his jaw dropped, he was no longer himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did Kiryu end up in the body of?</span></div></div>",

It was small and shaped like a TV remote but the design was completely alien. To begin with, it only had a few buttons and each had a completely foreign symbol on it. Looking on the back, there didn't seem to be any slot for batteries; instead, it was only a smooth metallic surface that reflected his confused expression. It was obviously not man-made and the tarnished piece of paper he had found with it only heightened that belief. Body swapping? Possession? It all seemed so ridiculous - like something out of a cartoon. However, with what he had seen this year, maybe it wasn't so ludicrous.<i> Could it be connected to the Metaverse?</i> It was possible but the circumstances in which he found this box were completely different to the app so maybe it was unrelated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had found this device in Inokashira park earlier today. The silver tint of the buried remote caught his attention as he walked through the park and the note it was wrapped in piqued his curiosity so he dug it up and took it home. If it was real, this could prove useful for both him and the Phantom Thieves and, in addition, it had seemed like the remote wanted him to take it anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper had explained clearly how to use the remote and each of its functions though he had yet to test any of them. He was hesitant. Sure, the note had explained the remote but he didn't know if he could trust it. He had found it in the middle of a public park; there was no way of knowing where it had come from or who had left it there. Maybe there was information hidden from him, such as unintended side effects, or maybe the remote has an entirely separate purpose. Maybe he was just being paranoid and should just bite the bullet and use it. Though, he could ask someone to help him test it, so he wasn't in this alone if something happened. He could ask a fellow member of the Phantom Thieves or one of his confidants to help him. Though, that could end up putting them in danger and Ren wasn't sure he could risk that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Ren decided to...</span></div></div>",

He felt the weight of a hat on his head as well. The world looks so strange with one eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said, \"It worked that's amazing.\" He heard Caroline's voice come out of his mouth with clear shock which was a rarity for her. He definitely had her body no doubt about it. The question was did it work completely? He or rather she only had one way to find out. He pocketed the remote and made his way over to the Velvet room door.

Every second he was in the body he thought pf the cruel ways Caroline would treat him while in the Velvet Room, maybe he should get some harmless payback?

Most of the time it came off to him as just a toy for them to play with. The anger was mostly directed at Caroline as Justine was more reserved. He can take verbal abuse far more than physical abuse. As he made his way into the mall he searched for the clothing store. He'd give Caroline a complete makeover should he switch....back. Wait what was that thought? Should he switch back? He meant when they switched back. Something about that thought felt off...leaving this body? As these thoughts crossed his or rather her mind she failed to realize she had bumped into a salesperson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salesperson said, \"Hello dear. Can I help you find something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen looked up at the woman who had a friendly smile on her face. That was a rare occurrence usually everyone just scoffed at him because of his record. It seemed like everyone knew his record and it both disgusted him and was hurt by it. The woman was being genuinely nice. He wasn't used to such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen said, \"Oh yes mam. I was hoping to buy some new clothes. My guardian was too busy today, so he said I should go by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman said, \"I'd be happy to help! What are you looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen said, \"Oh I'm not really sure right now. Do you have any suggestions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman said, \"Please follow me.\" She led Ren to the children's department normally he'd be upset, but considering the body he now had children clothes was a necessity. He can't walk around like a prison warden all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman said, \"I have a couple suggestions. I think a tom boy look would do wonders for you or I'd suggest a cute skirt or dress. Let me grab what I'm thinking about.\" The woman left to go find the clothes she mentioned. After a few minute she returned with some options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her left hand was a cute dress with a pink top half and a dark blue bottom half with two ribbons in the back. She also had light purple stockings with a pair of boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her right hand was  a light green tank top with a cute pair of green short shorts and a pair of black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen looked at the two options she had. The dress was as far away she can get from the prison warden attire. That was her original plan, but the short shorts could be very embarrassing as well. She didn't know when she'd switch back, but she wanted to be comfortable during her time with this body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she go with? </span></div></div>",

Could you bring me some variants of the dress with different colors? I'd really like a blue one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleswoman said, \"Of course dear! Why don't you try it on while I get the other dresses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen nodded and took the dress she had been offered and went into the changing room. She looked in the mirror realizing she was about see Caroline naked for the most part. Instead of being uncomfortable like expected she didn't feel too bothered peeping on the tiny warden's body. It was her own body right now. She quickly took her prison warden outfit, but when she went to take off the eye patch she was hesitant to do so. It felt wrong to take it off for some reason. She decided to leave the eye patch be and changed into the outfit she had chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in the mirror doing a few twirls and giggled. She had to admit she felt really cute in the outfit. Sure the eye patch kind of clashed with it, but she still really loved it. She heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleswoman voice said, \"Dear are you finished changing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen quickly said, \"Oh yes I just finished changing.\" She stepped out of the fitting room and modeled a bit for the saleswoman who squealed in joy at the adorable girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleswoman said, \"It looks wonderful on you! I knew I made a good choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen smiled gratefully, \"Yes you did thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleswoman asked, \"Is there anything else you'd like? Do you plan to wear it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well do you have any jewelry that would go well with the outfit? I think I'll wear it out. I'll need a purse or bag to put my old clothes in.\" Ren answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleswoman said, \"I have just the thing. Why don't we head to check out and I can give it to you there if you're done searching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen nodded, \"Yeah I think I'm ready to check out. Let me grab my old clothes first.\" She went back in the fitting room and grabbed her warden outfit making sure the remote and her phone were still in there. Once she gathered up her old clothes she followed the woman to check out. She had picked up enough clothes for a month or two. She wanted to try this body out in the metaverse. She never knew when the next heist would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two arrived at the register the saleswoman grabbed something from the back to show Ren. When she returned she had a small pink purse and a red crystal looking necklace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen frowned the necklace looked expensive. \"I don't think I can afford the necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleswoman said, \"It's on the house. Truthfully we've had this necklace for months and it won't sell. It's only party jewelry.  Think of it as a special gift for everything you bought today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen smiled, \"Thank you so much!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paid for her things and began making her way out of the mall when realized a mistake, \"I can't carry all this stuff to Leblanc on my own. I need help. Who should I call?\"</span></div></div>",

She decided to call up Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dialed her friend's number and waited as it rang a few times before she heard Ann pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn said, \"Hey Rin it's not often you call me up out of the blue. Can I help you with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen blinked at what Ann had called him Rin? Had the remote changed reality more than he thought? Rin...he liked the name a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn said, \"Hey Rin are you still there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin said, \"Oh yes sorry! I got lost in my thoughts for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn laughed, \"I swear you can be as scatterbrained as Ryuji sometimes. What do you need help with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin pouted, \"I am not scatterbrained!\" Her voice sounding much more like the real Caroline did there was some authority in it, but Ann seemed to ignore it. \"Anyway can you come to the mall? I went clothes shopping and well I bought a little too much. I need some help taking it back to Leblanc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn answered happily, \"Why didn't you tell me you went clothes shopping? I would have loved to come with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin said, \"Sorry Ann it slipped my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn said, \"No problem I'll be there shortly. I'll see you soon.\" Ann soon hung up on Rin. Rin not having much else she could do waited for her friend to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later Rin spotted Ann's blonde hair coming towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn smiled, \"Sorry to keep you waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin smiled, \"It's fine Ann I wasn't waiting long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy to hear that. So if you don't mind me asking why did you decide to buy some new clothes?\" Ann asked as she grabbed one of the clothing bags by Rin's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin answered, \"I just wanted to change my style up. I've been getting strange looks with my uh....warden cosplay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn said, \"Fair enough. It's still pretty early in the day. Why don't we go somewhere and have some fun? We've been busy lately, so we haven't had time to just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin thought for a moment about Ann's question. She had a point they had been busy. They had just stolen Kaneshiro's heart and got him to confess. </span></div></div>",

Ann seemed dead set on having a girl's day out in Shibuya and Rin wasn't able to say no<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ann talked about going out to drink some tea and see Rin try on even more outfits, internally Ren began thinking about what to do. The longer he stayed in this body the more he seemed to be affected mentally, thinking more like a small girl as he appeared to be.  While the feeling wasn't unpleasant he didn't want to risk losing himself, and going on a girl's day with Ann might sink him further into the role<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin thought about what she could do to get out of this situation. The remote was the obvious solution, if a swap got her into this a swap could get him out of this. She had many options if she saw someone she knew (She was unwilling to use the remote on a stranger), obviously the most obvious solution would be using the Aware Swap button. Either swapping with someome directly to get out of the situation or swapping with Ann with someone to throw off her plans <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Unaware Swap button clearly involved unforeseen mental changes, so if she used unaware swap between herself and someone else then it would be back to square one. However, if Ann were to have some mental changes maybe she would be less willing to go on this girl's day out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as luck would have it Rin saw someone she knew, preparing the remote and the swap she wanted she initiated her plan swapping....</span></div></div>",

She was level-headed and intelligent enough to trust with this knowledge and to help test the remote.

A couple minutes passed by before he received a text back from Makoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm sorry. I can't meet up right now because I'm busy with studying. I can meet up tomorrow, however, at LeBlanc.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen was a little disheartened that he would have to wait til tomorrow to test the remote but he reasoned that it was worth it to be safe with the remote. He replied, saying it was okay to meet up tomorrow, before finding a place in the dusty attic of his room to stash the remote. He settled on hiding it inside his workbench, surrounded by lock-picks he had made. With that, he looked out at the darkened sky and decided to go to bed, anxious to finally test the remote with Makoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thoughts of the remote's supposed abilities floating around his head, Ren drifted off into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following day, Ren sat in the cafe, waiting for Makoto to arrive. His mind danced upon thoughts of what the remote could do. The seemingly infinite possibilities it provided laid before him in a web of ideas but, before he  could act on them, he had to test the remote with Makoto. He glanced at his phone; the last message he had received said that she'd be here in a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced outside. It was raining. He felt a little guilty about making her come here in this weather but he did need to test the remote. Hopefully, it wasn't just a prank and he hadn't wasted Makoto's time. He took his last bite of curry as the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto had arrived. Closing the door behind her, she approached Ren, curiosity plastered upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you had something to show me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its upstairs\" Ren quickly replied before leading her into the attic that was his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his room, he retrieved the remote and its instructions before presenting them to Makoto. Reading through the damaged note, her brow became increasingly furrowed. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is real? It seems so ludicrous\" she said with a half-laugh.<br>\r\n\"That's why I called you here. I want to test if it's real or not. The Metaverse seems ludicrous as well but that's real so why not this?\" Ren replied.<br>\r\n\"You do have a point. We should test it out then.\" Makoto declared, smiling. \"Aware swap should be first function to test then.\" Makoto then pressed the button twice,<br>\r\nfirst targetting herself then targetting Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Ren's perspective shifted from standing up to being sat down. Additionally, his body felt completely different. Of course it felt different; it wasn't his body. The remote had worked.<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Ren heard his own voice speak as he looked up at his own body, knowing that it was Makoto in control. \"This...This is unprecedented.\" She was completely in shock as she held up her current hands, inspecting her hands. Quickly, she then looked at Ren in her own body, still shocked. \"Is that you, Ren?\" He nodded. \"So it does work, then.\" she stated as her shock vanished. She then approached the remote and picked it up before reverting the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back in their original bodies, they back discussing the remote and what it could do. \"How does this device work, I wonder?\" Makoto absently-mindedly said as she inspected it. \"There don't seem to be any negative side effects of its use so it seems ok to use but is it connected to the Metaverse in any way?\" she said as she placed the remote down. \"Thank you, Ren, for showing this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have one question, though.\" replied Ren. \"Should we show the device to the rest of the Phantom Thieves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Makoto respond?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would probably be more comfortable outside if she wasn't herself then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving agreed upon their accomplice in using the device, Ren sent Futaba a message stating <i>I've got something you may be interested in. When are <br>\r\nyou free to meet up, preferably in private?<i> It didn't take long for a response to come shooting back, saying <i>You've got something for me? ooh, now I'm curious. I'm free right now if you want to swing by. ;)<i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems that she's free now so let's not waste any time.\" said Makoto, as she peered over Ren's shoulder. Nodding in agreement, He slid the remote into his pocket as both of them made their way to the Sakura residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering Futaba's room, Ren and Makoto found their fellow phantom thief sat at her computer, hammering away at her keyboard with great speed and precision. Upon<br>\r\nhearing the sound of you entering her room, Futaba turned her head to see Ren and Makoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this thing you wanted to show me then?\" Futaba exclaimed, eyes glistening with eagerness. Ren procured the remote from his pocket and began explaining<br>\r\nthe remote and its various functions, Futaba hanging on his every word. After Ren finished his explanation, Futaba responded. \"A remote capable of switching people's <br>\r\nbodies? Sounds implausible. Though, the metaverse itself is weird enough and, if it is real...\" A mischievous smirk manifested on Futaba's face that make Ren almost<br>\r\nregret his decision. \"So? Show me how the remote works, then I'll know you aren't crazy.\" Ren glanced at Makoto, who only gave a faint smile in repsonse. It should<br>\r\nhave been obvious that she'd demand proof, leaving now only the question of how to prove it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen immediately ruled out possession. Possessing Futaba wouldn't show her that the remote worked and wouldn't be fair to Futaba. Similarly, letting Futaba possess someone unsupervised would be a recipe for disaster. After looking through the remaining options, he came to the conclusion that an aware swap would be the most effective proof. Swapping himself and Makoto wouldn't help as she'd think they were just messing with her. She'd have to be directly involved in a swap. With that careful consideration, only two options remained: Swap himself and Futaba or swap Makoto and Futaba?</i></i></i></i></span></div></div>",

It was only a few days after they had defeated Madarame's shadow and taken his treasure, it was a very exhausting affair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, have you messed with the panels on the third floor of this place yet?\" Morgana asked the other phantom thieves as they all played cards<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, why?\" Asked Joker<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That mysterious kid Jose said something about how they can change how you look, maybe you guys can get cool makeovers to your phantom thief outfits\" Morgana explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that sounds cool. Why don't we give it a try?\" Ann said, putting down her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phantom thieves made their way up to the third floor on the thieves den and just as Morgana said, there were multiple panels for the phantom thieves to stand on. \"So, how do these work?\" Ryuji said as he walked on to one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno!\" Morgana exclaimed. \"Just try thinking or saying things, you idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up you dumb cat. Hey Ann-\" suddenly a puff of smoke enveloped Ryuji, where he once stood was now an exact replica of Ann in her Shujin uniform \"Do you have any idea...s\" the second Ann suddenly looked down at herself in pure shock \"What the hell?!\" Ryuji yelled as he examined himself, all over he looked exactly like Ann<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other phantol thieves were completely shocked. Ryuji had morphed into Ann just from saying her name on the panel, this must be what Jose had meant when he said the panels could change their appearance. Being calm and collected as always, Joker threw out a suggestion \"Ryuji say your own name\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?? Sure? Ryuji\" and with another puff of smoke Ryuji turned back to normal \"I'm back!\" Ryuji laughed, now that he knew he could turn back to his normal self at any time, the initial shock of his body changing had turned into excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the phantom thieves knew how these panels worked, who used them next?</span></div></div>",

He looked forward to the lazy sunday ahead of him now that he and his friends had seemingly captured the killer responsible for the chaos in Inaba, a teen from a different school by the name of Mitsuo. There had been several murders and even more kidnappings, but with the crisis out of the way he could live like a normal highs-chooler and enjoy the rest of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey big bro,\" a soft voice rang out from the living room as Yu was putting on his shoes. \"A package arrived for you today.\" Sitting by the TV, Yu's little cousin Nanako was point towards a small box left out on the kitchen counter for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu raised an eyebrow. \"Doesn't look like its from Tanaka...\" He put in a lot of orders for items useful to his investigations and forays into the midnight channel with the rest of the investigation team, but he couldn't recall making one recently. Curious, he opened up the box, seeing a small device decked out with 4 buttons and a leaflet with soe basic instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, that looks like a lot of nonsense,'</i> Yu remakred mentally as he read the notes with a blank expression. 'But then, this whole year has been a lot of nonsense.' Body swapping was of course, impossible, but Yu had reason to be more credulous than the average person. After all, he could phase through televisions and fought monsters on a regular basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I owe it to whoever sent it to give it a shot, even if it is an elaborate joke,\" Yu honestly couldn't imagine who might've sent it to him, but it'd be mean to deprive the prankster of their fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that for your TV upstairs?\" Nanako asked from across the room, having been watching silently the whole time Yu read the instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu shrugged, \"I guess you could say that.\" It was best not to go into detail before you could prove something; otherwise people don't really believe you. He knew that from experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If I want to test it, I suppose Nanako is right here,'</i> Yu reasoned absently. She was a smart kid, and he knew she would keep a secret if he asked her too. Still, if it worked, it might be best to keep knowledge of it confined to the investigation team. They already knew the supernatural was real, so it'd be less likely to shatter their worldview. There wasn't much to do in Inaba on your own, so Yu figured that basically any of his friends would be available right now</span></div></div>",

A sudden burst of nausea overtook him as the room seemed to spin around and his perspective became much, much smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try what?\" Yu heard his own voice ask, as he found himself sitting down on the other side of the room. Standing by the counter, he saw his own body looking at him like a deer in headlights. \"...uh, big bro...?\" There was a brief clatter as Nanako dropped the remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick downward glance confirmed for Yu that the remote worked. He pulled up a pair of small, delicate hands to his eyes, and looking past those hands he saw his legs were exposed - he was wearing Nanako's dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Yu was quick on his feet. He had spent this whole year involved in stranger things than this. While his balance was off, he managed to pull himself to his feet. \"Don't worry Nanako - it's me. Everything will be fine,\" he assured his cousin in his own body as he stood up, his balance more than a bit off center. If the remote switched them so easily, it'd switch them back just as easily. However, the issue of 'damage control' still remained. Yu had enough experience to deal with this, but how would he explain this to Nanako? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big bro, are you me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the clattering sound after they switched, Yu realized that Nanako - who was now looking herself over with a sense of awe - didn't really process the remote. He could try explaining everything to her, but it might lead to... issues. If he could get a hold of it without her realizing though, there was a chance he could switch them back without Nanako knowing about the device at all and just play dumb about it. Maybe she'd think it was a dream? Or just some magical event like in a movie? He knew he had to commit before her sense of awe turned into panic though. </span></div></div>",

Nanako looked at the remote in amazement. \"Uh, Nanako, please hand that back to me so we can go back to normal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu could see in Nanako's eyes that she clearly had no intention of swapping back. Before Yu could say anything else however, the doorbell rang. \"Hey bro, you there?\" He heard Yosuke's voice say. Yu wanted to slap his head. He had completely forgotten that the investigation team had all planned to go to the beach today. He needed to swap back fast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm coming!\" Nanako said trying to imitate Yu, after which she did a giggle.

He saw his old body riding away with the others on a scooter. He kicked the air in anger like a child. How could he just let Nanako take the remote from him. What if something happened and she got hurt? Yu brainstormed thinking of what to do to catch up with them, but nothing came to mind.

That should be me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie looked to Yukiko, both were clearly annoyed. They picked up Teddy and threw him as far into the water as they could, he went flying much farther than they expected. \"Woah, Yukiko, you're so strong now!\" Chie exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko giggled \"Yeah, I guess I am.\" This swap seemed to have at least some bright side as she flexed her new muscles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more brainstorming no one om the team could think of a way to swap back, they soon gave up and decided to pray another freak accident would happen and swap them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team went back to playing in the water, trying to take their minds of this bizarre situation, however almost everyone but Rise was constantly distracted by their new bodies, which made playing around awkward <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the sun began to set, without another 'freak accident' to cause any more swaps. Since it was about time to be going home, that meant it was time to change out of swimsuits. Everyone who was aware their body had been swapped watched over the other person in their body to make sure that they didn't do anything inappropriate. Nanako for her part waa giggling as she changed into Rise's clothes, she felt so pretty <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swapped pairs talked about what they'd have to do for the night, and unfortunately the only thing they really could do is go to each other's home's for the night and hope they swap back in their sleep or something \"I swear if you do anything in my body Yosuke, I'll break your arm, er, my arm, er, well when we swap back you'll have a broken arm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako looked at the remote, although she had been careful with it it still ended up covered in sand and a bit wet, it still looked like it would work judging from the glowing buttons, hopefully it would correctly. The gang got on their scooters and began to head back home, Nanako not swapping back with Rise<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie finally washed back onto shore after they had all left \"Heeeey, don't forget me guuuuys!\"</span></div></div>",

After those memories came up Nanako felt her mind calm down panicking would not do anyone any good. She couldn't figure out anything on the top of her head on how to fix this.

I would've made more, but I have to leave early today help set up in class. I'll see you after school! Then maybe we can play at Junes!\" Yu finished her meal and began leaving the house. Nanako felt like something about that was strange. Was Yu always that cheerful? Of course they were. That's how her little sister was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly finished off her breakfast and made her way outside and was greeted by Kanji and Yukiko who looked uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji said, \"Uh morning Senpai. How are you doing this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko said shyly, \"Morning Yu. Did you sleep well?\" Something about Kanji's body acting shy looked so wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako said, \"I slept well enough. How about you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji said, \"Er...it was...something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko said, \"We were hoping you could switch us back before school. You did a bit of research after we left right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako said, \"Er...I did what I could. Are you sure you want to risk it? What if we get a similar situation to Chie and Yukiko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji said, \"Damn it I'd rather take that risk than just go to school like this. I'm a first year there is no way I can pass as Yukiko in class especially someone at the top of the class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako sighed they had a point and Kanji being in Yukiko's body really bugged him a lot for a few reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako said, \"Alright but don't say I didn't warn you.\" She fired off the aware swap at the two of them and waited to see what happens</span></div></div>",

Nanako felt horrible about all this. Why couldn't the remote have a reset button? All it could was swap bodies and apparently clothes and gender. Who made this remote? She had so many questions with no answers just like with the murder case. She tried to puzzle out a solution for everything, but only thing she could come up with was just trying to swap everyone back to their proper body as best she could.  She was glad at least for her big brother that at least once they switched back he'd have a female body while Yukiko had a male one. Maybe their love could help them overcome everything? Chie and Yosuke were in the best position right now with just altered builds. She kept trying to concoct a plan in her mind. Rise was currently in her big brother's body, but she didn't seem bothered by it why was that? She couldn't remember for the life of her. Had an unaware swap been done between the two, but how? As she was gathering her thoughts she heard shouting in the halls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked towards the shouting voices and saw Kou and Ebihara arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKou said, \"Ebihara, you have to actually start showing up at the club to manage the team. If you don't you'll get in big trouble with the principal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi said, \"But it's so boring Kou. Hardly anyone shows up up for practice. I don't have anything to manage. I know the basketball team means a lot to you, but we just don't have anything to do! It's just soooo boring. Why don't we skip today and go to Okina City me and you? It will be a lot of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKou said, \"I refuse to skip practice! We have a match coming up soon we have to practice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi said, \"Gosh come on Kou it's one meeting no one is going to show up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued their argument and it was not quieting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako clenched her head the argument was just making her headache worse.

The remote sparked again as this was another new pair of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't look any different physically and were still wearing their normal clothes. Nanako wondered if the Aware Swap had behaved like normal, however then the two began to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-ichijou, what happened to us?\" Ai said hardly able to believe what she was seeing, she was looking at her own body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKou was equally shocked \"I have no idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEbihara was about to suggest that they find out what happened and find a way to switch back, however then she caught sight of the time. It was almost time for basketball practice! If she missed practice too many times she could get in trouble, odd, she had never cared about that before \"We'll have to figure out what's going on later, Kou. It's almost time for practice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Kou would be rushing to practice so he could play some basketball, but for some reason the thought wasn't very appealing to him right now. In fact he didn't want to go at all \"Yeah, you uh, go Ebihara. I think I'll skip today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi wasn't having it \"Don't you dare get my body on trouble just because you want to ditch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKou got an annoyed look on his face \"Well then you should have thought about that before missing so many days already.\" He said in a very in-Kou like manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi growled but she had no real comeback, she couldn't force him to come to practice. She began to head off toward the gym. Kou for his part looked through Ai's purse and pulled put a hand mirror. He had never found Ai particularly attractive before, but looking at her body in the mirror filled him with a mysterious sense of pride \"Maybe I should reward myself with a trip to Okina City\" he said to no one on particular before heading off to ditch school for the day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako sighed, clearly the remote had malfuncted again. Judging from Yu's memories and the conversation she had heard, Ai and Kou's personalities had been swapped. While it was a bit inconvenient, at least that was completely fixable unlike the changes done to Kanji, Yukiko, Yu, or herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distraction cleared Nanako resumed thinking of a way to fix everyone, and remember what was going on with Rise's current body.

Kou and Ebihara were in each other's bodies with the other's personality. She was in an older version of her original body she thinks? That memory was a bit hazy right now. Yu was in a younger version of Rise's body. While Rise was in Yu's body but wasn't bothered by it for some reason. Maybe she could leave Rise as is? She could switch Ai and Kou's bodies back, but couldn't do anything about the personality swap. Why'd this stupid machine have to break on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought long and hard about everything but couldn't figure out anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said, \"Oh forget my mind to mixed up right now! Maybe I should check the manual after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to head into class where she spotted Yosuke and Chie in their original seat. The two had opted to wear each other's uniform much to Yosuke's dismay. They just didn't have money for new clothes right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke said, \"Hey partner did something happen with Kanji and Yukiko and the remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie said, \"Yeah why is Yukiko a boy right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako sighed, \"They asked me to try and swap them back this morning. They got back into their own bodies, but now they are the opposite genders. I don't know how to fix this honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke said, \"Damn that has to suck. Maybe we should all look into the remote later today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie said, \"I guess that could work.\" The fact that Yukiko was now a boy and handsome one at that didn't leave her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKashiwagi said, \"Alright class settle down! We have work to do today. Please turn to page 152 of your history books we'll be reading to the end of this chapter and then I'll be quizzing you on the last 3  chapters.\" The class groaned, but got to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter classes got through the day Nanako spotted Teddie in one of the desk in his human form. He didn't have time to chat right now. She had to find Kou and Ebihara and switch their bodies back at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got up to go find them the remote fired on its own and hit Teddie and Kashiwagi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had his uncle's scooter, but he generally saved it for trips out of town with his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenerally, Yu could find any number of friends just by wandering up and down the street of the shopping district. Kanji and Rise both worked there with their families, and Chie and Yukiko often went shopping nearby. Yosuke and Teddy were probably off at Junes, but that was a bit further away. He supposed it would help speed things up to sed everyone a text to see if they were available, and stopped to flip open his cellphone as he reached the end of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

It struck him as a rather drastic choice, but it probably left the fewest loose ends in the long run. With a click he activated the device, and suddenly he felt weightless, floating like a cloud over his own body, which seemed to keep up the conversation with Ai as though he was still inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though processing what had happened to him, Yu stayed in this state for maybe a minute or two, just watching fascinated. He thought he'd be able to adapt fast to something like this, but he was evidently wrong. He felt like a set of eyes just floating around, meeting no resistance as he spun around every possible direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'll leave you be for right now,\" he heard Ai say as his attention settled back on the situation below. \"I should probably go study a bit, after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you at practice then,\" Yu's own body replied with a nod, as he took a right turn and continued down the sopping district. Yu wasn't totally sure what his body was going to do without the remote, but he guessed it at least gave him a convenient opening. He found that with a little focus, he could push himself along at a fairl steady pace, easily keeping up with Ai until the two came across an empty block. As Ai stopped to let a car pass, Yu made his move and pushed through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Yu gasped in a high pitched voice, letting out a sudden burst of air as he suddenly had lungs again. He could feel long hair tickling at his neck, and a sharp breeze across his legs. A quick look downwards revealed his legs were completely exposed - he was wearing a dress! It was the very same white and pink outfit that Ai had been wearing. He also realized, as his face turned red, that he had breasts. He could The device worked perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the device, he became suddenly aware of the fact that he had it clenched in Ai's right hand - his hand for the moment. He reached downwards to put it away in a pocket, but merely brushed a hand against the hems of his skirt. He awkwardly hid it away in Ai's purse instead. He fished around a bit more, but realized to his frustration that Ai had given him her compact mirror. Wanting to see his reflection, he walked up to a nearby storefront, staring into the window long enough to get a faint reflection of his new face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" he said in Ai's voice, \"that thing works. For real!\" The situation was beyond surreal, but he couldn't help but smile for a second. As far as supernatural occurrences went, this one had a lot more potential to be fun than the last one. Wearing a skirt didn't bother him that much, but he had to admit that being a girl was an experience he wasn't expecting. \"Well Ai,\" he whispered under his breath as he straightened out the ribbon around her chest, \"how about we see where this takes us, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to seem like a weirdo, he turned away from the window and walked across the street as Ai had intended, fiddling with his new, long hair as he did. He didn't really know where his body had run off to, but he typically returned home briefly by the time it got dark just in case his uncle got back. Yu figured he would just swing by his house at that hour and use the device to return to his body then. That meant he had basically the whole afternoon to explore the possibilities before returning to normal. </span></div></div>",

His whole center of gravity was way off as he traversed the store, looking for some sign of his friends wandering the aisles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There they are!\" he murmured to himself, excited as he eventually spied the team - sans himself - at their usual table.Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Kanji, Rise, and even Teddy were all at the table together. He'd usually be at ease to see his friends all together, but suddenly he felt his (Ai's?) muscles tense up at the thought of confronting them.Still, it'd be a waste of time if he came hereand did nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on his best 'Ai Face', Yu grabbed her purse strap tightly and walked forward. \"Hey, you guys,\" he called out, still getting used to the high voice. The team looked confused as 'Ai' suddenly came out of nowhere, plopping down in an empty seat right next to Yosuke. \"You seem to be having quite the gathering, what's going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh, Ebihara?\" Yosuke seemed instantly frazzled by the girl sitting next to him, much to Yu's delight. Yukiko giggled a bit, but Chie just seemed sort of annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, Ai?\" Chie asked, a bit incisively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had nothing to do today,\" Yu replied with a pair of hands up in the air defensively, \"so I went shopping and saw you all. Can I not hang out with my classmates?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie gave a bit of a grimace. \"Be nice, Chie,\" Yukiko interjected. \"She's Narukami's friend, remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any friend of sensei has to be a good person after all!\" Teddy burst in, all of a sudden. He was outside his costume now - Yu could see it discarded a few feet behind him. He flashed a wink at Yu and seemed to sparkle as he continued. \"Especially one who's so beautiful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu gave a nervous grin in response. \"Uh, thank you for the compliment.\" He made a mental note: Teddy was a bit of a weirdo. \"So. what are you all doing gathered here?\" Yu probed, curious to get more of this 'outsider's perspective</span></div></div>",

Because several part time workers chose not to show up today, he was stuck with doing their work! As much as Yosuke wanted to jump into the T.V. world to avoid having to do this work, he knew that if he didn't do it, no one would<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yosuke was carrying a package, he stubbed his tow. While yelling to himself about the pain, he dropped the package and it's contents fell out. Yosuke looked around to make sure that no one saw that embarrassing scene. Once he was sure he was alone, he looked at what had fallen out of the package. It looked like a remote and manual. Yosuke assumed it was some kind of T.V. remote and began to put it back in the package. It wasn't until further inspection that he realized it wasn't a T.V. remote at all. It was labeled as some kind of 'Body Swap Remote'. \"The hell? We don't sell anything like this here.\" Yosuke thought aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke wanted to label it as some sort of prank and toss it out, but at the same time he was extremely curious. He finished putting the remote in it's package and took it to his bedroom. Once there, he began to read the manual. After a quick skim through, Yosuke had a vague understanding of how the remote worked. Of course, he had no way of knowing whether or not it was real yet. He didn't immediately dismiss the idea of 'Body-Switching' as ridiculous, because over the last few months he's been in many, many stranger situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now that he had access to this remote, the question was, who to use it on? Yosuke did know one thing though, he probably shouldn't ask for permission before he used the remote. If he asked any girl to swap with him, he'd probably get slapped in the face. If he asked any of the guys he knew, he'd probably get punched in the face, especially if he asked Kanji!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke figured he had three choices for what to do now. He could A. Call up the rest of the investigation team to the Junes food court and use it on one of them there, B. Wait until school tomorrow and then use it, or C. Swap with some random person on the street and hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he decided to....</span></div></div>",

The safest thing to do for now would be to wait for school tomorrow and wait for a good chance to use it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Yosuke had slept in and had rushed to get ready for school, he made sure to grab the remote from under his bed before he went out the door. Because he had slept in he was behind most of the people walking to school, but this may be beneficial! Now no one would see him and question why he was pointing around some weird remote. As he walked to school, Yosuke noticed two people he recognized walking far in front of him. It was Chie and Yukiko! Perfect, they could be a good first test for the remote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie had always been a bit of a jerk to Yosuke, often hitting him and criticizing him. She still hadn't forgiven him for breaking her Trial of the Dragon DVD. Switching bodies with her could be a fitting bit of payback! Maybe she wouldn't be so critical of him if she knew what it was like to walk a mile in his shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was also a good candidate to switch with. She was easily one of the most popular and beautiful girls in school. If Yosuke swapped with her, he could bask in her popularity for the day. Even if it was the popularity of the opposite gender. Of course, he would have to switch back before school was over. He wouldn't want to be stuck working at her parents inn for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he didn't need to switch with either of them right now. There were plenty of other people that he both did know and didn't know in school that he could switch with. In the end Yosuke decided to....</span></div></div>",

It had been nearly two months since Yu had left Inaba, Naoto had left soon after him, and now Rise was getting ready to leave and restart her idol career. It wan't far! Not only had his sensei let him behind, but two gorgeous babes were also leaving him in the dust. Just the, Teddie had an idea \"I know! I'll become beary famous and be know worldwide! Then Sensei and the others will want to come see me!\" Teddie thought aloud for a moment, but even he knew that it would never happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie continued doing his part-time job as Junes' mascot, but one day he found something strange on the ground. It seemed to be some sort of package. He picked it up and shook it around. Judging by it's size and how light it was, he jumped to the obvious conclusion that it was....\"Candy!\" Teddie yelled aloud and began to tear open the package. He frowned when he saw what was inside, it wasn't candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the package was a remote of some sort and a manual. Teddie tried to read the manual, but he wasn't very good at reading. He instead chose to look at the pictures in the manual to find out what the remote did. He couldn't figure out any specific of how it worked, but it seemed that this remote could swap bodies around. \"Cool!\" Teddie shouted out, getting some looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie began to think about what he could use the remote for, his first thought of course came in the form of using it on his friends. It would be fun to swap all of their bodies around for a little while, plus, if he so happened to end up in the body of one of the girls, he could get real up close and personal with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Teddie didn't limit his swapping thoughts to those he knew. The entire town of Inaba deserved the chance to at least have Teddie in their body for a little while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Teddie thought about what to do with the remote, he was suddenly interupted. \"Damn it Teddie! You already had five breaks today, you have to actually work!\" Yosuke shouted at Teddie. That's when Teddie had a third idea, who could tell Yosuke about the remote too! If Yosuke knew, maybe he could read the manual and teach Teddie exactly how each of the remote's buttons worked. Of course, there was also the chance that Yosuke could ruin Teddie's fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Teddie decided to...</span></div></div>",

With this remote, he can easily skip work and hang out with the fair maidens of Inaba with Yosuke being none the wiser. Immediately - without thinking - he used the possession function in order to get out of being yelled at by Yosuke and then maybe he could have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the world shifted before Teddie as he was suddenly thrown upwards. However, he  quickly realised something felt off as he found himself floating above the ground and felt weightless. In a panic, he flailed around a bit before realising what had happened; the remote had made him into a ghost. He looked down to see what his body was doing during his discovery, hoping that it hadn't fallen down and hurt itself. That would be unbearable. Instead of that, he found it talking to Yosuke, as if nothing had happened, and promising to get back to work. After learning that his body would be fine, Teddie decided to see what kind of fun he could have with the possession function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie rose through the roof to gain a bird's eye view of Inaba in his ghostly form. Awed by the freedom given to him, his eyes darted across the village as he tried to decide on a destination. Eventually, he decided to go everywhere, looking for someone to possess from the people he knew. He soared across the streets of Inaba, yelling in excitement despite being inaudible to others. Eventually, he identified his possible targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie and Yukiko were walking across the Samegawa flood plains. Maybe he'd having some fun as one of them, though he would have to try and fool the other if he chose one of them, which might be a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was in the Tofu shop. Teddie considered how it might be to be in the body of such a beautiful idol. Being an idol, combined with his devilish bear charms, might be the perfect option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie's strangest discovery was that Naoto was in town, which left her as an option. In Teddie's mind, being a detective would be beary cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Teddie spoilt for choice in who to possess but who did he decide on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He evenutally passed by the train station, which<br>\r\nwas seemingly empty. <i>Inaba never seemed like a bear-y popular town</i> Teddie thought. Though, maybe he could catch his breath and figure out where to go here, where no one would spot him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah that would be a good plan. Maybe he could go back to her family inn. Ooh, and maybe he could spend some time in their hot springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Yukiko-chan? You ok, there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGah! That was him right now, Teddie remembered and turned around to identify who was talking to him right now. To his surprise, emerging from the train station, was Yu Narukami - the leader of the Investigation Team. What was he doing here? Ooh, was he on a surprise visit to him and the rest of the Investigation Team?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sens- ah, Yu-kun, what are you doing here?\" Teddie inquired, nearly forgetting how Yukiko addressed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you nearly call me Sensei? Don't tell me that Teddie's convinced you all to call me that...\" Yu sighed as he approached the disguised bear. Teddie grew nervous. Sensei was bear-y clever and might be able to see through him. \"Anyway, I came on a surprise visit to see you guys. I'm on break from school right now so I thought I'd visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's bear-y great, Yu-kun\" Teddie smiled, this time remembering to address Yu properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that a bear pun? I didn't think anyone other than Teddie would've make those jokes. He must have really rubbed off on you guys while I was gone.\" Yu replied. <i>Crap! I should've been more careful. Of course sensei would notice that but he shouldn't suspect that I'm the handsome Teddie just yet. Just gotta keep cool.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's everyone else? I'd love to meet with the investigation team again, like old times. I assume you know where Chie is, Yukiko-chan?\" Yu asked calmly.<br>\r\n<i>Oh no! If I lead Yu to Chie-chan, then he'll see her acting weird and get suspicious. He might even get mad at me and force me to leave this delightful body. I've got to make up an excuse to leave. Oh but he might get more suspicious and see through me if I do that. Maybe I should just lead him to Chie and pretend like I don't know what's happened.</i> Teddie was beginning to panic at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Yukiko-chan? You're acting very nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Argh, I've got think fast! What do I do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Teddie choose to do?</span></div></div>",

Chie would be the best bet due to her close relationship with Yukiko - if he could find her. Yosuke (and probably Teddie) would probably be at Junes right now so he could go and ask them for help.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Adachi sat in his cell, desperately trying to fight off his boredom. He tried to fight off the boredom that had plagued him ever since he came to the worthless town of Inaba. The only respite he ever got from his boredom was when he was graciously given the power to force people inside a TV, with their anguished faces serving as Adachi's only source of joy. Though, it was that power that put him in this situation, imprisoned on several charges such as murder. It only served to magnify his boredom in the long run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former detective sighed as he laid back against the wall of his cell. What he wouldn't give for another chance to spice up his life. Eventually, he'd probably go insane from the boredom. There wasn't a single thing in this prison that he could use to entertain himself. All he could do now was fantasise about good food that he could no longer taste. He had truly hit rock bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there, wallowing in his misery, he noticed a guard approach his cell door before opening a small hatch and hurling a small box through it towards his head. Barely dodging it as it collided with the wall, he looked at the guard suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sent in as a gift for you. Don't get your hopes up, we already checked it and there's nothing useful inside. I don't know what loser would want to give you a gift, though\" The guard remarked, an arrogant smirk plastered on his lips before he quickly left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdachi's gaze then turned to the white box that laid next to him. Holding it up, he couldn't find a trace of any designs or text on it; it was a plain, white box. Satiating his curiosity, he opened the box to reveal a small piece of paper and what looked like a remote control - though it's button layout seemed bizarre and alien. Confused by this gift, he opened the folded piece of paper that accompanied the remote. Reading through it, it seemed to be a set of instructions for the device and outlined the absurd functions it supposedly had: body swapping, shapeshifting and possession. It was simply ludicrous; these things just don't exist in the real world. <i>Some nut-job must've sent me this either as a prank or because they're schizophrenic</i> He thought, shaking his head. However, a small voice in the back of his head was telling him to try it. After all, he had the power to enter TVs - did body swapping seem that outlandish compared to that? His curiosity continued to build and build as he thought about it. If it did work, this could be the opportunity he was waiting for, something to spice up his life again and help escape from his drab cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to begin with a small test. If the note was correct, the possession function would turn him into a ghost that would be invisible to others. A perfect, discrete trial. Holding up the remote to himself, he pressed the possession button and suddenly felt weightless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to see that he was floating above his own body, now a translucent ghost. <i>So it does work</i> Adachi though as he smirked. Looking down at his body, he watched it lay against the cell wall, sighing in boredom without the remote. It seemed that, while he was using the possession function, his body would act on its own, alleviating him of worry. With his test concluded, he flew back into his body as the remote reappeared in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is perfect. Maybe there is a god if I've received this.</i> he though as he began to formulate his escape plan. Obviously, he couldn't escape in his own body and would need to use the remote to take another. Neither shapeshifting or unaware swap would work as he'd still be in the cell, leaving only possession and aware swap as his only two options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he used possession, he could simply leave the jail as a ghost and then freely take any body he wanted and continue his spree from there as his body kept up an act to deceive the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he used aware swap, he could switch with a guard and leave in their body, leaving the guard to rot in jail as him, which would be hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, which function did he choose? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was free again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was free, his next plan of action was to take a body. Thinking on it, there were many options for him to take.

These are limited edition spells that won't be for sale for long, Kupo.\" The Moogle told Roxas and then explained to him what each of the four spells did. The spells seemed to be designed to change the bodies of the caster and whoever else the spells were used on. Roxas couldn't think of what he would use the spells for, but he chose to purchase them anyway, after all, Spells were spells and you never know when one will be useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had the spells equipped, he talk to Saix to begin his mission.

Once on the other side, he found himself on one of the little islands around Neverland. Roxas tried to fly, but it appeared that the pixie dust had run out and he could no longer fly. He looked around, but he was unable to find Tinkerbell. How was he supposed to continue this mission if he was unable to fly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Roxas remembered, he had those spells that he had bought from the Moogle! He looked at his inventory and saw that just like his other spells, it seemed that these all had a limited use rate for the mission. Since he had bought one of each, he could only cast each one once during this mission. They should recharge after the mission though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas considered his options, if he couldn't find Tinkerbell, the he could just become her and fly with her wings, one of the spells he bought was called Morpha, meaning that his body transform into Tinkerbell's until he was done with the mission. He wasn't sure if he could handle fighting the heartless if he was so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of seeing neither Tinkerbell or any Heartless, Roxas decided that he had no other choice and began to cast the Morpha spell on himself. He closed his eyes and thought of Tinkerbell while casting the spell. When he opened his eyes, he felt shorter and lighter. He also felt a breeze around his legs. He opened his eyes and looked downward at himself. The spell had worked and he had been transformed into the tiny fairy Tinkerbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas tried to gasp, but was unable to. In fact, he was unable to speak at all! He remembered that Tinkerbell hadn't talked to him anytime he saw her, but he didn't know that she was completely unable to speak, thankfully he didn't have a partner on this mission, so he shouldn't have to speak at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas tried to summon his Keyblade, thankfully he was able to. His Keyblade had thanfully shrunk to fit his new form. He tried to use his new wings and thankfully they worked and he was able to fly around Neverland. Now that he could explore the islands, it was time to hunt some Emblem Heartless. He flew out in search of them</span></div></div>",

It is done!\" Da Vinci said and handed Ristuka a small box with one button. \"Now, before I give it to you, why did you want me to make this? I like a good challenge and all, but I need to know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuka had an explanation ready, he figured the genius inventor would ask this of him \"Okay, so do remember bacn last summer when Ishtar held that race? Well to get Nero and Artoria to enter she took over my body as a 'vessel'. I didn't know until afterward, and had to deal with the mess she caused by speaking with my mouth.\" Ritsuka explained his past predicaments. \"Ever since then I wondered, wouldn't being able to possess people be cool? So I asked you to do this so I could try it out for myself!\" His explanation was as childlike as Da Vinci expected<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDa Vinci giggled \"Alright, here you go.\" She tossed the tiny box to him. \"Press that button and you'll turn into a being that can possess other's bodies. Once in a body press it again to go back to normal.\" She explained how it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Da Vinci!\" Ritsuka gave an excited smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, now just make sure you don't use it on me. Trust me, I'll know. Ciao!\" Da Vinci said and walked out the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuka immediately pressed the button to test it out. He felt a slight buzz, but nothing seemed different. Did it not work? He tried to sit on his bed to contemplate why, but to his shock he fell through his bed! Thankfully the same didn't apply to the floor. This must be what Da Vinci meant by a form that could possess people<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to see if this worked! Now who to try it on?\" Ritsuka said to no one in particular. He tried to think of who would he a first great canidate for possessing, but nothing came to mind. There was just too many servants at Cheldea, narrowing it down to just one was impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully he didn't need to think about it. He heard footsteps pass by his door and continue down the hallway. He smirked, whoever had just walked by had unknowingly signed themselves up to be his first target<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning through the wall and into the person, Ritsuka suddenly found himself inside the body of......</span></div></div>",

That was a woman's voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down his vision was blocked by a generously sized chest clad in a dark purple dress \"I recognize these clothes, and this voice! No way\" was all he could say. He had just possessed Skadi, a norse goddess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to make his way back to his room just to be sure, he needed to take very slow steps however. Skadi's heels were near impossible for him to walk in. After one particular misstep he made a trail of ice appear in front of him like Skadi would in battle \"Neeeeeeed to learn how that works\" he noted to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering his room he looked in the mirror, it was obvious he was Skadi before being able to see it, but seeing brought a whole new dimension to how strange and amazing this was. He was now a goddess, with both the power and the beauty that came with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing a few poses as Skadi in the mirror, Ritsuka wondered what to do next. He hadn't even considered what he'd do after he posessed a body, he just thought the idea of possession itself was cool<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought went to Ishtar. She had possessed his body before and messed with Artoria Alter and Nero's heads as him. Perhaps she deserved some of her own medicine? Messing with the useless goddess as a more powerful one could be fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of his power as Skadi, why not takw advantage of that? Some of the Valkyries were ay Chaldea now and he had full power to completely boss them around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in his mirror at the woman's image before him, he supposed he didn't have to do anything. No one but him had or will ever have Skadi in a position like this, maybe he should just enjoy her body on private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Ritsuka decided too...</span></div></div>",

Sharla, Melia, and Riki were taking this day to relax and cool their nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shulk and the others took a break from crafting the gems, Reyn noticed something strange on the ground. It was some weird metal device with buttons, and under it was what appeared to be a manual. Reyn was cautious in his approach, for all he knew this could have fallen off one of the mechon when they attacked the colony weeks ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the device he saw 4 buttons labeled 'A', 'U,' 'S', and 'P'. \"What in the blazes in this?\" He asked himself. Just examining the remote would get him no where. He picked up the small manual that was on the ground with it and began reading<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe text seemed to be a set of instructions on the device's functions. The 'A' button performed what it referred to as an 'Aware Swap,' in which two individuals targetted by the remote would exchange bodies. The 'U' button performed a similar function, called an 'Unaware Swap,' in which two people would exchange bodies but other people would be made unaware of the change - treating the affected as they normally would. The other two functions worked differently. The 'S' button stood for shapeshift and allowed the target to take on the form of anyone, provided that the activation was preceeded by targetting the desired form with the button. The 'P' button stood for possession and turned the target into a ghost, invisible to others and able to take over the bodies of other individuals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a load of rubbish\" Reyn said aloud. There was no way this thing could do something like this. However the more he thought about it the less strange it seemed, mechon technology and the stuff he had seen in Alcamoth all seemed impossible to him. Maybe he should just try it out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, on whom? The first thing to come to mind was to use it on some of the people who hadn't been gem crafting right now. Melia and Sharla insisted they be given a day to relax and Riki has joined them, but Reyn was bitter about being left with the work even if he was willing to do it. Becoming one of them and getting to relax himself would be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReyn gave it some more thought and chose to...</span></div></div>",

After a long day of helping the Machina, the High Entia crown princess, Melia Antiqua, was taking a solitary walk across a mechon-free beach beneath the starlit sky - a reminder of her home. With their current looming task of stopping Egil and the news of a Bionis Allied Force, these breaks were becoming all the more necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat upon the white sand, Melia stared out across the endless ocean as she processed her thoughts. Shulk had reunited with his childhood friend, Fiora, and Melia was happy for that. Fiora, herself, was someone who Melia was quickly developing a friendship with - much to her surprise. However, with Shulk and Fiora reunited, Melia also began to feel another emotion. She felt a sadness at this, as if Shulk himself had become lost to her. <br>\r\n<i>Am I jealous of Fiora? No, these feelings shouldn't matter. Shulk and Fiora are happy. I should focus on our impending task of stopping Egil and aiding my brother.</i> Melia thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts came to a halt when Melia noticed something gently bobbing in the ocean waves before her. Approaching it out of curiosity, she found a small white box about the size of two homs hands. She picke it up and opened it, revealing a smaller, rectangular shape within. She removed this object and examined it. Its pure white colouration reminded her of the technology at home but also of the Faced Mechon that Fiora had been piloting prior to their meeting. Upon the device, where four buttons labelled 'A,' 'U,' 'S' and 'P.' <i>What a strange device. Is this some form of forgotten Mechonis technology. Perhaps I should have Shulk analysis. Though, should I bother him with this at such a time?</i> Melia thought, contemplating the situation. It was then that she noticed writing on the inside of the box. Focusing her attention on it, she began to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe text seemed to be a set of instructions on the device's functions. The 'A' button performed what it referred to as an 'Aware Swap,' in which two individuals targetted by the remote would exchange bodies. The 'U' button performed a similar function, called an 'Unaware Swap,' in which two people would exchange bodies but other people would be made unaware of the change - treating the affected as they normally would. The other two functions worked differently. The 'S' button stood for shapeshift and allowed the target to take on the form of anyone, provided that the activation was preceeded by targetting the desired form with the button. The 'P' button stood for possession and turned the target into a ghost, invisible to others and able to take over the bodies of other individuals. The remotes functions seemed outlandish and impossible so Melia almost immediately dismissed it as false. However, the Monado did allow Shulk to see the future and Telethia could read people's minds so was such a phenomena really that impossible. Melia, strangely, felt compelled to believe that the device was the genuine article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next thought was how to use it. With such a device, she would need to think carefully about how she used it before she created too many issues for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could use the remote on Fiora to spend more time with Shulk. <i>Indulging myself this once shouldn't be too severe.</i> She justified to herself. Though she didn't want to admit, she did want to spend time with Shulk more and this remote gave her the perfect opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she could also use the remote to visit Alcamoth briefly. The remote said that her body would act as normal without her with the possession function so no issues would arise from that. There was already a false Melia taking her place in the capital so would one more have such great consequences? She could borrow a citizen's body to visit her brother while she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich option did Melia Antiqua choose?</span></div></div>",

Fiora was stuck in a mechon body, different to her previous Hom body. Perhaps she should divulge the remote to her and use the aware swap function to give Fiora Melia's own body. That way, Fiora could have a body that was closer to her original self - even if the body in question was only half-homs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that would mean divulging the device's existence and Melia wasn't sure if that was the best option. If Fior accidentally told someone else of the remote and it got into their hands, it could lead to chaos. Melia did trust Fiora but they hadn't know each other for long, so she couldn't be too sure. If her feelings of doubt grew too great, she could simply use the possession function to take over Fiora's body while leaving her own to act on auto-pilot.

Is that you? But you look nothing like yourself in the UG.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki frowned, \"Yeah...my body was my entry fee. I was given another body to play the game. Can..we please not talk about it? Why are we ghost and why is our bodies still acting like nothing happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeku said, \"No clue but we seem to have turned into ghost or something.

Can we possess people? If so...maybe I can take over her body and then leave the area. The mission was to clear the Noise in Spain Hill. We move them away from Spain Hill the noise is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki gasped, \"Neku we can't steal other people's bodies! It isn't right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeku said, \"You got any better ideas Shiki? Reaper Creeper isn't working. Im going for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew into the light brown haired girls body and felt himself sink inside it. He felt physical again and looked at his smaller hands. He muttered, \"It actually worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl said, \"Ai I swear I'm not dating Makoto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeku said, \"Prove it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl went to pull some tickets to the slam off from her bag.

Did their bodies eliminate them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled it had worked and unintentionally got too close to Mina and possessed her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki said, \"It worked Neku! The noise seem to be gone. Awesome work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeku smiled, \"Guess the gamble worked. Wait if the mission is complete then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Neku and Shiki felt dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the game master observed this. That pin made them complete the mission in a way they weren't supposed to. Plus that possesion ability could be used as an escape from the UG.
