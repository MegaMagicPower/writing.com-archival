            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She was standing at a mere 4\"3 tall with a lithe body and cute features. Looking only 13 years old, she barely had any hair on her, save for the river of fiery red hair that fell onto her back and ended at the ground. She was flat chested with her breast were starting to bud out enough to be felt in a hug or even groped. Her skin was a light green color, looking slightly tanned. She had deep forest green iris with strides of red in one eye and blue in the other, hardly standing out at first glance. Her ears were pointy like an elf, her features resembling one, and her skin was smooth and soft, the slit between her legs was small and tight, the smell of various flowers coming from it, dew being permanent on her lips. On her hairless pubis was a rather odd scar, a marking in the shape of a rose, this was the only imperfection she had however. Her skin was tight and taunt on her body, making her more sensitive, especially to being tickled. Various patch of small phoenix feathers were seen on her body. There was some on her forearms around her wrist, climbing up like a glove, others were on her legs around her ankles, climbing up like a pair of socks. She had feathers along her spine, ending in a V shape just above her cute ass and another V shaped patch would be on her pubis, if it hadn't been shaved off for the strange and gruesome marking, a thin line of feathers was the only indication as it wrapped around her thin waist like pantie straps. Feathers were climbing on her sides up to her breast, leaving everything exposed and stopping at a comfortable distance from her armpits before sliding onto her back and shoulder plates to rejoin with the ones on her spine.<br>\r\nShe only wears a green sundress with a floral design to it. The dress was looking too big for her, the straps always falling on her shoulders, the dress threatening to fall off her smooth body at any given time and the holes for her arms easily showed her breast and nipples, and her whole body was visible through the neck hole when she would bend over. The dress was cut short on her legs, stopping only at mid thigh, exposing her pussy to the lick of the wind and preventing her from sitting without putting on a show. The dress was also semi transparent, exposing her form in a shadowy manner. Her body's outline was easy to see, from the crack between her cheeks, the way her legs joint to her body, even her navel, breast and belly button was a visible green shadow. Around her neck rested a green collar with a name tag on it, marking her as a slave. Her ankles and wrist had flowers weaved around them as bracelets, easily concealing the cuffs used to tie her and prevent her from moving. She had various flowers in her hair, most arranged into a crown around her head, but many more making her hair a garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lies in a large and comfy bed naked as her dress lays on the ground next to her, folded neatly. She was tied up tightly in an X shape, her legs exposing her young slit to the cool wind coming from the fan at the foot of the bed. Tied up as she was, she was only able to moan and squirm as the cold wind licked pleasurably at the dew on her lips, even slipping inside of her at times. Her nipples were hard from the treatment, her skin taunt and sensitive.<br>\r\nShe was in a well decorated room, possibly a noble lived here. The door to the room opened slowly, revealing a shadow, though flora couldn't see it very well. Was it a male or a female?</span></div></div>",

Everything along the lines of normal sex is acceptable. M/M, F/F, M/F, etc. No scat, vore, expansion, size change, foot fetish or BDSM (BDSM is reserved for tickling only but can lead to sex afterwards.)<br>\r\nNo herms as everyone have different views on them and I'd rather not sort them all. <br>\r\nCharacters can be of any race you want, as long as you give a proper desciption of what the race is. You cannot, however, have freakishly huge assets, normal size dick, breast and other assets. DD is the breast size limit, but unacceptable on a loli type character. <br>\r\nDo not make short post, at least 1 or 2 paragraph are needed, be as descriptive as you like and watch your grammar. <br>\r\nEvery and all entries should be in third person, if you want something in first person, start a new branch at the main choices, but every post afterwards need to be first person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters: <br>\r\nFlora: 13 years old, plant elf and phoenix mix breed.
