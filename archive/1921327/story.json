She shouldn't have gone off to Austrailia, I know the job was great but she needs to be here with us. Phil has been really down about the situation too, we haven't really said much to each other though since she left.' You say to yourself. Thinking over the events that had happened the last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause the game you were playing and head downstairs. You see Phil stood in the kitchen, looking through the cupboards for food. He turned around and saw you and let out a slight smile, 'hey...' Phil said, 'hi' you said back to him, finding it awkward on what to say. 'You want to order takeaway for dinner?' Phil asked, 'Umm...Sure' you respond. 'Alright, you pick from these. I'm going to shower and get changed' Phil said, as he undid the buttons on his white button down shirt. He took it off and put it in the washing machine. You couldn't help but marvel at Phil's physique, neither your mum or Phil knew you were gay or that you liked big guys. You couldn't help but stare at Phil, over the years he had built up his chest and arms to make them pretty huge. You couldn't help but notice that his pants looked a little tighter though. Not by a huge amount, but you noticed this and thought he'll get rid of that easy when he hits the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil walked passed you and up the stairs, you heard the shower turn on in his bathroom. You proceed to go look over the menus, to see what you wanted. It looked like you had a choice of....</span></div></div>",

So you put the other two away and grabbed a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 5 minutes later, Phil came back down wearing a pair of jeans and a white tank top. 'So did you pick?' Phil asked, seeming a bit more cheery than he did before. 'Yeah. How about Chinese?' I said, and handed him the menu. 'Hmmm sounds good! I'll get it ordered. You want the usual, Singapore style vermicelli?' Phil asked, I nodded. 'Alright, I'll let you know when it gets here' Phil said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back upstairs and hear Phil in the distance say 'Hello I'd like to place an order' before you close your door and head back to playing your game. Thank god it was the weekend, so you could relax and not worry about work or school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around 30 minutes, you hear Phil shout your name from the bottom of the stairs. You pause your game again and head back downstairs, Phil is unpacking the bags that the delivery guy handed to him. There were like 5 meals there! 'Whoa that's a lot of food!' you say, 'Yeah...I thought I'd get more for my lunches for tomorrow and Sunday' Phil said. Phil never really eats takeaway, let alone gets multiple meals. He'd already dished up your meal, and put it on a plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls out a meal of fried rice and crispy shredded beef for himself and puts the other containers in the fridge. The two of you sit at the table with the TV on in the living room. There wasn't anything good on, but it helped keep the silence from being deafening. The two of you made small talk about what your days were like, but after being about half way done with yours you got full and you asked to be excused. 'Yeah no problem, I'll put this away for you' Phil said, he was pretty much done with his whole meal. So he would put it away quickly for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed back upstairs and after a few more hours of gaming, you decided to head to bed. Brushed your teeth and jumped into bed, you heard Phil go passed your room and into his at around 11. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pretty hot night though, you found it difficult to sleep. You tossed and turned and the clock kept on ticking, hitting 3 AM. As you rolled over once again, you heard footsteps by your room. You didn't say anything or make any noise, but you wondered why Phil was going passed at 3 AM. Whenever he wants water at night, he just grabs it from his bathroom. You waited a minute and heard him walk down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curiosity got the better of you, and you sneaked out of your room and made gentle footsteps across the landing, up to the top of the stairs. You crouched down and saw Phil in the kitchen. He was still wearing his white tank top but he'd removed his jeans and just wore a pair of grey boxers. You wondered what he was doing there, when suddenly he opened the fridge and grabbed the Chinese from the bag. He set out a plate and opened...</span></div></div>",
