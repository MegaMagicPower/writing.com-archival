You\u2019ve been so skinny in your entire life, and also you\u2019ve always been the smallest in the class, like it doesn\u2019t seem that you could grow much taller anytime soon.  You didn\u2019t liked it so much that you would always get mocked by your small size, and he can easily be the target from these bullies whenever he\u2019s around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated it so much that you\u2019ve always begged your mother to be home-schooled, but she wouldn\u2019t let that happen and you had to accept the fate and get teased and picked on almost every day, like it is his nightmare that haunts you every single night.  What more could it go worse if you feel it\u2019s never gonna your way at all?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell the answer is what it\u2019s about to happen today!  You was in the classroom, about to pack your bag and to be heading back home.  Although incidentally, you had no approached from any bullies that want to pick on you so bad, so you felt you\u2019re gonna be so lucky to finally get away unscathed for the first time of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I know that I\u2019m not there yet, but I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to head home without getting bullied at all.  I\u2019m gonna tell Mom all about when I can get there.\u201d  Even when you looked so surprised that today was gonna be in your favour, and your excitement says it all, after all the trouble you have encountered so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you had to do is take everything with you and head out of the classroom.  But then you suddenly bumped into someone and fallen back down to the floor, trying so hard to apologise for your actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, sorry!  I didn\u2019t meant to bump to y...\u201d  But that\u2019a when you had that sentence stopped dramatically and you had a glare look by standing and see who did you just bumped into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this is even worse!  You\u2019ve just encountered the fattest boy in the world, and he\u2019s certainly the biggest bully of the lot, and this is when your hopes of getting unscathed is all but dashed so dramatically.  The bully\u2019s name is Gavin, and he actually weighs at a massive 500lbs in weight.  He has that bottom heavy look in his body, which makes his ass and thighs much bigger than the rest, with his belly and moobs also noticeably fatter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the worst of the all is that the Gavin the obese bully can still move so much for his age, which in fact, he\u2019s only...</span></div></div>",

You knew that you\u2019ve done for and this is the biggest bully you\u2019ve ever encountered and it\u2019s the one you get picked on the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much so that you can only stare at Gavin, as he can let out with a wide smirk before he spoke out, as much as his skinny look face is retained, just so he likes to have some good looks for anyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, skinny!  What\u2019s the rush all the sudden?\u201d  Gavin wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry that I bumped you over, but I need to head home and get some rest for the weekend, okay?\u201d  You replied as you simply wanted to walk away from school as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the big issue is Gavin\u2019s ass is so wide, he\u2019s simply blocking the door, not allowing you to get out through there.  That\u2019s when he began to step forward and closed the door behind him, before he continued to waddle across until he made you back to the middle of the classroom, like there\u2019s nowhere to run or hide from an obese bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, why would you want to get away from me?  I just wanna see if you still like my fat ass you kept staring at it all the time?\u201d  So much so that Gavin would turn to his right almost fully, and makes a pat on his left butt cheek, which his whole ass is like the size of the entire couch if he takes up the whole length of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried so hard to look away, but with that ass so huge and made it jiggling so much, you couldn\u2019t help but blushed heavily that you do kinda admit by staring at it, even though it\u2019s because he\u2019s never seen the ass so big quite like Gavin\u2019s, and it feels so embarrassed for your 11 year old self, that you tried so hard to think otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... I mean it is so big, Gavin!  But that doesn\u2019t mean I like it.  It\u2019s only that I\u2019ve never you looking so bigger and fatter before, and then teasing for good measure.  I mean, what do you want from me anyway?\u201d  That\u2019s what you always to know, and it would feel like you\u2019ll be excepting the worse when Gavin replied with that smirk look to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about you twig, but I bet you would enjoy looking at my fat ass even more, if I can...</span></div></div>",

Will was venerated as a soccer player champion by most guys in school, including teachers... but he was a ruthless jerk-ass to anyone regarded as sissy or simply weaker than himself. His popularity helped him to do as he pleased and not get in trouble so he was one you tried really hard to avoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look at this little shrimp!\" He grinned but then tried to look nicer. \"You're going too fast. Why such a hurry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe unconsciously you enjoyed his weird smile and so could calm down and find it in you to talk: \"Sorry Will, I was just on my way to music class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Music, hum? You know.. you look like you could be just what I needed. Are you good at biology too? Come on, you must be good at somethi... some difficult human body subjects.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just became nervous again. He was towering over you and looking down at your face like he could just swallow you right there. After an awkward moment, he pushed you \"lightly\" in the stomach as if to check you're alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speak up. You gotta say something when I ask you a question\" He said this and upon realizing you gasped and tried your best not to fall back, he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHA. Oh man, sorry.. Sometimes I forget how strong I am\". He flexed. \"But hey, I need someone to help me study for my test tomorrow. Human anatomy and digestion. You can help me, right?\" He smiled trying to look nice again. \"I can help you in return. I know you like playing flute alone in the garden and the guys like to mess with your music. You know I can end that shit for you.. What do you say? Help me, will ya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just wanted to get out of there. After regaining whatever was left of your composure, you said: \"ok\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Meet me at the library after your music lesson. Don't drop this opportunity.. I wouldn't it if I where you.\" He turned around slowly and you managed to catch a weird smile as he turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left there just watching in relief as he walked down the corridor. The big hunt.. he was all toned and tall and though you wouldn't want to admit.. he was hot. Just as he was leaving, you noticed you were physically uncomfortable. You realized.. when you bumped at his back, you were soaked in his sweat.. and it smelled awful. Will was known for wandering around school, sometimes shirtless, after practice all sweat and spreading his manly imprint on all the noses around. He once forced a friend of yours to knee and take his hairy and sweaty armpit face-full so he would give him back a sandwich. The brut ended up eating it in a single bite and then belching at his poor victim. Your friend just passed as he laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went all the way to the bathroom immersed in his stench. You washed your skin but there was no way for you to clean your clothes.

His huge body could overpower even the strongest jock in gym class, yet for some reason he always picked on the weakest : you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym class always consisted of exhausting physical activities such as running, sit-ups, push-ups and more. The beefy coach began his victimization of you on the first day of gym class, by sitting his giant globes on your back, forcing you to push your own weight off the floor plus his. Of course this ended with you grunting and groaning while coach laughed at your pathetic attempts in front of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the other days of gym class torture were a blur because everytime it got worse. Coach Bruce was a handsome man with a million dollar smile and guns for days, but he was pretty much a handsome skunk at gym class. Whether it was sweat or farts, he would force it up everyone's nose. Your memories of torture got blurry everytime his stench filled your head, but you could remember the past few weeks vaguely featuring your face stuffed into his armpit, and another week flattened between the cleavage of his well massive pecs. Each time your humiliation would be accompanied by vulgar insults such as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to get sat on you pathetic sack of shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought it was a memory, but he was actually standing in front of you. That million dollar smile showing his excitement for yet another round of his personal twisted game. Everyone else was doing random activities involving balls and other sports equipment, while the only sports equipment near you was the giant ass of Coach Bruce which you would soon be forced to try and lift off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his ass meat smothered your face, you tried screaming for help and mercy. Your cries were met with chuckles from the beefy coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might wanna close your mouth, shitsack,\" said the sadistic coach. You didn't over, however, as you were truly in need of help and continued screaming only to recieve a full force feeding of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRTT!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw nothing but darkness, but imagined that million dollar smile on the coach's face as he laughed at your humiliation.

Truth be told you had masochistic tendencies, Coach degrading you and treating you like a seat brought arousel.

Soon rumbling came from above and the cheeks sprayed more raunchy farts as Bruce relaxed on your puny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the coach leaned forward and let loud a silent toot before standing up and looming over you. Bruce then lifted you up with one hand, and you stood up only to reach the bottom on his large pecs. Coach then patted you on the back roughly while laughing as you nearly fell over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach then went to his office and followed him after he shoot you a look.

You questioned yourself as your heart pounded in you chest, overcome with emotion; fear, excitement, worry, lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, that's the spirit, little bug.\" heartily laughed Coach Bruce as he presented the pill to you. \"I wasn't sure that you'd actually want to take it. I mean, I wasn't plannin' on givin' you a choice anyways so this works our nicely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the pill that was dangling in front of your face, frozen in hesitation as doubts filled your head. 'What am I doing?' you questioned yourself, 'What if it doesn't work or, more importantly, what happens if it DOES work? Will it hurt? How will I even return to normal size?' \"Time's ticking, I ain't got all day,\" impatiently stated Coach. \"Ok, fine,\" you blurted as you snatched the pill and swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute it appears as if the pill was a dud. \"Huh, I thought something would of happened by now. Well, my cousin did say it was a prototype so I guess there was a possibility that it wouldn't work. Shame, I was really looking forward to utterly dominating you with my toned gluts,\" said Coach Bruce with a tinge of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I guess it really doesn't work,\" you quietly mumbled. Truth be told you were somewhat relieved that it didn't work, who knows what would've happened if your life was in the hands of your sadistic Coach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt a sharp pain shoot through your body. \"Ahhh, god t-that, ahhh,\" you exclaimed as you began to shrink, not even being able to finish a sentence. The pain didn't last long, however, as the shrinking began to accelerate before coming to an abrupt stop, leaving you at a minuscule two inches (five centimetres).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, now that's what I'm talking about!\" ecstatically exclaimed Coach, struggling to contain his excitement over his new play thing. \"I knew my cousin wouldn't let me down. Now, I got a class of maggots to whip into shape and you're coming with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest, or even get used to your new body, you were snatched up in Coach's powerful grip. \"Now, where to put you? I think it's a bit too early for my ass since odors might be more *ahem* potent at your stature so I think it best to ease you into things since I want to be able to enjoy you for a long time,\" slyly stated Coach while cracking his infamous million dollar smile. You were equally filled with fear and excitement for what he meant by, \"enjoy you for a long time\" but one thing was for sure, your throbbing dick sure wanted to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, I think I've got the perfect place for you,\" said Coach whilst lifting his right arm, \"My pits will probably be a good starting place since I haven't worked up a sweat yet. And, as I'm sure you're well aware of, they can get pretty rank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a terrifying sight from your height as you were powerlessly lunged towards Coach's muscular body, each individual muscle now capable of spelling your doom in an instant with one wrong flex. You were plunged deep into the thickly forested jungle of Coach's arm pit, each hair entangling you like vines or snakes, locking you firmly in place. You were suddenly overcome by panic as you realized the severity of your situation but all of your struggles were futile as even Coach's pit hairs were stronger than you, more worthy than you. Your fate was sealed as Coach brought down his musclebound arm, trapping you in his pit. You were now under his complete control. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You only knew he started to run when the rate at which he moved his arms quickened and, not to mention, a tropical shower started in his pit hair jungle. This had the effect of turning his dry hairs that had been scratching your body into slippery snakes that rapped around you. Lassoing you into their grip, turning you into a sort of puppet as each movement of Bruce's arm caused a hair to pull on you and consequently move whatever appendage it was attached to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help yourself. The shier fact that your Coach was able to manipulate your pathetic body with nothing else but his pit hairs got you hard. Knowing that he thought nothing of the motions that caused you to involuntarily move and that you were powerless to stop it clouded your rational thought as your mind became engulfed with pleasure. As your pleasure continued to build a stray hair had found its was towards your throbbing member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pulse of pleasure shot through your body as the hair rapped itself around your member as if it had a mind of its own. The feeling was like nothing you had ever experienced before as the hair began to service you in the rhythmic pattern of Coach's stride. You never thought that you would be into something like this but here you were having the time of your life as Coach unknowingly puppeted you. His overwhelming power over you tapped into a side of you that you didn't even know existed. You always knew that you were a bit of a masochist but this was farther than what you had ever imagined or desired, or was it? Maybe you wanted it all along but didn't know it before now? Whatever the reason was you were in absolute bliss, it was like Coach's body new you better than you new yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of being crushed in Coach's rank pit, the pit hairs working their magic, the knowledge of his absolute control over your being, the smell, and even the salty taste of his sweat all combined to give you an orgasm of cosmic proportions. With one final tug of the hair that encompassed your member as Coach finished his last lap was the perfect end to your seven minutes in your heaven known as Coach Bruce's armpit. </span></div></div>",

I knew that you liked torment but I admit even I didn't see you having this much fun,\" said Coach Bruce with a sly smile while eyeing you up and down; giving a long whistle as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to react to this as you continued to acclimate to you new environment. It was then that you noticed that class wasn't over yet as your gaze was met with that of every member of your gym class, all locking judgmental eyes with yours. Before you had the chance to address the situation Coach Bruce's powerful voice boomed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fucking disgusting,\" with a sudden shift in tone. You were really at a lost for words now as only time would tell what Coach's true plans were. \"You're a worthless cuck through and through, you know that? I try my best to make your life a living hell each and every day in hopes that one day your spirit will be broken enough so that you can serve your only purpose in life: serving the powerful, such as myself. But no, instead you have to be turned on by it, ruining my hard work. Well, guess what? I'm gonna break you, ass wipe, one way or another and everyone's gonna watch so they can all learn what happens to worthless bugs like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood ran cold as Coach finished his rage-fueled speech. Somewhat unfortunately, this cold blood flowed strait to your phallic member, ready for round two. You decided that it was in your best interest to say something in defense before your enraged mountain of a coach could address it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but wasn't this y-your idea?\" you meekly questioned, \"T-taking the p-pill and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch, that was supposed to strike fear in your heart as you noticed that your life was in the hands of a hulking giant. Instead you fucking get off to it! Well, Imma let you in on a little secret, bug, you're gonna be struck with fear now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had time to respond you were trust at break neck speed into Coach's tight athletic shorts and against his bear ass, discovering unsurprisingly that your giant skunk of a Coach went commando. Your whole body was immediately wedged between the tight fabric of the shorts and Coach's rock hard buns, leaving an outline of your body visible to the outside world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone pay attention now,\" said Coach as he addressed the class, \"Y'all see this? This is the outline of a pathetic little bug who's about to be broken beyond repair. Best learn from his mistakes so you don't end up like him\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Coach Bruce used two of his powerful fingers to reposition you slightly so that you were now right outside of his massive crack. Lucky for you, Coach's cheeks were so hard that they prevented you from entering his crack. However, that was about to change as Coach suddenly gave himself a wedgie. With a mighty push from behind, you were forced forwards to part the Red Sea, which your puny body somehow managed to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were being plunged deeper and deeper into Coach's rancid ass crack by the second, causing you to bare extreme pressure as Coach's cheeks stubbornly fought against your decent. By now you were so firmly wedged that any and all motion was impossible, even breathing was proving to be a challenge (Though it was soon to become much more difficult). All the while the muscular brute could feel your pain and couldn't help but smirk with glee knowing that no matter how hard you struggled, not even your pathetic pleas could reach him as they were thoroughly blocked by his firm ass. Suddenly, you heard something that sounded like twisting iron from your perspective. In reality this was just Coach's stomach gurgling, signalling the start to your main punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to pinch your nose for this one. Oh wait, you can't. That's too bad. Well, enjoy your new air!\" cruelly mocked the herculean beast as he ripped a fart that was like a mighty clap of thunder which resonated throughout the gym. It was even worse from where you were as Coach's cheeks vibrated ferociously, painfully vibrating every atom in your pathetic little body. You gasped from the pain, only to have your nostrils violated by the powerful aroma of a point blank shot from your Coach's ass-canon. His farts were already bad at normal size but now they were down right deadly as only one had been potent enough to singe your nose hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of this, you couldn't help but derive pleasure from your current situation. The same couldn't be said for the rest of your classmates, many of whom were on the brink of vomiting. You couldn't understand it but as Coach ruthlessly continued his barrage you began to grow hard yet again, causing you great pain as your poor penis fought Coach's mighty cheeks for room to extend. This was a battle that it was sure to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Bruce's barrage mercilessly continued at full force with mighty gusts of fetid wind barraging your body every few seconds. Each fart renewed and worsened the burning you felt in you eyes and throat whilst seemingly increasing in volume. To make things worse, Coach's acrid emissions seemingly lingered in your nose, allowing you no relief. Each subsequent blast, despite what might be expected, got louder and more powerful in every way. Even now, you couldn't help but feel horny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like your new air, ass wipe,\" questioned Coach Bruce. \"I can tell you on thing for sure, your classmates sure don't seem to be enjoying it!\" He was right, all of your classmates were either vomiting or had been rendered unconscious as the air in the gym grew hot, humid, and foul. To think that one person was capable of changing the climate of an entire school gym was incredible. To think that you were at the source of the climate change and still alive was even more incredible, especially given your current size. Was it do to your kink for it? Whatever the reason was your luck was about to fully run out as Lady Luck seemingly turned her back on you for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next blast that Coach unleashed was the one that did it. There was nothing particularly remarkable about it compared to all of the other farts that had blown through Coach's ass. It was simply a bit louder, a bit more forceful in its exit, a bit longer, and a bit fouler. But this was enough. This was enough to break you and your kink and with your kink gone, there was nothing left to keep you from succumbing to the aggregate force of your powerful coach's farts. Your kink broke about halfway through a raunchy thirty second bast and the rest of that blast spelled your doom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you broke, suddenly you were able to smell the full force of Coach's farts, causing your whole repertory system to first feel like hell itself was burning within it before it shriveled up like a raisin. Next you heard the sound of the blast at its true volume, causing your eardrums to painfully rupture. You couldn't scream out in pain as your lungs were freshly destroyed. Finally was force of the blast, the vibrations shock you so violently as the waves bounced off of Coach's firm ass and were subsequently absorbed into your soft body that all of your internal organs simultaneously, and painfully, ruptured. As for the acrid gas itself, the force of it rushing past your helpless body had been enough to turn you red as it began to peel of your skin like a bad sunburn. The combination of all of these factors caused you to falter as the blast came to its fateful end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Bruce didn't even notice when it happen, that's how worthless you are and how little you mattered to him. He continued to pepper you body until your whole class had been rendered unconscious. It was then, after a mighty sigh, he pulled back his tight shorts and pulled you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn't help but feel a tinge of pride as he looked you over, knowing the he had been the one responsible for what had happened to you. That he had had so much power over another living being. Knowing that he was a god to you who decided your fate. Knowing that he could easily do that to anyone else. That was what he thrived on, power over others. He'd always had power over most anyone at their normal size but now, now he knew that his cousins pill had been a success, he could easily become anyone's actual god. However, there was still one question: what to do with the residual evidence? This was what he asked himself as he rolled you over in his fingers, lost deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do with you?\" Coach wondered aloud to an deaf audience as everyone who could of heard had long since been rendered unconscious. \"Can't just throw you in the trash since that'll leave evidence and we can't had that now, can we? Burying or burning you would take to much effort, plus a worthless piece of shit such as yourself doesn't even deserve a proper funeral. Flushing you down the toilet like the piece of shit you are would be much more fitting, but a waste nonetheless.\" As Coach wondered an idea flew into his head, one that would kill two birds with one stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, all of that fartin's got me a bit peckish and I think I've just found the perfect snack,\" devilishly said Coach as he licked his lips in anticipation. Without skipping a beat the muscular brute flung you into the air and caught you in his gaping maw like he would with popcorn. He cruelly rolled you around in his mouth like a mint, making sure to extract all the flavor your little body had to offer. \"Your kinda plain, ya know. The only seasoning you've got is from my sweat and gas. Kinda sad that you're so worthless even as a meal that your only flavors are the ones I gave you.\" After a few more moments Coach had had enough of you like an old piece of gum. Only, instead of spitting you out like a piece of gum, he tilted his head back once more and swallowed you, thus sealing your fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposed to what most might expect you weren't fully gone, at least not yet. Horrifyingly, you had been in a sort of comatose state where you were somewhat aware of what was going on but couldn't react to it. As much as you wanted to protest Coach Bruce's actions you couldn't. You couldn't even open your eyes or feel much either. All you felt now was pulsations of Coach's throat muscles as they forced you downwards, quite relaxing actually...at least in your current state. Before long your subtle massage ended with a hard plop as you entered what was soon to be your graveyard, Coach's empty stomach. Within no time you were inundated in digestive fluids as Coach's stomach started to churn you into a formless sludge. Luckily, given your current situation, all you felt was a slight tingle as the digestive fluids started to break you down before nothingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, shit sack, you really didn't hit the spot.\" *belch* \"I guess that's no surprise, you failed at everything in life so I guess it's only fitting that you fail in death. Your not even giving me the pleasure of feeling your futile struggles as my stomach indifferently churns you into your true form, shit. But still, I can't help but feel...turned on,\" said Coach as he glanced around, making sure that everyone was still unconscious, before reaching down to his throbbing cock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the feeling of your body wasting away inside of him was enough to set his power boner over the edge. His glided back and forth over his massive member, one that would have most certainly put yours to shame, making the last sound you heard on the planet the sound of your sadistic god of a coach pleasuring himself to your death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached release he could no longer feel any trace of you in his belly. But that didn't matter the slightest to him, all that mattered was the knowledge that you were long gone. Despite this, he almost felt the slightest tinge of despair. Almost. After all, with you gone who would he use as his daily plaything? But that was no issue, he would simply find another weakling to torment. Though none would be able to truly replace you and your immense lack of worth, at least you had that.  Even so, the thought of whatever minuscule morsel of protein you added to his muscular frame was an arousing thought. And knowing that you were forever erased from the world at his own hands provided the final spark that blew the TNT in Coach's balls, blasting thick, hot ropes of his seed upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach was left in a similar bliss that you were in earlier, an eye for an eye, so to speak. As Coach slowly recovered, he realized that he's got more evidence to clean up. Luckily, he spotted the perfect tool for the job, your old clothes. \"Shit sack won't be having any use for these,\" Coach snickered as he grabbed what had once been one of your favorite shirts and proceeded to soil it with his seed. It was around the time he finished cleaning up that the rest of the class began to awake, just in time for a massive belch from Coach Bruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBUUUUURRRRRPPPPP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god Coach that reeks,\" remarks one of the students, \"Wait a minute what's that?\" they remark whilst pointing at a bright white speck that had emerged from Coach's maw that was slowly rising upwards. What 'that' was was your soul, making its way to the afterlife. Unfortunately, Coach got in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what is that,\" said Coach as he successfully attempted to trap the shimmering speck between his thumb and forefinger. As he began to more closely examined the specimen, he realized what it was and couldn't help but crack a smile. 'Perfect,' he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, I see you were trying to escape your final resting place. Well guess what? You're not gonna. Why? Because I am your god now; your afterlife. I can't even imagine why you would even want to leave all of this,\" Coach said as he gestured to himself whilst flexing his bulging muscles and bouncing his toned pecs. \"I though you liked this. Oh wait, let me guess.\" Coach suddenly approached the speck. \"I finally broke you.\" Even though you couldn't respond Coach new that he was right. \"Hah, new it. Now enjoy your eternity of churning away inside of me.\" Coach then proceeded to damn you for eternity by sucking you up through rounded lips and straight into his gurgling stomach, tasting your sweet essence along the way. The rest of the class just looked on confused, not knowing what had just happened. But Coach new. And he knew you knew. That what really happened wasn't just your eternal damnation but one last hoorah, one final public humiliation right before the bell to your very last gym class rung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The final bell of the day rung out, and Coach Bruce had a deposit to make. It had been in the back of his mind the whole day, where to leave your new form? After much thought and going back and forth between the school toilet and a paper bag, he finally made his decision. 'It's only right,' he thought 'I've left him in gaseous form in the gym and in the lungs of some prospect replacement as a sort of initiation to the role so now it's time to leave him in solid form at home.' Like it or not, you certainly made some rank farts that would forever haunt the day's unlucky victims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach made his way towards where your locker was with a paper lunch bag in hand, your lunch bag. With one final glace around to make sure the coast was clear, Coach pulled down his tight athletic shorts  and squatted down in front of your locker with his ass directly above your lunch bag. It was then that a bombastic fart erupted from Coach's ass, instantly gassing out the entire locker room. The blast ended with a wet squelch, signaling your rebirth into the world. \"Can't wait to see what you look like now, soon to be shit sack, it's probably an improvement,\" Coach taunted whilst flashing his million dollar smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach felt you part his asshole and slowly slither towards the ground, passing through the place that had very nearly been your doom now as a crackling log of compounded churned human. Coach let out a sigh of pure bliss once the first log dropped into the bag with a thud, filling the room with your new permanent scent given courtesy of Coach Bruce. A torrent of former human followed unheeded until what felt like a cork stopped the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing? Oh I know, you don't want to leave me yet, do ya? Well ya don't have a choice.\" And with that Coach balled both of his fist and let out a mighty grunt, causing your skull to shoot out of his ass hole like a bullet. Your head, shoved countless times into his toned cheeks, had just made its final voyage through it. That was all that was left of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wooeee, you sure stink, shit sack. How fitting, your nickname became reality, ha. Welp, all that's left is to wipe the rest of you off of me, wouldn't want you to be incomplete.\" Coach then proceeded to grab, ball up, and wipe himself clean with all the clothes that had been in your locker. All that was left now was to get you home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the car ride to your home Coach decided to strike up a conversation with you now that their was an actual physical representation of you again instead of just your spirit that was busy burning away in his bowels. \"Ya know, boy, I'm not sure that you're gonna be remembered,\" cruelly and bluntly stated Coach, \"I mean you had no friends, nobody to talk to, and just blended into the background most of the time. Hell, the only time you had any sort of spotlight was in my class. Your parents probably wouldn't even notice that you're gone given that you're the runt of the litter and all. It'll probably take them a second to figure it out when they read the bag too. They'll be like, ''Your Son' wait what son?' Yup, your life will go unremembered and your death unmourned. Oh look, we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach brought his diesel pick up to a stop in front of your home, bidding you one last goodbye before he lit you on fire and lobbed you at the front door. Proceeding to floor it, leaving a thick cloud of black exhaust in his wake, Coach sped off into the sunset with your soul still trapped in him. You both new what he said was true, your parents most likely thought the bag of shit was a prank and nothing more of it. Never realizing that one of their sons had been killed, eaten, shat out, and delivered home, never realizing that son had existed along with everybody else. Coach robbed you of changing that, of making a name for yourself, of doing something wit your life regardless of how pathetic it was. Oh well, he was probably doing you a favor, after all what he had said before was true. Your only purpose was to serve others and serving you are, in the afterlife at least, by providing your herculean, bulging pile of muscle, brute that was your coach with the knowledge that you would be suffering deep within his bowels for eternity. He smiled at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

And to think that I had so much more fun planed for you today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked the heavens as coach lifted his meaty ass off of your meek face, allowing you a breath of fresh air. You quickly sat up to see everyone else, including your sadistic coach, filing their way out of the gym and into their designated locker rooms. You were slightly surprised by this as Coach usually gave you a 'special goodbye' after every class. \"Maybe he's waiting until we're in the locker room so that everyone can see him humiliate me,\" you thought to yourself. Irregardless, you had to hurry to the locker room lest you wanted that brute to become enraged at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the locker room things continued to be unusual as you saw Coach quickly making his way away from where your locker is located. At first you thought that he must have done something to it but you soon realized that wasn't the case as everything appeared to be in order. Not wanting to be within reach of your bully of a Coach any longer, you quickly changed your clothes and reached for your body spray. That's when you realized it, your body spray was missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, that sadistic-ass human skunk must have taken it. Uugghhh, that's the only thing that keeps me from smelling like his ass for the whole day! Damn it all,\" you complained to yourself as you realize that you're going to be wearing Eau de Bruce all day long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day your fellow classmates avoided you like the plague, not that you were particularly popular anyways. Coach's farts had the same effect as skunk spray in terms of potency and it's effects on people. You had to endure the humiliation of people holding their noses as you walked passed them in the hall. You were even asked to step into the hallway during one of your classes once your classmates and teacher couldn't endure the stench any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what he wanted, huh?\" you thought whilst sitting in the hallway, \"To publicly humiliate me not only to our gym class but also to the whole school, making me even more of a social outcast in the prcess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*rrrrrriiiiiinnnnnnggggg*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final bell of the day rung, signaling that you could finally go home and wash off all of Coach's potent stench. There was only one last thing you had to attend to, see what the homework was in the class you were just exiled from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, looks like we just have book work. Good thing I already have my book in my backpa- WHERE'S MY BOOK!?\" you exclaimed in horror. \"I know it was right in here, where could it have go-...oh shit,\" you said as shiver ran down your spine as you realized that your bully coach had stolen your book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go get it, I can't afford a missing assignment. My grade's bad enough as it is!\" you told yourself for courage as you made your way back to your sadistic coach's dungeon, the locker room. </span></div></div>",

Yet, the whole time you walked you were worried about coach jumping out of any corner to ambush you early. You finally made it to the locker room doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe he's not in there,' you thought hopefully. \"It is after hours, maybe he's gone home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't have been more wrong. As you entered the room, Coach Bruce was doing push-ups in the middle of a bunch of weights and other workout equipment. His shirt was off and torso glistening. Your heart sank as you saw your book lodged in Coach's gym shorts. Now your work would smell like his ass too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his last rep, Coach Bruce stood up quickly, blasting a quick but massive fart in the process before pulling your book away from his round and smelly glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd be back, pipsqueak,\" Coach said. \"So fucking pathetic. leaving your work here, I guess you suck at all your classes, not just mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you tried to gather the courage to speak to the shirtless, muscular coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...um...I...n-n-need my b-b-boo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...n-n-need it,\" Coach said mockingly. \"So come and take it from me.\" Coach's pecs bounced before he turned around and slowly placed your book near between his gym shorts and his perfect ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery 5 seconds that you didn't attempt to obtain the book, he blasted a fart. You would have to do your assignments with Coach 's stench filling your room if you didn't act fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly ran and tried to get it quickly to avoid another ambush from coach. You quickly pulled your book out of his shorts, suffering a quick waft of his stinky farts before turning to run away. Only then did you notice the two men whose muscles matched Coach's standing on either side of the exit door. They smirked as they looked at your pathetic surprised face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen in place, you are helpless to stop Coach from pinning you to the ground and sitting on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO! NO! NOOOO!' you thought as you felt Coach's massive round butt on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep sound of chuckling men filled the room as your pathetic body was pinned to the floor. You looked up and saw three buff men, and came to the reality that you were at the mercy of all of them. You couldn't see the two other men's asses, but their pecs matched the size of Coach Bruce, if not bigger, so you could only imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he really is pathetic,\" one man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya,\" Coach said. \"He needs to be taught a lesson.\" Coach looked down at you and your heart raced through your chest, probably against his meaty ass. \"So, pipsqueak, meet Coach Ben and Coach Hank. I figured if I can't get through to you in gym, maybe coaches from two other schools can. Maybe their asses can speak a language you'll understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped in fear as all the coaches smirked down at you. </span></div></div>",

You thought that you were going to have a heart attack by how fast your little heart was beating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scared, pipsqueak?\" mocked Coach Bruce, \"I can feel your heart beating against my ass like it's trying to find out if anybody's home.\" It was then that a gurgling sound could be heard from Coach's fart-factory of a gut. \"Hey I think somebody <u>is</u> home,\" said Coach as your heart raced on \"Alright, alright I'm coming!,\" said coach right before his ass answered the 'door' with a deep fart that resonated in your chest, vibrating every fiber of your inferior being. \"Alright, I think it's time to let the other <u>men</u> in the room take over,\" stated Coach with an extra emphases on the word \"men\" in order to further degrade you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time!\" boomed one of the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what you told us he needs a real physical education,\" uttered the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right boys. Now, I've devised a little game for small fry here in order to insure that he gets nothing but the best physical education we can provide,\" menacingly stated Coach with a sadistic smile on his face. He then promptly arose from your chest, allowing you to breath properly once again (not that it helped since the stench of his farts lingered), and addressed the two men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do tell how we're gonna whip this worm into shape,\" asked the first man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here's how it's gonna work. This worthless wimp will have 10 minuted to beat each one of you individually in a game of your choosing. If he, by some miracle, manages to beat both of you then he can reclaim his book and be on his marry way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in shock from what Coach had just said. How would you, YOU, of all people manage to beat these two muscular giants at anything? 'I should just leave, who care's about a single book anyways? I mean, as long as they don't destroy it I'll get it back eventually, right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and by the way, to insure that you play through the game I'll be periodically giving your book a 'penalty.'\" added Coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do y-you mean?\" You uttered meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing major. I'll just fart on your book every time you break the rules and, you know, rip out some pages to wipe off my sweat or to use as toilet paper.\" You felt the color drain from your face as you stood mortified at the words that had just escaped Coach's handsome and rugged mouth. \"Don't worry, I'll just result to that only if you do something stupid like giving up before the time expires or trying to run away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, there goes that plan,\" you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, with that settled I'll be taking this\" said Coach as he pulled back the waist of his shorts back so he could place your book against his bare manly ass. \"And I'll leave Ben and Hank here to introduced themselves.\"  As coach walked to the other side of the locker room to take his seat among a plethora of weights and workout equipment like some sort of gym god, your heart skipped a beat as you felt a hand clasp firmly down onto your much smaller shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right boy here's how it's gonna go down now, I'll be playing you in a one on one game of Sharks and Minos while Coach Hank over there will play you in wrestling mach, got it?\" Coach Ben's powerful voice struck fear into your tiny being so much so that your only response was a weak nod. \"Good, now let's get this thing started!\" Said Coach Ben with a wink of his massive pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you new it you had Coach Ben's muscular figure standing a few yards in front of you as you stood shaking on the starting line. Coach Ben was bit taller than Coach Bruce and more muscular to. Each square inch of his herculean body was covered in powerful muscles that looked like they could crush you in under a second. To top it all off, he had a jungle of pit hair that trapped and magnified the stench of his superior sweat into two rank sponge-like tufts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready boy? The rules of this game are so simple that even a shit for brains like yourself can understand but just in case you are somehow so pathetic to not even know ho the basic-est of basic games work I'll giver you a quick refresher. All your weak ass has to do is get pass me and reach the other side of the court we have marked out simple, right? Now if you step out of bounds then that's a penalty and will result in your precious little book being damaged, am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID AM I CLEAR!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes-sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good little bug, now let's get this thing started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Coach Hank started the timer and your ran as fast as your little legs would go in hoped of somehow evading Coach Ben.</span></div></div>",

If anyone dared to fuck with me I'd just tackle them and pin them down how you're pinned now. You're making me nostalgic boy, for the good ol' days when I would punish anyone of my choosing under my rock-hard buns. Now to really make it like the good ol' days\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPppffffffffftttttttttt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Ben had just unleashed on of the most powerful farts you had weathered in your life.

It's been a while since I last did the ass to pit maneuver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aaaaahhhhhhhhh!!\" you desperately shout, only causing the salty and vile taste of Coach Ben's pit sweet to enter your mouth. This caused you to struggle even harder, kicking violently as you slowly chocked on Coach's rank pit stench. Your kicks only served to harm yourself since kicking any part of Coach's muscular body was like kicking a brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, cute, he's struggling,\" taunted Coach has he was amused by your pointless efforts. \"It can't be that bad, can it?\" Coach said as he gave his other pit a quick whiff \"Daaammmnnn, that reeks,\" he said while coughing. \"Maybe I should put on a bit of deodorant so I don't accidentally kill the kid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help but agree, said Coach Hank, especially since I want a go with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I'll allow it but it'll cost him,\" said Coach Bruce who had just unleashed an ungodly fart on your book to remind you that the clock was ticking. \"Let him out for a sec so I can talk to him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly released from your pit-jungle prison, causing you to suddenly regain the consciousness you had started to lose from inhaling such a toxic stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up, shithead, because I'm feeling generous I'll give you two options. Option one, continue as you were but with Coach Ben wearing deodorant and have your book suffer a certain penalty or option two, let Coach Ben use your face a deodorant for the remainder of the time and suffer no penalty. So, what'll it be, pipsqueak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully considered your options. On one hand if you continued as your book would suffer irreparable damage that'll no doubt cause Coach Bruce's inhuman stench to be permanently engraved in it, forcing you to suffer his stench whenever you had to do school work. Or, you could face a terrible fate for only a few more minutes. The best option was clear, you'll let yourself become human deodorant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-option t-two\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"haha, alright, bitch, option two it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope this doesn't kill you,\" said Coach Ben before shoving your helpless face into his humid jungle of an armpit and began rubbing your around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your eyes and mouth firmly shut as you felt Coach's abrasive hairs brush your face with a thick layer of the foulest smelling sweet imaginable. Despite your best efforts to hold your breath, you inevitably took a breath and when you did you felt your entire body shrivel up and begin to shake as the toxic scent filled your lungs. The smell was so toxic that any small animal or insect unfortunate enough to take your place would suffer certain death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweet mop, open your mouth and use your tongue to lick up my sweet. Just rubbing your face in it isn't doing much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like crying as you silently obeyed. A bit of vomit entered your mouth as your tongue made contact with the hairy and slim surface. You chocked it down best you cold as your tongue was forced to explore every crevasse of Coach Ben's pit as he used his powerful hand to move your face around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it for that one, now for the next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you actually did cry as your head was forcefully transferred from one pit to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking pathetic. Can't even handle a real man's stench, worthless piece of trash\" commented Coach Bruce as he berated your poor book with a 10 second long ass blast, worsening the already revolting odor of the room. \"That was for crying, pussy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt absolutely defeated as you heard Coach Bruce's comments while being forced to lick Coach Ben's pit. You couldn't do anything without receiving some sort of punishment; you couldn't run, you couldn't talk back, you couldn't even cry without having one of the brutes utterly humiliate you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were busy feeling sorry for yourself and chocking back the tears, Coach Ben had finished.<br>\r\n\"Annnddd, there we go\" he said while letting you go, causing you to fall to the ground \"You make a good deodorant, boy. Better than anything I've used in the past!\" His comments fell on deaf ears as your were busy coughing up a hairball made up of Coach Ben's rancid pit hairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ccoooouuuuuggggghhhh* *rrrreeeeeccchhhh* *pppuuuuhhh*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed up a gargantuan pit-hairball onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, you really are a pussy,\" stated Coach Bruce, \"but I'll stay true to my word and won't inflect a penalty upon your book. Now get your hot mess self together and get ready for the second game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh God,' you though to yourself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ho ho, I've been waiting for this,\" eagerly states Coach Hank while a gurgling sound can be heard from his stomach. \"Oof, best prepare yourself for this little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you pulled your broken self together just enough to line your self up with Coach Hank's titanic frame towering in front of you. Coach Ben triumphantly stood to the side to act as the ref for the match though you doubted that he'd actually do anything to prevent you from getting absolutely pummeled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright men *er* man, and pathetic runt.\" of course he had to find anyway to insult you \"I want this to be a clean and fair fight,\" Coach Ben said while winking at Coach Hank as he said \"Clean and fair\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready...WRESTLE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the word \"wrestle\" could finish exiting Coach Ben's chiseled face, you found yourself being struck by what felt to be a speeding truck. Coach Hank, despite his impressive size, was quick on his feet resulting in you being struck by a truly gargantuan net force, propelling yourself backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to come out of the initial daze, you saw Coach Hank's smiling face glaring down on you, instilling you with panic. You naturally began to struggle but to no avail as Coach had you firmly pinned underneath his godly frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey shit head, look straight at me for a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly agreed, fearing what would happen if you didn't. Especially considering the position you were trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, *hyuk ptoo*\" Coach Hank said as he spat right on your exposed face. \"Ha, how'd you like that you worthless piece of shit? haha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggghhh, gross. How the heck is that fair?\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll allow it,\" coolly stated Coach Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but he spat in my face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. I said that I\"ll. Allow. It.\" he said as slowly got in your face with each word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that it was in your best interest to bite your tongue, not wanting to have both muscular giants tormenting you at the same time. You just had to bare through this for a few more minuted after all, how bad could it possibly get? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if fate itself wanted to see you suffer, Coach Hank's stomach suddenly unleashed a monstrous growl. \"You know what boy? My strategy to get students to behave is a bit different from Ben's. You see, he likes to use his pits and stuff as tools for discipline, and while that's all find and good where he coaches, I find cutting right to the good stuff to be much more effective when dealing with the delinquents at the military school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused as to what he meant by \"the good stuff\" and silently hoped that you wouldn't find out anytime soon. Unfortunately, Coach Hank wasn't about to let you get away without having a taste of \"the good stuff\" as he suddenly spun around so his massive ass was hovering over your helpless face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God no, please no...\" you begged as Coach Hank's massive gluts descended upon you while blasting a trumpeting fart that was abruptly muted by your face as it was firmly wedged in between his mountainous globes. I smelt absolutely horrid, if anyone could give Coach Bruce a run for his money it would be him. He unrelentingly proceeded to expel all of his pent up gas at gale force onto your poor face, forcing you to breath in every ounce of his foul emissions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~, that's the good stuff!\" exclaimed Coach Hank \"You see, I find forcing misbehaving students into my pits and such to be somewhat inadequate as a form of punishment. Why taunt them with my true power when I can just go ahead and show them, you know? That's why I prefer just flat out pinning them to the ground and smothering them under all this ass.\" he cockily states while clenching his cheeks and peppering you with another blast. \"It reminds them of their place in the world by scaring them for life, thus preventing further misbehavior and instilling them with respect for their superiors.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Coach Hank was giving his speech about is favorite form of punishment, he continued to destroy your sense of smell with fart after rancid fart. The persistent blasts distorted your sense of reality to the point where you could feel yourself slipping into insanity. However, before the stench of Coach Hank's was able to drive you over the brink into insanity, Coach Ben called time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a rush of relief as Coach Hank lifted his massive, toned gluts off of your tainted face. For a few moments you remained on your back, gasping like a fish out of water for what was, comparatively, fresh air (Even though the collective musk and gas of the three godly coaches had long since ruined it).  As you slowly recovered, a booming voice rang out throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright maggot, you know what happens now,\" boomed Coach Bruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh YOUR PENALTY, DUMBASS, for not winning your match against Hank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh.OH. Please don't I'm begging you, I need that book\" you hopelessly begged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, tough luck, kid,\" coldly stated Coach as he unleashed a bombastic, nuclear bomb of a fart on your book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo, Please! I can't watch,\" you said as your adverted your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess what? You are gonna watch every second of it,\" said Coach Hank as he and Coach Ben quickly restrained you and forced you to look upon the carnage that your book was suffering at the hands of your sadistic coach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast after ghastly blast were forces upon your book, permanently engraving it with the unmistakable stench of Coach Bruce; destroying any chance you had of being able to do your homework without being reminded of him. 'That was his plan all along, wasn't it?' you thought to yourself 'For me to have a permanent reminder of him. A permanent reminder of his power over me, of what he can do to me. But why?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to form in your eyes, partially from the realization, partially from the stench of Coach Bruce's gas which had duly contaminated all of the air in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, he's crying. What a pathetic little baby. Are you gonna go run home and tell mommy? Oh boo hoo,\" taunted the Coaches, further destroying you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey runt, if you're crying now just watch this,\" taunted Coach Bruce as he took in a deep breath in anticipation. Suddenly, he blasted the biggest fart of the night which lasted as long as all of his previous farts put together. It was as if all of the farts he had blasted before had suddenly reentered his body and united in terms of volume, stench, and sound; only to be expelled as one collective mass. The shire force of the blast was enough to create a stiff breeze that could be felt radiating in all directions from under Coach Bruce's toned cheeks. Its sound was so deafening that you could hear your ears ringing and actually saw some dust falling from the ceiling. And the smell, the smell was so bad that it could have easily caused someone who hadn't been acclimated to it to faint. You began to think that it would never end as you began to, once again, lose consciousness. However, right before you did the unruly blast came to and end with a sudden squishy sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"fewww. That. was. what. a. real. man's. capable. of.\" panted out Coach Bruce \"But that might have been a bit too much, even for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that. was. awesome,\" chimed in Coach Hank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man. That was the manliest fart I've seen in a while. You should really work on trying to make even bigger ones, though it might prove fatal to the students,\" said Coach Ben<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you guys are right. You can never have too much of the single manliest thing a real man can do, blast gas like a cannon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their conversation waned on, you began to become fully awake and suddenly snapped to your senses. \"Oh dang, is my book ok?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your book? Oh that's right. I had gotten so into it I had forgotten all about it,\" said Coach Bruce as he stood up to examine the damage. \"It's not to bad on the surface, guess your lucky my farts didn't disintegrate it or something, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even respond as Coach mad his way holding out your book. But, right before he handed it to you he suddenly pulled it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm not totally done with this yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as Coach Bruce suddenly ripped out a page of your book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you done enough?!\" you exclaim only to be answered by your indifferent Coach plunging his hand with the paper into the back of his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That last one got a bit wet towards the end. Gotta clean up somehow, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. That was the last straw. You couldn't react to what had just happened, you couldn't even feel in emotions about it. All of the torment had taken its toll on your psyche; you beyond being destroyed you were just, numb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" asked Coach Bruce as he unceremoniously places the page he ad just used to wipe his ass back in your book and closed it, smearing his mess on more pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, what do I care. You can let him go now, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, both muscular coached released you and allowed you to be on your way. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unceremoniously, you exited the locker room and were hit by an exhilarating blast of fresh air. The air was so clean and crisp, sweet even. It was in stark contrast to the air within the locker room, which wasn't the best in the first place, but at this point qualified as a full blown bio hazard. However, you remained trapped in a daze, seemingly unfazed by the drastic change in air quality that was making its way into your body, cleansing it of the toxins that had just been forced into it. You continued to walk through the empty halls of the school until you had made your way outside and had started to make your way home. The whole way home you kept your head down, still struggling to process what exactly had just happened but nonetheless reverting to our natural state of avoiding the shame of having to look someone in the eyes in your current state. A cool breeze encircled you, caring the ever lingering stench the three muscle-bound coaches had engraved onto your being into your surroundings, causing all creatures, even insects, to treat you like an exclusion zone around a nuclear disaster. People could smell you coming from miles away and therefore avoided you likewise, causing you to become an social outcast not only in school but in everyday public life as well. All the while, you didn't really notice as your brain had seemingly shut off all function that didn't pertain to getting home in futile attempt to keep you from suffering the pain of having to process what had happened but it was only delaying the inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, you made an immediate beeline for the shower where you quickly tossed off your clothes, climbed in, and opened the tap.  The cold water falling from the shower head was another exhilarating blast however, you were not without reaction to this blast as you suddenly collapsed onto the cold, hard shower floor. Your brain had delayed the inevitable long enough and had just opened the flood gates, allowing you to finally process the full scope of the day's events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-why the fuck would they do that!?' you questioned yourself as the cold water ran over your teary face. 'Why me? Out of all the God forsaken people on the planet why me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed until your were able to regain your composure enough to finish showering. As you grabbed the soap and began to scrub you began to notice something, the smell wasn't going away. No matter how hard you scrubbed the smell didn't seem to diminish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on, come on please.' you pathetically begged. 'How is that even possible?! It's like it's fucking part of my skin now!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough, you had used up all the soap and had become red all over from your persistent scrubbing but the stench stubbornly lingered. 'It's probably coming from my dirty clothes, best to get rid of those,' you convinced yourself, not totally wrong as your clothes were beyond any hope of being washed clean again and would probably end up ruining the washing machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll just get rid of these, finish my homework, and go to bed. Then tomorrow, it'll be like nothing ever happened.' you told yourself in order to push through those final urges of breaking down again. And with that, you tossed your clothes into the fireplace and went to your room to start your homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat down and opened your book bag a sudden horrid, yet familiar, scent hit you like a sucker punch. It was the book that Coach had ruined, fulfilling it's duty instilled by Coach to torment your throughout your studies. You weren't about to take it, however, and grabbed a piece of cloth to wrap around your nose. With that, you were able to finished your work (luckily avoiding the pages that Coach had ripped out) and turned in for a good night's sleep. Unfortunately, your sleep wasn't good for long as your improvised mask came off as you slept, allowing Coach's rancid stench to violate your nostrils. The stench wasn't strong enough to wake you but it was nonetheless able to destroy your pleasant dreams and replace them with horrid nightmares of Coach's torment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The Next Day*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in a cold, panicked sweat having just been awoken by an truly horrifying dream. 'God damn it! Why does he have to bother me in my dreams too? Can't I just get a rest!?' you thought as you tucked your head between your knees and began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you came to your senses and jerked your head towards the clock only to see that you were late. \"Oh shit,\" you exclaim as you hurry to collect all of your things and leave your house. Lady Luck was not smiling upon you today as you realized what class you were late for, none other than the human skunk himself. Your mind raced as you arrived at school, 'Oh God, oh God what do I do!? I don't want to deal with anymore torture but I can't afford to be marked truant. He's already tormented me enough, hasn't he?' Before you could finish deliberating you had arrived at the entrance of the very sight where you had been utterly destroyed the day prior. With much hesitation you took a deep breath and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, everyone had already left the locker room and had made their way into the main gym. This allowed you more time to build yourself up in preparation of dealing with Coach Bruce. You were done changing into your gym clothes and began walking towards the main gym sooner than you had hopped, passing the spots of your previous torment on the way with stench still lingering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the main gym, you reached for the handle of the doors with a shaky hand and, with bated breath, pushed it open. Suddenly, everyone had stopped what they were doing and stared at you. You thought about running away but were stopped by a sudden booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, isn't it the shitbag himself. Glad you decided to join us, now come over here for your punishment for being late,\" boldly stated Coach Bruce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Did I hear that right?\" cockily questioned Coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no.\" You had no idea what possessed you to stand up to your bully of a coach but you boldly, and foolishly stood your ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon  ass wipe, don't make this harder than it has to be.\" said Coach with a tinge of anger in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough of you always picking on me. You're always tormenting me, in class, at home, and in my sleep even! Why do you even do it? Is i-OOF\" you were suddenly interrupted by your coach tackling you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to know why I do it, huh?\" angrily stated Coach. \"I'll tell you. It's because it's the divine duty of a superior being, such as myself, to put the inferior scum of the Earth in their place. You see, that's why my buddies and I became gym teachers, so we could identify the lowest of the low before they reached adulthood and start preparing them to serve us stronger, more intelligent, superior rulers of the world. That's why I do what I do. I'm performing a duty to society as a whole by crushing your spirit and getting you used to being subjugated like you were born to do. Crushing your dreams before you try to reach them and inevitably fail due to your inherited inferiority in order to prevent it from damaging the dreams of those who count, us more dominant humans. Your nothing but a parasite to society, nothing but a toy for us to play with. As for why I use the specific methods I use, that's because I don't value your life or your property anymore than a gym rag. That's why I wipe my sweat on you, fart on you and your stuff, and use your stuff to wipe my ass. Hope that got through your inferior skull, shitbag. As for your punishment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How strange were the circumstances surrounding your current situation. The school library claimed that you had failed to return your math book while you remained absolutely adamant that you had proactively returned it before its due date. You would have gladly dealt with the issue with the librarian as it was not uncommon for students to accidentally switch textbooks and turn in each other's textbooks without knowing; you were confident that this is what happened. However, due to some administrative and policy changes your school had gone through in the past year, a lost textbook was automatically treated as a serious offence as it was seen as a disrespect of school property. With this unrelenting zero tolerance policy in place you were unable to plea your case with the librarian and were instead sent straight to the highest disciplinary authority the school had to offer, Mr. Reed. That's how you ended up in your current position, nervously standing outside of his imposing office, waiting for your turn to speak with the brute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flung open with a sudden, swift moment to reveal a trembling boy being ushered along by the firm grasp of one of Mr. Reed's hands as he towered over the lad with a scowl. You remained silent as you saw the boy being lead  along until Mr. Reed broke the silence with a stern order, \"Wait inside. I'll be back soon.\" You obeyed and stepped inside his office, taking a seat in one of the two uncomfortable chairs that faced his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou filled the creeping minutes you had to yourself by looking around his office, observing his various medals, awards, and photos, the vast majority were from his time in the military. Judging from the photos, Mr. Reed was an absolute beast with muscles rivaling those of any bodybuilder. Nowadays, he had gained a bit of weight and lost some muscle mass but was still intimidatingly strong as hell. You could only imagine the intimidation he had been capable of whilst still in his prime, he would have been able to stomp out delinquency with a single glance. The remainder of the awards were for the exceedingly good jobs he had apparently done at other schools, gaining the reputation for being able to straighten out the delinquents at even the worst schools within a matter of weeks. And, he wouldn't just make the schools he worked at average but instead transform them into well-oiled machines that cranked out well-disciplined pupils that were seemingly incapable of making small mistakes, like losing their math book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking about Mr. Reeds seemingly magical abilities to turn around any school he came into contact with, nobody was 100% certain as to what Mr. Reeds tactics were. All that people knew was that he started out by targeting groups, punishing the entire group in private before giving them humiliating public punishments such as making them scrub the walls of the lunchroom clean. After he finished with all of the troublesome groups he would move onto individuals, such as yourself, either giving them private or public punishments. Beyond this, whatever Mr. Reed did behind closed doors remained unknown since, frustratingly, nobody who had experienced the punishment ever spoke of it. Not even teachers knew or if they did they did a great job of keeping it under raps, not that they would care to know. All that administrates and teachers cared about were the results, they couldn't care less about the means. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, fantastical theories emerged, none of which you considered to be credible. Still, you couldn't help but scratch your head in wonderment at some of the things that had happened after Mr. Reed arrived at your school that almost made you believe some of the theories. Foremost was the fact that after he was done with a particularly troublesome group you'd notice that one or two of the groups members were suddenly missing. What made this stranger was that it only happened to groups that were more on the outskirts of the typical high school hierarchy. This made it harder for the general populous to notice the disappearance of those individuals in the first place and once they did they just assumed that the individuals had simply moved away. You would have accepted this if it just happened once or twice but the reality was that people were disappearing from every 'unpopular' group that had history of causing trouble. Stranger still was the fact that after a group lost a member(s) said group would carry on as if that person(s) hadn't existed, even adopting an attitude like that of a stereotypical perfect student.  You pondered as why this could be as you heard heavy footsteps approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed froze for a brief moment as he grasped the handle to his office, slightly leaning towards one side as he relaxed his bowels. A quite hissing sound was audible for a few seconds as Mr. Reed let out a silent but deadly blast, inhaling deeply as he basked in the potent scent of digested meat. To anyone that would have been there to witness this, they would have seen what looked like the vapor from a essential oil diffuser exit the backside of Mr. Reed's jeans and lazily rise upwards with a small, indistinguishable figure barely visible in the mist, only to fade into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He glared at you for a few moments before he finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your current situation of being confronted by the most no nonsense man you would probably ever meet in your life, you decided to respond rather informally as it was the last day of school and this brute was standing in the way between you and your summer vacation. \"'cause 'parently I can't keep track of a simple book 'n' y'all won't lemme talk to the librarian 'bout it, do I have that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed leaned forwards in his chair, placing his in hands the steeple position with his elbows on the desk, \"Oh, is this a joke to you, 873300? Because I'm not laughing. What you've done is a serious disrespect of school property which can and will result in serious disciplinary action being taken. Now, I suggest that you fix that attitude of your's before you make things worse for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's just a book, there's no need to get so worked up about it. If worse comes to worse I'll buy the school a new one, easy. And, um, why'd'you call me by my student ID number? I have a name you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your information, 873300, I am well aware that his whole book situation can be resolved in an instant but that's not the point. The point is that you did not treat school property with adequate respect and care, that's why your here. Furthermore, I am aware that you have a name, just like everyone else on the planet, I chose to call all students by their ID numbers since they are my subordinates and therefore are not worthy of being referred to by their names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't it easier to memorize names than it is to memorize numbers? And what d'ya mean that that's the reason I'm here? That isn't really a reason, idnit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" bluntly stated Mr. Reed, now visibly annoyed. He continued his sentence after a brief pause, \"It becomes easier to memorize numbers over names once you stop seeing them as people, 873300. You see, I view all of you as a bunch of dumb animals in need of training. That's why you're here, to receive training on how to be a good little flea bag that does what it's told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruh, what kinda dummy shit you on?\" you question in a semi-laugh of disbelief, \"How would you even train me? Gonna bust out a clicker and give me a cookie and click the clicker every time I do something right so I associate the clicker with a reward like one of Pavlov's dogs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the straw that broke the camel's back. Mr. Reed had maintained his composure despite your disrespect long enough. He brought his hands down with gusto, slamming down his palms hard on his desk as he pivoted upwards, bringing himself closer to your still smirking face. \"That's it you've just crossed the line, 873300,I'm gonna do to you what I do to the worse of the worse, do you hear me!?\" belted Mr. Reed in a resonating voice that was so deep and booming that it resonated in your chest cavity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I'm so scared,\" you mocked as you kept up your fa\u00e7ade of indifference. In reality, however, you were absolutely shitting yourself. For some strange reason, it hadn't yet clicked in your brain that submitting to Mr. Reed would most likely result in you receiving a lesser punishment, oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed appeared to be rather shocked that you continued to talk back even after his outburst, with a sigh he continued in a passive aggressive manner, \"listen, I don't know what you think you're accomplishing by doing this but all you're doing is making things harder for yourself. You are going to be punished for your actions. You will be trained to not repeat your malignant actions. And no, this won't be anything like Pavlov's dogs  since they were trained to respond to positive reinforcement whilst you be trained purely by negative reinforcement, more effective in my opinion, I'm sure you can see the results of my work. Lastly, do not think that you will be getting out of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? What's there to stop me from walking straight out of that door? You legally can't lay a finger on me,\" you triumphantly professed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I both know that that won't work. You know that any twerp that I decide needs punishing will be punished sooner or later. In your case, it's gonna be sooner since you won't be telling anyone else about what happens in this room,\" Mr. Reed ominously stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what he was saying was true, every single person who tried to ditch when they received a note to come to his office was eventually caught. For crying out loud you distinctly recall seeing him step out and stop traffic to get to a poor soul who had just thought they had mad their escape, he was one of the ones you never saw again. This isn't even to mention the fact that nobody ever spoke of what when on behind his office doors, whatever he did/was going to do to you would be so horrid that you would never speak of it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, flea bag, are you gonna make my job easy or not?\" said Mr. Reed with sudden informality, breaking you out of your trance, \"I've been sent here to correct the problems and you're no exception to this so like it or not you're gonna be straightened out. I have a reputation to uphold after all, been keeping it up since the military you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yup, there's no way you're getting out of this,\" calmly stated Mr. Reed as he slowly arose from his plush office chair, \"You've broken the rules and now need to be punished.\" He proceeded to slowly stroll towards his office's cabinets where he proceeded to pull out a cup. He started to reach for a second but hesitated for a second as he asked, \"Hey, 873300, care for a drink? Trust me, you're gonna need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" you hesitated, confused by his uncharacteristic actions. Whatever the case was you weren't about to ignore his advise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in dismay as you discovered that the drink he was pouring was nothing more than plain water, at least it would hydrate you for any incoming physical punishments. Mr. Reed began to speak as he poured the water from a large bottle, \"Times like this really bring me back to the good ol' days, back when I was a young man just a little older than you, back when I first enlisted in the army,\" he paused as he walked back towards the desk and handed you one of the glasses, \"I quickly proved myself to be a useful asset thanks to my outstanding performance in, well, everything. That's why I was selected to pioneer a new program that would soon turn me into that handsome lad you see up there,\" he said as he gestured towards one of the photos you had been looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...was this like a Captain America kind of experiment?\" you commented as you stared at the photo, \"making super soldiers and stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" replied Mr. Reed after taking a swig from his cup, \"It was more of a happy accident that I ended up that way. The actual purpose of the program was to find new ways of dealing with and disposing of captured spies and other enemies, which we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pretty interesting,\" you said with only partial interest, \"surprised that you're allowed to tell me this. Seems like such an effective method would should be keep secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it will remain secret. Would you like to hear more about it while we finish our drinks?\" replied Mr. Reed in an off-putting tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that it would be better to let Mr. Reed continue his walk down memory lane as it seemed to put him in a good mood. Plus, it would just be awkward silence otherwise. \"Sure, I'm game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! So, after a few months of testing the heads of the program decided that enough data had been collected and rolled out the new method to all branches of the arm forces. By this time, however, the war broke out which meant that we had a flood of new recruits. As a result, my time involved with the program and the new method came to a halt as I was given the role of drill sergeant and sent off to train the new recruits. Or so I though, you see some of the recruits that we were getting were...well....absolutely pathetic. There was no way in hell anyone could make a man out of those wastes of oxygen no matter how hard they tried. That was when I realized that there was a solution to this problem, the new method. I realized that we could set up a system that would identify those who wouldn't amount to anything early on so they could be taken care of so that no energy would be wasted on trying to train them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, you're telling me that you offed them?!\" you exclaimed as you became more interested in the story as it posed more questions than it answered, \"and what the heck is the new method in the first place? How did it make you into an absolute powerhouse? What the heck's even going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your first question, yes we 'offed' them,\" before he could continue answering your questions, you cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HWAT,\" you explained, \"that's all kinds of fucked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it was for the greater good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE GREATER GOOD!? YOU KILLED THEM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but their lives were worthless anyways. We just wrote of their deaths as some heroic last stand in battle or somethin'. That way their families would rest easy thinking that their loved ones died in a triumphant last stand instead of never making it out of basic training,\" coolly responded Mr. Reed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, couldn't believe what you were hearing. Was what he was saying even true? And is it was then why was he telling you this? You remained silent as you pondered, unable to will yourself to keep up your facade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for your second and third questions, they have the same answer. You see, the new method involves shrinking the subject down to around the size of an action figure, this could one of two ways. Either the subject was tortured in order to extract information and then disposed of or the subject was just disposed of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that doesn't answer my third question, though,\" you retorted, still unsure if what he was saying was true. You wanted to believe that he was lying but on the other hand, Mr. Reed was the most no nonsense person on the planet.  There was no way that he would lie about anything, was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting to that before you rudely interrupted me. Anyways, after discussing various methods of disposal from cremation to burial we finally found the most effective way, to dissolve the body in acid. That way there would be no leftover evidence such as ash and bone, the only problem with this was that acid is difficult to handle and store. That's when one of the head scientists came up with a theory: what if the acid used was stomach acid? Sounds crazy, I know, but the crazier thing was that it worked...well sort of. Turns out that only certain types of people's guts can completely break down and destroy another human being, that certain type of people being what that scientists called SM, or superior males, which the army just so happens to have an abundance of. Turns out that, according to his research,  there exists a subset of the male population that is superior to all other humans in size, strength, and intelligence. And, it just so happens that you're looking at one of those males,\" boasted  Mr. Reed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-does that mean...\" you meekly stated, sill in utter disbelief in what your ears had just heard. You weren't even 100% sure that you had even heard any of what Mr. Reed said correctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, I was personally responsible for the disposal of hundreds of spies, enemies, and worthless recruits. That's why I was able to get so strong since, as it turns out, humans are perfect muscle fuel for us SMs,\" proudly stated Mr. Reed as if it were a perfectly natural thing to be proud of. \"Of course the effects only last when there's a steady stream and when you make sure to get plenty of exercise when there is a steady stream, or else you end up like me,\" he let out a small, hearty laugh as he grabbed and shook his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean or else you'll end up like me? That doesn't make since, you would've been getting plenty of exercise whilst in the military. Unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're certainly right about that! But, like all good things, my time in the army soon came to an end and I was honorably discharged. Afterwards, I decided to use the skills I had gained as a drill sergeant for bettering problem schools but, without my secret weapon, I didn't have much success. That was until, by pure chance, I ran into one of the scientist who had worked on the project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a hard time believing that Mr. Reed would ever have any problems dealing with problem teens but, then again, before he told you about the secret program you were being extremely defiant. Anyways, a light bulb just went off in your head, one you wished wouldn't have gone off. \"No...it can't be. You're lying, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, am I? Well, you're about to find out. How was that drink, by the way?\" evilly smirked Mr. Reed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wha-\" before you could finished your sentence you suddenly felt an intense pain and doubled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, since staring my new job I have't had much time to workout. I guess I could go to the gym early before work  like your math teacher does but I think that too much work. Anyways, I'm still strong as hell and that's all that matters,\" Mr. Reed indifferently stated as you were busy writhing in pain. It soon got to the point where you couldn't take it and blacked out.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your vision was momentarily blurred as you slowly began to regain conscious, your head pounding as you fought to remain awake. For a moment you couldn't remember where you were or how you got there as your eyes came to focus on the high ceiling of the room you were in. You tried to sit up but it was proving to be difficult as your hands sank into the surface that you were lying on, not to mention that your whole body still ached. By the time you managed to fully sit up, you realized that something wasn't quite right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-am I hella smol or is er'thing hella big? Prolly jus' a wack dream,\" you wondered aloud as you tried to make sense of your surroundings which seemed to be a gargantuan office. You tried hard to remember the events that led up to you waking up on what appeared to be a giant office chair but, despite your best efforts, you couldn't remember which seemed to confirm your suspicion that this was all just a wild dream. At least it seemed to until you started to inspect your surrounding closer; it all seemed so real...too real. Just then, you heard the thunderous sound of footsteps making their way towards you. You really hoped it was all just a dream then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed sat reclined in his plush office chair, pleased to see you shrink down to the size of an action figure. He sat eagerly counting the minutes until you'd awake as most tended to lose consciousness when they ingested the serum for about the same length of time. He had to resist the urge to take care of you sooner, but he knew that there was no fun in doing it while you were unconscious. His diligent waiting came to an end when he heard your puny voice originating from the chair you had been sitting at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive figure obscured your view, casting you into an imposing shadow which entrapped you in it's impermeable darkness.  Before your eyes had the chance to adjust, you heard a massive booming voice from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, still think I'm lying, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. In front of you stood Mr. Reed...except that this wasn't normal Mr. Reed. The Mr. Reed that stood before you was as tall as skyscraper from your perspective. \"This is a dream, it just has to. That's the only logical explanation to this, unless...unless...oh god.\" Seeing Mr. Reed stand before you was all you needed to remember the exchange you had just had with the brute. The thought of him telling the truth was too much for you, you simply couldn't accept it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I love it when they figure it out, when they figure out that there's no escape from their fate. Now, you're about to see just how real this is,\" uttered Mr. Reed as his massive hand descended towards you, restraining you in his powerful grasp. You were trapped and there was absolutely nothing that you could do about it. This, however didn't stop you from struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha! Let me go! Y-you can't do this!\" you exclaimed in desperation as Mr. Reed slowly and steadily brought you up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can, and I will. And guess what, little toy, there's nothing you can do to stop me so beg and scream all you want. It brings me pleasure anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a burst of loud static came from Mr. Reed's walkie-talkie followed by a distorted voice, \"Main office to Reed, main office to Reed. Come in Reed.\" Mr. Reed instinctively reached for the device and pressed the button on the side in order to reply. As soon as he did you began to yell at the top of your lungs, \"Help! He's shrunken me and is going to fucking kill me! Fuckin' send send for the love of god, I don't want to die.\" Instead of hearing another voice answer your pleas you were only greeted by silence. It was then that you realized that Mr. Reed had only pressed down the button for half a second, none of your pleas were heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try but we can't have you spoiling all the fun, now lets shut you up for a bit,\" as soon as Mr. Reed finished his sentence he lifted up his opposite arm and began swiftly moving you towards his armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what're you doing? What're you doing?! Fucking STOP! No, no, no, no, Mph!!\" you screamed whilst beings shoved into Mr. Reed's armpit. This wouldn't be so bad since he always wore sleeved dress shirts however, you came to find that the fabric surrounding Mr. Reed's pits were soaked in sweat. Just when you though things couldn't get any worse Mr. Reed slammed down his arm, firmly pinning you against the sweat soaked fabric as he finished his call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried your best to struggle but found it impossible not only due to the pressure but also do to the stickiness of the fabric, entrapping you the rank, sour-smelling aroma of Mr. Reed's pit sweat. You remained trapped for what felt like centuries as Mr. Reed finished talking to whomever was on the other end. Just when you began to feel like you would die from the humidity within the armpit, you were suddenly blasted by a wave of fresh air and rescued by a familiar hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, listen up, 873300. School's about to get out and they need me to patrol the campus to insure that nobody decides to pull any end of year pranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean I;m free to go since you can't do anything to me once school's out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no, you're not in the school's hands anymore. You're in mine, and I don't let the little things like jurisdiction get in my way of serving up some fair punishment. Now, what's gonna happen is that you're gonna be joining me on my patrol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? What'd'you mean? How'm I s'posed to do that?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see, now let's get going, the bell's going to ring any minute now.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With that said, Mr. Reed tightened his grip on you before he spoke, \"Now, don't try any funny business on our way there, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny business you say, hmm, like me screaming for help, causing you to be caught red-handed and me to be set free? WhY WoUlD i EvEr Do ThAt?\" you taunted in a sarcastic tone, \"And, how're you gonna 'splain away you holding an action figure sized me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't plan of getting caught, that's how I explain this whole situation away. You forget yourself, 873300, you forget that I can easily crush you like an empty soda can. Now, that won't happen unless you decide to open that little mouth of yours while we're around other people,\" confidently stated Mr. Reed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I see. Still, how're you gonna carry me around without people taking notice? I don't see you getting around that one, chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this,\" bluntly stated Mr. Reed before shoving you into one of his pant's pockets, making sure to keep a firm grip on you as he began to exit his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" you responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite still having Mr. Reed's firm hand encasing you within it's iron grip, you were still able to feel the rhythmic movements made by his powerful quads as he walked onward towards your destination. Your whole body was being forcefully compressed with the motion as the fabric of his pants tightened and loosened with each one of his strides. To make things worse the heat from within the pocket caused Mr. Reed's hand to start sweating, causing you to become coated in a thick layer of disgusting hand sweat. At first you tried to use this to your advantage as you thought it would serve as a natural lubricant that would aid your escape, screw whatever he said about crushing you. You couldn't be more wrong. In reality, Mr. Reed's sweat further entrapped you as its consistency was extraordinarily slimy and sticky, serving as a binding agent that further adhered you to Mr. Reed's gargantuan hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the walk drew on, you began to smell a pungent, musky smell that slowly permeated its way into your nostrils. It seemed oddly familiar, as if you'd smelled a lighter version a couple times before, typically in certain places in the locker room or when you stripped off all your clothes before a shower. But why would you be smelling a much stronger version of that smell now? It took you a minute before it finally clicked, that smell was none other than Mr. Reed's crotch musk. It was so strong that it managed to find its way to where you were in his front pants pocket. You groaned in disgust as the thick musty odor of a real man's nether regions violated your nostrils, magnified by the hot and humid conditions within the pocket. You felt like you were on the brink of vomiting when you were suddenly yanked upwards as Mr. Reed sat down in one swift motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, 873300, where you'll be getting your last glimpses at the outside world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes slowly came into focus as you recovered from the wave of nausea which had just hit you like a truck do to a combination of the smell and the sudden roller coaster- like movements you had just experienced. \"Hwa, hwhat d'you mean,\" you stumbled out between gasps as you began to look upon your surroundings. You where inside one of the many electric carts which your school used to patrol the campus as well as to transport supplies between buildings. Beyond that your campus' quad slowly came into focus, soon to be filled with swarms of highschoolers, eager to start their summer break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments you were finally recovered enough to give a proper response, \"Dude, ya needs to fix y'allz swap crotch. That shit's so rank I don't even have words to describe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that's what happens when you have so much packed into such a confined space, starts to get pretty swampy from the heat. Sorry that you aren't capable of handling such manly aromas, 873300 but fret not, I wouldn't dream of putting you anywhere closer to there than you've already been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, how merciful of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be getting the wrong idea now, it's not for your sake that I'm not gonna grind you into my crotch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried that I'll report ya for sexual misconduct if you do?\" you jousted, \"'cuz it doesn't seem like you've given a shit 'bout anything else you've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're correct, I don't care about anything I've done or plan to do to you. The reason I won't bring you any closer to my nether regions is because I would never grant such a worthless piece of shit the honor of touching what a superior man holds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruh, why ya gotta be like that tho, I ain't worthless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I do believe that you are mistaken, 873300, you're worthless in every sense of the word,\" before he could finish his statement the final bell gave out it's fateful ring as hordes of students poured out out of the buildings. \"Looks like it's go time, 873300, now time to hide you in plain sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're ya gonna do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By putting you where a worthless piece of shit belongs.\" Before you could respond Mr. Reed leaned towards one side whilst plummeting you downwards towards the seat of the cart, to where one of his plump ass cheeks had just been sitting. In a blink of an eye he let go of you whilst slamming down his elevated cheek, trapping you underneath his entire weight. Despite this, he insured that your head was still sticking out, allowing you a view of whatever he drove past. \"There we go, now you won't be going anywhere while still being able to see many of your classmates enjoying their freedom, the very same freedom that you'll never get to experience again. Best of all, nobody will even notice you're there and if they do they'll probably think that you're an action figure I accidentally sat on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried your best to reply to what Mr. Reed had just said but found it impossible as you could barely get enough air to remain conscious into your compressed lungs let alone enough to speak. You felt as if every single bone in your body was about to snap underneath the his gargantuan weight, they probably would have been if it weren't for the cart's cushioned seat and the blubberiness of his ass. There was no escaping this, you simply had to wait for Mr. Reed to finish yelling at misbehaving students as he drove past them. You're only objective at the moment was to survive the whole ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of riding around, whilst Mr. Reed was stopped to scold a random student, you spotted something out of the corner of your eye. This something wasn't just a something but a someone, and not just a someone but a group of someones. It was your friends, the only people who were close enough and willing enough to help and all you had to do was get their attention. Without wasting a second you  began to call out to them, \"h-hey~ Help...me....please.\" Try as you might you weren't able to produce more than just a barely audible whisper. Soon enough, they started to walk away. \"No...please...don't....go....come....back,\" you desperately pleaded as tears began to stream down your face, your only pass to freedom gone. Mr. Reed certainly took note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to get your friends to help I see. Don't bother, even if they could hear your pathetic pleas they wouldn't come to your aid. You know why, 873300?\" You knew full well that Mr. Reeds was fully aware that you were incapable of answering and was only asking questions to spite you. \"Well I'll tell you, it's because they don't see you as their equal. They see you as that one annoying kid who's only in the group because they were once close friends to one of the group's members and is only allowed to stay because he provides amusement from time to time and because they can't be bothered to get rid of you. In other words, they're only your friends because they pity you, because they know that without them you'd be all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately wanted to refute what he was saying but, alas, you were unable to. \"You might not want to admit it but that's the cold hard truth and you know it. I've seen they way you act around them and the way the act around you. They try to ignore you and to push you away but you desperately cling on, trying to things they'll like such as talking like a hoodlum the same way you've been talking to me. You're nothing but a worthless piece of shit desperately trying to fit in but hopelessly failing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you weren't balling your eyes out already you certainly were now as you continued to take his ruthless barrage as he began to drive back towards the office. \"That's not the only reason you're worthless, 873300, there's plenty more but I'll only give you the major ones. You're useless at math, the most important subject, you're weak, you're socially awkward, you can't play any sports, and you barely make an impact in anyone's life, hell I'm sure it won't be for a couple of weeks until somebody questions your disappearance. You deserve to be under my ass, 873300, that's the only place where a runt like you deserves to be other than dead. The only thing you're actually decent at is English, one of the most useless things to excel at. I mean, what would you have done later on in life, become an English major and later go on to be a starving author? Come on. You know very well that the only things worth pursuing in life are STEM related, all things which you just happen to be useless at.  You literally would have amounted to nothing, 873300.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed's barrage ended as you pulled up to the school's office. You heard a loud rumbling coming from above as he put the cart in park and removed the keys. \"Damn, I was hoping to save this for later but now's a good a time as ever. Here's a little preview of what you're whole worlds gonna be pretty soon, 873300.\" With that Mr. Reed leaned over to one side and released a massive, deep, brassy, hurricane-like fart onto your shrunken body. \"Ah~ that hit the spot,\" said Mr. Reed while inhaling deeply, \"that's a smell I've grown to absolutely love over the years. The smell of what a superior male can do.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Mr. Reed had finished relishing in what his superior body was capable of producing he promptly exited the cart before grabbing you in his fierce grip, slowly carrying you towards the imposing building.  You were completely stunned from the intensity of the blast, so much so that you were incapable of continuing your remarks or even of protesting. You lay perfectly still within Mr. Reed's grip, your brain seemingly stuck on a loading screen which only reached 100% once Mr. Reed broke the ominous silence which had fallen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, 873300, the place where you'll spend the last fleeting moments left of your worthless life,\" said Mr. Reed as he reached for the doorknob of a room you had never entered before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a second to realize that the room you were about to be carried off into was the detention room. You had only ever passed the room from the outside, never paying much attention as you had never gotten into enough trouble to warrant a trip. But now you were about to enter the infamous room for what was seemingly the first and last time. With a faithful push the door to the room flung open, and Mr. Reed stepped beyond the curtain of darkness which divided the dark room from the brightly lit hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds all you could see was a sea of darkness, stretching everforth into oblivion, ready to swallow you up. Suddenly, all of the room\u2019s harsh fluorescent lights simultaneously ignited, burning your eyes in the process. As your eyes slowly adjusted you came to find that the room you were in was no different than your average classroom save a few notable exceptions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRows of desks were neatly arranged in an orderly manner, all set facing the room\u2019s only whiteboard which had the words, \u201cDetention, no talking, no phones, no food, no drink,\u201d written on it in bold black ink. Directly in front of the white board sat a solitary desk set facing the rest of the room, the supervisor\u2019s desk you presumed. Besides this the room was rather barren when compared to your average classroom. No posters or work adorned the walls, no pens or paper where visible, no books to speak of, and not a single window to give occupants a glimpse of the outside world or to let in a breeze of fresh air. You even took note of the intense silence which permeated the room, not even the idle sound of the air conditioning could be heard as the room had a notable lack of vents, allowing for any sound made to be heard. This had an adverse effect of giving the room a rather stuffy atmosphere which seemed to slowly asphyxiate any inhabitants. The overall atmosphere of the room seemed to be akin to that of a sensory deprivation chamber or the solitary confinement of a prison. Something told you that this was intentional. You felt that any poor soul who was forced to spend hours upon hours would eventually, inevitably lose at least a small part of their sanity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden lurch forwards, you were snapped out of your trance as Mr. Reed carried you towards the front row of desks before setting you down on the desk which was directly across from the supervisor\u2019s. He proceeded to sit down at the supervisor\u2019s desk, without saying a word, and stared at you for what felt like an eternity before he finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think, 873300? I designed the layout of this room myself, it\u2019s perfect, isn't it? I would have changed a few more things but this was the most I was able to get away with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very\u2026ummm\u2026plain if I\u2019m being honest. I mean, what the heck are people supposed to do when they\u2019re in here?\u201d you responded with a growing tinge of hesitancy, your speech slowly becoming less informal as a result of you gradually not being able to keep up the fa\u00e7ad of calmness you had been projecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuffer, that\u2019s what. They\u2019re supposed to sit in absolute silence and reflect on what they\u2019ve done to end up in there until they\u2019ve learned their lesson. If everything goes according to plan then they will have suffered so much from a lack of any sort of stimulation that they\u2019ll never want to break any rules ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK then, I\u2019m not sure that there are other ways to deal with misbehaving students that are more humane but, whatever gets the job done I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are other ways but what\u2019s the point if you don\u2019t get to see them suffer. There\u2019s no fun in that! That\u2019s the whole point of this desk is facing the rest of the room,\u201d says Mr. Reed while gesturing towards his desk, \u201cit\u2019s so I can watch as, one by one, their spirits break as the hours tick by. As their futile struggles to keep themselves entertained inevitably fail as they succumb to the extreme boredom of not even being able to do menial schoolwork. I\u2019d have to say that it\u2019s my third favorite thing to do in this room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help yourself as your curiosity got the better of you, \u201cI know I\u2019m going to regret this, but what\u2019s your second favorite and favorite thing to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked, 873300, my second favorite thing to do is this,\u201d Mr. Reed\u2019s was ominously followed by silence as if he had spontaneously forgotten what he was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you questioned moments before discovering what Mr. Reed was referring to, \u201cOh my God! It smells like something fucking died,\u201d you exclaimed as you tightly held your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, it\u2019s always fun to see everyone\u2019s reactions as they get a whiff of one of my silent but deadly blasts. What makes it even better is watching them try to contain their cries as any sort of outburst would result in additional punishment. Plus, to top it off, since there\u2019s no ventilation in this room the odors from my emissions linger and worsen over time until I open the door at the end of the detention period. Until then, everyone\u2019s forced to breathe in air which is gradually composed more and more of my toxic emissions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-why tho??\u201d you questioned whilst still choking on the horrid stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo reasons: One, it\u2019s fun to watch the suffering of others, especially if I was the one to cause it. Two, it\u2019s the natural result of my favorite thing to do in this room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDestroying worthless wastes of oxygen,\u201d said Mr. Reed with a sinister smirk as you stared at him in wide-eyed disbelief, \u201cyup, this is where all of this school\u2019s undesirables meet their end. In fact, that young lad you saw with me earlier meet his doom right here,\u201d he said while quickly scooping you up to take you to another row where he then pointed to a spot on the ground, \u201cThat\u2019s where he fell after shrinking. Since I didn\u2019t want to keep you waiting, I decided to skip the fanfare and just swallow him like a pill before he woke up. He did end up waking up when he reached my gut though. Ha ha, he struggled quite a bit when I burped up the remainder of his air before I made my way back to my office. Of course that struggle was rather short lived as he croaked before I reached my office, I hope you do better than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHWAT! You can\u2019t possibly be serious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly mean that you still don\u2019t believe me, 873300?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter what I\u2019ve seen, what I\u2019ve experienced, I guess I do partially believe you but still...why? I know you\u2019ve given your reasons but I still can\u2019t accept them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be frank, I don\u2019t give a damn if you accept my reasons or not. All that matters is that I\u2019m doing the world a favor by ridding it of another worthless waste of oxygen. You seem like a somewhat observant fellow, 873300, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve noticed people disappearing around campus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve come to realize what has happened to all of them.\u201d You slowly knod in confirmation. \u201cNow, do you wonder why I chose to eliminate those individuals in particular when I\u2019ve left worse trouble makers with nothing worse than a slap on the wrist?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess...you\u2019re gonna tell me anyways, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect, the reason behind this is that the ones I let go actually have value while the ones I eliminate don\u2019t. Sure, they might not be the smartest but they sure are the manliest. They assert their dominance by degrading the weak and by partaking in athletics, not to mention that they\u2019re also extremely popular. Those are men that are going places, taking what they want and asserting themselves above others. As for the ones I eliminate, they\u2019re the exact opposite. In fact, they\u2019re often the individuals that are tormented by the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s messed up in all kinds of ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, at least I put them out of their misery, not that they deserve that. Anyways, it\u2019s about time for you to receive your punishment,\u201d with that Mr. Reed took you in his grasp and walked you to the supervisor\u2019s desk where he set you down before taking a seat. From this point of view Mr. Reed seemed to be like some sort of god, towering over you like a mountain. You simply looked up in silence. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this trial started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrial?\u201d you questioned. \u201cLike I\u2019m going to be judged and sentenced? So there\u2019s a chance that I can walk free?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m the judge, jury, and executioner so if you want to convince yourself that there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get out of this then be my guest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, I call this court to session.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hecks even the point of doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch your tongue, 873300,  or you might just be handed a harsher sentence. As for why I go through the formality of having a trial for the accused, it started as necessary formality needed for legal reasons back in my military days. Its stuck around until now simply because I enjoy the thrill one gets when they sentence another being to die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust...Just get the damn thing over with,\u201d you said, not wanting to comment on his sadicity of his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, Mr. Reed proceeded to read out your charges in an authoritative manner, \u201c873300, you stand accused of the high crimes of the disrespect and mishandling of school property, disrespecting school faculty, and being an absolute failure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what?! How the heck is that a crime and, more importantly, how do you even judge that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSILENCE, I shall not be interrupted!\u201d burst Mr. Reed as you quickly back off to let him continue, \u201cAs I was saying, you have failed at athletics, social life, and your most important subjects. This translates to you being an overall failure in life and people who fail in life don\u2019t deserve to be alive at all. So, how do you plead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot guilty, bitch,\u201d you weren\u2019t sure as to why you continued to be so brash with Mr. Reed. Maybe it was due to the fact that a miniscule part of you still clung onto the belief that Mr. Reed was lying. Or maybe it was due to, if he wasn\u2019t lying, there was nothing you could say or do to make things any worse for yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cTough luck, the jury finds you guilty of all crimes and sentences you to death,\u201d chirps Mr. Reed with a sinister smile sprawled across his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBruh, I ain\u2019t even get to defend myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing you could have said or done would have changed the outcome,\u201d bluntly stated Mr. Reed as he quickly scooped you up in his right hand, \u201cNow's time for the fun stuff, for me at least. haha\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly dawned on you, that minuscule shred of hope that you so desperately had clung onto had broken. Your short, teenage life was about to tragically be cut short. You began to struggle and squirm like a fish out of water struggling for its life. Unfortunately for you, you would soon end up just like a fish out of water, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStruggle all you want but it isn\u2019t going to help you out in the slightest. In fact, all you\u2019re going to end up doing is getting me excited,\u201d said Mr. Reed as he felt his pants start to tent, \u201cgod I love it when they struggle\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLET ME GO, YOU CAN\u2019T DO THIS TO ME!!! I\u2019ll do anything else you want me to do, just please,\u201d you desperately plead as you begin to sob, \u201cp-please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I can and I will, just watch me. There\u2019s nothing you can do to stop what\u2019s about to happen to you, 873300, just be glad that I\u2019ve saved you from living out the rest of your miserable life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed, in one swift motion, greedily shoved you head first into his gaping maw. You desperately tried to protest but your pleas were drowned out by you receiving a face full of tongue. Mr. Reed carefully licked your whole body, making sure to cover every square inch of you in a thick layer of his saliva. A quiet moan escaped past you as he savored your flavors and, more importantly, savored the feeling of putting another pipsqueak where he belongs. He couldn\u2019t help himself, his twisted ideas of purifying mankind by ridding it of inferior beings got him harder than anything else could, he unzipped his pants and got to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all of your flavor was gone, he reached up with one hand while the other remained dutifully at work in order to get the your execution started. With one small thrust your head was forcefully shoved into the back of his throat, causing his powerful throat muscles to lock you in. From then on out the rest of the process was hands free as his throat muscles, conditioned from years of practice, easily sucked you down towards your doom. This was despite your continued struggles as you clawed at the insides of the demonic slip \u2018n\u2019 slide that you were being forced to ride. Soon enough, your head was being forced against the closed entrance to Mr. Reed\u2019s hungry stomach. As Mr. Reed\u2019s throat muscles continued to force the rest of you down, your head popped through the opening, soon joined by the remainder of your slimy body. Naturally, you began to claw at the walls of the stomach along as the entryway that had just closed behind you.  Your efforts were fruitless. You began to scream out of desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! For the love of all that\u2019s good in the world LET ME OUT! I Promise I\u2019ll change, I\u2019ll turn my whole life around. Please, I don\u2019t want to die. I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your pleas were being drowned by the rhythmic sound of Mr. Reed pleasuring himself to your demise. In fact, the only thing that your fruitless struggles were accomplishing were providing your tormentor with more stimulation. \u201cThat\u2019s right, bitch, keep on struggling. The only thing you\u2019re accomplishing is encouraging my stomach to churn you,\u201d cooed Mr. Reed between moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t wrong since, as soon as he finished saying that, acid began to flood his stomach. This drove you into an even wilder panic as you felt an intense burning all over your body, this isn\u2019t even to mention the foul odor. The burning was by far the worst pain you had experienced in your life, it felt thousands of times worse than what you thought a bullet ant bite would be. This was worsened by the fact that his powerful stomach wall had begun to process of churning you into sludge. As if things couldn\u2019t get any worse, you were suddenly vacuumed sealed as Mr. Reed burped up all of your air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single foul, explosive belch Mr. Reed robbed you of the last thing keeping you alive. You would soon black out from a lack of oxygen but not before squirming and struggling like you never had before. This was exactly what he wanted, what he needed to push him over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, that\u2019s right...squirm like the worm you are...get churned into the shit you deserve to be...ugh...ugh...AHUGH!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Reed as he blew his load all over the very desk you had been tried at.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWoo, that was the best one in a while,\u201d said Mr. Reed as he admired his work for a quick minute, \u201cNow, before you croak, there\u2019s a couple of things I want to make sure you hear. For starters, I hear from one of your teachers that you\u2019re quite the environmentalist snowflake who cares deeply about reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Now, I hate to break this to you, but the way a Superior Male\u2019s digestive system works causes us to produce extreme amounts of methane gas from the foods we eat, especially from meat. And, for whatever reason, former person causes us to produce the most methane out of any other type of food, just one of the many interesting things I found out while the project was still in its experimental phase. Anyways, the point is that I\u2019m going to churn you mostly into something you hate and there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop me. How does it feel knowing that the vast majority of your being is going to contribute to the destruction of the planet? To something you had so admirably been against? But I don\u2019t just have bad news for you, there is a silver lining after all! The rest of your body, the parts what won\u2019t become shit anyways, will be absorbed by my body as I ride home in my classic muscle car. Think about it 873300, part of you is going on to become part of something greater, something greater than you could ever be. You could go on to become a drop of my sweat or to contribute to replenishing the seed I just lost, the possibilities are almost endless!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point you were mere seconds from losing consciousness, using your last ounce strength you mouthed the words, \u201cfuck you.\u201d That would go on to be the last thing you would do in the world besides a couple of  involuntary twitches when your body finally succumbed to asphyxiation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and before I forget, due to your outburst in court I\u2019ve decided that you\u2019ll be receiving additional punishment.\u201d Mr. Reed\u2019s comment was heard by no one as you had already given your last breath, leaving your body to be slowly churned into a formless sludge that would go onto his small intestine to start the absorption process. It was at this point that you puny soul broke free of its earthly bonds and began to search for a way out. Mr. Reed had gone through the process so many times that he became an expert on detecting the presence of the little guy bumping around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see you\u2019re finally done,\u201d gleefully said Mr. Reed, \u201cLooking for the way to the afterlife I see. Well, that\u2019s actually what I wanted to talk to you about before you so rudely crapped out on me,\u201d he gave pauses as if waiting for a response. He knew that if there was one it would most likely be in the form as a slurry of insults but that didn\u2019t matter to him. \u201cSo what usually happens at this point is that I\u2019ll either burp or fart you out depending on how far in you\u2019re in and what I feel like doing. If I have the choice I\u2019ll typically fart out the ones with major infractions in order to give them the added punishment and humiliation of having to pass through my funky bare ass while I burp out the ones with minor infractions. However, there is a third option which is the one I\u2019m going with for you. That option is to never let you out, to keep you suffering inside of me for all of eternity, to keep you churning away. A fate worse than eternal damnation. This is your additional punishment for speaking out during the trail. You know what, 873300, I\u2019m probably doing everyone a favor by making my gut your afterlife, I can\u2019t think of a more unworthy person to experience the afterlife than you. It was probably starting to crowded up there anyways, best to keep the space meant for you open to somebody more worthy of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mr. Reed went home for the day, leaving you to finish digesting whilst he went along as if nothing had happened. </span></div></div>",

There\u2019s no escaping it, not even through a belch,\u201d Mr. Reed swallowed hard, forcing your soul back down his gullet and into his voracious stomach, forcing you to relive your final moments alive. \u201cNow you\u2019re gonna be staying down there full all eternity, got it?\u201d With you securely in your prison he proceeded to swing open the door to his classic American muscle car before starting the powerful V8 motor and speeding away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beginning to set as he motored into his driveway after had taken the scenic route home, making sure to bask in every moment of it as he felt the remainder of your body slowly disintegrate whilst sitting behind the wheel of some pure American muscle. Without haste, he moseyed on over towards the front door. \u201cWell, 873300, this is where I live. A real bachelor pad isn\u2019t it? If only you could see it,\u201d he said as he opened the front door to reveal a room littered with empty beer cans and miscellaneous workout equipment. The only furniture in the room was a crusty old recliner that was covered in stains, a coffee table covered in trash, a flat screen TV, and a dartboard. Mr. Reed certainly wasn\u2019t lying when he said that his place was a bachelor pad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout skipping a beat, Mr. Reed began to throw off his work clothes as he made his way to grab a cold one from the kitchen. By the time he returned to the living room he was down to a pair of white briefs and wife beater that were both formerly a bright white color but had been stained to an ugly grayish yellow from years of being in close contact with the brute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed sat down with a heavy thud promptly followed with a hefty sigh as he cracked open his beer and took a swig before flicking on the TV to watch the game. \u201cThis is the life, 873300, too bad you\u2019ll never get to experience it. Downing beers while watching your favorite team dominate the opposition while sitting in your favorite chair with your feet up, leaning over every once in a while to cram another rancid blast into the soft cushioning. Well, if you\u2019re lucky, then maybe a small part of you will be in one of the hundreds of farts I cram into this poor chair. Chances are you\u2019ll be sticking around for the long hall too since the fabric of this chair tends to cling onto smells and not let them go. That\u2019s another thing you won\u2019t be able to do, fart into a chair so much that it\u2019s permanently marked as your own. Oh well, chances are that you were probably so pathetic that your farts couldn\u2019t scent mark anything. Bet you didn\u2019t even follow any sports either, pathetic. Good thing I took you out then, you were a disgrace to men everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\nMr. Reed continued his night of drinking, farting, and game watching until he eventually passed out for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun slowly creeped into the darkened room until it eventually reached where Mr. Reed was sleeping. With a sudden twitch midsnore, Mr. Reed slowly came alive as he let out a yawn and stretched out his limbs. Midstretch, he leaned over and unleashed an ungodly blast that abruptly came to an end with a loud squelch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, ready already? Well, let\u2019s get you taken care of, 873300, and I know just the place where your reformed remains deserve to lie,\u201d he said while getting up and promptly heading towards a closet where he grabbed a bag and filled it with miscellaneous clothes before heading towards the garage where he grabbed another bag. With both bags in tow, Mr. Reed exited his house and headed towards his car where he tossed the bags in the back seat and cranked the engine which came to life with a throaty roar. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The whole trip Mr. Reed made sure to keep his sphincter shut tight as to not let another molecule of your former body escape before the time was right. He even went as far as to hold in any belches he felt brewing for extra insurance. It was a grueling task as your digestion, plus those beers he drank, had left his gut bloated with gas but it was all worth it to give you the ending he thought you deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes pass and Mr. Reed pulled into a remote campsite that was miles away from any other, thus ensuring maximum privacy. Mr. Reed had slowed his car to a near stop when he suddenly leaned over and released a rank blast that was as loud as a roar from the car\u2019s powerful V8. As if to prove this, Mr. Reed revved his engine twice before parking the car and taking in deep whifs of the smells that surrounded him. There was, naturally, the pungent odor of the mighty blast that had just erupted from his ass witch mixed with the smells of the earthy scents of the forest along with the smell of the exhaust of a pre-emissions V8 which carried the strong scent of gasoline with it. It was what Mr. Reed considered to be the manliest combination of smells in existence. The only way it could get any manlier was if the scent of a man who had just finished an intense workout to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few euphoric minutes had passed, Mr. Reed got out of the car and got to work setting up his campsite. Within the span of ten minutes he had set up the tent, built a fire pit, and had gotten other miscellaneous preparations done. By now, Mr. Reeds anus was reaching its limits, it was only a matter of time before your body would reenter this world in its new form. Mr. Reed strutted over to the firepit where he dropped his pants, letting his massive member to swing out freely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s time to get this thing started. Let\u2019s see the number my body did on ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed proceeded to squat over the firepit, instantly unleashing a torrent of gas which polluted the area with the akrid stench of shit. \u201cAh~ smells like a good portion of you got processed into gas, probably methane if I were to guess since the gas doesn\u2019t seem to have a scent of its own but is instead infused with the scent of the parts of you that remained solid. Uggh, we\u2019ll test out my theory later, I see your solid chunks want to make an appearance.\u201d Mr. Reed gave out a deep grunt as a long of former human broke though his sphincter and plopped down onto the firewood below.  Mr. Reed let out a few heavy breaths before continuing as a long lo snaked its way out of his filthy anus onto the pile of firewood where it began to build up into a sizable pile. Mr. Reed began to pick up momentum and pretty soon you were sliding out of his hole with almost no effort required, it was becoming quite the tranquil moment as Mr. Reed was able to enjoy the beautiful scenery while feeling a growing sense of relief as he emptied his bowels. That moment would soon be interpreted as, while a rather large log was making its way out, a massive burst of gas coursed through his bowels which caused the log to explode with a bang, spraying shit in a thin layer all over the firepit. \u201cDamn, 873300, you don\u2019t have to be so aggressive. I\u2019m gonna let the rest of you out, don\u2019t worry. Except for your soul, do don\u2019t get any ideas.\u201d With that, Mr. Reed began letting lose massive trumpeting blast which launched out any solid specs of the mud that was at one point a living human being with dreams and aspirations that might have clung to his cheeks. It only took a few forceful blasts before Mr. Reed\u2019s ass crack was virtually cleaned of any former human residue, leaving him ready for what came next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, it seems like there\u2019s only gas left which means it\u2019s time to permanently rid you from this world and to prove my hypothesis,\u201d said Mr. Reed, taking a break to glance down at his accomplishment, \u201clooks like my body barely absorbed any of you, 873300. Considering that shit is all the useless bits of food that would mean that the vast majority of you was useless, how pathetic. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not even gonna leave you in your current form since you don\u2019t even deserve it. Sure you might go onto serve as fertilizer but your useless ass would probably the most shit fertilizer in existence, no pun intended. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to reduce you to ash, that way you\u2019ll be nothing in life and in death. Quite fitting for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed proceeded to grab a lighter from a nearby bag which he promptly lit. \u201cNow to kill two birds with one stone,\u201d he said as he placed the lit lighter directly behind his plump ass before a rumbling torrent of gas blasted out of his anus, through the flame of the lighter, and onto the wood in the form of a steady stream of fire. Mr. Reed was now effectively a human flamethrower. \u201cHell yeah, I knew that would work!\u201d he exclaimed as he glanced back at the burning pile of shit and wood that lay beneath him. The smell that emanated from the blaze was enough to make even the most iron-stomached person in existence vomit. It was as if the heat from the fire was unlocking new hidden smells trapped within the shit and forced the scent straight into the nose of anybody nearby. Of course Mr. Reed didn\u2019t mind and actually took pride in the revolting scent, knowing that he was the one responsible for it, knowing that it was just what his body could do naturally, reminding him of how much better he was than others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed continued with the rest of his night out in the bush normally except that he always made sure to fart in the direction of the fire so as to burn up any remaining parts of you as well as to watch the flames of the fire flare up for amusement. Before Mr. Reed went off to bed for the night, he decided to engage in the common practice of roasting marshmallows over a campfire, except with a twist. Instead of simply holding them over the fire he instead stabbed the marshmallow stick into the ground on the opposite side of the fire and proceeded to bend over with his ass facing the fire. With a small grunt, he let out a quick blast that shot through the fire, catching fire, and hit the marshmallow on the other side. \u201cDamn, the methane you turned into cooks marshmallows at the exact right temperature, a silver lining for turning into something you hate. You know something, I really only went this far with burning your remains because the teacher for the class you lost the book for insisted on it since he claimed it would drive you up the wall since you\u2019re a treehugger or some shit. So I guess burning half of you and turning the other half into a potent greenhouse gas was supposed to be the ultimate punishment for you on top of, you know, killing you. Huh, I guess you two must really not have gotten along then. Well *yawn* it\u2019s about time I head off to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed made his way to his tent where he promptly crawled into the sleeping bag and passed out. Before he passed out he let out one final fart which got trapped in the sleeping bag. This normally wouldn\u2019t be so bad except for the fact that your soul had come out with the fart and were now forced to breath in the toxic stench of Mr. Reeds farts as they became trapped in a sleeping bag. But you needn\u2019t worry long, by the time morning rolled around and Mr. Reed unzipped his sleeping bag you were long gone. You hadn\u2019t gone back into him and you hadn\u2019t ascended to the afterlife. Instead, your soul had been destroyed, reduced to atoms from the repeated akrid blast that you were forced to endure. They were so powerful that they had actually began to tear the very fabric of your being apart until you were nothing, thus was the power of just the simplest of body functions from a superior man. In a weird twist of irony you had ended up killing yourself in a way. Mr. Reed\u2019s stomach might have killed your body but it also produced immense amounts of gas from digestion. This gas would then go onto kill your soul, to kill you for good. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s a 14 year old motocross champion, and has inspired many people to take up motos or anything, just to enjoy so much with it.  Of course you just wanna watch and admire it so much that you\u2019ve always wanted to meet Haiden so much, but now\u2019s the chance to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened was there was a giveaway where the winner will receive an invitation to come over to Haiden\u2019s place and hang out with him, and you just so happened to won it, and couldn\u2019t wait to spend some time with his idol.  It will be your most memorable moment in your entire life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you arrived at Haiden\u2019s place you\u2019ve been taken to the living room and get yourself comfortable, so that you would patiently waiting for Haiden to come over to see you in person.  You still couldn\u2019t believe that you\u2019re here, so you needed to calm yourself down and get too much nerves in you whatever happens in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, just stay calm and try not to freak out or anything when Haiden.  I wouldn\u2019t want to be embarrass him if I did so.\u201d  You said to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as you did though, you feel the house beginning to shake, like it was some kind of an earthquake, seeing the props and furniture rattle heavily.  Not only that though, you can hear the booming noise as well, and you had to stand up in great worry and look around to see where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW...What\u2019s going on?\u201d  You nervously worried as the quake continue to shake further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know how to react or what to do in this situation, since you\u2019ve never had that feeling so intense quite like this before.  And just when you think things could get very unpredictable, you begin to hear a loud belch behind your back, before that voice is spoke which made you realised who\u2019s this voice actually belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, you must be Kyle, right?\u201d  That high-pitched voice can be heard as it asked that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat can only be one thing when you turn around and realised that voice belongs to your idol, Haiden Deegan.  But something\u2019s odd about him and you noticed that he looks way more different than you first thought.  Why perhaps?  Because Haiden has gotten huge!  Not just huge, but massively obese that he\u2019s able to stand and move on his own feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid is so massive in fact, you feel like Haiden weighs at 1,000lbs or so!  Sure, he may still have good looks in his face, but how on earth did he get so much fatter so quickly?  He had his moobs pushed against his shirt, as it\u2019s gonna tight so much that it pushed out by his fat belly overlapping his waistline.  He had thick arms to come with it, but the biggest part of the body is Haiden\u2019s ass and thighs that are so big, his could take up the whole couch to sit on, and it wobbled so heavily when he moves in each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smile from your idol\u2019s face says it all, looking like it\u2019s that surprise he wanted you to see in person, if that\u2019s why he chose you to be here.  You didn\u2019t know what to reaction for a couple of moments, but just until he make your composure by seeing that massive girth of a 14 year old boy, that\u2019s when you make a respond as much as he has to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH..Haiden?

Your stomach acids are just too weak to do anything at all to anything meaty! For most people, this would be a horrible affliction; but you\u2019ve managed to eat so well that you still have quite the impressive body! Your muscular chest was covered in hair, accentuating the softness of that big, round gut you were sporting beneath; the pinnacle of a dad bod. In fact, you always thought that your \u2018disorder\u2019 would actually prove to be a blessing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason comes down to one point; you don\u2019t consider your stomach \u2018just for food\u2019. Really, you had a rare and rather odd fetish; vore! You spent many years reading fictional stories of men swallowing cute young boys whole, and recently, you\u2019ve discovered that you really do have a talent for swallowing large things whole\u2026 meaning you might be able to make your fantasies come true! Not to digest them, of course - you\u2019d never hurt a cute boy - but rather, you fantasized about letting a boy bounce around in your big gut, or spend a sleepover in it, or just gobbling up boys at the park or mall to tide you over as temporary snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne dose of reality, however, got in the way of your plans. Fitting something that large down your throat was challenging enough; getting it back up was just about impossible! Unlike in your fantasies, it quickly became clear it\u2019d be impossible to get a boy back out of your stomach, barring surgery (which, for obvious reasons, wasn\u2019t an option); your gullet was a one-way trip! At first, you thought this meant your fantasies would never come true.. But as time passed, you\u2019ve found you\u2019ve come to like the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, your heart flutters at the thought of keeping a little boy as an occupant in your big, fat, gross stomach, forever and ever! You considered heading to the park or something and sneaking a random, sufficiently cute boy onto a one-way trip down into your prison of a stomach... but you figured, since you could only do this once (or maybe two or three times), you had to do it right. It'd be more special if it was a boy you knew! And luckily, you happened to know many perfect boys around your own neighborhood!</span></div></div>",
