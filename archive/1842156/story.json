Basically, Richard was as fit as could be expected of a man who weighed ten times what most men his height weighed - better, in fact, then many fat men.  And this daily swimming workout was one of the reasons why.  Still, Martin knew that the such a magnificent weight put a strain on all Richard's bodily systems, so close monitoring was called for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heartrate slowed as Richard reached the other side, and Richard tapped in, then called up to Martin, </span></div></div>",

However that changed when someone brought Mathew to his attention. A certified genius Matthew had finished his first doctorate in physics at 14, mechanical engineering and organic chemistry at 16, his medical degree and completed residency by 20 and several more after that. Why he stood out was more the man behind him, a renowned expert in archaeology and computational linguistics Peter. When Richard extended them an invitation to stay at the clinic with the offer of unlimited resources for research into fattening processes Peter was already a well-rounded 510lb but with two years at the clinic and a bottomless appetite for his favorite footling sub sandwiches made him into a massive 703lb ball of a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter had for years hidden his love of his size, while always overweight it took until college for him to really pork up. He and Matthew met one fortunate lunch on campus, repeating those lunches lead to dating and a whole lot more. It took Matthew little effort to talk Peter into gaining and with his encouragement put Peter into some of the largest pairs of khakis ever seen in research academia. Their willingness to join the clinic wasn't based on need so much as wanting their shared dream to come true, to have Peter weigh 10 times as much as Matthew and then so much further than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they've had a good amount of time to work on multiple projects, both Peter and Matthew are on the verge of breakthroughs to allow them to gain faster than even before, what're they going to get working.</span></div></div>",

He'd been working with a program to identify common symbols and assemble a rough alphabet possible for speaking, the idea of finding and transcribing a language unspoken for so long got him so excited his belly regularly demanded a half dozen of his favorite sub sandwiches.It was an unbelievably rare item, the best dating techniques confirmed the creation of the stone tablets to around 24,000 BC in an area surrounding the discovered site of ancient fertility symbols like Venus of Willendorf; meaning that the book predated any previous text by more than 20,000 years.  Peter had been trying for 14 months to find a translation of the book, it had been written in rough symbols never seen before and the reason it fetched 1.8 million dollars at private auction by an anonymous collector was that the several of the tablets, had symbols of women like Venus, and some that were substantially larger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the monitors Peter hit the switch on his recliner from a leaning position he loved to snack in back to a normal seat to better access his workstation. As the motorized chair lifted his bulk upwards Peter quickly shoved the last few inches of sub into his greedy mouth. The massive sandwich stretched his fattened cheeks to capacity while he picked up mustard covered cheese slices off his once white 12xl button up lab coat and shoved them in as well, pushing the food down his relaxed gullet and into his cavernous belly. Once his chair had lifted into the sitting position he reached past his bulk to his 64oz gainshake, it was his 3rd of the day and while he had gulped the first two down fresh while they were still partway frozen this one was just like a thicker glass of cold milk. \"What the hell, it's a celebration!\" he said before putting the glass to his mouth, gulp after gulp drained the half gallon shake in just under 30 seconds, his spare hand rubbing the upper portion of his belly as he thought about soon having the belly of Richard and how little he could reach of his fattened self then. A massive belch caught the attention of Matthew, who's work in the other lab was dropped to see what his man was up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hun, quite a belch!\" Matthew says while Peter wipes the excess shake off his jowls and spare tire of a double chin. \"Making any headway on your translations?\" <br>\r\n*Uuurp* \"Actually just got the first translation done, 14 letters and I think I have a composite of what their speech pattern might have been.\" Peter said now eyeballing another 5-pound sub sitting on the tray. \"Oh go for it babe, I'll set it to assemble translations for a few of the tablets, let's jump to the good ones huh?\" Matthew says while reaching for the mouse to configure the translator. \"Thanks this is the discovery of a lifetime and I'm glad I'm sharing it with you.\" Peter beams before unwrapping and gulping down a quarter of the sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Peter finishes off the giant sub the first 4 tablets are done translating and Peter tries to piece together the rough language. \"Hmm... this does seem to be an incantation like I had estimated, oh! this one too!\" Peter runs his hands under the massive rolls of his apron and shakes excitedly, the motion of his husbands quivering fat distracting Matthew from looking anywhere else. \"Well of these tablets it would seem this one claims to add any amount of 'Oum.'.. their word for fat or mass, I'm not sure but I'd assume fat... They had a number system... oh fascinating! I wonder how their mathmatical.... ok back to the tablet it looks like you'd just have to say it aloud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable! what do the other tablets do?\" Matthew asks, prying his mind away from the 86 inches of doughy waistline bouncing around long enough to ask a meaningful question. \"It looks like this one you can... yes! you can multiply your current weight. I can't believe they had addition and multiplication it's outstanding!\" Peter says before attacking his 4th milkshake of the day, he could feel the excitement in his tentlike khakis as another 6,500 calories was gulped down faster than before. \"This one has something to do with fertility, hah better let Eldonia and Alessandro know.\" \"What about the last one?\" Matthew asks, dreaming of the possibilities if these were to work. \"Looks like something to do with loosing weight, hah who needs that one?\" Peter laughs, he really should present the slides to Richard, he'd been asking about them recently and if anyone appreciated them it'd be the man who paid so well for them. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, a man who was a mountain really.  He was wider than the desk and taller than pretty much any other man.  Huge, fat cheeks above a thick double- well, triple- chin framed the head as it sat atop broad shoulders.  Those shoulders rested above two, gigantic pecs that were soft, flabby, and as big as some other sumo's bellies.  They rested proudly above a vast, soft, drooping belly that was barely contained by a t-shirt with the dojo's logo on it; no doubt a special order due to the yards of fabric needed to make it.  It rested partially on the desk as it was being rubbed by two huge, strong hands attached to fat wrists and tree-sized arms.  Beneath it sat two thighs big as silos with giant calves, all heavily muscled to support him.  His waist was huge, bigger than any other wrestler, and it melted into two, blimp like butt cheeks.  Each one bigger than a beanbag chair, likely able to crush a car with little to no effort.  They were packed into a pair of gigantic sweats that were strained heavily due to having to hold in all that man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Yoshi, but we have to ban you.  We can't risk you crushing someone,\" said the smaller man.  \"Even if you lost some weight, you're still over seven and a half feet tall!  We were accepting before, but you just keep growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain sighed, \"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Now, you're welcome to drop by anytime but BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ,\" the man said before an annoying alarm started to go off from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi grunted and rubbed his eyes.  His alarm had interrupted the dream he was having.  Though it wasn't so bad really since it was the dream that replayed whenever he was truly exhausted and his mind wandered to the memory of being banned from professional sumo wrestling.  He pulled the sheets off of his gargantuan gut and palmed the sides of it with a small smile.  Who said Japanese guys were tiny and wiry office workers?  His years at Maximus had been good to him.  He had been gaining and training for sumo, but recently he'd been focusing on a new goal.  He wanted to keep growing but stay mobile so he could become a record holder and show that sumo organization.  After putting on a hundred pounds since being kicked out 9 months ago, he's gotten even closer to a ton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heaved himself onto his side as he tried to roll out of bed.  Flopping onto his side, his belly spilled out before him and hung off the side of his custom sized bed while his constantly growing butt stuck out behind him.  With a flex of his belly he grunted, and fired out a thick fart, expelling his morning gas loudly- a side effect of his high protein diet.  After doing so, he swung one of his huge feet out from under him and planted it onto the floor with a thud.  He pushed himself up a bit and rounded his other leg around to plant his other foot down, slowly raising up.  There he stood at his full 7'7\" height and 16' waist, ready to start the day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yoshi usually started and ended every day with a workout.  He trained with Bear during that time, having the bodybuilder push him to expand his strength and pack on muscle so he could keep hauling his giant ass around.  Plus Bear was fond of huge men so he was more than willing to help out Yoshi.  It was an interest of his to see how big he could get and still move since his hubby, Hog, didn't walk unless he had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant sumo yawned a bit before thundering over to his closet.  Each of his heavy footsteps created a deep thud on the floor and if it weren't for the sturdy floors and walls, everything would be rattling like an earthquake.  Usually he'd just wear his mawashi, but he was waiting for a few new sizes to arrive as he outgrew his last one.  He pulled out a giant jock and a pair of equally huge workout shorts as well as some socks and his massive size 26 workout shoes.  Grunting, he slid the jock on, having to lean around his girth and squat down so he could pick it up.  As he did so his belly rested on the ground and pushed his moobs up into his face.  This made him smile and get mildly excited, but there was no time for that now.  He did the same with the shorts and tucked his belly into them a bit for the extra support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then thudded back to his bed and sat down, grunting again as he reached around to get his socks on.  It was getting tougher and tougher to do the bigger he got, but Bear had been training him to be more flexible too so he could still do at least this.  Sadly he still broke a sweat as he got one on and rested a bit before tugging the second on.  Exhaling a bit he slipped his feet into his shoes, adjusted them, and then grunted as he pushed his mammoth body up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting his shorts, he started to thunder out of his room, squeezing out sideways through the already wide door.  He waddled down the even wider corridor, huge thuds echoing as he pushed his huge belly along, the massive blimp wobbling and leading his way.  A few workers in the hall stepped against the walls to give him room, Yoshi holding a huge mitt up to wave to them as he pressed on.  Thankfully his room was near the gym so it was only a short waddle to the huge, open doorway and big, glass windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBear was already there, setting things up when he heard the huge thuds.  He turned and smiled, his square, stubbled face beaming happily.  Yoshi returned the smile and rumbled up in front of Bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, big man!  Ready to get started?  I think we'll do some weights and squats for now, then Hog's got breakfast ready,\" Bear said in his thick, gruff, but quite sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am,\" Yoshi smiled as he and Bear went over to the weights section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey warmed up a bit, did a few curls with dumbells that would make any jock grunt with effort, but for them it was nothing.  They were perfectly in synch- Bear's huge arms bulging and relaxing as he curled the heavy weights while Yoshi did the same.  Though with Yoshi, his fat arms tensed and relaxed, causing the flab to jiggle.  The weight also followed the curve of the side of his belly as he curled, making his gut shake too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two worked up a decent sweat and then moved over to the bench.  Bear had ordered a bench that could be connected to others to give Yoshi enough space to lay on.  He had connected about 14 feet worth of bench, meaning the massive man still hung off the sides a bit.  Though it didn't matter much as Yoshi eased onto it and spread his huge legs, getting comfortable despite the missing 2 feet.  He lay back as Bear added weights to either side of the bar, filling it with enough to make even him put forth some effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Bear grunted as he got the last weight on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready,\" Yoshi said as he gripped the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBear started to spot Yoshi, standing over the man's huge head.  He counted off reps as Yoshi pumped, monitoring how his arms flexed with each one.  He loved how lazy Hog was, but he also loved how strong and active Yoshi was so for him, living at the center was a dream come true.  Yoshi's forehead broke into a sweat, followed by square inch upon square inch of his body.  His moobs and belly dripped sweat onto the bench, some pooling in his bellybutton and dampening his huge asscrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several reps, Bear had Yoshi stop and cool down as he got a second bar ready.  Yoshi panted and wiped down what he could of his body, but the sweat just kept coming in full force.  Bear helped him up off of the bench and he lumbered over to the second bar, chest still heaving.  He squatted down and grabbed the bar around his shoulders as Bear instructed him to do some squats.  Yoshi did as he was told, rising up from his position to come back down slowly.  He had his huge legs spread apart and was grunting deeply with effort as he squatted.  His belly and ass pressed down into the gym mats, coating them in his sweat before he rose back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept going as Bear encouraged him, forcing him to work hard despite all the weight.  On the last one, Yoshi went down and a thundering fart ripped from his giant ass.  His cheeks were red, but mostly from exertion, having given up most of his modesty since joining up at Maximus.  Bear just laughed and dramatically fanned the air while Yoshi let the bar fall and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you ARE worse than Hog,\" Bear bellowed with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had me doing squats so this is your fault,\" laughed Yoshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow...</span></div></div>",

Fairly bouncing his 1200 pounds on his toes, he goes to the shower at the side of the gym, strips off, and steps into the enormous shower enclosure - really, a glass-walled cubicle.  Closing his eyes, he activates the shower - which is no ordinary shower, but more like an automated car wash for giant guys.  Yoshi reaches down and grabs his gut, lifting it, then dropping it, letting the floor and wall mounted sprays clean even his gut overhang.  He wiggles about, raising and lowering his vast arms, shifting his oil-barrel legs left and right, so that every square inch of flesh looses its layer of sweat and comes out clean.  The shower, initially warm, slowly shifts to cool to cool him down, then the water ceases, and a cyclone of warm, dry air roars out of slots in the walls and ceilling.  Once again, Yoshi elevates his generous gut to let his overlap be dried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the shower, Yoshi picks up a pair of clean fleece shorts and a t-shirt with \"Maximus Gain\" stenciled across the gut region.  Dropping heavily onto a nearby bench, Yoshi quickly dresses (as quickly as his fat allows), then climbs to his feet again.  Meanwhile, Bear has showered as well, and donned his own shorts and muscle shirt. Bear's shirt is stencilled 'Hog Trainer\" across his mountainous pecs, and \"Maximus\" stretches across his gluts on the shorts.  The two fill the doorway, then rumbled along the broad hallway to the dining room, where Hog awaits them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking fatter than ever, Hog sits in the dining room, stirring a vast pot of eggs.  Spying Yoshi's gut preceding him into the dining room, Hog calls out, \"You've come!  I thought I'd starve to death, waiting!\"  He grins broadly and high-fives Bear, as the dining room waiters quickly take the lids off an acre of high-protein and high calorie foods for Yoshi, and a similar but much sweeter spread for Hog, suiting his sweet tooth.  Bear picked up the vast pot of eggs, and dumped a large quanitity into each of three bowls, one for each of the three big men.  Soon all three are deep into the vast breakfast. Bear finishes first, of course, then helps feed Hog the rest of his super-calorific repast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually sated, Hog and Yoshi burp loudly, then sit back, reclining to digest the thousands of calories they have just ingested.  Many go to Yoshi's hard worked muscles (as do the calories of Bear's smaller repast), but Hog's intake goes to Hog's fat layers, mostly.  Hog and Yoshi....</span></div></div>",

Then the magnificent trio head down a huge hallway, catching up slowly with Eldonia and Peter, who left the cafeteria moments ahead of them.   The mammoth quintet reach a broad set of double doors, which Yoshi opens by ramming his gut into the them.  Inside is a wide boardroom table, with wider chairs scattered around it, and at its head sits Richard Maximus III.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments after the four men seat themselves, and Eldonia parks her massive scooter, Dr. Martin, Alessandro and Martin hurry in.  With Dr. Martin is a stranger, who tries hard to avoid rubbernecking at the sight of so many huge human beings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome,\" rumbles Richard in a deep voice that suits his 2000 pounds frame.  \"Top of today's agenda is our visitor, James.  He's a freelancer - National Geographic, NY Times, BBC - who specialises in unusual human stories, and he's asked to do a report on the clinic.  Welcome James!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" James replies, his wonderment and amazement at his surroundings obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, none of you have to speak with James, and we get approval for any images he may want to take out of the clinic,\" Richard continued, \"but I'd like you all to work with him - this could be a great opportunity to expand the work we do here.  James, do you want to ask us a few questions as a group first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied James.
