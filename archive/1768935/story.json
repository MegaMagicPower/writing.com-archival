He wasn't going anywhere, he was just wandering to kill some time, as he often needed to do. A single week after finishing his exams, he was already bored. All of his friends had got jobs (the lucky sods, he thought) but they're wasn't any left by the time he got round to applying for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I should take a moment to explain what Dave looks like. He has medium length, thin black hair with a fringe which covers the top of his face. He is relatively thin and slightly taller than average. At this particular moment he is wearing black jeans and a plain White t-shirt, with a black baseball cap as well to keep the sun out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dave turned a corner, he suddenly collided with a woman who was walking the opposite way. Both fell and Dave quickly rolled over, more than ready to erupt at whoever had cost him his obviously so precious time. The woman was already getting to her feet, trying to get away from this situation as quickly as possible. The woman was around 20 but was much shorter than Dave, only around 5 foot tall. She was a thin and had massively long bleached blond hair which reached halfway down her back. Her face was caked in makeup and she had piercings in her Tongue, ear and eyebrow.  She was wearing a miniskirt, fishnet tights and high heels which elevated her a couple of inches off the ground Dave quickly noticed the thong which peeked out from her miniskirt. On top she wore a blue tube top and a black bar which pushed out her breasts and made them seem as large as possible. The woman was also wearing lots of jewellery on her hands and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave let the first thing which came to his mind escape through his mouth. \"You Fucking Bitch!!!\" The woman opened her mouth and replied...</span></div></div>",

It was all a dream. Or was it? Suddenly Dave noticed something about himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That's weird...\" Dave thought to himself as he groggily got out of the bed. He opened his bedroom door and got the feeling of emptiness from his house. Home Alone. He slowly marched across the hallway to the bathroom so he could get a better look at his fingernails. He looked down at them to see that not only had they grown from what he called nails into what could only be described as talons, but they had erupted in a sickly pink colour which utterly repulsed him. His only thoughts were: WHAT; THE and FUCK.<br>\r\nDave almost screamed but held himself back. One shout or scream would bring the neighbours knocking, and he had enough to deal with at the moment. Maybe this is all a dream, he thought to himself. Back to bed. Back to bed. Back to bed. Just when he thought his life couldn't get any worse, he woke up to find:</span></div></div>",
