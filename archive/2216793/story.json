While it was a paying job, it was one that left her plenty of time to think and even browse the web with little chance of being caught or in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis being said, such a boring job would be understandable if Jenifer didn't notice anything amiss behind her, or even beside her in the Donations bin, or as most people recognized it - The lost and Found box. During one of her free periods of browsing the web, various objects that had made their way into said box glowed an odd blue, though on occasion red and even green had occurred. Jenifer wasn't unobservant, but it didn't help that her job plus looking down at her phone left her unaware of what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all leads us to this moment in time, where a box filled with various objects that most would disregard will cause a change for those 'lucky few' who decide to brave this 'benign' box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex Hopps - A young adult male who has lost his pair of glasses, and stumbles his way to the information desk in hopes that either they are there, or maybe a loaner pair could be in the L&amp;F box<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca Troy - A young female who had donated a pair of glasses to the box, but also picked up a pair of earrings while Jenifer was distracted. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpencer McKnight - a young high-school student who had decided to ask Jenifer if it was okay to donate a few items, and spots something that they 'just have to have'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle Stevenson- a busty party girl in high-school who in a somewhat daze wandered past the information booth.

'Sadly', while at the mall window shopping, Alex lost his glasses and was glad that he could at least still see general shapes, if not details without them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone mentioning that they could have been found and turned in to the information desk, or that they might have a pair of glasses that could be used in the meantime, Alex stumbled their way to said location.

I seem to have lost mine, and if not, would their possibly be a pair that could be loaned to me?\"</i> Alex asks awkwardly, feeling quite embarrassed about having to ask about such a simple thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Someone donated some glasses earlier, and you are free to use them, but unless you want to go searching this box, these are the only pair i know of on hand,\"</i> Jenifer answers, feeling bad and helping the almost blind Alex and helps him over to the Lost and found box, even tempted to offer to aid him if he does decide to search said box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

She had the looks, the wit, and the humor that allowed her to easily socialize with anyone in and outside of school. It's why she was at the mall in the first place since some of the school's cheerleaders during P.E. asked if she'd want to go shopping with them this weekend. Something that Rebecca had happily accepted before realizing just how brainless the cheer squad really was! It was like talking to multiple brick walls and only took about half an hour before Rebecca came up with the excuse that she had to donate an old pair of glasses she almost never used anymore. Figuring getting rid of them was well worth it if it meant just a few minutes of peace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca casually walked towards the information desk with an audible sigh that caught the attention of the girl behind the desk, her name tag reading Jennifer \"Can I help you with something?\" Jennifer asked politely, some cheesy romance novel in hand which had just started to get good. Jennifer couldn't help but internally groan as she just wanted to finish the book during these slow hours of the day and Rebecca was the first person to stop in all day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a donation if that's okay.\" Rebecca replied, lifting the glasses in the air for Jennifer to see before setting them inside the box of lost and found. Getting a smile and nod from Jennifer as she realized this customer wouldn't need any help, which meant she could get back to her reading. Only during that time Rebecca couldn't help but spot something shiny just below where she had put the glasses down, on closer examination Rebecca realized that the shine was coming from diamond encrusted ear rings. Something that was definitely high end and not supposed to be there with the rest of this junk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was about to say something to the woman behind the counter but noticed that they were now back to reading their book, paying her no attention.... 'It's not like anyone really cares about this stuff, I'm sure plenty of stuff goes missing and it's not like the world ends.' Rebecca thought to herself, confidently taking the ear rings out as she removed her hand. Squeezing one hand shut around her prize tightly while the other waved by to Jennifer who silently waved back. Not even looking up from her book as Rebecca left the store</span></div></div>",

Though Rebecca just saw it as a lawful trade if anything, she gave away some decent glasses so it was only fair she get something back for her efforts. '<i>Why am I even worried? Everyone probably does something like this when going to the lost and found.</i>' Rebecca told herself before moving up the mall's escalator to find the group she'd come in with. Quickly hiding the earrings away in her pant pocket for safe keeping until she was finally alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the time she spent at the mall was anything but special, the group she'd come in with just gossiping while trying on a wide assortment of clothing. After about 3 hours Rebecca was finally relieved that they were calling it for the day, giving Rebecca her chance to finally leave for home with her 'perfectly lawful trade'. Giving the teenage girl a chance to really look the jewelry over for any signs of it being fake. Yet the more Rebecca looked, the more certain she was that this was from one of those out of country fancy brands. Meaning she'd hit the jackpot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca, is that you?\" Rebecca's mom called out from the kitchen, hearing the front door open along with a long groan from her daughter. \"Yeah mom, it's me! Something smells delicious.\" Rebecca smirked, poking her head into the kitchen \"It's your favorite, lasagna. Just the way your grandmother used to make it.\" Rebecca's mom laughed, walking over to meet her daughter's eyes \"How was your day with the girls from school?\" She asked, already able to read the situation from her daughter's eye roll. \"That very well may have been the biggest mistake of my life, seriously mom. Shoot me the next time I ever think about going dress shopping with cheerleaders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know I used to be a cheerleader right?\" Rebecca's mom teased, kissing her daughter's forehead before returning to the meal she was preparing. \"Were you also annoying during the prime of your life?\" Rebecca teased back with a knowing smirk before leaving up the stairs to her room. \"I'll have you know, I'm still in the prime of my life young lady!\" Rebecca's mom hollered after them, but Rebecca was to focused on one thing only. Once making sure her bedroom door was locked Rebecca quickly removed the earrings from her pocket, knowing her mother would most likely know something was up if she ever saw her daughter with the diamond encrusted earrings. Leaving Rebecca little choice but to hide them away in her room if she ever wanted to see them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking herself over in the mirror Rebecca held the earrings up to her ears, thinking they actually paired with her outfit very nicely...</span></div></div>",

This morning Rebecca didn't had the time to do it and she did feel a little dirty after walking around with the group. She got more exercise than she had in gym class. So taking the necessary clothes with her, Rebecca decided to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile cooking Rebecca's mother, Maribel (Mary for her friends) was done folding the laundry as well. Seeing as how the lasagna needed to cook she decided she could go upstairs to put the clothes away. First putting her and her husbands' clothes away she then knocked on Rebecca's door. Hearing her sing softly Maribel knew her daughter was taking a shower. She opened the door and put Rebecca's clothes on her bed. Rebecca could take care of the rest. When she was about to leave the room Maribel spotted something shining on her daughter's desk. Curiously what it was, she walked closer to it. Grabbing the objects she saw it was a beautiful pair of diamond encrusted earrings. Maribel wasn't sure what to think about these. They would cost a fortune to buy. Did Rebecca buy them? Or were they a gift from someone unknown to her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribel wasn't sure what to think about it all. Either her daughter spent her money on something so expensive or she got it from someone who could afford this. Either way Maribel wasn't about to let Rebecca have these things before they had a talk about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribel meanwhile was admiring herself holding the earrings next to her ears. She could try them on just for show. Then she could just take them off. Or would that be wrong?</span></div></div>",

With only a cursory and customary greeting to her mother, Rebecca bolted towards her room, closing the door and taking a deep breath, the tension from 'trading' the glasses for earrings being replaced by the curiosity of what she'll look like in them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Pulling her hair up into a ponytail, all the better to see what her currently bare ears will look like after getting her prizes on, Rebecca quickly retrieves the earrings from her pocket, standing in front of her mirror, which was luckily just in front of her bed.<i> \"Seriously, who would toss these in the Lost and Found? They must be quite expensive if they're not fake,\"</i> she muttered to herself, putting the first earring in, shuddering as a chill crawled down her back suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Looking around, confused at the sudden sensation, Rebecca didn't notice the earring glow briefly, turning back just as it stopped. Glancing around one more time, she looks in the mirror, admiring the look of the jewelry in her ear, while fumbling with the other piece in her hand before slowly bringing it up to her other ear. Distracted with putting it on, and getting it locked in with the mini-clasp on the back, Rebecca failed to notice both earrings glow, this time no sudden stop in said glowing occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0The chill sensation returns to the extrovert, who looks up and notices her reflection in the mirror, a glow around her ears before her body stops responding to her desires. <i>\"Wha-!\"</i> She starts to utter, only to realize she can't move, her body slowly locking up as the chill sensation spreads throughout her body until it reaches her eyes, which were wide with panic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing that Rebecca sees before the cold feelings reach her eyes was the ceiling as she topples over backwards onto her bed, thankful that it cushioned her fall . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gaah!\"</i> Rebecca gasps, shocked as she feels a mix of sensations, confused as the last thing she could recall was a cold spreading feeling and earrings. . . before looking around in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What the- . . . testing, testing, this is me speaking?\"</i> Rebecca starts to exclaim, noticing their surroundings were not what she was used to, considering they were in a small two bedroom house before, and right now they were in a large 50x40x15 room. . . a bathroom? and alot of the things in said room looked quite high-class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd in the odd surroundings, Rebecca noticed that her voice was different, and tested it to make sure, which proved that something was up. Looking around she noticed a large ornate mirror and walked over to it, taking a look at the reflection and gasping loudly. Standing before the mirror was not Rebecca but some other woman. Instead of short shoulder-blade length brown hair she had long ass-length red hair, her previous C cup boobs were outclassed by this woman's monstrous DD cups, with larger areolas than she'd ever seen before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer, Rebecca noticed that this woman was taller than her by a good four inches, and her legs were a bit more defined than her own, but the real shock was that she looked so freaking hot! <i>\"Wow...who the fuck is this woman?\"</i> She mutters aloud, shocked when she heard something else that drew her attention to the fact that she'd been ignoring the sensation of disconnect, a slight 'chill' all over, a slight lag when she tried to focus on moving an arm or hand to inspect the body she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'Who am i? Who the hell are you and how are you controlling my body!?!'</b></i> Rebecca heard, it sounding in the exact voice of the woman she'd been hearing when testing said voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Uh.....what?\"</i> Rebecca responds confusedly, not sure if she was just having a very lucid dream or something else, as this is the kind of stuff that happened in stories, not real life. . . right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'I said who are you and how are you controlling my body...and stop touching my boob please! It feels so weird, like a numb body part that is being poked and groped!'</b></i> The woman's voice says internally, with Rebecca noticing that she'd been fondling the redhead's boob after poking it a few times, quickly stopping, though thinking on what she'd said about the sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Uh....i have no idea how this happened...and I'm . . .Becca?\"</i> Rebecca says aloud, deciding not to be completely honest as well as not sure how much anyone could get off of a nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'Well, what was the last thing you remember doing? Maybe that caused this?'</b></i> The voice suggests, seeming to be grasping for any explanations for this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I was trying on some earrings i got from a Lost and Found box in the mall. . .\"</i> Rebecca starts to recount before the voice shouts, it sounding as if practically in her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'Were they really fancy looking, with some gems in them and stuff? If so then they were mine, I lost them last week while. . .'</b></i> The voice says, trailing off and sounding quite evasive at the end. . . there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How did you lose them?\"</i> Rebecca asks, only to hear a bit of a whimper from the voice, waiting a few minutes before finally getting an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'I kind of lost them when i found a forum online that caught my interest...you have to understand i didn't think it was legit!'</b></i> They start to ramble, but wouldn't clearly explain more than that they tried something from the internet without expecting it to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Interesting. . .\"</i> Rebecca says aloud before. . .</span></div></div>",
