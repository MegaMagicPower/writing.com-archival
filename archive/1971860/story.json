Nearly blinded, she looked through and saw a car, along with two women in officer uniforms. One was an incredibly obese blonde woman, looking over 400 pounds easily and barely fitting into her suit, which was stained with ketchup and mustard droppings. The other was an Asian woman, who wasn't obese but had incredibly large breasts. The blonde pointed a gun at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make one move and you'll be in trouble! URRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was very confused by the situation, but made a leap of faith to her left. Unfortunately, the woman's gun was too quick for her, as it shot out some sort of handcuff device, immediately attaching itself to Selina's hands, causing her to stumble a bit. The officers quickly went in and apprehended her. The Asian woman took out some sort of scanning device and scanned Selina up and down. She looked at the results and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"135 pounds!\" she said, shaking her head, \"Looks like we have someone about to pull some diet scams, Wendy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we got rid of you thugs!\" the blonde growled, \"Criminals like you just want to ruin our livelihoods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do?

She sat up, finding herself at a table, looking around and finding herself in what looked like a diner. It smelled of flatulence and burgergrease, as she tried to figure out what happened. She rested her bloated belly against the table as an obese waitress approached her. The waitress had long brunette hair and a uniform stained with grease and condiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, honey?\" she said, \"I found you passed out earlier in the alley.

Tell you what, URRRRP!, I'll offer you free meals just for today. You do look mighty hungry,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina didn't want to eat, but despite her pumped stomach, it growled loudly, even causing the waitress to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I can tell you're starving.

She looked through the large menu, and all she saw looked very unhealthy. Steaks covered in extra grease, triple burgers with bacon and cheese, shakes made out of hot dogs and ice cream, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, wouldn't a diet bar be enough of me,\" she thought.

Selina licked her lips at the large display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in, hun!\" the waitress said as she walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina went like a wild cat into the food.

Her fleshy belly grew like a beanbag as it rested itself on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly two hours for Selina to finish but she felt satisfied. As she gulped down a cup of syrup to finish it off, she burped off loudly, but a bit embarrassed. How was she so piggish after such a short time? Not only that, she must've gained about 70 extra pounds in the short timespan. Selina enjoyed it all, but had to find out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you miss, but I must head out now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress farted back in happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina walked out to the city streets, and somehow, her stomach was still growling with hunger!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaving only a pile of dirty plates on the table, licked clean, Selina groaned as she rubbed her bloated belly. Her feast had taken a toll on her body and her outfit. Minutes into her feast, her body practically exploded with flab giving her cat suit no time to prepare for the sudden shift in weight. Her stomach tripled in size and busted the zipper in front. She propped it up on the table letting it gurgle and rumble as her food digested. Her hips doubled in width and split around her rear. Now everyone could go ahead and ogle at her sweet ass once she sits up, though currently its nearly filling out the whole booth. Her breasts were as large as her head by this point and with her attire ruined, there was little covering them up. She hoped that the indecency laws were lighter around here and that she wouldn't wind up even larger than she already was. Although she wouldn't mind another meal like this even if it did wreck her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you save room for dessert?\" The waitress returned, smiling as she looked upon her content customer. Selina blushed a little embarrassed to be seen this way even if its by a woman larger than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can eat BRRRRUUUUUUUUP!\" Catwoman belched, surprising herself. \"But thanks anyway....\" She tried to look for her name tag but couldn't find it. She suspected it's probably lodged underneath her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Rose. People stopped looking for it a while ago. And don't mention it. We gotta look out for another these days. Slob patrol is really cracking down on sticks.\" If the police officers were more like Rose she might not have minded being fed liquid garbage. Speaking of, Selina remembered the situation she is in and craved answers. Her stomach however craved more sustenance and the thief was tempted to take her up on dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that you mention it, there is something I want...\"</span></div></div>",

She would also need to get a layout of the city so she'd know what places she should avoid. Lastly, she needed to find a way out of this putrid hellhole. Everyone walking ahead of her was constantly breaking wind and she was unfortunate enough to be downwind of their tuna salad toots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter snagging about $400 from various victims, she broke off from the crowd and ventured off into the city with one thing on her mind. </span></div></div>",

Though that wasn't her main concern at the moment. A flurry of questions filled her head as she broke into jog up to the front door. That proved to be a mistake as she found herself out of breath by the time she got there. It was a cool night out and she needed to cool off so she undid the zipper of her jumpsuit sighing as the breeze refreshed her pudgy body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped inside deciding to deal with her appearance later. If Batman saw her, good for him. If not, his loss. Either way the breeze felt good on her skin and her gut was now hanging loose and blocking the zipper. No way she was going to get that zipper up until she lost some weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelving deeper into the mansion, Catwoman was worried about why the place had gone to pieces. If Batman was here, he clearly needed a new cleaning staff. Her stomach gurgled and the burglar appeased it by ripping a couple of farts while no one was around. As she did, she pondered what was going on. Did she travel into the future? Or go to another dimension? Is this the work of Mad Hatter or Scarecrow? All possible but it didn't explain why everyone's a slob. Or why she's still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot came down and crunched an empty bag of chips.

Just as she was about to let her guard down, a horrid stench reached her that was stronger than before. Suddenly, her reflexes kicked in and leapt backwards as a tremendous figure lunged from above. Selina avoided the attack just in time, and even with her heavier figure she still managed to land on her feet and live up to her feline namesake. As the dust settled, she got a good look at her attacker and gasped when she realized who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before her was another Selina Kyle, only this fat cat was far larger than herself. This thief wore a jumpsuit much like her own only it was far too small for her and everything was on full display. The zipper was all the way down, no doubt to give her paunch room to breathe and cover up her waist like a doughy apron with a few creases here and there. Her breasts were a out four cup sizes bigger and bigger than her chubby head. And then there was her ass, which looked like it could fill the entire backseat of a cop car. How she managed to sneak up on her, let alone remain acrobatic with those thunder thighs was baffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have known they'd someone after me,\" said the fatter Selina. \"I just didn't expect a scrawny copy cat. Let's see if you're at least half as good as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could get a word in, this world's Catwoman pounced with astonishing speed. Selina just barely dodged the attack. She had a plethora of questions but first she had to put an end to this fight. \"I'm not here to fight. I came here to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steal what hasn't been taken?\" The other Selina guessed, pausing to let out a cheesy belch. \"You bastards already took everything from him. First his business, then his life, and now his home?\" She spun around and aimed her flabby ass at Selina, revealing a prominent blown out hole in the back of her suit, where she vented a nauseatingly fishy PPPPPPBBBBBBLLLLLLRRRRRRTTTTTT! It was almost as strong as one of Black Canary's screams and stung her nostrils. This stunned Selina long  enough for the fatter cat to move in and land a flurry of slashes on her that tore her costume to shreds. The front of her leather attire was exposed much like her doughy counterpart and gained a series of a claw marks that drew blood. To make matters worse, the fat cat belched again in her face and ended her combo with a belly bash that sent her flying and slamming against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina fell to the floor, aching from the beatdown she just received. The hardest hit she got was the revelation that Bruce was dead. She refused to believe this was the case and wanted answers right now. She winced and struggled to get back up to her feet but her new weight made it difficult. Not to mention her head was still spinning from the gas attack, and the other Catwoman was in another weight class entirely and in her element. How was she going to get out of this?</span></div></div>",

The most obvious feature was that everyone was fat. As in, <i>everyone</i> was <i>fat</i>. Fat enough that this universe's fat version of herself was a little on the light side. Fat enough that she saw elementary school-aged kids twice her weight. Even the pets were fat; she saw someone walking a dog that was probably heavier than the kid. Everything about the city seemed to revolve around eating. Every large flat surface was plastered with posters promoting some sort of artery-wrecking fast food product, people had (very stretched-out) tattoos of their favorite chip brands like people back home would have gang signs, and every corner had some sort of restaurant, stall, or cart hawking something that inevitably had the words \"triple-\" and \"fried\" somewhere in its name. She looked up, but above her were endless spires of illuminated restaurant billboards and neon soda signs. And of course, everyone was carrying a cup, bag or wrapper of sorts, and the only time something came out of their mouths rather than going in was when they belched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were the smells. Harley wondered why her alternate self hadn't started going by the name Pennywise, considering how the entire city smelled like a sewer. Every surface people touched seemed grimy, there were puddles and stains of very questionable repute all along the sidewalk, and the air itself seemed to be filled with a foul-smelling haze. Harley wondered what it would be like to light a match in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't shake the feeling she was being watched, though, and she wasn't exactly wrong. Whenever she caught someone's eye, they would either stare at her like she'd grown a second head, or give her a dirty glare worthy of blood feuds and people who cut you off in traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, me, why are we going so far and passing all these other places?\" Harley asked, shouting over the din of traffic and flatulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer larger companion slowed down to a normal-paced waddle and let her catch up. \"Oh, these places? I've eaten at every one of 'em at least half a dozen times. They're all good, but they ain't nothing special. If all these other places are blowin' your mind, wait until you see <i>this</i> place!\" And with that, they stopped in front of a place that looked like a rather upscale establishment; black walls, silver building accents, nice mahogany doors, lines of people waiting to get in, and two bouncers with big paunches who could probably throw bigger punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge Harley grabbed her and put a heavy arm over her shoulder, whispering, \"Just follow my lead and keep quiet.\" Harley had no trouble with staying quiet, though her gag reflex was a different matter; Large Harley's armpit was right by her head, and all the leather and spandex in the world couldn't keep the odor from staying in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley didn't focus on what her corpulent counterpart was doing compared to holding her breath, but somehow they got through the doors and were quickly escorted to a booth. When Harley was free of her companion's fleshy prison, she took a massive gulp of air. Big mistake. The stench of the outside was even more overpowering here, and she could hardly breathe without trying to not throw up. Big Harley, meanwhile was having the time of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you're gagging at <i>this</i>?! You can't be serious! If this is bad for you, then I'd hate to see you in my bathroom the day after One Buck Burrito night!\" she snorted before launching into another fit of flatulent giggles. When it died down, she resumed talking, \"I already ordered us the three-course special. Believe me, you'll love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the conversation died down significantly, with the silence occasionally being broken by gas escaping from one of Large Harley's ends. Thin Harley was bored out of her skull; there were no napkins to tear, silverware to throw at people, plates to spin (and promptly break), or menus to read the fine print of. The only other thing on the table was a bowl full of cake-like sugary bread rolls stewing in melted butter. Harley had stopped after a couple bites, but her fat friend had already eaten half the basket and began pouring butter into her overflowing mouth, rendering her spandex-clad front a little too transparent for Harley's tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Harley said, attempting to broach the awkward silence, \"how did everything get to become so, ya'know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big?\" Large Harley aptly replied. \"Well, I'd say it all started, I dunno, twenty or thirty years ago. I mean, when I was younger, everyone was still pretty thin. Then, I guess bein' fat just started becoming popular, then just normal. When I went into high school, I was 150 pounds. When I graduated, I was just over 200. Almost 300 when I met Mister J, and now, I'd say I'm easily past 500. I was around 400 or so for most of my life, but then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley, now engrossed in this weird world, eagerly asked \"...and then what? C'mon, tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge Harley sighed (which was cut off prematurely by a burp), \"<b>It</b> happened. It all started when-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say another word, a massive waitress on a motor scooter with a body like Jabba's and hair like Chewbacca's rolled up and placed two massive soup-tureens that rested on her belly up on the table. \"Order up! Special, first course, two servings!\" Without another word, she sped off back to the kitchens. Harley wasn't sure whether the puttering noise was from the cart or from her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley cautiously lifted the lid off and wanted to gag. Inside was a churning pool of what looked like half-congealed fryer oil, its surface obscured with lumps of fried dough, mystery meat, and a few unidentified white globs. Once again, Large Harley saw her smaller self's reaction and had another laugh at her reaction. \"What, you've never seen melted lard mixed with mayo before? That's a piece of deep-fried chocolate cake, that's some mozzarella, and the meat? I wanna say it's beef. I dunno, they change it every week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fears (very slightly) assuaged, Harley nervously leaned over, filled her ladle-sized spoon, and apprehensively took a sip. Her tongue felt like it had been taken a wrong turn down an alley, got whacked by a stick of butter, and was robbed of all its tastebuds. The flavors were so powerful and overwhelming it was as if they canceled each other out, leaving only a vaguely buttery taste. A glance across the table showed her large counterpart earning her name, desperately slurping down soup and picking out floating chunks of food with her bare hands. Harley didn't want to be rude; her friend (for lack of a better word) had arranged this all, and she didn't want to make her bad or seem even more out of place than she was already. <i>Besides,</i> she thought, <i>how much damage can another sip do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley moaned in a combination of pain and ecstasy, her hands rubbing her swollen midsection. She hadn't packed away the soup like her larger self, but a good third of it was empty and all the chunks of food were picked out. She didn't necessarily <i>want</i> to feel like she was pregnant with triplets, but a combination of interdimensional peer pressure and a bit of actual hunger forced her to each as much as she physically could without being sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley glanced down at her swollen stomach. It only peaked out several inches, but as far as she concerned, she might as well be carrying a boulder in her belly. \"Oh god,\" she mumbled, her eyelids fluttering a bit. \"I'd say I <i>definitely</i> overdid it. Food wins.\" The ladle slipped out of her hands with a clatter and Harley closed her eyes, listening for a moment to the sounds of her larger self pouring the remaining contents of Harley's soup-tureen into her own.</span></div></div>",

Harley nodded in agreement and her fat self picked her up and hid her in her extra-large bra so she wouldnt be caught by the waitresses. They both made their way to the bathrooms(Which stank to high heaven because of all the flatulent slobgirls who ate here), and took two stalls next to each other. Little Harley sighed in relief when she finally got to piss out all that soda she had been chugging to wash down the food. Meanwhile Big Harley was overflowing the toilet and pissing onto the floor with her oversized bladder full of fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shits started soon after, and they hit hard.

Happens to the best of us. Took me some time before this big ol\u2019 paunch of mine could hold its food,\u201d Large Harley gave her flabby stomach a few good pats and shakes, showing her smaller self the result of years of gluttony. As if awakened from by its owner, her stomach emitted a deafening growl. Both Harleys watched the roaring gut jiggled through the food-strained spandex before Big Harley laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of my stomach, \u2018bout time we get back to stuffing our faces.\u201d she placed her smaller counterpart back in her bra and left the bathroom. She made it to her booth just as the massive waitress arrived with the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecial, second course, two servings!\u201d she placed the food on the table and sped away, leaving a trail of flatulence sputtering from her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge Harley was ready to scarf down her meal when she felt something squirming in her chest. \u201cOh right.\u201d Reaching into her bra, she pulled out her smaller self who was gasping for air. \u201cSorry, guess I had food on the brain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley grabbed the table\u2019s edge for support as she slowly walked to the other side of the booth. Her body reeked of her fatter counterpart\u2019s horrible odor while her face glistens from the sweat of Large Harley\u2019s breasts. \u201cJeez, just how heavy are those things? I was almost squished by them!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, if there\u2019s one thing the girls ain\u2019t, it\u2019s light.\u201d Big Harley shook her bountiful boobs. \u201cBesides, it was the only place I could think of to keep you hidden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep me hidden from what? Just what\u2019s so different about your world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge Harley looked around, making sure no one was listening before she spoked in a quiet manner. \u201cListen, I can\u2019t say much, but it\u2019s for your safety. The fewer people that see you, the better. When we get to my home, I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley nodded but before she could ask anything else, Large Harley\u2019s gut roared once again, breaking the tension between them. The fatter blonde of the duo grinned sheepishly and rubbed her angry belly. \u201cBut first, let\u2019s finish eating. I\u2019m practically wasting away here.\u201d She handed her smaller self a plate and then proceeded to chow down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Harley stared wide-eyed at her meal: A quadruple burger loaded with bacon, onions, red and green peppers, BBQ sauce, jalape\u00f1os, and melted cheddar cheese oozing from the sides; Accompanying the burger were a side of chili fries and onion rings.  Like a pillar, it towered on the plate, almost taunting the thin blonde to eat it. In midst of her eating, Large Harley noticed her smaller self\u2019s expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not afraid of some burger, are you?\u201d Large Harley asked playfully before she belched loudly. \u201cJust clamp it down and bite it.\u201d To highlight her point, she took a chomp of the burger. She smiled smugly, her lips smeared with BBQ sauce and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching her fat friend\u2019s demonstration, Harley grabbed the rather intimidating burger. <i>At least it\u2019s more appealing than the soup\u2026 and probably just as filling too,</i> she thought. She opened her mouth as wide as possible and bit the burger. Her tongue was met with an overwhelming spicy flavor, causing her to drop the burger and fanned her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops, forget to mention the jalape\u00f1os have a bit of a kick,\u201d Large Harley said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask for some sodas for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their drinks arrived, the Harleys resumed eating. Big Harley scarfed down her food, only pausing for a drink or expelling gas from either end. Little Harley, however, at a more reasonable pace, though the food was taking its toll on her. The burger was so thick and greasy that even chewing it became a hassle. Her distended stomach, still digesting the soup, bulged as she ate through her burger while taking sips of her heavily carbonated soda; she placed a hand on her belly as gas brewed inside it. <i>Ooh, even in my stomach, this burger still giving me problems. It\u2019s lucky it\u2019s a damn good burger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Little Harley, belly filled and swollen with a burger, soda, and a couple of onion rings, pushed away her plate and leaned back into the booth. She cradled her bowling ball sized stomach; it might as well be a bowling ball, considering how heavy it felt on Harley\u2019s lap as it gurgled and bubbled. She moaned before a burp escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 how was it?\u201d Large Harley asked, taking the rest of her smaller self\u2019s chili fries and onion rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh, way\u2026 way better than the soup,\u201d Harley said, tending to her aching food baby. \u201cSo much food. I won\u2019t be eating anytime soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hate to burst your bubble, but there\u2019s one more course left.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Oh. Yay,\u201d Harley replied sarcastically. Her food-filled belly gurgled loudly as she belched surprisingly loud before a fart blasted from her ass. She didn\u2019t bother excusing herself. She was just glad she free some space in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice one.\u201d Large Harley mockingly applauded at her smaller counterpart\u2019s gaseous display. She giggled and reached for a handful of onion rings when she noticed\u2026</span></div></div>",

Take today for example, she and the Joker were planning to nuke Metropolis until the Justice League showed up. She was getting their getaway car prepped when all of a sudden there was a bright light and she was whisked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she found herself in a strange, familiar looking city. It looked like Metropolis, only it was night time and more importantly, it lush with greenery and plant life. The sidewalks were overgrown with grass and weeds, large stalks of vines were wrapped around buildings, beautiful gardens have overtaken the rubble of buildings. All Harley could say was, \"Sheesh, who turned the urban jungle into a literal one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly she knew the one person that could be behind this. \"This has to get to be Red's doing. Guess I should go pay her a visit.\" Harley headed down the sidewalk, unaware that a peculiar plant seemed to be watching her. From the looks of it Harley seemed to be in the slums of town. When she did find people, they were enormous! They had to be at least 400-500 pound. Most of them gave her an odd look before going back to their own business  shuffling as fast as they could away from her. Another thing she noticed was the smell. It's like the whole city cut the cheese and never stopped ripping. Then there were the strange, foul smelling dumpsters seemingly on every corner labeled 'Manure Dropoff'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stopped to assess the situation, one of the vines from a nearby streetlamp snaked down and wrapped around her pulling her up by her feet. She yelped and found herself dangling upside down. What's worse, just as she reached for the knife hidden in her boot, she could hear the familiar sirens of an approaching cop car. \"Ah crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding the knife behind her back, she watched as the cop car came to a halt. What seemed unusual to her though was that given her numerous experiences riding in the backseat of a paddywagon, this one seemed wider than usual. It soon made sense when two obese women stepped out in green uniforms. They looked more like sumo wrestlers than cops but they were eyeing Harley like they were on the beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know, they weren't kidding when they reported an actual clown running around here. Looks like you owe me dinner, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I know. Alright Stick, you've got some explaining to do?\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone needed an explanation, it was Harley. What happened to the city? Why were these lardasses so fat? Where was her Puddin? She had a feeling they wouldn't tell her if she asked nicely. Still clutching her knife, she considered cutting herself loose and beating the answers out of these pigs or making a break for it. Or she could let them take her in and go to the source. Knowing Joker, he'd break her out the moment he found out someone took his favorite gal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Then it occurred to Harley that her Puddin' might be upset that he had to save her once again so she decided to handle this matter on her own. She got to work cutting the vines holding her up and stalled the cops for now. \"Okay officers, ya got me. Please be gentle. I don't think my teeny tiny body is a match for your big, mighty bodies.\" She said in the meakest voice she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right! I bet you'd snap like a twig under my ass.\" The one called Sarah said. \"Maybe we should find out~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go easy on the kid. She probably got roped into one of those Stick gangs or something.\" The other cop mentioned. \"Besides, the chief told you we can't do that no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on Lena, we haven't had a perp to bust in weeks! Just let me have a little fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as she said that, Harley finished slicing through the vines and dropped down. She grabbed the cut vine and used it to swing over like Tarzan and kick Sarah in the face. The cop staggered back as Harley released her grip and went after the other cop. The clown used her face as a  dismount and backflipped onto the ground. While Sarah recovered from the kick, Harley sweeped her leg and sent the blob falling face first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lena pulled out her tazer and charged at the second banana. She thrust her arm out but Harley sidestepped her and landed a couple punches on her. Due to her bulking physique, the flab absorbed much of the force. Lena was pissed now as Sarah struggled to push herself back up. Harley backflipped onto the top of the car and hopped onto the other side, forcing Lena to chase after her. Seeing as her partner wasn't getting up anytime soon, Harley started cartwheeling just out of reach and let the cop chase after her until she tired herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a minute to reduce Lena to a sweating, panting mess. Making it all the more easier for Harley to sock her in the face and have her fall on her ass right on top of Sarah with an OOF!  Her tazer clattered on the ground and Harley picked it up. As the two cops groaned, Harley stood over them grinning like a madwoman. \"Night night, ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then zapped the two at full power, knocking the cops out. She then turned off the tazer and blew some smoke off it as if it were a gun. She pocketed it for now and reveled in her victory, doing a little dance for no one in particular. But then she remembered that she still had no clue what was going on and that these two were out of commission, she couldn't ask them squat. \"Doh! Good one Harleen. Now what am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she realized that the cop car was still unlocked and the keys still in the ignition. \"Maybe this wasn't a total loss after all...\" As the cogs in her head started spinning, she stripped the officers of their clothes and valuables, leaving them in their bra and panties. As tempted as she was to leave them, even she wasn't so cruel as to leave these unconscious girls alone in this part of town. Besides, she still needed answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she slowly lugged the two into the back of the car, grunting as she looped her arms under theirs and put them in the back. Seeing their ample endowments did make her feel a little self-conscious though but she told herself that at least she still had her figure. Once Sarah and Lena were stuffed in the back, Harley got into the driver's seat and noticed an open box of donuts. Feeling a but peckish, she helped herself to one and revved up the car. She drove off into the city, turning on the police radio to hear if there was any word about the Joker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the livelier sections of town, she noticed that everyone had put on some pounds. There wasn't a single person that was under 400 pounds and every single face was chowimg dowm on something. Everything seemed focused on obesity and getting bigger. Another thing she noticed was the abundance of plant life and greenery. The urban jungle looked like an actual jungle, with vines and flowers covering every building. Harley had a feeling this was Ivy's doing but there was still a lot of gaps to fill. Speaking of gaps, when she reached into the donut box she got nothing but air. Apparently she had eaten the entire box clean. Resulting  in a tiny but noticeable belly bump covered in crumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley needed answers right away before she wound up like everyone else. She had to do something other than drive around town.</span></div></div>",
