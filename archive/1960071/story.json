Yesterday she had received an envelope addressed to her from a modelling fashion agency looking for people to fill in the role. It had been her dream to be a fashion designer/model ever since she was very young. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reading the letter, she decided to take a shot at it. She came dressed in her best designer clothes with her design sketch book in one hand and a latte she picked up on the way their in the other. Looking up at the clock it read 9:15 The time of the audition was 10:15 am. Blythe had arrived early. She had one hour to spare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ones here yet.\" Blythe sighed. \"Guess I'll have to pass the time before the audition starts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a fold up chair, she sat down and started sketching ideas in her book. This went on for five minutes until she heard a low growl noise. It was her stomach. In all the rush to get here on time, she hadn't had any breakfast. Blythe eyed a food table over the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table lay an assortment sugary treats and a small bowl of fruits. Cakes, pies, tarts, cookies, doughnuts and other delicious pastries. Blythe found this a bit odd at first. It was not common that most models indulge themselves with various junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGROWL! Clenching her stomach with hand, Blythe decided to get a closer look. Moving towards the spread her mouth started to water a little. \"Maybe, I'll have a small snack while I wait.\" Blythe reached over and grabbed... </span></div></div>",

Her hair, her eyeshadow, and now there was what she just did. Insulting some random girl just because the Biskit Twins were as well. She had even given a small snort. How did she ever let things get this far, how she become so blinded by all of the expensive gifts and kindness the two had been giving her? Sure she loved every gift they gave her and some small part of her enjoy how fun it felt to just insult people along with the Biskits, but still. Here they were just insulting one of her best friends and encouraging her to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's my friend, my real friend you're insulting. So cut it out.\" Blythe finished her retort with certainty. There was no doubt in her mind her \"short-term\" friendship with the sisters was through. When she had even first met them, the two had made it perfectly clear that they hated being told no. Yet as she stared in the faces of Britney and Whitney, thier eyes portrayed something other than rage. She couldn't quite tell what it was as it was hidden behind the girl's usual look of indifference, but it wasn't rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, like, know what Blythe? I guess you're...sorta kinda right.\" Britney glanced back as Whitney placed a hand on Blythe's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More for the fact that you're, like, our BFF.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe knew something was up, the way these girls were acting was just not right. She shook the brat's hand off her shoulder. \"Well I'm not going to be if your're gonna, like, insult my friends.\" Blythe kicked herself for that like, hanging around these girls was poisoning her language as well as her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on girl. After everything we've done for you? All of our nice gifts we gave you?\" Britney and Whitney closed in on Blythe, each taking hold of one arm. \"Even our special poses? You're like, the first person we've ever been so close to. Come on, give us another chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe would never admit it, but seeing and hearing these girls so desperate for her gave her satisfaction. And yeah, the touchscreen, the shopping trips, she loved it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, tell you what.\" Brittney got in even closer. \"Let's like, make it up to you. Whitney and I were planning on going to a special little place tonight.\" Her voice came with such a smooth tone, contrasting with her normal goth tone ao well. \"And I think Whitney and I would just love if our best friend came with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Yeah.\" Whitney joined her sister, the two almost smothering Blyth with affection. \"And nobody, but nobody else has ever been with us there.\" Whitney pulled a card from her pocket, placing it in Blythe's hand. \"Just come to the place on the card after work. We just know this whole incident will be forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe did pay attention to the Biskits' pleas, but her eyes were now focused on the girl who had started this issue. She must have seen the Biskits being so affectionate because she just up and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghh, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In her mind, she knew this was a bad idea. She didn't even tell the let's about all of this, hard as it was to hide due to her never taking off the makeup and clothes Britney and Whitney got her. She walked the streets, looking to the card they had slipped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Upper Crust's Berry Center</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from a big blueberry on the middle of the cards, there was nothing too special about it. Certainly not the Biskit Twins style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Hey Blythe!\" Speaking of whom, Britney and Whitney waved to Bylthe as they leaned against a blue painted door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better be good girls.\" Bylthe honestly couldn't tell if the disinterest in her voice was really her own or if the influence of the twins was still in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney gave a series of knocks on the door while Britney said \"Biskit Twins plus one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, the door opened.</span></div></div>",

The decor of the building itself was nothing too surprising for her, considering her knowledge of the Biskit Twins. High quality marble with columns reaching to the ceiling, yet the whole building was decked out with top of the line technology. Off in the center was a rounded area, with so many drinks stored up behind the counter that Blythe could only assume it was a bar. But what really caught her attention were the Parton's that walked, or in some cases rolled about the place. Mostly female people with snooty expressions similar to the twins were dotted all around. Thier skin  was all sorts of shades of blue and purple and many had stomachs extended to the point they could hardly walk. For clothes, many were wearing togas covering up all of the body, but it didn't stop Blythe from blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Welcome to Upper Crust's Berry Center.\" Whitney pushed Bylthe into the shop as Britney closed the door behind then. \"This little place is a perfect juicy hangout for...like, folks who can dih out the cash for it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Whitney's grip on her so tight, Bylthe couldn't really move away as she was pushed past multiple patrons as they either gave nods to the twins or stared at her with the kind of superiority the twins often gave her. At least before they were trying so hard to make her thier friend. \"And you've brought me here because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust us Blythe. One night of being of berry is gonna make you see that we're the bestest besties a girl like you could ever have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the rounded bar was a woman coated in blue, her hair tied and bunched to look like a bunch of grapes. Upon seeing the girls, she smiled. \"Ah, two of my favorite customers. I was worried you were going to miss tonight's party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, not tonight Miss Crust.\" Britney motioned to Blythe as if displaying a trophy. \"This is our new BFF and we're giving her the best night she's ever had to make sure she knows it. And, like, don't worry...\" She pulled out a blue card from her pocket. \"We're still gonna give our own little donation when this is all said and done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpper Crust leaned in towards Blythe, causing the girl to smell berries on her breathe. \"Well, she is certainly looking the part. So girls, how do you intend to do the changing tonight?\"</span></div></div>",

Giving two good shakes before pouring the unknown substance into a mock martini glass, with a blueberry on a tooth pick instead of an olive. Handing it over to a Blythe who was looking slightly sceptical at the beverage presented to her. Catching her gaze Miss Crust whispered gently into Blythe's ear. \"Don't worry honey, it's all non alcoholic.\" The aroma of berries coated her nose. Leaning back she placed a bowl of berries down, before turning to cater the other customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you have got to try Miss Crust's Blueberry Special, it's totally delicious.\" Whitney placing the glass into Blythe's hand. Reacting slowing she limply gripped the glass between her palms. Hesitating Blythe looked at both Biskits on either side of her, smiling sweetly while watching in wide eye anticipation. Something doesn't feel right about this, Blythe thought. Turning back to her drink she gave it a closer look. Maybe she was just being paranoid. Shrugging it off, she took a small sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the juice hit her lips and passed down her tongue, her eyes lit up. This was the tastiest drink she has ever had in her life! A smile crossed her face as she paused to let an \"ah\" of pure ecstasy. \"Wow, you guys weren't kidding!\" Blythe exclaimed. \"We know right, it's like, the best.\" Britney says putting an over her shoulder. \"And only the best, for our best-est BFF.\" Whitney added following suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe smiled at the the two twins, perhaps they were being sincere with her for once. She took another hearty drink of her blueberry cocktail. Noticing her glass was almost empty, Britney called out \"Hey Miss Crust, how about, like, two more shots here?\" Blythe piped up slightly before motioning with her fingers. \"Make that three!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while enjoying this, Blythe failed to notice certain changes to her...</span></div></div>",

The area around her mouth, especially the spots not already coated with makeup, were changing shade into a bluish tone. And as she kept drinking, the blue continued to spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor minutes on minutes, Blythe continued drinking. Almost internally competing with the Biskit twins to see who could drink the most of these heavenly blueberry drinks. Grabbing a few blueberries from the bowl Miss Crust had set out, Blythe gobbled them all down as the Biskit twins laughed. Normally, the two girls laughing would have brought some annoyance to Blythe, but the delicious sensations she was feeling were slowly overtaking her previous resentments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny girls?\" Blythe turned to the sisters, quickly shocked to see thier whole heads were turning blue. \"What...whats going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it works faster if you've transformed before.\" Brittney said as Whitney pulled out a mirror, Showing off the growing circle of blue that had enveloped Blythe's boss and was continuing to slowly spread across her face. \"Though you're taking to it quite nicely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe stared at her face, touching the blue to see if it wasn't just juice.

Her face now completely coated in blue and spreading down her neck.  She looked at both twins who followed suit. They didn't seem to be phased by this at all. Noticing their BFF was starting to freak out, Brittney and Whitney decided to put her mind at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you see Blythe, this is a special sort of transformation we like, like to undertake once in a blue moon.\" Britney chuckled at her own pun. \"We like, like being turned into blueberries.\" Whitney giggled along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Blythe's mind was running through a thousand thoughts. They're turning into blueberries? They've done this before? How is this even happening? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look we know your, like, new to this whole berry thing?\" Britney putting a hand under her chin, she moved up her gaping jaw. \"But don't worry, this is all going to be alright. Like, being berry is totally worth it! Your the first person we ever invited to be berry with us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about Britney's calm words and smile reassured her. They said they had done this before after all. And they still looked normal at the end of it. Perhaps being berry isn't so bad. Regaining her confidence she resumed chugging down blueberry juice heartily. The Biskits gave a little cheer before joining along with her. Soon Blythe's entire skin and hair were blueberry blue. Suddenly she felt her body start to change. </span></div></div>",

Her fancy designer shirt was already starting to strain slightly as her belly kept growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe laid her hands, in awe of her occuring growth. The calmness from her bff's replacing whatever fear was still inside her with excitement. This was a completely new experience to her, not to mention a pleasureable one. Her stomach continued to grow, every little movement causing it to jiggle and slosh about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, there you go.\" Whitney took note of Blythe's smile as her own stomach started growing. \"A nice big blueberry belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike all those, like, large kids at school though, this is cool, right BFF?\" Britney continued drinking and eating, while Blythe nodded her blue head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yeah, those loosers wish they could experience something as cool as this.\" Maybe it was just the pleasure of her stomach now growing enough that some of it was poking from under her shirt, but Bylthe felt no shame in talking like the girls on this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpper Crust soon came to the girls' side of the bar and gave the trio a good look before setting three cloaks down. \"It's good to see you girls enjoying yourselves.

Blythe compelety unaware of the Biskits plans to brainwash her, was starting to decline from her normal personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of growing up from a rich family as a spoiled brat, her father pampering with gifts and adorable pure breed pets. Remembered first meeting Brittany and Whitney as playmates due to their families being in business with each other. She thought they were the coolest people alive and wanted to follow in their footsteps. Whatever latest fashion trends they followed, so did she. Whenever they wanted to do something with her, she would too. Even their uniforms and hairstyle matched. Most people confused them as triplets. The Biskit Triplets, it had a nice ring to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the door, Blythe and Biskits stepped into a luxury bedroom. Complete with a queen sized round bed, walk in wardrobe, large bathroom, a giant blue lava lamp, jumbo flatscreen TV and a telephone on the side for room service. The room had an all and all 60's hippie vibe to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off their cloaks revealing strained beachball stomachs over their designer clothes. Belly buttons poking out like a cork. Blythe grabbed two hand fulls of her berry gut, smiling as she jiggled it up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, BFF what do you wanna do now?\" Brittany asked. </span></div></div>",

The last thing I want is having these totally cool outfits my BFFs  bought me, like, ripped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, totally read your mind there.\" Whitney reached for her jacket, struggling to take it off. \"I mean we can always just, like, buy more, but why bother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding.\" Brittney said as she gave her own blue gut a nice wiggle. \"Especially when Upper Crust gives us an entire wardrobe of togas and loose fitting stuff to wear while we berry out.\" Brittney pointed towards said wardrobe. The newly formed Biskit Triplets walked into the small room, everything just as Brittney described. There were even a few walls to change behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Blythe said, her manufactured memories flashing in and out. \"Like, I remember having a closet like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah girl.\" Brittney said from behind a changing wall as she grabbed a pink toga from the side. \"We would practically spend, like, whole sleepovers just in that closet of yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney followed in her sister's choice, pinking out another pink toga as she tossed her clothes to the side. \"The maid will pick them up. But yeah Blythe, it's a shame your dad, like, left you alone with that dork of an uncle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe, grabbing a pink toga like her friends ,felt a two he as her false memories clashed with her new ones, trying to gain control back from the bratty Biskits. \"Like, I have an uncle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't you like remember?\" Brittney was posing her toga in front of the mirror. \"You called us your dad suddenly became such a jerk. He gave you such a ride dressing down about how he 'couldn't take your brattyness' and how you 'needed to learn life' or whatever drabery he told you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe's real memories tried to fight, but the feeling of her berry belly washed it all away. She remembered night crying into the shoulders of her friends, lamenting her fancyness all washed away. Ever the cool friends that they were, the Biskit's stood by her side, vowing that they would (make sure thier father would) help Blythe get the rich, spoiled pampered life she deserved. \"Like, yeah. I mean, I'm his daughter. It's bad enough he has to punish me for no reason, but to stick with the weakest link in our family? I mean the man is a walking car wreck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls laughed as they continued thier trying on of clothing, the trio finally deciding on a black and pink striped toga with a blue flower Brett's as accessories. The Biskit Triplets stepped out of the closet with thier heads held high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, like, don't know about you girls...\" Brittney looked down to her belly. \"But want to keep this growth going. If we wanna, like, cheer Blythe up after that depressing rememberance, we need to get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney and Blythe agreed with Brittney, ea ch rushing to the phone for room service.</span></div></div>",

Cupcakes, pies, cakes, milkshakes, ice cream, muffins and other foods. All which had had one key ingredient. Blueberries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't eat slobbery, but they still ate with such gluttony that it would have been quite a sight. At one point Brittany and Whitney began feeding Blythe themselves. Playfully dangling blueberry grapes over her wide open mouth. The scene looked like something out of an old Greek or Roman portrait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe at this point had lost all her real memories and had become practically hooked on being berry. Her stomach began to blow up at an incredible rate. Pretty soon her front began overlapping the rest of her small body. She felt her cheeks become bloated and blueberry drizzling out her mouth onto her double chins. Her once small unnoticeable butt cheeks, became to large beach balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany and Whitney smiled at Blythe's transformation, this had turned out better then they expected. Finally after polishing off what seemed like hours of gorging, the Biskits and Blythe both completely stuffed to the brim. Nothing was left except a few crumbs on the silverware. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sitting on the bed, piled next to each other now resembled large blueberries. Their stomachs showing under their togas. Arms and legs like little chubby stubs sticking out. On top the heads now neckless barley visible above their rising chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a gurgle erupted from Blythe's gigantic gut, letting out a loud \"BUUURRRRPPPP!!!!\" \"Uph, Like excuse me.\" Blythe giggled. \"Like no, BURP! Problem BFF.\" Brittany said. \"Yeah, Like after all, HIC! it's ok to Like, BURP! be a little impolite.\" Whitney agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling the three giggled at their own \"joke\". Blythe then felt a vibrating underneath her. Looking around lazily she picked up the source. Her mobile phone was ringing, under one of her layers of berry fat. \"Ahh, like guys? Like, my phone is like stuck.\" Whitney using her pudgy fingers into Blythe's fold, managed to pull out the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney eyed the caller ID saying \"Hey, like Blythe...\" </span></div></div>",

All of her former friends she now saw as looser, lower class twits that only wanted to mooch off her and her friend's money. \"Of course one of those have to call when I'm having fun with my best friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you, like, want us to tell them off for you BFF?\" Britney eyed Whitney with an excited face, and she gave her the same. This was thier chance to see if thier plan worked, if all the pampering and brainwashing worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe shook her head, sending blueberry juice around the room. \"Like, no way girl. I've had it up to...well you know. I'm gonna give those moochers like, one hell of a message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Biskits winked to one another before tossing the phone to Blythe. The device came to rest perfectly on her double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Blythe, are you there?\" That scared little voice had to be Song's, she always was a little fraidy cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You called, like, my phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, look. I wanted to check up on you. Part of me wants to say sorry for the way Sue and I acted back at school, but I got a message from her with a very interesting picture. Of you with the Biskits and dressing like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I do with my friends is my own business and that little wallflower needs to learn privacy. I mean, she probably should considering how she looks.\" Blythe ended that retort with a snorting giggle, much to audible displeasure of those on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah Blythe. That was just rude. And, really? Friends? The Biskits?\" That had to be Jasper, he always spoke in that kind of 'I'm funny but not really I only think I'm funny' way. \"From what the girls told me, they only just started acting nice to you and showering you with gifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Can't you see that they're just bribing you? The minute you stop acting like them and come to your senses, they're just gonna drop you like a hot rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind Blythe's berry body, the Biskits snickered. \"I think it's, like, way past that point.\" Whitney licked a little blueberry juice from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny you two are the ones talking about being friends only for the benifits. The Biskits have been my friends for, like, ever. You and rest of those loosers back at school were only using me because of my own rich life. I guess when Daddy cut me off, you thought I would just magically lower myself to you lot, but I ,like, know my friends and they are right here beside me. You, like, getting this? The Biskits are the only friends I have and the only ones I, like, need. I don't know how you got my number, but get your looser number off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over to Blythe, Brittney pressed her phone off and nudged it off Blythe's big blue chi. \"Like, wow. That was some, like, grade A rage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe looked to her friend, her face portraying the same indifference that was the default for either Biskit sister. \"Well, those little dweebs asked for it. Trying to turn me away from my BFFs. The only ones I need for that matter.\" Blythe leaned into Brittney, who gave Whitney the biggest grin and got one right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked. Of course it would worked, but it worked. Blythe was now thiers. She was perfect, a molded image of them. If only in looks and personality.</span></div></div>",

Looking down at herself, Blythe saw something was indeed going on with her rear end. Getting out of the chair, she could more clearly feel as it kept growing and growing. With every move she made, her butt started to wobble about, the slightest sound of juice sloshing about echoing from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this is what berry transforming is?\" Blythe allowed that like, the Biskit's little consolation from earlier keeping her confidence. She was worried or anything of the sort, but why her butt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends, sometimes it starts there, other times it can, like, start elsewhere.\" Whitney slapped her stomach, drawing attention to the growth it was going under with juice more clearly sounding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney kept her attention to her breasts as they were starting to push into her shirt. \"Yeah, but no matter where it starts, it, like, is always super pleasurable. The kind of pleasure you certainly wouldn't get with those looser, former friends of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it looked like Blythe was keeping her attention on her ever growing rear, a small pang of guilt was running though her. A part of her just still couldn't believe she was hanging out with the girls that had insulted her friend. And furthermore, why were they so intent on saying they were her only friend? With how the girls acted towards people it should seem the other way around. But Blythe had to admit, between the expensive gifts, the special treatment, and the pleasure of the growth started becoming pronounced, she was having a harder and harder time saying they weren't her friends. She just didn't want the pleasure to stop.</span></div></div>",
