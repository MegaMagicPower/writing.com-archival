            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Omega. The galactic centre of crime and injustice. And you, of all people, are one of those who call this place \"home\".<br>\r\n     It was just an ordinary day for you. You were walking home through an alley after finishing up everything in the shop. You were sick of your boss's demands. The conditions were horrible, especially for such low salary. But you had no choice. You had to earn your living. Even though you could barely do it. You always wanted to leave Omega to never return again.<br>\r\n     Just as you took another turn, you heard a sudden zap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     -A few minutes earlier-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Two batarians were standing in a dark corner talking...<br>\r\n\"So what's this?\" One of them asked.<br>\r\n\"A shrink ray.\" The other one answered \"I snached it yesterday from some careless salarian.\"<br>\r\n\"A shrink ray, huh? Shall we test it?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure! But on whom?\" the second batarian wondered.<br>\r\n\"Maybe on that pathetic human?\" he said pointing at you, as you were passing by.<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" the batarian with the shrink ray said firing it at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Suddenly the surroundings around you started growing. \"What the hell?\" you thought. It was only after you turned around that you realized that you shrank!<br>\r\n     Two huge batarian figuires were towering over your tiny body.<br>\r\n\"So what are we gonna do with him?\" one of them said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"We can sell him for some extra credits\" the other one answred casually.<br>\r\n\"S-s-sell me? Wait! You can't do tha-\" you were trying to say.<br>\r\n\"Quiet, human!\" the batarian said angrily.<br>\r\n     Suddenly the the other batarian's head exploded in a perfect headshot. The other batarian soon followed his buddy dropping you down. But as you were about to hit the ground a three-fingered hand caught you. You looked up to see a blue-marked turian face.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" your saviour asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" you said looking up at the turian.<br>\r\n\"But, don't you think killing them was a little extreme?\" you asked almost sorry for the batarians.<br>\r\n\"They're highly dangerous criminals. They deserve it.\" he said firmly. \"So, how did you get this small?\"<br>\r\n\"I uhh... I actually don't know. I was just walking home when I realized I was shrinking.\"<br>\r\nTh turian turned around to look at the motionless batarians.<br>\r\n\"Hmm... what's this?\" he said, picking a gun from under on of the dead bodies. \"It looks like some kind of a gun.\" he went on. \"Shrink. Grow.\" he read on the gun. He tried firing it. But it just made a wierd sound and emited some smoke. \"Guess it no longer works.\" he said looking at you. \"Well, I can't just leave you here like this. You're gonna be coming with me.\"<br>\r\n\"Seems like I have no other choice.\" you noticed \"It's not like I'm against the idea either.\"<br>\r\n\"Good to hear. By the way name's Garrus Vakarian. Just call me Garrus.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! By the way, where are we going?\"<br>\r\n\"Right now we're headed...\"</span></div></div>",

We were just about to head back to The Normandy.\" the comander said as a massive krogan came up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later Garrus took you out of his pocket. You were in a big room filled with red light and various technical devices you didn't bother to study. Garrus put you on a table next to his probable workspace.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to The Normandy's main battery\" he said with a slight laugh.<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" you said. \"But tell me, was that Comander Shepard back at Omega? I thought he was dead.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he was...\" Garrus answered vaguely. \"Now please, make yourself at home.\" he said with a smile. \"I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\nHe left the room and the door closed behind him. You looked around. The room wasn't too big. Well, for you it was, but not at your actual size. Most of the space was taken by various machines that produced quiet but steady humming. There was a odd-shaped bed next to the table, probably specially designed for turians. There also was a small window lookg out intoithe starry void of space. All in all it was quite practical and comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus was back in a few minutes with a tiny bed in his hands. He put it on the table next to you and said: \"Here you go. You must be tired of all that happened.\"<br>\r\n\"You're not considering me your pet, are you?\" you asked looking at the turian questioningly.<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" he exclaimed. \"I just wanted to make everything easier for you, little guy\" he added giving you another smile.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Thank you. And actually...\"</span></div></div>",

It was surprisingly comfortable. At least a lot more comfortable than the beds on Omega. You were slowly drifting to sleep and enjoying the last moments before sweet dreams hit you. You were very happy. Although you were shrunk, you didn't mind it. In fact, you were enjoying yourself. Especially since a giant turian was taking care of you. And, most importantly, you were out of Omega! And with these happy thoughts in mind you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up later and found Garrus...</span></div></div>",
