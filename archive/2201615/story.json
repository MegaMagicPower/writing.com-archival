I have seen hedonistic Eldar gorge themselves to oblivion. I have seen cults of Slaanesh bestow their strange 'gifts' upon innocent women. I have seen genetic abominations far and wide, Xenos Tech-heresy and Chaos machine sorcery. To the untrained eye, these events may seem like strange, perverse anomalies in a galaxy far too bloody to care. But I am an Inquisitor, and it is my duty to look deeper, to see the pattern beneath. And I tell you, fellow inquisitors, that these events point to a disturbing fact and trend of our existence:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGluttony and Hedonism are powerful. So powerful, in fact, that it is a force in its own, agnostic of allegiances such as Loyalist or Traitor, Xenos or Human. Such depravity can strike the most loyal of Imperial soldiers, or the most perfidious of chaos-addled Xenos. The tales I have collected of these events, for the edification of other Inquisitors, and perhaps, out of my own sick curiosity and fascination, are so numerous that it was easier to divide them into categories of subject matter, and further subdivide these categories with increasing precision until the final tale was reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find before you this self-same collection, prepared for your perusal. Take heed, fellow inquisitor, for the stories contained within may yet awaken something within you as well. Indeed, though I have done my best to separate tales that single out members of the Inquisition and their allies into its own category, a startling number of these stories feature Inquisitors succumbing to this hedonistic gluttony, to the point that I could not simply bundle all of them into the same grouping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have asked the aid of my fellow inquisitors in editing and transcribing these tales into a palatable format for the reader, and I hope you find them intriguing and enlightening enough to warrant your further perusal and, perhaps, a volunteer of aid in translating and transcribing yet more of these tales. In the name of the God-Emperor of Mankind, these stories should not be forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere would you like to begin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Inquisitor Actimus Storymaker, of Osbera.</span></div></div>",

Suffice it to say not even my close colleague Amberley or one of the most esteemed regiments in the entire Astra Militarum were quite safe from this trend. I will supplement this category with extracts from the Cain Archive, as the Commissar's excellent literary stylings, as well as Amberley's interpolations, tell this tale far better than I could, even if the events take place largely on my homeworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEXTRACTED FROM THE CAIN ARCHIVE<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">The following tale is somewhat embarrassing, not only for the Valhallan 597th, who faced the brunt of the trepidation laid forth in this section from the archive, but also for myself, who was also caught up in its events. Regardless of the potential personal loss of face, however, I feel it necessary to bring this segment to light, if only as a cautionary tale about the subtle dangers that exist within the Galaxy, and how even Inquisitors are not safe if they are ever lax, even for a mere moment. I ask any readers not to judge too harshly, as I assure you that in the same situation, it would be difficult to say whether anyone would have done better. Nonetheless, I think we should begin with Cain's first observations of the Valhallan 597th's first deployment onto the world of Osbera, a planet that has known its fair share of conflict over the millennia, though this particular extract begins shortly after another extract recently released, the events of Drechia and Ironfound, some decades into Cain's association with the regiment. Needless to say that, despite whatever implications may be gleaned from the document itself, the regiment, and myself, did eventually recover, as our status in events later in the chronological turn of events obviously demonstrates. But I will concede at the time that it did seem rather hopeless. Nonetheless, I will do my typical duty and let Cain's work speak for itself, with my traditional, occasional editorial interpolations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Amberly Vail, Ordo Xenos.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgive me for stating the obvious, but I truly can't stand the agents of Chaos, particularly that vile debauched creature Slaanesh. I know of course that such is expected of me, being a hero of the Imperium and not to mention an imperial Commissar at that, and even further an occasional agent for a certain gorgeously beautiful Inquisitor, but I feel that sometimes I just simply can't emphasize that enough. The 597th's mission to Osbera was completely hectic, one of perhaps my most life-threatening encounters while assigned to the Valhallan guard regiment, and for reasons that to this day I find completely Barmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first presentiments of trouble didn't start coming until after our regiment had landed and been firmly entrenched on the place; a veritable paradise world traditionally, Osbera had been recently racked with a double-headache of both a Xenos attack (the Eldar<sup>1</sup>), and a Chaos incursion (apparently a cult of the aforementioned devious pleasurefiend). My palms began to itch just before Colonel Kasteen approached me with the news that the brilliant minds in the Munitorum had somehow managed to misplace nearly all of the regiment's ration supplies<sup>2</sup> in their organization of the deployment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well isn't that absolutely Frakked.' I cursed, walking down the ramp from our shuttle with all the Commissarial presence I could muster, passing troopers stopping occasionally to catch a glimpse of their commanding officer and the legendary hero, Ciaphas Cain disembarking. 'How are we suppposed to take back this dirtball if our men and women are starving to death?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fortunately we happen to be deployed on a Paradise world for once.' Kasteen offered, flicking through the dataslate that bore the news of the Munitorum's most recent grievous error. 'Unlike most places we get dropped, we can probably gather enough food for our troops from the surrounding environment. Osbera is famous all across the sector for its delicious food and the rapid rate at which it is produced and moved out, almost as if this were an Agri-world. About time we got this kind of posting, we could use the chance to relax a little and l've always wanted to try some local flora and fauna that won't try and kill me first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA valid enough sentiment, even if I couldn't quite consider being on a planet that included anyone trying to shoot at you relaxing, but I couldn't help but feel my palms begin to itch. And believe me, if I'd known what lay at the heart of this situation,  I'd have had more than just itching palms.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<sup>1.</sup> <i>Of the craftworld variety. Cain typically demonstrates an almost complete inability to tell the difference between Craftworld Eldar and the marauding Dark Eldar, so I felt it best to establish that fact now, especially since future events don't exactly do an excellent job of painting a clear picture.</i><br>\r\n<sup>2.</sup> <i>Yet another example of the Astra Militarum's branch of Munitorum adepts being just as efficient as any other branch's, and perhaps the event that set everything in this chronicle into motion.</i></span></div></div>",

A short while later, the first crates of fruits, vegetables, and slaughtered animals from nearby groves and farms began to be carted into the installation and preserved for use by the regiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasteen, who up until that moment had been doing the undoubtedly real work of organizing the regiment into something resembling a fighting formation for defending this position, walked up next to me as I was overseeing another shipment of food into camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The smell is certainly pleasant enough.' Kasteen cut in next to me, to which I simply nodded and adjusted my hat surreptitiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Indeed Colonel.' I responded at length as said Colonel proceeded to pick up a Ploin from a passing by cart and started juggling it in her hands. 'Fresh fruit, fresh produce, and in some cases fresh meat. Our boys' morale should stay nice and strong for the next few days, or until we start to run low again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hopefully by that point we'll not only be properly organized to make supply runs simple, but we may have gotten our own supplies from our munitorum agents, assuming they're not standing around like idiots.' As she said it, Kasteen slowly brought the Ploin to her mouth and took a bite out of it, starting the whole affair in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell alright, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it certainly feels like that first demonstrable example of the nature of the planet's Flora triggered something of a chain reaction. I didn't notice at the time, but immediately upon taking that first bite of Osberan Ploin, Kasteen's flak vest bulged ever so slightly under the outer layers of armoring she wore, her midriff becoming ever so faintly softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was just the start, believe you me, but it was at that point that my attention was pretty thoroughly distracted by the voice I could hear coming from down the ramp as someone made their way up towards me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Good afternoon Ciaphas, Colonel Kasteen.' Amberley's voice rang out, as sweet and alluring as ever<sup>3</sup>, my head snapping in her direction as soon as I heard it, conveniently missing whatever was going with Kasteen's uniform in my haste to greet the oncoming Inquisitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Amberley!' I said, striding forward to meet her at the top of the ramp up into the fortifications we had set up planetside. 'It's good to see you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you as well.' She replied, reaching out to shake my offered hand, our grips remaining clasped for just a second longer than was strictly speaking necessary, after which both of us offered a slight, nervous cough before returning to the display table Kasteen had taken a seat next to, conveniently on the opposite side from where we were standing, preventing the Inquisitor from picking up on what I'd already not noticed. Pulled up on the table, which had been set up next to the onboarding ramp to function mostly as a glorified check-in desk for any supply drops, was a rotating image of the planet dotted with symbols to represent supply lines, notable force concentrations, and other relevant tactical information about the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can see you've already wasted no time in plundering the resources you could get from this world.' Amberley noted with just a hint of bemused sarcasm as she examined the planetary display, sitting down in one of the chairs around the table while I took up the seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Earlier than we would've expected to.' I nodded, sipping at a mug of Tanna leaf tea I'd left on the table a few minutes earlier. 'Munitorum mishap. We landed, but none of our rations did, so we had to go straight to foraging. Fortunately the planet's got plenty of supplies for us, so we won't be starving to death, just got to worry about the regular getting shot and sliced up problems.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Speaking of which.' Kasteen cut in, pulling out another fruit and offering it to the inquisitor. 'Care for a ploin, Inquisitor? This planet's products are surprisingly delicious, even moreso than usual, and we just got a fresh shipment in, it'd be a shame not to try some before they get sent for preservation.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, I have noted that anything that gets 'preserved for future use' becomes almost as bland as a standard ration pack.' Amberly said, taking the offered fruit and biting into it<sup>4</sup>. 'Mmmmm, you weren't wrong about them being more delicious than usual.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must admit I probably seem irregularly dense to you, readers, because even though Amberley was sitting right beside me, I didn't notice the crimson bodyglove she normally wore faintly dome outward at the stomach just at the consumption of that single fruit. But then again, she was an Inquisitor, and someone whose temper I was readily familiar with, so I was perhaps taking extreme care not to let my gaze drop anywhere below her eyes while anyone else was around<sup>5</sup>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pleasantries aside though, Inquisitor.' I interjected while she tore into the remainder of the Ploin, and Kasteen started to dig into a second one. 'What exactly brings you to this lovely corner of space? I'm not quite sure what job an Inquisitor might need to fulfill on an open battlefield, everyone seems to be aware of what's going on.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the fruit she had been eating with almost indecent vigor, even going so far as to suckle any remaining juices off of her fingers before stifling what seemed like the most ladylike approximation of a belch I could possibly conceive of, before she responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's actually precisely the reason I'm here. The situation seems a little -too- cut-and-dried for my taste.' she noted, spinning the display round with a few twists of the knobs and dials on the table. 'The enemies you seem to be up against, a chaos cult of Slaanesh and a number of Craftworld Eldar, are making their presence known far more quickly and broadly than is typical for either group's usual mode of operation.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you're worried they've got some kind of devious plan hidden behind the bluff of an all-out invasion?' I asked, suddenly feeling like I'd just had a Valhallan shower<sup>6</sup>. It made sense. Both chaos cultists (well, those who weren't servants of Khorne anyway) and Eldar tended to be on the sneakier and trickier scale of enemies I'd had to face in my long and illustrious career. The idea that something as big as an invasion and all-out war could be a bluff however, which implied that there was something even bigger being hidden behind it, frankly terrified me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmberley nodded. 'Exactly. So I'm here along with a handful of my retinue to try and figure out what's going on behind the scenes while you and the 597th fight the main fight. Hopefully anything I find will be of assistance in the main battle anyway.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs terrifying as the revelation had been, it suddenly gave me an idea on how I could avoid ever having to deal with the front lines of this war, even after the task of sorting out supply lines had been dealt with. I stood, turned to face Amberley, and saluted, looking my most Commissarial. 'Inquisitor Vail. I'd like to request to accompany you on this task. Not only to provide my assistance, but to act as a liaison between your task and ours, to ensure that communication flows smoothly and we can properly co-ordinate our efforts.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmberley looked at me with that faint smirk that she usually got whenever she saw right through my grandstanding and false courage, and I almost expected her to decline, but after a moment she nodded. 'Alright. That sounds like an excellent idea. Unless you've got any objections, Colonel?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasteen looked between the two of us for a moment, looking as surprised as if she'd just intruded on an intimate moment, and held her hands up in a negative gesture. 'No, no, that sounds perfect.' she said, seeming oddly flustered. I took mental note of it, but honestly didn't know what to make of it. Stress, or distraction, perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right. That settles it then.' Amberley said, putting her hands on the table and pushing herself to her feet at the same moment as Kasteen did. 'Let's get to work.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was at precisely that moment, as two of the women in my life that I respected more than just about anyone short of the Emperor himself stood up, full of fire and determination to beat back the enemies of the Imperium, that I noticed the slight bulges in the bellies of both of their uniforms. The incongruity of the moment almost threatened to make me laugh, which would have been disastrous given the situation, and I stifled it with an effort, the links not quite forming in my brain just yet that this was something truly amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething must have shown on my face, however, because Amberley looked at me quizzically. 'Something the matter, Ciaphas?' she asked, prompting me to scratch the side of my head insecurely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I, uh...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<sup>3</sup><i>Flatterer.</i><br>\r\n<sup>4</sup><i>Stupid, stupid, stupid!

And I'd spent a not inconsiderable amount of effort minding my figure.</i><br>\r\n<sup>5</sup><i>So that's his excuse. I suppose trying to avoid a 'my eyes are up here' reprimand is as good an excuse as any, though I note the 'anyone else around' clause of that reasoning.</i><br>\r\n<sup>6</sup><i>Also known as being doused in ice-water.</i></span></div></div>",

The synapses in my brain I'd mentioned previously were firing now, telling me that this was definitely something that the two of them should absolutely be made aware of, as it couldn't be a sign of anything good, but at the same time my brain was running in circles trying to figure out how to word the revelation in such a way as to keep my skin in one piece after telling the Colonel of an Imperial Guard unit and an Inquisitor, of all things, that they'd suddenly gotten fat<sup>7</sup>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, lacking for any sort of remark to do the job, I resorted to simply pointing at their bellies until they got the idea and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Holy Emperor!' Kasteen swore, followed by Amberley's less than ladylike string of curses<sup>8</sup>. Hands immediately flew to stomachs, as the instinctive human reaction to confirm that the new additions were real took hold, their fingers exploring the new expanse that had been revealed. Something about the experience brought a flush to both of their faces, and I found my own skin growing hotter around the neck as well, until I issued a polite cough that brought them back to their senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well.' Amberley coughed, sitting back down, causing her new gut to protrude just past her bustline. 'This certainly bears investigating.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yes.' Kasteen growled. 'I can't wait to get my hands on whoever's responsible for this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You'll have to line up behind me. I've got Inquisitorial authority, so I get first crack.' Amberly replied, Kasteen and I being unable to tell if she was joking<sup>9</sup>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If I were to take a wild guess.' I cut in. 'I'd say it had something to do with the food on this planet. I noticed it only just after the two of you started to have those Ploins. No idea for certain though, since I've certainly already had one earlier, and aside from tasting particularly good, you can see I've had no adverse effects.' for emphasis, I patted the flat plane of my abdomen, same as it ever was, underneath my commissarial outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well that's bad.' Kasteen replied, looking at an open crate of fruit sitting across the way. 'We can't just not eat anything, our forces would starve.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Indeed. As unfortunate as it seems, it doesn't seem to affect everyone, so we'll just have to deal with it for the time being and I'll send some of the food for analysis and see what my team can come up with.' Amberley started to make her way over to the crate, picking up a few fruit and packing them away into a small container she produced from somewhere. I noticed while I was watching that she couldn't help but pick one or two up and scarf them down while she was doing so, much to the disdain of her figure<sup>10</sup>. My eyes, which had up until that moment been on the back of her head, watching her work<sup>11</sup>, slowly drifted downward as I noticed the curve of her once pert buttocks begin to swell outward with girth, her bottom slowly bulging out behind her as she occasionally snacked on some of the native cuisine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Definitely in the food.' I muttered, turning away before she noticed me looking. Once she was done with her task, she walked back over to the table, her fattened arse spreading across the seat she had previously fit squarely on as she sat. Kasteen and I refrained from comment as she sealed the container she had placed the food she hadn't managed to scarf into, setting it aside for delivery to her team, presumably Mott, her rather energetic Savant, for analysis. Once that was done, she stood up again, the belly I'd noticed earlier wobbling a bit further away from her torso than when I'd last looked. 'Let's get to work.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<sup>7</sup><i>Please, at the moment we had barely become a little chubby.

Still though, those of you with a refined appreciation for the Gothic language are still welcome to skip it.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom <i>Like a Phoenix Come to Roost: The Lesser Known Deeds of the Valhallan 597th</i> by General Jenit Sulla (retired) 103 M42<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tale I now relate to you, my dear readers, is perhaps one of the most embarrassing stories among the many exploits of the Valhallan 597th, as we were faced with a devious and unprecedented threat in the form of the very victuals provided us by the planet itself<sup>12</sup>. Some perfidious machinations had afflicted the planet's plants and animals, rendering a malicious effect upon any of the women of the regiment who were unfortunate enough to consume them. As fate would cruelly have it, through the misplacement of the regiment's rations would cause this to be the case for each of us, down to the last woman. The effects of this planet's comestibles, debilitating as they were, would have rendered the regiment completely incapacitated had it not been for their restriction only to those of us of the female persuasion. The fact that we had been formed into a mixed regiment with the aid of the legendary commissar Ciaphas Cain meant that, hindered though we had been, only half of our number had suffered any true ill effects<sup>13</sup>, and as we women suffered along, the effects having spread through the entirety of the regiment within the first twenty-four hours of our deployment, I had absolute faith in my sisters' ability to carry on through the inhibition, and in our brothers' dedication to help take up any slack provided by our sudden infirmity. We would not let the taint of this planet's foodstuffs prevent our regiment from doing battle and seeing off the enemy in the name of our Glorious emperor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first few days of affliction, the effects were merely an annoyance, as the women and men of the 597th made preparations for battle against the forces arrayed against us despite the status of half of the troopers in the regiment slowly growing more impeded by the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the celebrated Commissar, I saw little during those early days, as he had been seconded to the aid of some secret task whose details had not been furnished to the likes of myself and other officers below the ranks of Major Broklaw or Colonel kasteen. No doubt he was seeking some answers as to the source of the debilitating taint afflicting our supplies, as he so often was to be found hunting down the root of each danger he found himself in. But while he was away, our first battles were to be fought against the treacherous forces of chaos and the insidious Xenos known as Eldar. Ironically, it seemed as if the planet's unique affliction was not partisan to any particular force, as I and my troopers noted that the enemy also seemed to suffer the same ill effects as we had, their women being just as debilitated, if not moreso, for they lacked the steel determination and iron fortitude of we blessed Imperial Guardswomen, and we forced the enemy back without too much difficulty, though our trials and tribulations were as yet only beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Attentive readers who managed to struggle through that passage may note that, amusingly, Lady General Sulla never actually mentions what that debilitating affliction actually was. Apparently the pride of a General is somewhat more fragile than a Commissar or an Inquisitor.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<sup>12</sup><i>Which almost leads one to believe that the celebrated General Sulla has never heard of the concept of poisoning.</i><br>\r\n<sup>13</sup><i>At least that Sulla could see. There were certainly other effects that afflicted both the men and women of the planet, as noted later in this extract.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Amberley's decision to get to work, our first task was to meet up with her ground team and then make our way to inspect the source of our tainted rations to see if there were any clues there. My aide, Gunner Ferik Jurgen ambled up to us as we made our way out of the base, cutting the usual shabby figure he always did as he approached, preceded by his odour a good minute before he actually visually arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your quarters are all in order sir.' Jurgen said, sketching a haphazard salute as caught up to us, indicating he'd completed the task I'd sent him on earlier that morning. He offered a polite nod to Amberley. 'Miss Vail, ma'am. Good to see you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You as well Jurgen.' she replied, the faint smirk of amusement she often wore on her face as she watched him fall into step behind my shoulder as he often did. Either he was too polite to mention the change in Amberley's figure, he didn't want to offend an Inquisitor, or he just plain didn't notice, because he said nothing about it as he gamely loped along behind us.<sup>14</sup> A short while later we came to the place she had parked, her vehicle of choice this time apparently being a Land Speeder painted in the traditional inquisitorial colors of Black, crimson and gold, her pilot Pontius sitting in the seat and waiting as the vehicle hovered several feet off the ground. It appeared to be one of the specially made ones as well, extended beyond the normal length of such a vehicle with an extra thruster and open compartment for carrying troops, the like of which I'd only seen before being employed by Astartes Infantry as a fast insertion vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What, no Raptor?' I asked, referring to the D'Lorien Raptor that was her preferred grav car when she was going undercover in hive cities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It is a war zone, after all.' Amberley remarked, her voice indicating she found my joke appropriately funny, as I'd intended. 'Speaking of which, Ciaphas, if you'd like to take the gunner seat. I know you're a better shot with such things than most.'<sup>15</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as she asked, taking the seat beside Pontius and checking the pintle-mounted Heavy Bolter, finding it in working order, and took a glance over my shoulder as Amberley and Jurgen boarded, noting the other passengers for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRakel, the somewhat mentally unstable Psyker was on board, though she immediately shifted to the furthest seat she could get as soon as Jurgen boarded and proceeded to stare daggers at him the entire trip, along with Caractacus Mott, her elderly Savant, and Zemelda Cleat, one of her Acolytes. I noted quietly that Osbera's food's unique nature had already hit Rakel and Zemelda as well, the psyker's outfight seeming even tighter than normal as she seemed to be practically spilling out of it now, what had once simply been somewhat excessive d\u00e9colletage now becoming a bulging canyon of cleavage, and Zemelda's stomach was already making its escape from her outfit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy gawking out of the way, I turned back round to face the front as Pontius barely waited for everyone to be secured in the speeder before taking off, whirring across the beautiful lush landscape of Osbera toward the nearest of the local farms we had been pulling supplies from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farm\" in hindsight might be a bit plain of a word for what existed on Osbera. Despite being a paradise world, and thus a place most people would visit for pleasure rather than work, the place sported a food export to challenge that of most Agri-worlds, and the place we found ourselves soaring into looked more like a jungle than an orchard. Ploin trees heavy with fruit, caba nuts strewn about, and other such fruits and vegetables as far as the eye could see. As soon as Pontius was parked again, we all filed out and started walking around, looking for anything that might seem out of the ordinary, Mott taking samples of the various foods on display and comparing them to the readings he was already getting from the samples Amberley had shared with him that she had packaged from our base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Amberley, I was following along behind her as she walked the rows of Ploin trees, absentmindedly thinking of how grateful I was to be out here rather than on the front-lines being shot at by crazy chaos cultists and Eldar at the same time, when she stopped, instinctively picking a Ploin off a tree with that same lack of awareness she had shown at the base, and proceeding to devour it within the span of a few seconds. Still walking forward without paying attention, I accidentally bumped into her, pressing against her enlarged buttocks as she was finishing off the fruit, and was greeted to the most surreal sensation of that arse pressing against me as it swelled and grew even fatter than it already was.<sup>16</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt heat rush to my face immediately, an uncommon sensation for someone so normally in control of themselves, as Amberley seemed to snap out of her gluttonous daze and look over her shoulder at me quizzically, and with a surprising lack of the incandescent rage I would normally expect from an Inquisitor who just found someone pressed into her suddenly wider arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<sup>14</sup><i>Quite possibly any combination of those options, including all three of them.</i><br>\r\n<sup>15</sup><i>In fact, cain's marksmanship skill was quite commendable, though of course you'd never hear him acknowledge such.</i><br>\r\n<sup>16</sup><i>You know I only forgive that remark because of the circumstances. It was genuinely quite large at the time, and he made it up to me later anyway.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Enjoying yourself back there, Ciaphas?' Amberley asked me, in a tone that spoke of her typical bemused sarcasm, which in itself was actually rather atypical given the situation, but also of an unusual sultry tone that was slowly beginning to build. The smile she flashed me told me what sorts of things she was thinking of doing to me, and it wasn't the usual torture and execution I'd normally expect for anyone who ended up shoving themselves into an Inquisitor's buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason I couldn't yet explain<sup>17</sup>, I found myself unable to resist playing along. 'I think I might be, Inquisitor. It is quite soft where I'm standing currently.' My hands instinctively reached down and squeezed the massive, soft orbs of Amberley's expanded arse, and the blush on her face and the way she bit her lower lip told me I'd made the correct move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think I know a better position for you, Commissar.' She said, the sultry tones in her voice overpowering all else as she led me by the hand to a secluded copse within the verdant jungle of the farm we were on, and we both began to discover, quite intimately, that a secondary effect of the planet's food, one that affected both men and women, was that it was a potent, yet subtle aphrodisiac. Subtle enough that not even an Inquisitor would notice what was going on until it was too late, but strong enough to overpower the discipline of not only said inquisitor, but an Imperial Commissar with a lifetime of dissembling and mastery of his impulses under his belt. But all of that went out the window by the time said belt was hanging from a nearby branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of modesty, and to preserve the decency of my companion in that moment<sup>18</sup>, I won't go into any further detail than that, but suffice to say an enjoyable time was had by all, and by the time we'd come back to our senses and rounded up our clothes to return to the others, who all diligently didn't comment on what had just occurred, Mott seemed to have something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Interesting genetic augmentations.' Mott began, rambling before he'd even gotten a full sentence out. 'Aside from rapid multiplication of adipose reserves, specifically targeted at organisms of a species' female disctinction, at least in any species that has a physiological sexual dimorphism, also contains a number of potent psychotropic effects. Reductions in inhibition, stimulation of hunger centers to encourage continued consumption, subtle shifting of cognitive focus to reduce attention to what one is consuming, alteration of pleasure centers, causing changes of physiological sexual preference, and increased libido. The last two are not dimorphically exclusive, and this is just what I've managed to discover so far, who knows what else is hidden beneath this tampering.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So in Gothic,' Amberley began, straightening her disheveled hair, 'It makes women fat, hungry, and unable to notice how much they're eating, and it makes everyone more, shall we say, sexually active, and changes their sexual preferences? Towards what, exactly?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I feel like we've got an idea of towards what.' I interjected, unable to stop myself from demonstrating by goosing her, which caused her to yelp not just in surprise but also in involuntary pleasure<sup>19</sup>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'P-point taken.' she stammered, a blush already rising to her cheeks. 'So it's specifically designed to make women larger, and make everyone prefer it that way. But why?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well from a military perspective, that's a potent disabler. If half our troops are getting, shall we say, out of shape, and all of them are feeling more focused on bedding down than fighting, our force becomes significantly less effective. And that's just our mixed regiment, there's far more women among the fighting forces of the Eldar from what I can tell.' My theorizing was punctuated by the occasional munching sound as the women couldn't stop themselves from partaking of more of the food around us, bloating themselves that much further outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Solid idea, but that seems like a lot of work for a very strange goal. There's got to be something else going on.' Amberley said between mouthfuls as her cleavage began to force its way further out from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was at that point, fitting with the whims of fate being tempted, that we'd get some further revelations, even if they weren't what we were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<sup>17</sup><i>But which we were shortly about to discover.</i><br>\r\n<sup>18</sup><i>And I appreciate that. Believe me, I likely would've excised this entire section from the archive had he not.</i><br>\r\n<sup>19</sup><i>I'd like to emphasize the involuntary aspect of that statement, before anyone gets any ideas.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We spent a few more minutes examining the environs, which mostly amounted to the women stuffing their faces some more and the men trying to keep urges in check. Well, except for Jurgen, who despite his affinity for pornoslates, seemed to have almost no interest in actual women, at least the ones around us, and for Mott, who seemed too caught up in his analysis to think of anything else. Which is mostly to say that Pontius and myself were trying not to make animals of ourselves. As we were gearing up to leave, I was suddenly struck by the all-too familiar tingling sensation in my palms, and I looked around just in time to watch a small spinning disk soar past me and slice through a ploin tree next to me, barely even jostling the trunk on its way through. I never saw where it went after that, because my eyes and survival instincts were fixed in the direction the shot came from, and I barely had the time to parse the fact that I should already be dead if the Eldar were shooting like normal before the reason for the lack of aim became apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving out of the treeline as fast as their prodigiously thick legs could carry them were the fattest group of Eldar women I'd ever seen<sup>20</sup>, apron-like bellies wobbling and enormous mammaries heaving as they closed in a sprint that, while nowhere near the inhuman speed that the Eldar could normally achieve, would suitably match an Imperial Guard trooper running in full kit, which seemed downright miraculous considering the sheer bulk of the creatures. I recognized the warriors as Howling Banshees by their distinctive masks, and I knew that if I let them get close enough to unleash their hellish scream, I was a dead man, but something in the damned food of the planet had me transfixed. Their gait as they ran seemed practically erotic, the sheer amount of bulging flesh deforming their armor and wobbling up and down as they tried to move with the grace they once possessed but simply couldn't manage in this fattened state, their buttocks in particular, visible from the front due to sheer width, gyrating against each other with each clearly strenuous rise and fall of their ham-like legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one that was charging me specifically fortunately didn't seem to be able to correct their aim, probably something to do with those enormous arms they were sporting (these women had clearly been eating this food for far longer than any of our regiment), but she also didn't seem to be quite used to her own girth as she was unable to stop her wild charge by the time she reached my addled and unmoving form. I maintained enough survival instinct to bring up my chainsword and deflect the one half-hearted swing she made with her own blade at me, but then we collided. Or more accurately, she collided with me, and we both went down with me being squashed under what felt like a full ton of Eldar bodymass<sup>21</sup>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I lay there pinned and trying to catch my breath, the Banshee took the opportunity, likely after recovering from the sheer embarrassment of the predicament, to unleash the power of her mask. But, as with all other things on this emperor-forsaken world, that too had been altered by the food that grew here, as rather than the mind-breaking scream customarily unleashed by the Howling Banshees, I was greeted by a sonic boom of a belch which flung my cap from my head, shook the trees around us, and firmly, yet I will note, painlessly, rendered me unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised me even more was that I eventually woke from that state of unconsciousness to find that not only was I alive, but I was completely safe and not a prisoner to be presumably tortured for all eternity<sup>22</sup>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<i><sup>20</sup>Which might not be a particularly high bar, considering I don't think either Cain or myself have ever seen an Eldar outside of this situation who could even be classified as overweight.</i><br>\r\n<i><sup>21</sup>To be more accurate, based on my own observations and Mott's capacity for measurement and mathematics, she and her companions were all likely somewhere around five to six hundred pounds each. Still quite a lot for an Eldar, or really anyone to be running around at that size, especially with such speed, but still.</i><br>\r\n<i><sup>22</sup>Yet another example of Cain's seeming ignorance of the differentiation between the various types of Eldar. Craftworld Eldar have almost no recorded instances of using humans as torture objects for the sake of their own pleasure. They tend to prefer using us as pawns in their games, as it turns out.</i></span></div></div>",

In fact all six of the Eldar who had made their presence known seemed to be lying unconscious rather than dead on the ground about the area, and the Inquisitor, her entourage, and Jurgen all seemed to be no worse for wear whatsoever, though the women seemed yet again even fatter than before I'd lost consciousness. Amberly walked over to me as I was reconciling myself with the headache that was rapidly forming behind my eyes and I took in the sheer increased expanse of her. She must have put on a not insignificant fraction of her current weight in the time since I'd been knocked out, because she looked massive. Not nearly as large as the Eldar, but her wobbling stomach was beginning to separate into two distinct rolls as its pale flesh revealed itself from under her bodyglove which was no longer able to conceal all of her girth, and a pair of breasts larger than her head were gently resting atop it, her outfit still keeping her decent in that regard, though the tree-like thighs wobbling toward me looked about ready to begin tearing holes in their current confines as well, to say nothing of the bouncing buttocks I could -almost- see from the front as she approached, the upper half of which seemed to making good their own escape. It was a sight that almost struck me breathless as there seemed to be no end to the beauty of this woman even as she grew more bountiful by the hour<sup>23</sup>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Ciaphas, try this, it will make you feel better.\" She said as she leaned forward, granting me a generous view of her incredible canyon of cleavage as she handed me a ploin, though in my fruit-addled state the thing I was most taking in was the wobbling mass of her stomach leaning ever closer to me. \"We discovered a few more qualities of the local food during that fight. Chief among them apparently they have a regenerative effect. Wounds and injuries heal rapidly just after ingesting something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her word for it I took the ploin and took a generous bite out of it, and sure enough my headache almost immediately began to recede. \"Praise the Emperor.\" I said in honest surprise, \"It's too bad about the other effects, these could be valuable medical supplies otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, that faint bemused smile once again upon her face that always made my breath catch for a moment whenever I looked at it. Come to think of it, her face was looking a bit rounder as well, her cheeks taking on an almost cherubic caste which I, in the moment, found even more intoxicating than usual. \"Indeed. Though for the moment on this battlefield, we may just have to put up with the other effects and indulge in them where we need to in order to keep our fighters in peak condition.\" As she said it, she took a bite of a faintly apple-shaped fruit herself and a small gash I hadn't noticed until then on her arm, likely a glancing blow, sealed itself up without even a trace of a scar as her body once again bubbled and billowed outward in all directions ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of peak condition.\" I said, uncomfortable with the words I was being forced to say, but I needed to get the question out there to determine just how much danger I would be in in the long run as these fruits kept taking their toll. \"How are you handling the, uhm....Extra load?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if it weren't there, honestly.\" Amberley said, shrugging. \"That seems to be another one of the effects we've discovered. Mott's doing a more thorough and focused analysis of that trait specifically, but everyone who should be getting bogged down by the extra weight is moving as if they were in their prime. Might be something about the healing properties of the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just that.\" The Savant in question cut in, strolling over. \"The rejuvenating effects of this substance is actually improving the health and musculature of its subjects, even under the additional accumulation of adipose in its female targets. Everyone who has these comestibles will find themselves in perfect health and peak physical condition, easily physically capable of carrying any amount of the extra weight they've put onto themselves. It even seems to increase muscle mass significantly in those achieving particularly high weights, allowing them to move as if they were perfectly slim with widths that threaten to outreach their height. Strangely, the increase in muscle mass seems to be directly tied to the increase in adipose tissue concentrations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's not even going to really physically disable people in the long run?\" I asked, looking at the savant quizzically. \"That shoots my disabler theory right to frak doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Within reason, of course.\" Mott nodded, \"though at a certain point the body will achieve such a significant mass that it will be unable to move not by virtue of lack of strength but by simple nature of one's limbs not being able to reach the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Amberly as a completely healthy, but completely immobile sea of lard so large that her feet couldn't even touch down enough to walk should have appalled or at least concerned me, but in that moment something about it was unfathomably alluring, and I could tell that Amberley had had the same thought with the same results, judging by the blush on her face<sup>24</sup>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[grand total for this chapter exceeded the word limit, continued in part 2]</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<sup>23</sup> <i>Flattering, given the circumstances.

Tampering with Imperial research and turning it to perverse ends does seem to be something of a standard of Slaaneshi designs.\" Amberley said. At that moment her stomach gave a loud, ominous grumble which caused her semi-constant blush to deepen significantly. \"The Eldar certainly seemed to be perfectly capable of moving and fighting despite their weight.\" she attempted to keep the conversation on track, though I could tell she was being distracted by what was going on inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which.\" I commented, willing to play along. \"I noticed all of these Eldar seem unconscious rather than dead. Prisoners to interrogate seem important but how did you manage to knock -all- of them out without having to kill even one of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well about that.\" Amberley said, squirming a bit at what seemed now to be building intestinal distress. \"There's a few chemical byproducts produced in the women affected by this food that build until needing to be released. Current understanding is that it carries with it a significant charge of the aphrodisiac qualities of the fruits' effects, along with trace amounts of its other qualities, and the effects can apparently be amplified by those of sufficient psychic talent, like Rakel over there, into a sensory overload that can render individuals unconscious. You seem to have been struck by something similar from the howling banshee that tackled you, and I- oh Emperor damn it all.\" she no longer seemed to be able to contain herself, unleashing a bout of unexpected flatulence that lasted for a complete ten seconds, during which time she seemed unable to stifle a groan that sounded less like embarrassment and more like almost sexual relief<sup>25</sup>. As I watched, her legs and buttocks ever so faintly seemed to swell; must have been those trace quantities of the fruits' other effects that had been mentioned. The strangest thing was that as I took in the scent of the unexpected release, it smelled heavenly, counter to what might have been expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emperor's blood that felt good.\" Amberley gasped, putting herself back together. \"And it seems almost like a delivery mechanism to spread whatever's happening to the affected individuals to any hold-outs who might be resisting consuming any of the tainted foodstuffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that eventually it'll spread to everyone.\" I nodded, the sheer sprawling threat of such a a wide-spreading effect sending a shiver down my spine. \"We need to find these cultists and figure out what they're doing and how to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's even them.\" Mott put in \"The modifications here don't necessarily seem like sorcery, and the Slaaneshi cultists might be just as affected by this as both our forces and the Eldar. If not more, they seem like the type who would thoroughly throw themselves into this sort of situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. You're not wrong, and we should probably test whether or not any amount of these effects are warp-based. Jurgen<sup>26</sup>, if you would kindly step over here.\" I raised my voice to call for my aide, who dutifully walked his way over to our side, his earthy scent preceding him by a few paces, displacing the pleasant smell of Amberley's recent release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I certainly don't feel any less like ravaging you again.\" Amberley said, biting her lower lip. \"Only one other thing to test.\" she took another bite of food and once again swelled outward, her breasts finally tearing a small rip in the upper fabric of her bodyglove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, definitely not warp stuff. Thank you Jurgen, you can return to what you were doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly sir, spot of tanna for you as well?\" my aide dutifully produced a flask of the tea and offered it to me, which I gratefully took and nodded as he turned to return to patrolling the area with a sketchy salute. The familiar aroma and taste of the tea helped center my thoughts and focus on the matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably get these Eldar bound up properly and prepared for interrogation.\" I suggested, and Amberley managed to shake her dirty thoughts<sup>27</sup> long enough to agree with me, and we set to work preparing for the next step of our investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<sup>25</sup> <i>As embarrassing as that is even in hindsight, it was only the beginning of what was to come in the future and if I was going to cut that from this section of the archive I would have had to excise the entire extract, so I might as well swallow my pride and leave it in.</i><br>\r\n<sup>26</sup> <i>Jurgen, being a Blank, would have nullified any psychic effects caused by the food of the planet simply by his being present, which would have made our lives a lot easier.</i><br>\r\n<sup>27</sup> <i>Which were perfectly within the confines of the Imperium's acceptable degree of sexual promiscuity, thank you very much.

Don't want them using them against us again when they come to.\" Amberley called out to everyone after we'd finished tying up each of the fat captives. Taking her advice, I walked up to one and reached out to remove its mask, uncertain what I'd find beneath. Perhaps the hideous piercings and flesh modifications I'd seen on some of the faces of the slavers I'd seen and occasionally been chased by over the years<sup>28</sup>. What I saw, to my mild surprise, was a pale face relatively unmarked aside from a few scars from wounds likely too old to be healed by the local fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was long and dark, and the typically alien, unnaturally sharp and long features of the Eldar people were rounded out by the fat she'd put on. In fact, with her eyes closed, the only real feature that easily identified her as not being human were the long, pointed ears. I stared at her for a moment, taking in the features of what I was pretty certain was the warrior who had knocked me out earlier while the others continued removing the masks from the remainder. I can thankfully assure you that my natural distrust and loathing of the alien wasn't completely curbed by the appreciation for soft faces and soft figures the local cuisine had instilled into me and everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it opened its eyes, glaring at me with the completely black, abyss-like eyes common to their species, and I stilled the instinctive urge to jump away with the ease of long practice, simply standing and adjusting my cap as I turned to Amberley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like they're coming to. The floor is yours for interrogation, Inquisitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmberley nodded at me and walked over to stand in front of the captive Eldar, putting her hands on her hips in a stance that normally would have been intimidating and authoritative, but with her palms squishing into the saddlebags on her sides just looked a bit sensual. Her voice and eyes had the right effect though, as she swept her burning gaze across the group of aliens and snapped out icily \"Which one of you is in charge of this squad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gathered eldar just stared at her as if they didn't speak the language, but my ability to read people is so well-honed that I can even read most aliens reasonably well, and I could tell at least half of them were feigning ignorance. Apparently Amberley could as well, because she said something in the Eldar language, and frak me if it didn't sound like a bunch of windchimes<sup>29</sup>, but at least two of them visibly winced, and one spoke up in heavily accented Gothic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in command of this squad, Mon-keigh. What is it you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Amberly replied, before walking directly up to the -other- Eldar who had winced at her speech earlier and kneeling down in front of them rather than the leader. \"You're going to tell me everything about what your people are doing out here, and everything you know about the food on this planet as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" The lesser Eldar asked, which is a stupid question to ask an Inquisitor, believe me. Their minds can think of punishments that go beyond cruelty, even ones that are normally as upbeat as Amberley, who replied simply by standing up and waving her arms to indicate the farm we were standing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I'm going to stuff your leader with so much of the fare of this planet that she'll be left a quivering mass of flesh. And then I'm going to do it to the next one in your group, and the next one after that, until you either give me what I want or I finally make my way around to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't.\" The alien retorted, also a bad response for an Inquisitor. She seemed to be reading the playbook on how to make your situation worse with every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerley shrugged. \"If you insist. Commissar Cain, would you give me a hand with this?\" she needn't have asked, I was busy gathering fruits from the nearby trees before she'd even finished issuing her threat the first time, and dumped a large pile of them onto the ground next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should get you started, but I'll keep getting more for you. Jurgen, Mott, Pontius, if you'd give me a hand? Not you, Zemelda, we don't want you scarfing too many on accident. Keep Rakel company, if you wouldn't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we gathered food for Amberley's unorthodox torture method, the Inquisitor picked up one of the fruits from the pile I'd gathered and held it in front of the leader's face, who couldn't resist opening her mouth for Amberley to shove almost the entire thing in for her, and further couldn't resist biting down when she did, swallowing like clockwork, only for the process to repeat itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI learned as things continued that the larger the victim of these comestibles got, the slower their growth became. I assumed it was because the calories required to maintain the ever-larger forms being reached were increasing constantly as well, but it got to a point where several whole fruits had to be consumed before any notable growth could be seen. Of course by that time the Eldar was so incredibly fat that I couldn't see her being able to move at all if it weren't for the muscle-stimulating effects of the food. Also as time went on, the Eldar's gas become an ever more constant presence, the sound of farts and the mysterious aroma of the chemical byproducts Amberley had mentioned earlier permeating the area. Apparently the duress of the situation was kicking things into overdrive, because past a certain point the releases were near-constant, the expressions of the other Eldar growing steadily more horrified as their leader bloated into a fat gasbag slowly inching her way towards true immobility as her body thickened further and further, approaching the point at which she would no longer be able to reach the ground with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for an hour before Amberley stepped back, satisfied with the results as she gazed at a massive blob barely distinguishable as an Eldar. She couldn't help but snack a bit during the process, but she had displayed incredible willpower throughout and had barely even swelled a couple of centimeters. She was an Inquisitor, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's one down. I suppose now it's on to the next one.\" she said, reaching down to grab another fruit from the pile before her chosen target spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Stop! I will tell you what I know, just please, no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Let's get started then, shall we?\" Amberly smiled, popping the fruit she was holding into her own mouth instead, and proceeded to get properly into the interrogation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end we didn't learn too terribly much; this was just a scouting force that had been sent to investigate the local sources of food just like we had. What we did learn was very interesting, however. Apparently the Eldar were from a craftworld by the name of Ulthw\u00e9 and had gotten here first, before the chaos cultists, or at least before they'd revealed themselves on the planet, though I suspected at least some of them had been there for some time. Apparently the Eldar are looking for something important of theirs on this planet from before it was settled by the Imperium, and ran into the situation with the food as soon as they arrived. That established a timeline; either the food had been affected by someone else prior to the two factions taking their holds on the planet, or it had been done by some undercover agent of the Slaaneshi cultists prior to the Eldar's arrival. That is of course assuming we could believe anything the Eldar said, but under the circumstances it was all we had to go on. We also learned that the pointy-eared numpties have no understanding of what makes the food the way it is, though whether that's because the technology is beyond them or so far beneath them they didn't bother trying to understand it was anyone's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, you've been very helpful.\" Amberley said, licking the juices of the fruit she'd just eaten from around her mouth. She'd probably put on another dozen pounds over the course of the interrogation, but the gain was clearly slowing down on her much faster than on the Eldar; probably something to do with the Eldar's weird physiognomy. \"Now then, what to do with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release *URP* us....Please....\" The leader moaned, though considering the state she was in, I wasn't certain what form of release she was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...I suppose I could...\" She pretended to consider, though I could tell she'd already thought up a plan to use the prisoners to her advantage. \"Very well, you're free to go and roll your commander back to your people, on the condition that you let your farseer know that I'd like a peaceful word with them. Perhaps we can find an amicable solution to this conflict without continuing to battle each other and cost your craftworld more of your precious lives and our troops more of theirs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a deal with the Eldar seemed risky; they were likely to pull out and stab us in the back the instant they accomplished whatever goal of theirs they had on this planet, but at the same time, fighting a war on two fronts was never ideal, and getting the pointy-ears to focus more on the cultists than on us would certainly make us a lot safer. And in the end, she was the Inquisitor and I was the commissar, so I just nodded and helped cut their bonds and get them to their feet after they'd accepted her terms, and followed Amberley as our group headed back to our compound with our new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<sup>28</sup><i>Again, Cain seems unable to tell the difference between the Aeldari and Drukhari. Such mutilations are almost unheard of among the typical craftworld variety.</i><br>\r\n<sup>29</sup><i>The phrase was \"I could butcher your language, or you could speak to me in mine.\" typically the sound of a human poorly pronouncing their language, even if it was intentional in this case, is enough of a blow to an Eldar's pride to make them willingly converse in Gothic.</i></span></div></div>",

Raised from childhood into athletes who put even the elite Kasrkin of old Cadia to shame, their physical dedication is matched only by their faith. They would rather die the most agonizing death than let themselves fall even an inch from his light. Even the smallest sin to them is as grave as giving an entire world over to the Tyranids, something that must be blotted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...perhaps because of their dedication to faith and purity, the warrior nuns tend to be rather...idealized within the Imperium. Maybe it isn't true that they are the fairest women in all the Imperium, but if you like them sworn to purity, zeal and an exercise regime that lets ab muscles cut diamond then you can't go wrong. Perhaps the Ministorum and Inquisition do use them for their sex appeal sometimes, to motivate the masses in various ways. Pity that most are sworn to avoid sex save for when off duty and that their duty almost never ends save in death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even the most pure can fall to lust and sometimes in this dark millenium, that fall can go further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto sloth, abandoning training and devotion in favor of a heresy focused on a life of easy relaxation that saps the muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto gluttony, throwing their fervor into the over consumption of every foodstuff in the Imperium, bloating out of their armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways this is covered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would the masses of the Imperium do if they knew that sometimes even the steely dedication of a Celestian rusts into all encompassing hedonism, that on occasion a Retributionist's strong muscles can grow so lazy they struggle to pick up their weapon, that sometimes a Hospitaller's medical skills are focused upon expanding the human body to a heretical extent, that sometimes a Sister Famulous's nimble tongue can persuade an entire world into obesity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat even an Imperial Saint, charged with the God-Emperor's immaculate light, can even grow too fat to fly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would they do if they discovered that sometimes, the Inquisition has caused these peerless warrior women to fall into obesity for our own ends? Sometimes it is to stop the Sororitas from asking too many questions, other times to disguise them and sometimes to discredit a political rival, but it happens. And often, enough that every Sororitas' training includes mnemonic imagery that can be triggered to turn all their disgust at slack and obesity into all encompassing fascination and perversion? That all of them are to some small extent aware of this and just waiting for the excuse to abandon their duty for wanton gluttony?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPray. Pray that the common mob of Imperial citizens never learns of these facts, that their foremost mortal guardians are all too ready to fall into obese uselessness. Riots, revolts and despair would break out across the Imperium in that case, throwing us into catastrophe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd furthermore, pray even harder for me, dear reader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the Sororitas themselves have found me and their justice, slow, wobbling, panting, is inevitable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Inquisitor Cornelius Sulla</b><br>\r\nThought for the Day: Blessed is the ass large enough to see from the front and the breasts large enough to see from the back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I digress- of course I do- how else would this lesson be two hours in length? But anyway, on to the, hehe, meat, or flesh- you could say of the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of you know that inquisitors, in general, aren't among the lowest of the god emperor's servants by far. Naturally, their food, drink, and accomodations will be appropriate for their importance. Just as naturally, their resistance to the capricious words of temptation, of sin, would be matching, and for the most part, it proves to be up to the task indeed. Then again, we wouldn't be here, in this musty lecture hall, talking and sleeping over the clacking and scrawling of servitors if the faith of all inquisitors was ironclad. Now, the Inquisition, as a whole, may seem to the commoner as one large, pants wettingly terrifying organization, with goals as unfathomable as they are ominous. But you know better than that. We know better than that. And so, it falls to the ordo hereticus to take the, ahem, weighty brunt of the archenemy. No surprise, for they come into contact with she who thirsts, slannesh, the god of deviancy, on a basis unimaginable for the average citizen. I shan't name names, but let's just say that with the two augmetics that fill my eye sockets, I've seen slim, yet voluptuous ladies of the Inquisition gorge themselves until clothing and armour alike strains to contain their vast guts. Did they get fat? Presumably. I didn't stick around. Seeing a beautiful and intimidating inquisitor fill herself with grox to bursting may sound like the topic of a porno-slate, but when you begin to be looked at not as a loyal scribe, but as a potential meal, it's time to move on, and believe me, I've seen a colleague or two be swallowed whole by an inquisitor under the influence of... Otherworldly entities, their deaths only serving to bloat and swell the once flat stomachs of previously svelts inquisitors gone round the bend. Anyway. That's all for today. I need a drink. Or two.

Savor the growth of the beautiful human and heretical xenos forms on display, rather than breaking them down all at once. Pace your tale's growth out in a fashion restricted to the moderately fantastic rather than the immediately absurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly) Contributions of little substance are of little worth to the Golden Throne. If you wish to add your verse to this tale, make sure it is substantial enough to be satisfactory not only to your fellow readers, but to the Emperor of Mankind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirdly) The central focus of this archive is tales of growth and gluttony, excess and enjoyment, but this often brings with it other subject matter. Tales of Expansion, Inflation, Muscle Growth, Slobbification, and the like may follow, but remember to keep central the ideas of the growth of girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourthly) Content of a Sexual nature is welcome in this archive, so long as its presence does not overly pollute the tale. Exercise moderation, fellow readers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThusly written, enjoy the tale<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Inquisitor Storymaker, Ordo Xenos</td>",
