            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another calm evening at the quaint Yusaku residence.  Inside the small abode was one petite Taiga Aisaka and her precious partner Ryuji.  His mother, Yasuko, was still working at the hostess bar where she was employed at, and it was a busy night for the childish mother, which also meant that she wouldn't be home until rather late.  This also meant that the 'teen with the face of a thug' would only make a smaller dinner for himself and his 'adorable tiger' and cook up something else for his mother that wouldn't spoil.  Currently he was in the kitchen, dutifully crafting each piece of the meal with precision and care. Cooking, and to a lesser extent cleaning,were both passions for the teen, as he was thrust with these responsible at a young age and grew to love them.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryuji! Is dinner ready yet!\" yelled out a certain 'palm-top tiger' as she rested on the small dinning table located in the other room.  The small girl was always impatient when it came to food, as within her petite frame housed a bottomless stomach.  She would become even more restless when it came to her boyfriend's cooking, as that always gave her a special feeling each time she indulged in his created meals.  With each and every bite, she would be able to sense just how much love he would place into each of his dishes and enjoy them just that much more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be patient.  It'll be done in 15 minutes!\" yelled back Ryuji, over the soft roaring of the stove.  The vegetable side dishes were already complete and the rice was fully cooked, with the aid of a brand new rice cooker that Ryuji proudly bought on a bargain deal. The only dishes that still needed time to be completely cooked were the meat and fish dishes, both of which need to be carefully prepared to staff off possible contaminants that may make any person ill.  The teen prided himself on his cooking abilities and to serve undercooked meals was simply unheard off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh!  Ryuji that's too long.\" whined the long haired girl.  Sighing at the fact that she still had to wait to satiate her deep hunger, she brought her head down to the table to rest.  By it still being the better-half of the winter season, Taiga was dressed in a simple red turtleneck sweater with pair of grey sweatpants.  She left her heavy coat in her permanent spot by the door as usual.  By laying down her heard on the table, she began to reminisce on all that she and Ryuji had been through the past few weeks.  Them finally encountering their feelings for each other, the strains that had been placed among themselves, Ami, Minorin and Kitamura, Taiga and her issues with her family, Ryuji with his own issues on not choosing to seek higher education, and all had resulted in the couple choosing to elope.  Everyone of these issues had been thankfully resolved and the two were free to developing their new-found relationship.  Taiga was also grateful to her stubborn mother which had allowed her to finish up her schooling at the area and for her to continue living in the apartment right next to Ryoji's smaller house, though Taiga would often spend nights with her boyfriend.  While she was extremely grateful that everything became settled, she had to admit that things also became a tad boring.  The past few months were spent with an enormous amounts of drama and seeing things simply going back to normal unsettled the girl slightly, as it simply seemed too ordinary for her tastes.  These inner musings were soon disrupted by the sounds of dinnerware being placed on the wooden surface.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready you impatient girl.\" teased Ryuji as he ruffled Taiga's hair and went back to his seat across from the girl.  He had quickly set up their dinner and waited for the girl to dig in first before he began to eat his own wares.  At the sight of the spread in front of her, the girl's face lit up in delight.  Of course she started with the meat.  It was her favorite food after all.  The teen sitting at her front gave a warm smile at the sight of his girlfriend enjoying the meal he created. With his pride of cooking, Ryuji loved to see others enjoy what he would make for them.  Getting out of his own thoughts, he also started to eat. Around twenty-five minutes had passed and both teens had finished eating.  Taiga had a bright smile on her cherubic face, a sign that she had enjoyed the meal.  Though she couldn't place it, there was strange feeling coming within her.  Was it that she was still hungry?  Maybe, but even then, some extra food couldn't hurt right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ryuji, I'm still kinda hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, but you ate most of the dinner, and besides, it's kind of late.\" said the teen, a bit confused on why his girlfriend was still peckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's alright to eat a little more sometimes right?\" Why don't we go to the convenience store and  get some snacks like old times?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Fine, fine.  If it's what you want, then lets just go.\" reluctantly agreed the teen.  He often found it difficult to not give into Taiga's usually unreasonable demands. In was in this way that he spoiled the young girl the most, though watching her small face light up each time made it almost worth it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" shouted out Taiga as she stood up and rushed towards the doorway, most likely to prepare herself for the frigid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  At least help me clear out the table you ungrateful girl!\" Giving out a low sigh, he went to clean the surface of the table, carefully stacking each plate and bowl carefully,as they were obviously fragile.  Coming from a relatively low-income household, Ryuji learned early on to appreciate the value of every household item.  Carefully dropping the dishes into the sink, he rationalized that it be better to wash them later or tomorrow, lest he let Taiga getting too impatient and running off on her own.  He quickly made his way to the door leading outside, only to find Taiga, wearing her black heavy jacket with her red scarf wrapped tightly around her thin neck, which covered her face from the nose down. Taiga obviously had an irritated expression at the moment, from what Ryuji could tell from underneath all of the cloth that covered her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You take too long.\" said the girl with a bit of a vicious tone, her seemingly new-found hunger making her a tad bit more violent than her usual self.  Ignoring her attitude, Ryuji grabbed his own coat from the standing rack and quickly put it one.  It was a simple black overcoat, but it was something that the teen cherished as Taiga had bought it to replace his old one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't help clear the table after you ate nearly everything I set.\" He had thought to choose some more harsher words to get out his point, but there was no point in antagonizing Taiga even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you were mad about that?  I thought you would love to do it all yourself, seeing as you're the housewife and all.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure, make fun of the guy that cooks and cleans for you, that's a great idea.\"  Taiga had to admit, she loved teasing her boyfriend about his neurotic cleaning habits, and it served as quite a contrast to her own personality. Seeing that he was ready to face the brisk air, she opened the front door, seeing it was dark outside.  After all, it was Winter and past 7:00 P.M. Stepping down the steps of the small patio, the tiny girl felt the rush of cold air hitting her very being. Looking behind her, see saw Ryuji closing the door and locking it up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" asked Ryuji as he also went down the steps and onto the slightly narrow sidewalk that stood in front of the house.  Taigi didn't answer, instead she opted to simply walk right past Ryuji, in the direction of the convenience store.  Showing a bit of a disgruntled face, he quickly caught up to her.  It was quiet between the two as they went along in a steady pace.   After a few more minutes of the two silently walking together, Ryuji felt a petite hand slip into his right hand.  Looking over, he saw his girlfriend giving him a warm smile.  He quickly responded with a grin of his own and gave her hand a small squeeze.  As before, the entire trip was silent, both teens enjoying each others warm presence in the frosty night.  The convenience store was luckily only about ten minutes away so the two wouldn't have to spend long in the cold, and it meant that Tagia would be able to get her precious snacks quicker.  Finally, the 24-hour store was in view and Taiga practically dragged her boyfriend thought the sliding doors.  There was a lone worker at the counter, a young girl who looked to be in her early twenties.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\" greeted the eager-looking employee.  Taiga ignored her, rushing off to the aisle where they kept her favorite foodstuffs.  Ryuji acknowledged the worker with a small nod and went off to find Taiga.  By the time he reached the section where his small girlfriend was, she had already gathered a plethora of large chip bags and snack-cakes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want these.\" said the girl as she slightly struggled in holding up all of the junk food.  Luckily Ryuji snagged one of the hand-baskets that were located right by the entrance.  Placing her chosen products into the plastic basket, he found Taiga still going up and down the aisle finding even more things to purchase.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much food are we even going to get?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno alot?  I told you I'm still hungry.\" said the girl as she was eying two different brands of chips, trying to pick between the two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyways just hurry up, I don't want us to be out too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I'm done anyways.\"  As she placed the bag that she chose into the basket along with the other junk-food products, the two headed over to the counter to pay for the food.  Placing the basket on the counter, the employee started to ring up each item, the scanner causing the register to let out an audible beep with each scan of a bar-code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this sure is a lot of food you and your sister.  Are you guys having a party?\" innocently asked the young adult.  At her words, Taiga began to fume almost instantly.  In order to avoid having his rage-filled girlfriend mauling the poor girl in front of them, he quickly grabbed Taiga into a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, no, she's my girlfriend!  We're just getting some food, that's all.\" rationally explained Ryuji, confusing the worker slightly, while rapidly calming Taiga down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right the total is $25.78.  Will that be cash or credit?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cash\" said the teen as he pulled out his wallet.  The payment went through fine and the cashier handed over the four bags filled with their legally acquired food-stuffs.  The two left, Ryuji holding all of the bags, while Taiga seemed to be muttering something under her breath.  Later the two arrived back at Ryuji's house, both had settled down in the living room, the two enjoying munching on the junk food.  Ryuji and Taiga both opted to change into their sleep-wear as it was pretty late and it was more comfy for them.  Their attire consisted of a normal sized blue t-shirt and a pair of flannel pants for Ryuji and an over-sized white shirt with a pair of loose red boy-shorts for Taiga.  The pair where currently watching an action packed movie, with Ryuji sitting on the floor with Taiga in his lap.  Impressively Taiga was on her second bag of chips, which were the ever classic cheese-puffs already and it seemed like she was almost done with the bag too.  Seeing this, the teen was quite surprised that she still had that much of an appetite.  In an unexpected move, Ryuji wrapped his arms around Taiga's midsection and gave her a loving squeeze, his head resting on her left shoulder.  Needless to say, her face began to turn a light shade of red as a feeling of bliss overcame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!  What's with this lovey-dovey stuff all of a sudden.\" While her words expressed her discomfort, she obviously loved this spontaneous actions of his.  Of course, her pride would never allow for her to reveal her line of thinking. After all, she was a 'tsundere' or at least leaned towards that level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you keep eating this way, you're going to get pretty fat.  Oh I'm actually feeling a bit of gut here.\" teased the young man as gently rubbed Taiga's mid-section.  For the second time of the cold night, the short girl began to fume once again, she never did like being teased about her physical stature.  Letting go of the bag, causing it to fall to the ground with some of the cheesy poofs falling out of the bag, she grabbed Ryuji's bare arms, clawing into them with her fine nails.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  Well then, no matter what I look like, you're stuck with me!  I'd never let you break up with me.  If anything I'd be the one to end this, and it looks like I'm dangerously close to doing that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you're crazy if you think I'm letting you outta my life,  You'd never survive without me and I couldn't live without you either.\"  His words were the truth.  In no way could he see his life without the crazy wild girl that was his girlfriend.  He gave the girl a small peck on her check to show what he truly felt.  At the contact of his lips to her soft cheek, the girl felt as if she was melting, which caused her to relax her grip on his arms and lean further back into his warm embrace.  She knew what she wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, you know that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, and I love you too.\"  It was that simple to them.  Nothing more, nothing less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now can we finally get back to the movie?  I think we missed the climax or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.  Anyways, I thought you were too busy stuffing your face to even pay attention.  I mean what's next on your hunger crusade?  Those frosted twinkies or those fruit-cakes?  I mean they all sound so healthy and what not.\" sarcastically stated Ryuji.  At the pace she was going at, they would be going shopping again the next day, perhaps even the day after that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet you.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
