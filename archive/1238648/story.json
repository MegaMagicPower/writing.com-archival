Here he was eating some chocolate cakes with the reality and fact that he was the richest man in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately, James seems oblivious to the fact that he has gained a considerable amount of weight. He is about to gain some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was in his bedroom continuing to eat and eat for hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe burped and was finally finished with his twelve cakes he eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood was everywhere in his new house, food and dessert was stacked like small hills and on tables. He had invited some girls from who knows where and they were all running around the house in their bikinis. There was a pool party outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls was in the table making a milkshake. James wanted one of those and the girl who he didn't even know gave it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, James ate for a year in ecstacy nonstop. He ate all kinds of foods imaginable. He was still ignorant to the fact that he was now fat. james didn't know that he was now 220 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, James was getting ready to go a wrestling match which was being shown in his state of L.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to see the punches and fighting so much he couldn't wait. But first he needed to get his jeans on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"come on, stupid jeans fit!\" James said. He paid no mind that his round fat belly was in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put on a shirt that barely hid his belly and off he went to the wrestling match in his limo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he was at the arena watching wrestlers beating the hell out of each other. He tried sitting down, but his large butt couldn't fit. \"Stupid chairs, why did they make them so small?\" he asked himself. James had ordered a 3 hot dogs, 4 cheeseburgers, a liter of cola, and some donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still eating when he saw the women wrestlers fighting. James knew his favorite women wrestler was Ashley Massaro, he hoped she would win. \"Come on, Ashley!\" he cheered her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about three minutes, the fight went on until Ashley did her signature move, pinned her rival and won the fight. \"WHOO, yeah!\" the crowd cheered. James who had already finished his food, tried to get up, to cheer Ashley, but his butt was stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally got out and soon found out from an usher that Ashley was signing autographs. James was in last line. James was the fattest person in line. People were snickering at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe had no idea what they were laughing so he ignored them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley soon said to the line that she had to leave and she ran out of time. \"that was a downer\" i thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to leave, his limo was in the garage but then out of nowhere Ashley, Ashley Massaro, in all her glory and beauty, caught up to him surprisingly, of all places and of all times! and said to a wide-eyed James:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was in a black tank top with her physique showing. Her tanned musculature was enough to make him want to sweat. Her beauty was making him tremble. James was shocked and appalled that he couldn't speak. Ashley was in my presence talking to him out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally found his voice at last and said \"yyes\" with nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled and asked him \"what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, James, here you go!\" Ashley gave him a photographed picture of herself with her signature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I think i saw you in the row up ahead when i finished my match and you.. couldn't get out of your chair?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that this is a conversation, James said with embarrassment in his plump face. \"umm..yeah those chairs are really small.\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you're not a gym nut, are you?\" she squinted at him as if studying him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" James frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, i'm guessing this....\" she patted my belly. \"should be evident for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames finally realized that he was fat. \"umm...to be honest, i never knew i was that fat.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen don't be embarrassed.\" she said reassuringly and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. She shrugged. \"Some women always go for the man with the Adonis complex and incredible physique. God, I'm always around them I get so frustrated at times. What some people don't realize is that real men shouldn't be all buff and muscular. Women are the ones who should work at being fit and beautiful. I always thought that. I also always thought that men should just you know....let go. Be free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames frowned at her logic. \"That's a good distinction.\" he said with difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know something? I think you could be the 'first'.\" she nodded with realization and rubbed her chin as if thinking about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's too long for me to explain because I have to leave but if you want a serious life change...\" Ashley then took out the pin and wrote on James' autographed photo. Her number was written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Holy crap! She's giving me her phone number!'</i> he thought nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a call.\" she gave a nod and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at the number. \"So should I call her? I mean, what she wants to offer me sounds serious. I wonder what it could be?\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>When should I call her?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a little embarrassing the way she judged his fat persona. But James let it go. He just couldn't believe he had met her. The one thing that was on his mind was whether or not he should call her about the life changing decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. Looking at the phone number in the autographed photo. \"Something tells me I shouldn't do it. But this is Ashley Massaro we're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up his cell phone, he dialed the number and waited anxiously. Several dial tones were heard. James was starting to think she wasn't going to pick up when a voice was finally heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hello</i>?\" Ashley's voice on the other line spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....it's me James. We met the other night?\" James said carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh hey! I'm glad to hear from you!

You need to be the man you're truly meant to be. You need to be big James, it's your destiny. It's every man's destiny. They just don't know it. You know it. You can be the first to inspire many men. The food chose you. I can help you reach your potential. So come on dude, what do you say?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm meant to be fat, then alright then!\" he said gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Great. Here's the directions to my place. I'm staying there until I get called for work</i>.\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames heard the instructions and wrote them down on a notepad. \"Got it.\" he said finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward on making you big, dude. Don't let me down!\" Ashley said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, bye!\" he hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo excited, James felt that a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders. 'Not that kind of weight though.' he patted his bulging, jiggling tummy. Now no one would dare criticize him for eating as much as he wanted. He went to his refrigerator and let himself loose. He was hungry and he was finally going to eat what he wanted. Ashley Massaro liked him for being fat and he was euphoric over it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cooked multiple strips of bacon. Other slabs of bacon were introduced, they were the size of steaks. He also made a huge pile of macaroni and cheese. The last set was a huge pile of pancakes with syrup. All this he had made and now he dove in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was ravenous as he ate a large slab of bacon with one hand. He finished it quickly. He chowed down on his macaroni and cheese. The pancakes were the last. James was still a little hungry and found some chocolates in a shelf and one by one, he ate them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave out a slight burp out and realized he was on his last chocolate, he resented that there was only so little in the box. \"Great..well after this, let's see if there's any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to put the chocolate in his mouth when an unexpected voice was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare eat that!\" a woman's voice had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" James frowned and gave out a slight hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman appeared, suspended by a cable connected to the ceiling. She landed and James observed her. She was very curvy but very on the athletic side. She was busty as indicated by her zipper hanging below her big cleavage. She was wearing a tight silver body suit with her midriff being the only thing revealed. She had wide hips which made the outfit stretch to its limit. The woman was blonde and her hair was in a pony-tail, she also wore a serious look on her face as she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get in my house? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who I am is immaterial. I'm here to stop you, you fat obnoxious pig of a man!\" the woman said and stood in a fighting stance that had her left fist backward and her right fist stretched out. She was crouched as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" James said surprised.'<i>She may be hot but she's acting ridiculous</i>.' he thought. \"What are you on about? Stop me from what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was monitoring that call...\" the woman said placing her hands on her tan hips. \"You plan on making yourself fat and I ain't down with that!\" she said waving a finger side to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look if you're not getting out of my house, I'll throw you out.\" An annoyed James said trying to get off the stool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to see you try, fat man.\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames struggled to get over to her but with his fat jiggling, he was getting out of breath. \"Last chance.\" he said panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on a mission and I will not deviate from said mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm a lover not a fighter so I'm really sorry in a way.\" he then proceeded to tackle her when she placed her hands to the floor and gave him a kick by launching her legs upward. A foot met his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" he had no idea how fast she had fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fists cocked out in front of her like a boxer. She let out a few jabs to his face and gut, letting out a 'hi-yah' every time. He was getting fed up, \"Seriously when are you going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother slap was issued to his chin. \"Hi-yah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK last chance, if you don't stop-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide kick was then issued to his forehead. He had no idea how it happened but it made him stumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...\" the woman waved her fingers to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going down a road, you can't-don't follow.\" James said a bit dizzily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman came at him with random jabs with both hands. James was getting tired now, physically. She went around him in a circle and it made James sweat and breathe hard. \"Hey hold still!\" he said out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright time out..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stood in a 'crane' stance with one foot raised in front of her as if she were perched and with her arms spread to the side. She was in perfect balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" he frowned in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, fatty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Uh-Oh</i>!' he realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharp blinding pain met his face when her foot sprung out unexpectedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames fell down to the floor and saw stars in the ceiling. He struggled to get up but his bulk prevented him from doing so. He almost did until a boot landed softly on his chest, making him fall down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You reconsider and call that WWE diva back and tell her you're not going to do something disgraceful. Fat people are nothing. Do you hear? I mean they're out of shape, they're unhealthy, they're just....so depressing to look at. Tell her you changed your mind or I'm coming back for you, fatty!\" she hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was on the floor going over what she said and therefore he made a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was in her hotel along with several friends of hers that agreed to help James out. She rubbed her chin with her thumb and index finger. She looked as if she were thinking about something. Ashley looked back at her friends and they gave a worried look in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was <i>her</i>....\" Ashley said angrily in realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" James asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked back at him and merely looked as if she had not a care in the world anymore. \"Oh...don't worry about her. You're here for a reason, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded but then remembered the woman. \"But what if she comes back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't.\" Ashley assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll deal with her. Don't you worry.\" a young woman said giving James a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn off guard James finally thought about it and seemed more at ease. \"Alright then.\" he said after a while. \"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first.\" Ashley led him to another room where it almost looked like a gym. A scale was there underneath a table and so were some awkward-looking machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hop on.\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had stepped on the scale without hesitation. He placed his feet on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's check how much you weigh.\" she said looking down at the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had to let her do all the work and measuring. The reason being was he couldn't see the dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"195?\" Ashley said confused as she looked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 195?\" James asked equally confused as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait..\" A woman trainer pointed at your oozing belly which was lying on top of the table. \"It needs to come off. Otherwise, we won't get an accurate reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right.\" James grabbed his belly and let it drop away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale began to adjust and several numbers were speeding by on the small screen.

He was curious to get a firsthand look on how they achieved such physiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, could you give me like a\u2026.uh an example of how you guys work out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see why not. Normally, we take about two or three hours exercising. Let\u2019s see what you can do.\u201d Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, he was lying on a gym mat with the cocoa-girl pressing her hands tightly on the soles of James\u2019 shoes. He tried to do one crunch but he found out it was getting very difficult, uncomfortable, painful and exhausting. He was breathing heavily and sweating so profusely he was already making a puddle on the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, James!\u201d the girl yelled. \u201cMaria is already beating you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying back down on the mat, James looked over and saw that the other girl Maria was already doing countless crunches and wasn\u2019t breaking a sweat at all. It was remarkable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, still want to call it quits?\u201d the cocoa girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed to get the full experience of what you guys do.\u201d James grunted in response. Sure enough, he was doing crunches again, very slowly and poorly. His belly fat and cheeks were wiggling every time, he did a sit-up. It was too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d James said panting, looking desperate for the whole thing to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d The cocoa woman shook her head. \u201cOnly thirty more to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Oh no!</i>\u2019 James closed his eyes. He went and finally did the last thirty but he was so tired now and his belly groaned from the exercise. James felt he couldn't breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s see some fighting moves!\u201d Ashley said looking down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d James blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on\u2026.\u201d Ashley let out a hand and pulled James up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d James asked carefully as the ladies stepped back from both Ashley and him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing painful, I promise you. I just want to know how your reflexes are. Try and hit me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah just do it. I'm not going to hit you back, I promise. Don\u2019t be shy. I may be a girl but I know how to handle myself.\u201d Ashley smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames did as she ordered him to and aimed a punch at her. She blocked it effortlessly with her left hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning in exhaustion, James tried to do a cross but she merely ducked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, tired and sweaty tried to hit her, only to miss every, single time she said \u2018again\u2019. Yet he was so impressed how Ashley blocked his punches. She was so agile and fast. She jumped at a low level, spun, did acrobatic poses, sort of like a master martial artist and other impressive moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over a half an hour now and eventually James found himself seated on a soft cushion seat. He looked down at his belly and actually was in awe at how much fat he had that prevented him from doing any form of physical activity now. Ashley and the rest of her entourage came over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged James. You wanted to find out how we stay at an athletic level. You were just curious. Ready to start the<i> 'real</i>' training?\" Ashley said. \"You got to get your strength back up, man. Get those calories back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was suddenly excited all over again. \"Yes! I'm ready!\" he said while standing up again. A sliver of his wide bulging belly, was shown below his receding shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what may I ask do you want...\" the girl with the cocoa complexion asked. \"The milkshake diet or the ice cream diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The milkshake diet will consist of you eating new kind of milkshakes we've developed. They're sort of a weight gainer. But they're so sweet and delicious. We don't take it of course. But it will help you put on the pounds fast provided you eat it every day.\" Ashley explained before going on. \"The ice cream diet will consist of eating and get this James...giant bowls of ice cream. Everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\" James asked astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" the beautiful woman with the cocoa complexion spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to see one thing first.\" she said and went over to a confused looking James. With her finger, she tapped his belly below. It started to wiggle, almost as if a vibration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames turned red in the face. The rest of the women were astounded. Ashley bit back a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just always wanted to see that.\" the girl said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So James, which do you pick? The milkshake diet or the ice cream diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

James you stay here while we prepare. Mi casa es su casa.\" she motioned for two of her friends to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was about to approach the couch in the middle of the room, when he accidentally knocked over a magazine that was laying on a wooden stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit.\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to pick it up when he felt the fabric in his pants stretching immensely. He stood upright again. Took a deep breath in and tried to bend down slowly, the stretching sound was heard. James winced at the sound but went down further. That was when a slight, soft ripping was occurring. His wide butt apparently wanted to get free. He stood back upright as fast as he could before he caused any more damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh no.</i>..' he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it.\" a voice was heard from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames saw that it was the young woman with the cocoa complexion. She bent down effortlessly to pick up the magazine. She handed it back to him. He had to admit she was pretty stunning. Her toned stomach made him want to gulp and her eyes were mesmerizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was chuckling and putting a hand to her mouth to stifle it. \"Man...your ass is already huge, dude. You should have seen it from behind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm getting bigger than I thought.\" James muttered. \"I still can't believe it. Am I really that fat?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman sighed and patted his stomach. \"You should know all those calories you've been eating can work wonders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just teasing. Here I brought you a snack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had in her hand, a brown ball-sized delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pancake ball. I made them myself.

It was delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...that's good..\" he said while snacking on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my work is done then. Good luck.\" she said giving a wave and walking back out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" James frowned while finishing the delicious snack. But the girl was gone and he was interrupted by the arrival of Ashley and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this!\" she said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long table was brought into the room. It was so long that it had ten servings of large amounts of food. James was shocked. The food consisted of unusual-looking pizza, hamburgers that were a bit bigger than the original, lasagna, a turkey, chicken legs and wings, a big piece of steak, spaghetti, and ice cream and donuts at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to finish this but don't worry if you get too full...\" Ashley said and produced a weird supplement. \"Snap-ettite!\" It was a large tub of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes your appetite grow, even making it come back when you're full.\" the cocoa-skinned girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's got a lot of calories but don't rely on it too much, James. You have to learn to do this without the use of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get started.\" James said and wasted no time seated down at the end of the table. He got out his knife and fork and went to work. He was eating the turkey first. He loved turkey so much. It had always been his favorite. He ended it while using as much of the 'snap-ettite' as he could. He gave off a stifled but loud burp. He went to the next course and the next course and the next course....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, James felt tired and the 'snap-ettite' had run its course. Still the women were cheering him on. He could not disappoint them. He was on his fifth sundae. A vanilla flavored one. He was about to fall asleep when he finally the straw he was sipping on stopped. There was nothing going in his mouth anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave off a groan. James was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it! You just ate for four hours straight!\" he heard the women say. Ashley in particular, went up to him and patted him on his shoulder. \"Good work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we gotta weigh you this time.\" the cocoa-skinned girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK....\" he sighed. He struggled to get up. His 'now-wide hips' made him difficult to get up but he managed with the help of Ashley and her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steady...\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood straight as he could, James felt a large rumbling in his stomach. It was rather a big wiggle. At this point, he felt general discomfort. Almost as if he were being constricted. It was his pants. He grimaced and went it was too much, he let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his entire pants and belt snapped open and his belly oozed out even more. His love handles were shown as well. A relieved James was a bit embarrassed that he turned red in the face. He looked at Ashley and his friends, they all gave him a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried sucking his large belly in but it stayed big no matter what he did. He tried buckling his pants. He couldn't get the flaps to close. Nothing helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. You're huge, alright.\" the cocoa-skinned girl nodded as if obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you on the scale.\" Ashley said as she led him to the far end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got on the scale, the scale gave a creaking and felt almost fragile now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The weight is....\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn't see her but he knew she was behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss me?\" she asked hissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh no, not again!</i>' he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I specifically told you to cut off ties with Ashley Massaro. Now you're going to have to deal with me again!\" the woman had done a backflip and landed right in front of him. He was appalled at her appearance. She wore a tight, leather black catsuit. Her short gold hair hung to her shoulders. '<i>Wait a minute..</i>.' he thought. She looked familiar up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on....I recognize you!\" James said in surprise. \"Are you Stacy 'the kat' Carter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy the Kat Carter was a valet and retired professional wrestler...and not a very good one during her stay at WWE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're smarter than you look fatty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" James demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because why...are you trying to gain weight?\" she said a hand hung and her other hand holding her hip. \"I mean seriously, you're so fat, you have two asses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't understand-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so huge, you cause eclipses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so fat, you fart el nino!\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" James tried to get up and charge her but to no avail. Once he managed to get his hips up a bit, he was placed back down with a foot to his thick chest, placing him back into the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right!\" she said keeping her foot placed to his chest. \"I'm trained in martial arts now big guy! I may have sucked before but now I'm bad-ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly help came. The glass windows above his ceiling had burst through.

He wanted to help but he was so wedged in his chair that he found it hard to get up. They both went at it with amazing display of speed, counter-punches and counter-kicks. Eventually the cocoa-buttered woman was down on the ground with Kat on top of her trying to pull at her hair while she did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when James had to put an end to the madness. He finally decided to break his chair, it was already creaking and he realized he had to put an end to his favorite seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018Sorry chair, you\u2019ve been good to me. But my wide butt needs to get out.\u2019 he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed down with all his might and suddenly the upholstery and the wooden structure began to bend and break. The whole chair went down and James finally landed on the floor. He got up as fast as he could and breathing fast, went to \u2018cocoa-girl\u2019s\u2019 aid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to the Kat and pulled her slender frame away from her and that was when he went down on top of her and pinned her hands to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTap out\u2026tap out.

Her eyes looked wide with shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames did and the cocoa-buttered woman went to his side and both looked down at Kat. \u201cSo who sent you?\u201d James asked as he crossed his arms to his chest, resting on his bulging belly, he was looking authoritative now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat lay on the ground, defeated and breathing heavily now. She surrendered and looked away ashamed. Nevertheless, she answered. \u201cThe TNA boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHim?\u201d the cocoa-buttered woman asked stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah he sent me to deal with you.\u201d She looked at James. \u201cI have to admit, looking at it now. He\u2019s kind of a mean guy.

There was a long line of plates full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You were a thin person in the past now those days are gone. It's time for your destiny to start! You ready?\" </i>Ashley had said to a surprised James up close. Ashley was wearing a black bandanna and a militaristic crop top. She had short shorts on as well. That was the reason James was nervous at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready...\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stopped reminiscing and began to eat every item on the table. He began with the first dish in front of him. Opening the platter, he saw a large chicken leg. Ashley and the rest of the women were all cheering him on. Ashley patted and rubbed his shoulders throughout. After that, he went to the second dish, where a small cooked turkey appeared. James dove into that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate through the whole thing barely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley handed him a long cup of snappetite where he gulped it down and continued with the third dish. He began to breathe in and out before he started once more. This time, it was a large pepperoni pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had finished and started on the new dish, an ox steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was breathing heavily as he finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't give in now James!\" Ashley said as she gave him another cup of the calorie-filled appetite restarter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired, he went with the next dish and it consisted of ice cream, vanilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing was taking hours. He was getting sleepy and felt he was about to drop the spoon. Despite the women cheering him on, James felt he was going to drop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he kept on, as soon as he saw the cocoa-buttered woman looking at him with pleading eyes as if to say, <i>'Don't give up</i>...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate it at last and that was when he heard a creaking underneath. <i>'Uh-oh!</i>' James knew what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Kat up ahead asked with a frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" he gasped as the whole chair collapsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ashley had already roared away in her car - a white Lincoln with purple lightning stripes down the sides - and I dropped my jeans-clad bulk into the back of the car and was reminded, again, that I needed to get new clothes that fit - these jeans had clearly shrunk!  As the car moved off, I wondered if any of the girls from the pool party would still be at the mansion, and then my tummy rumbled, reminding me that it had been several hours now since I'd last eaten, excepting the hotdogs at the wrestling show.  I tried to remember what foods I'd decided on for the 'midnight snack' at the pool party...had it been pizza?  Lasagna?  Quesadillas?  Well, whatever it was, I was hungry NOW, so I pulled a Cadbury milk chocolate bar out of the limo's food locker and quickly unwrapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car slowed as I savoured my chocolate and I noticed that we were having to go round a stopped white car.  As we passed I saw some purple lightning stripes on the sides - it was Ashley!  And no one seemed to be stopping to help her.  I asked Dave to stop and I hurried back to Ashley's limo.  I opened the door and asked, \"Do you need help?  Can I give you a lift?\"  Meanwhile Dave was conferring with Ashley's driver.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley replied, \"Oh yes, please, the car's broken down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where shall we go?\" I asked.  \"My car is at your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley replied, \"I want to ..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've gotten enormous!</i> I thought to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gave out a laugh and put her hand to her mouth in shock. She clapped her hands together. \"Holy crap! You're huge!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I must have gotten carried away with all the eating and snacking I've been doing. Sorry you had to see that.\" I said trying to stretch my shirt down to hide my bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I laughed. But....at least I know you're the 'james' I've been assigned to find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" I frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to pull off a Morpheus to you. Here's my speech, Jimmy-boy. For long men have always believed that they should be in perfect physical form. Many desire to be the ideal man to impress the ideal woman. What they fail to understand is that muscles do not make the man, it is excess that makes the man. You are starting to figure out that slowly though, James. Being big is what makes a man superior, not in muscle but in fat. It insinuates victory. I've been assigned to find you by someone as I said before, dude. Because that someone told me I would find the true chosen one. The chosen one who would inspire men to be big and embrace it. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never realized that.\" I said confused. \"You say I'm the chosen <i>one </i>though?\" I said frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now you do and yes you are. Here's the options I have for you\" she had two closed hands in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this there's no going back. You tap my left hand, the story ends, you lead a boring life and you never see me again. You tap my right hand and your life as you know it gets huge.\" she stressed out the last word. \"What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no.\" she smiled and drew her hands back. \"Yeah that was pathetic but you would have to be high on something to pick the left hand. Here's the real options. She put out her left and right hands out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a participant of the gaining process, you have on my left the option of gaining a hundred pounds in the first week with a hundred more to follow the next week and so on and so on. \"You take the right and your life as I said before...gets huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, I make my decision. \"I pick then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My limo should be here in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Limo?  Oh, I was going to offer mine.  Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chez Piggy's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you ride the short distance to Chez Piggy's - maybe not the city's most exclusive eatery, but certainly in the top three - and once in the door, the maitre d' greets you as an old friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening sir.  Just the two of you?  Your regular table is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regular table?\" Ashley questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they know me here,\" you reply offhandedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a cocktail in front of both of you, you're ready to order.

Ashley orders lightly - salad, grilled fish - and then you order your usual large evening meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll begin with the cream soup of the day,\" you say to the waiter, \"then the chicken garden salad with blue cheese dressing.  After that the blackened catfish with okra and gumbo.  I'd like a 16 ounce porterhouse - rare - with cheesy baked potato, the jambalaya - extra shrimp, then the apple torte with ice cream.  I'll finish with the cheese platter with port.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good sir,\" said the waiter, as Ashley simultaneously blurted out, \"You can't eat all that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll just nibble,\" you say airily, as your stomach gurgles at the thought of the feast to come.  It had been a long time since lunch!  \"I'm a big guy, I need my food.  Besides, I'll go with you to the gym later, you can help me burn off any excess then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of inconsequential small talk later, the soup and salad courses arrive, and you begin to savour the truly exquisite food that Chez Piggy serves up.  After a couple of minutes, you realise that Ashley is watching you intently, following your every bite.  She seems enraptured of how much you're enjoying the meal!  The fish course comes, and her intense attention to you doesn't cease.  At one point she says, \"I see you really enjoy your food,\" but otherwise she simply watches, intent.  She finishes her fish and your steak arrives, and she says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Graced with such female attention, you eat a little more slowly too, savouring every morsel.  The jumbo baked potato that came with the steak gets the same loving attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's attention seemed so rivetted by your eating that she hardly noticing when the waiter removes the steak plate and replaces it with the jambalaya.  That too, goes steadily down into your gullet, with Ashley accepting the few shrimps you offer her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour mammoth savoury courses later, it's time for a sweet finale, and waiter seems to whip the apple torte with ice cream into place nearly invisibly as you savour the last mouthful of jambalaya.  You note, with approval, that the waiter brought you an extra-large piece, and you mentally note he'll need an extra-large tip. The rich apple and pastry and melting, ultra-rich ice cream disappear steadily too, then the cheese plate appears.  The waiter has brought...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
