            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Late Spring, Summer's just around the corner. You, Nick Lewis, were working with a group of students in the science lab after school. It was Friday night, and normally you'd have a multitude of better things to do, but when a couple of pals in on the project told you what they were up to, it sounded too good to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't one of the smarter teens there, so you were relegated to acting as an assistant, fetching tools and equipment and whatever those doing the actual science needed. Apparently, one of the guys there had a big ground-breaking scientist father who accidentally left some notes out on an interesting new serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupposedly, according to the notes, pouring the concoction over human skin should cause the cells to bunch closer together, hardening the skin into its own near-bulletproof armor. Sean, the scientist's son, did his best to quickly copy as much of the notes down as he could, and collect some of the materials from home and smuggle them into school. It's a miracle he didn't get caught, and now here you all are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all there's about twelve of you in on this. Sean told a friend, who told a friend or two, who told a friend, and so on until you got to where you are. Seven boys and five girls, all excited to see if everyone here can contribute to create this miracle serum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat none of you knew, however, is that due to a large number of reasons, you all got the serum very, very wrong. Some of the notes were sloppily taken, some numbers were written incorrectly, some people couldn't quite read the handwriting correctly, someone got their math off, someone used the wrong temperature, someone didn't measure quite right. It was a perfect storm of mistakes to create an incredible, yet terrible outcome. If anyone had done just one more thing right or just one more thing wrong, it would have been a simple failure. But no, as if a higher power demanded it, you all screwed up just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the final stages of creating the serum, the mixture got too heated and started to bubble and rattle the glass it was being heated in. Erin, one of the girls there, tried to quickly shut off the heat, but it was far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass exploded and mixture splashed over everyone. Everyone rushed to the emergency chemical showers, quickly rinsing off the mixture. But it was too late. The new serum, accidentally created by all of you, already soaked into your skin and began its work. Rather than hardening your skin, it would condense your cells and cause each and every one of you to shrink down to just a couple of inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how fast-acting was your new serum? When and where do you, Nick Lewis, shrink?</span></div></div>",

All twelve were good students with a path to potentially successful futures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now? All of that is likely gone. Not even ten minutes after being coated in the dastardly liquid, all twelve students fell to the ground and passed out, as their bodies reacted strangely to the serum. Condensing, condensing, condensing. More importantly, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking. Their bodies dwindled in size. Soon they were all very tiny, just a couple of inches tall. Nothing compared to their previous heights, even the shortest among them (Laura at 5'1\", if you're curious).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you, Nick Lewis, woke up, you were in shock and awe of your surroundings. Everything was massive. Except you. And your classmates. When the rest woke up, some were too in shock to speak. Some cried. Some were amazing and excited at what had happened. You didn't know how to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, everyone collected their emotions enough to gather and speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all started to deliberate on your plan.</span></div></div>",

A viscious, sadistic and nasty girl through and through, she's the most popular girl in the entire place. She couldn't see your tiny forms on the floor in front of her. Her gaze was straight forward as she nattered or rather thundered on the phone. Every step brought her feet, clad in knee high platform boots that could crush a tank to dust without their owner so much as noticing, thundering towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople start to panic as it dawned on them that they were in trouble. Some began to bolt, others stayed frozen in fear. Niamh kept walking and walking...</span></div></div>",

So if gore of any kind is not your thing, maybe go read a different chapter instead)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of you were too scared to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is familiar with the phrase fight or flight. Meaning when faced with a threat, do you face it down or try to outrun it. But there is a lesser known third F.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the phrase \"Fight or flight\" being so common, you'd be surprised at how many people actually fell under Freeze. It's a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all twelve of you, five of you were frozen in your tracks. Yourself included. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart never pounded harder in your entire life as it did right now, as Niamh's massive boots pounded into the ground, sending tremors you felt in your very bones rattle your whole being. One would think it should be easy to see the pattern of her stride and predict exactly where her meteoric footfalls would land. But you're dealing with life an a whole new scale, and it's just impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour life really does flash before your eyes before it's ready to go. A flash is exactly what it is. When you hear that term, you think you'll see everything on fast forward really quickly. But in reality, it was a series of images, some people you cared about, some people you hated, your favorite video game, last Tuesday when you had spaghetti for dinner. It was just a quick series of images that passed by so fast you're not sure if it really happened. But the last one was Niamh's face, from an angle below you, since you're usually taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the dusty, ridged sole rise into the air and eclipse the sky. It's the most terrifying thing you've ever seen. Your life is over, and in the peak moment of terror you are simultaneously filled with a fear like no other that left you without the ability to scream, as well as the calm that washes over your very soul, knowing there's nothing you can do to change this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it's over. The front of her sole is behind you. Her heel is in front of you. You were caught in the raised instep of her platform boot. Your life was spared. Your extremities go numb, as your brain has given up on trying to fully process the wave of physical signals your body has been launching its way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even realize, but you had turned around to watch Niamh keep walking. You are numb to feeling for the moment, overwhelmed by your own cocktail of emotions exploding inside you. The numbness comes in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriana was frozen, like you. You see the exact moment the terror solidified in her eyes. The image of where she was standing was replaced with Niamh's platform boot. You heard a terrible sound, like a water balloon from the inside exploding from too much pressure, coupled with the sound of someone breaking an entire bundle of sticks in half at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity passed between when you heard that sound and your brain processed what exactly it was. You only glanced at the spot where Briana stood for a split second. There was a lumpy pile of flesh there, surrounded by a massive pool of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiamh's footsteps did not falter or change pace in the slightest. She didn't even notice what she had done. She didn't have a clue that her following footsteps were leaving a red splotch on the tile with every placement of her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreezing in the face of danger is not what killed Briana. Besides Niamh's boot, what actually killed Briana was the cruelty of fate, or the randomness and lack of caring of reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn ran, after all. John did not freeze like Briana, he fled. He saw the horror that was Briana's fate. He saw Niamh's approaching feet. He was already running, so he tried to get out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's problem was not miscalculation. He successfully maneuvered himself out of the path of the boot that crushed Briana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's problem was distraction. He was so drawn to the liquefied remains of Briana stuck to the bottom of Niamh's boot, that while he successfully ran out of the path that that foot traveled, he had almost completely ignored the other one. From your perspective, it almost looked as if he tried to run underneath her left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, John fared no better against the careless saunter of the school's queen bee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered your life flashing before your eyes. What you do not remember is the moments between seeing John disappear and sitting on your hands and knees with a pool of your own vomit underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were distracted from your pool of sick as the now-distant rhythmic footfalls stopped. You looked up and saw Niamh turn around and look down the hall in your general direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the rest of your hearing kicked back in. Several of your other shrunken classmates were screaming and crying in absolute terror. You don't blame them. But you think it got Niamh's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her eyes focus on the two dark pools of blood, and then follow the splotchy trail that led to her. You could see her face wrinkle in confusion as she lifted her foot, grabbing it with her hand to get a better look at the underside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross,\" was all she had to say. She put her foot back down and started to look at the rest of you. You could barely make out her whispering, \"What the fuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to come back this way. It was like before, the thunderous tremors caused by her footsteps increasing as she drew near. She reached down and grabbed Sean up off the floor. He was somewhat far away, but you could still see the tears streaking down his face and his terrified expression as Niamh's delicate, pale fingers wrapped around his body and lifted him into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiamh looked him over, and you saw her facial expression change. She was clearly still somewhat confused, but now she knew a bit more about what was going on here. She looked back at all of you, and made her way towards her next nearest classmate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crouched down to snatch up David, the rest of you had begun to flee. Even those of you who were formerly frozen. You all ran in the opposite direction, hoping to hide or escape Niamh by any means necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you, Sean, Vanessa, Will, Rob, Jennifer, Laura, Eric, Tiffany, and David are still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiamh has captured Sean and David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of you are running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho escapes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. All of you escape. Niamh only manages to capture Sean and David, the rest of you found somewhere to hide. Once Niamh leaves, you re-gather to discuss what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Several of you escape, but Niamh captures many of you. Whether you're among the captured or the escaped is up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. None of you escape. Niamh's stride is too big for you, she has an easy time catching up to and capturing each and every last one of you. You're all in her hands, now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You run for your life. The adrenaline surges through your body and forces you to <i>go</i>. You don't think you've ever run faster in all your years. For just a moment, you forget your terror. You just relish the feeling of running, all-out sprinting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that enjoyment is quashed within seconds. You can <i>feel</i> Niamh catching up. The tremors grow more intense very quickly, only stopping for a few moments here and there. And each time they stop, you can hear the yelling of one of your shrunken classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're already running faster than ever before in your life, but from the earthquakes you can tell it still isn't fast enough. You try to mentally channel your adrenaline to somehow make you faster. You try to pray that somehow you will suddenly gain a burst of speed and escape. You're currently between classrooms, so trying to duck into a doorway and hide isn't an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run out of time to hope as a shadow stretches over you, and giant, pale, tree trunk-like fingers stretch out ahead of you and wrap around, closing in and sealing you in her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your stomach drop as it feels like you're launched into the air on a rocket ship. In reality, Niamh's just lifting her hand. In moments you're shoved into her other hand, with your other captured classmates. She has this hand, her right hand, pressed against the upper area of her stomach so that it's easier to hold so many of you. When looking up, instead of seeing her enormous face, instead you are shaded by the outcropping that is her breasts. They were pretty decent before, but seeing them above you, completely dwarfing you, even contained within her bra and shirt, makes you feel even smaller than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were among the last that needed to be collected. Only two of you came after. You quickly did a head count, remembering to subtract Briana and John, and realized Niamh had you all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of you were crying. Others had blank stares. And still yet, some of you peered over the edge of Niamh's hand, as if maybe you could survive the fall. You specifically, you were just watching everyone else. You were feeling the rhythmic sway as Niamh carried all of you. She carried you all back into the lab you had escaped from. The place of regret, where meddling with science you didn't understand changed your lives forever. And ended Briana and John's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiamh walked around the room, checking through cabinets. She eventually pulled out a bin, set it on one of the counters, and deposited you all inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood above you, looking down at all of you cowering in the bin. This is the closest you've been to her face where you could actually see it. You've always been used to being almost a foot taller than her, and looking down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even before today that's all you had. While you were taller than Niamh and could look down at her in that regard, she won out in every other plane. On the popularity scale, you're like a B-, maybe a B. Not too shabby, but you're nothing compared to Niamh. She wasn't even an A+, she was the S Rank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now you've lost even that, as she towers over all of you. She was smiling now, maybe a bit excited. You hated to admit it, but she was pretty hot. It's not like you got to be the school's queen bee by not being a looker, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea how you losers wound up like this, but this is the craziest shit I've ever seen. Stay here while I clean up the mess you made,\" she said, her face turning to disgust as she says the last part. She walks away, and off in the distance you hear the ripping of paper towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mess <i>we</i> made?\" Tiffany asks incredulously. \"<i>Mess</i>?\" she seethes. That <i>mess</i> is our friends! <i>People</i>!\" Tiffany is beginning to hyperventilate. You quickly make your way over to her to try to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be alright, we'll make it through this,\" you say to her quietly, while hugging her to you, as her tears begin to flow. You and her both know these are empty words, but it's not about whether it's true. It's just about the comforting nature of hearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiamh's back after a few minutes, still giddy about her find. She speaks down to all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'd you losers like, even do? I can't imagine it was on purpose, did you mess something up with a lab experiment in here? I cleaned up your mess by the way, you're <i>welcome</i>,\" she said, as if we were really supposed to be grateful for it. \"I mean, I guess it would make sense if it were on purpose. There's no better cause then to give yourselves to <i>me</i>,\" she said, her eyes looking away and her hand gesturing at her, indicating she's clearly being facetious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's see here, there's...\" she pauses to count all of you, \"ten of you here. That's a lot of little people,\" she laughs. \"Well, I guess there <i>used</i> to be twelve, huh? Sorry about that,\" she says, but the rolling of her eyes and the sigh she gives indicate she doesn't care at all. \"Anyway, ten is a lot,\" she says, musing to herself. She kind of looks up, the wheels in her head clearly turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiamh is deciding whether she wants to keep all ten of you. What does she decide?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Ten tiny little pets (or toys...)? Sounds pretty ideal. She keeps all ten of you to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Ten tiny people <i>is</i> a lot. Niamh decides to divide you all between her and her closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Two words. <b>SNAPCHAT GIVEAWAY!</b> Niamh actually takes to social media to auction you guys off, one by one, to her Snapchat followers. You're all split up, and Niamh only keeps one or two of you to herself.</span></div></div>",

So I guess I'll call up the girls and we can divvy you guys up,\" Niamh says down to you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks away, her fingers tapping quickly on her phone. Vanessa seems to be beginning to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gonna split us up! I don't want to be split up, we're all we have. We need each other!\" she practically cries. Her tears had only just begun to dry from the loss of your friends, but now her cheeks are wet again thinking of all of you being split up. David and Laura are doing their best to comfort her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty though, you find the thought equally upsetting. You were all in this together, and soon you'll be going your separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiamh is back before long with a much smaller container that reminds you of tupperware. It has holes stabbed into the lid, and she's prying it off. It's easy to gather you'll all be going in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't give any warning or ask for permission, she just starts grabbing you all, one or two at a time, and dropping you into the plastic container. It's very unpleasant, having a giant hand just grab you without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, you don't have a lot of room, all ten of you squished into the container. But the slight claustrophobia is somewhat comforting, as you're all close to one another. The material of the container is opaque, so you can't really see outside. But you're able to figure out when Niamh shoves the container into her purse. You all huddle together and speak softly among yourselves, telling each other to be brave and that it'll be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while has passed, you've felt lots of swaying and moving and familiar sounds like a car and chatter. Eventually you feel the container lifted out of the purse, and the ceiling is pried away. Looking up, you see the gigantic faces of Niamh, Liv, Makayla, and Madison looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, they are <i>so</i> cute!\" Madison squeals. Her high voice was piercing to your small ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many do we get?\" Liv asked cooly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's four of us and ten of them. Do the math, Liv. Two of us get two, and two of us get three,\" Niamh replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright, but which of us get three?\" Makayla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously I get three. Which of you bitches gets three as well depends,\" Niamh responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on what?\" Liv asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna hear what your plans are. Then I'll decide who gets three,\" Niamh says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison goes first. Madison is a cute blonde girl. She always seemed on the somewhat nicer side of the popular squad, but that's not necessarily saying a lot. She's on the shorter end, but she was still taller than Niamh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my little people will probably be my little pets. I'll get them cute little jars with their names on them, or ooh maybe a cage. That could be cute because I could watch them play together. We can chill in our jammies and watch movies. And they'll be all over my insta, they'll get me so many followers,\" Madison laid out her plans. Niamh nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Liv's turn. Liv has tanner skin, and a much dirtier blonde hair color than Madison. Liv always had a really chill demeanor about her, she was never as animated as some of the other girls. She was extremely pretty, and with her status coupled with her laid-back demeanor, it's hard to not feel like you need to impress her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make mine serve me. I could use the pampering. They can expect to be giving a lot of foot rubs. And they can feed me grapes,\" she paused, looking down at us, her expression unchanging, \"like a goddess.\" Niamh seemed more impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was Makayla's turn. Makayla was a brunette, with a warmer skin tone. She always seemed a little...well, it was hard to put into words. She often made quips when hanging around Niamh, and sometimes the stuff she said was kind of messed up. You think maybe she had a gear loose or something. Something was definitely off about her. Her response only proved you right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IDK, I'm gonna make 'em work hard as fuck, though. Maybe I'll make the little shits lick my shoes clean, or something else depraved. I know they'll work their little asses off though because if they don't, I'll eat 'em.\" Makayla said. She seemed kind of excited about getting to work some of you to the bone. She was definitely scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiamh deliberated for a bit, before finally saying \"Alright, I've decided. Liv gets three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiv's expression didn't change. Madison looked disappointed. Makayla's frightening look hadn't really dissipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all that was left was actually divvying you up. Who do you wind up with?</span></div></div>",

They really were just treating all of your peers as nothing but little things that were free for the taking, trading them like they were candy at the end of a long halloween night. As you saw the blonde titan named Madison set Jennifer down in her lap, the enormous pillars of her fingers came crashing down above you, wrapping around your body as she raised you high in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You were petrified in fear as the giant bubbly face lit up upon your inspection, the blonde woman giggling as she turned you around to get a full look at your condition. She pressed her finger into your back as to playfully poke you, before turning you around and giving you a wet kiss, leaving an imprint of lipstick as she set you on her lap next to Jennifer. As the denim from her jeans folded underneath you, she looked up at the other three girls who were still arguing over who got who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've got mine!\" Madison proudly announced to her group, nodding down at the two of you. You thought about it for a moment, and were thankful that you got the easiest of all the options on the table. Sure it wasn't going to be ideal, living with some teenage girl who viewed you and Jennifer as pets that might garner her more social media fame, but the alternatives were becoming a slave, toy and potential snack with the other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, that's fine with me.\" Said Niamh as she looked at who Madison had captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Me too.\" Replied Liv, who went right back to fighting over the others with Makayla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Awww, I kind of wanted that little dude.\" Boomed Makayla as she crawled over to Madison, looking down at her lap, and more specifically you. \"He looked like he would've been tasty!\" She laughed, before snapping her teeth in front of you, making you and Jennifer flinch and fall backwards onto Madison's jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Stop it! Don't tease my pets!\" Cried Madison, as she scooped the two of you into her palm, nestling you against the warm skin of her cheeks, rosy with excitement. \"I can't have them getting hurt! I need them for my Instagram!\" Makayla backed off, chuckling as she went back to deciding who went with who. \"Alright, thanks Niamh! I need to get home, but I really appreciate it!\" She started to open her purse, bringing her hand down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"See you later! Have fun with your little people!\" Replied Niamh, who went right back to her arguments with the other two. The hand sloped as you and Jennifer slid down into the bag, you landing first onto the expensive designer purse, and Jennifer landing right on top of you as she zipped up the top. As the room began to move, you turned to Jennifer, slipping her off of you and starting to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Does this mean that all our friends are going to be- Slaves?\" You asked, terrified of what their fate had in store as a gigantic tube of lipstick loomed in the background. Jennifer got up and sat down on a pack of tissues as she looked solemn, right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't think it's best to focus on that. Let's just go with whatever's happening for us right now, and worry about them after we escape. After all, there is no saving them if we don't save ourselves.\" She said, with you nodding to affirm her statement. All you could do was wait for the purse to be opened, and for the woman who thought of herself as your owner to retrieve you. Eventually, the light opened revealing</span></div></div>",

Sean took on a leadership role, though your group was clearly working decently as a psuedo-democracy. You split up into four groups of three, and check different parts of the school. It seems like no one else was left. You guys were all alone in these massive halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had all decided to meet up at the cafeteria once done scouting. It was easy enough to find food that you could eat from for the weekend. It's not like you all ate that much at your new size. Finding somewhere to sleep was a little tougher.You eventually discovered a backpack that was left behind. It was on its side, zipper open. A home ready to be made. So you all took trips carrying food back to the backpack so you could use it as a temporary hideout until Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing the weekend was difficult. Time really dragged on, since so much of the world was shut off to you since you couldn't reach anything. Even formerly short distances felt more like miles now. Most of your time was spent together, talking, getting to know each other better, playing games. It was all you could do to pass the time. Once Sunday night rolled around, everyone was nearly too excited to sleep. You all stayed up extra late, and eventually even the sturdiest of you passed out due to exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to Briana shaking you awake. You open your eyes, bleary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh..?\" you mutter, looking around. Despite the lip of the backpack being mostly closed, the light that did manage to filter in was very bright. That wasn't sunlight, that was the bright overhead artificial lights. Oh yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonday morning! You sat up, noticing that those already awake were waking those harder to get up. Soon you were all awake, and formulating. Will took a peek outside your little backpack home. The digital clock display that hung from the ceiling in the middle of the hall read 7:06 am. Classes weren't too far from starting. Your plan to get help needs to go into action soon. Thankfully, the backpack was really close to a nearby classroom, so help wouldn't be far. Either you could get lucky, and get a teacher's attention, or you could get the attention of another student and have them bring you to a teacher for help. Either way, help would be had for the twelve of you. You would be returned to your normal heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat room was your bag-hideout outside of?</span></div></div>",

Even crouching, she loomed above you all like a small mountain. Her usually stern expression was replaced by a mixture of disbelief and confusion. The bag fell from her hands with a resounding <i>THUD</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she reached out a hand. It descended ominously like a pale UFO, capable of abducting several of you at once. You scrambled away from the incoming fingers, the massive digits faltering as Miss Sinclair noticed your tiny cowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry\u2026 I didn't mean to frighten you.\u201d The giant teacher chewed her lower lip sheepishly. You watched her lower both hands onto the floor, this time leaving some space between them and the shrunken troupe of students. Her green eyes looked down at you expectantly. Laura, one of your more brave classmates, was the first to climb into the plush field of her palms. The rest of you followed closely, everyone weary but optimistic. You'd been hoping to get a teacher's attention. Now you were literally putting your lives in her hands. They formed a protective cup, cradling you within walls of warm skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Sinclair stood, keeping her palms as steady as possible. She held them close to her stomach as she gingerly carried you into the classroom, leaving you in the shadow of her ample chest. Somewhere in her late 30's, the titanic brunette was well-developed with mature curves. Her white blouse looked a little overtaxed by the weight of a generous bosom. It subtly heaved with every step, the cumbersome sway something you wouldn't have noticed at normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lotion-scented floor beneath you opened as she deposited everyone onto her desk. A gigantic mug dwarfed the whole group, dominating the flat surface littered with books and paperwork. Miss Sinclair sat in her chair, leaning forward until her face hovered a few inches (to her) above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be perfectly honest, I have no idea how this could've happened.\" She thundered, bathing you in humid coffee-breath. Your eyes were drawn to her plump lips, which were neatly coated in dark red. Pristine teeth and a monsterous tongue flashed behind them while she spoke. \u201cWhatever the case may be, I\u2019m assuming you all are in need of some assis-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Sinclair was cut off by the unceremonious ring of the school bell. Class was starting! Unwilling to expose you to a herd of unruly teenagers, she hid you as quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She swept you into the depths of her mug, wincing as you land in the lukewarm dregs of her coffee. She'll head to the Teacher's Lounge right after first period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She dumps the group into the first container she can find in her bag. Unfortunately, it's the one filled with her lunch: a hearty chicken salad.

You'd later realize that it was just a few students walking by, chatting among themselves, but at the moment none of you were quite thinking. Between panic and disorganization, the entire group scattered almost immediately, running screaming in all directions. Adrenaline coursed through you and you ended up running too, even as you yelled out at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Stay together!\" You cried, no one heeding your orders as you ran to take shelter by a nearby chair leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was pounding as waiting in the shadow of the cold metal, glancing out into the room, expecting to see shoes and feet stomping by any second. You waited, probably for a lot longer than you should have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes had passed by the time you had worked up the courage to take a step forward. The hallways beyond were quiet, so you were fairly sure no one was going to burst into the room. Unfortunately, no one else who had shrunken was immediately visible. Your first thought was to search for the others, but soon you though better. If you spent the next few hours searching around the room, you might miss a chance to grow back or end up getting too hungry to continue on. Not to mention, the others might have already left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was better this way....split up you could all cover more ground. If anyone of you found someone and got their attention, the rest of you could be saved. So it seemed to be in your best interest to find help. You looked up, eyes falling on the clock on the wall. The normal school day was technically over, but even on a Friday there would be stuff hapening after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone, probably Rob, had suggested the locker rooms, mentioning the volleyball team. Even if they weren't in, there was bound to be at least one team coming and and out on the weekend. That could be a good option, even if the gym was a way's away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option would be the classroom used for detention. It was only a few classrooms away and given the size of Hyperion High, there was guaranteed to be at least one misbehaving student in there, not to mention a teacher keeping an eye on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last option would be the teacher's lounge, teachers always stayed later than students, so it would be a sure chance to find someone (hopefully not the one or two teachers you didn't get along with). Like the locker room it was a ways away, but at least no one would assume you were spying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you go?</span></div></div>",

They were now getting changed, and you had to admit this was always a fantasy of yours, you just never imagined you would be shrunken while it happened. The players on the team varied greatly from one another, and you got a look at all of them from here. There were several options that seemed appealing, and you took in your options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The first was Carly, a nice girl with hair dyed purple. She had a few piercings in her nose, and from the view that you got watching her take off her bra it looks like she continued the trend with her nipples. Her figure was quite appealing, with curves and a little bit of pudge on her stomach, but she was nice and that's what you were looking for at this size. She was quite lonely, and you had always been a sort of acquaintance to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The second girl was Nicole, a former friend of yours that parted ways a year or so ago. She was nice, and had brown hair cut short. Her body was thin, with not that big of breasts and a tight ass. You never really figured out why you guys stopped hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The third girl was Patty, a sadistic girl with crazy athletic ability. She was six foot two, and incredibly tone in muscle, supposedly being able to out lift most of the guys in school. Being caught by her would be a bad outcome, no matter how plump her ass and huge her boobs were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Deciding on who to target, you</span></div></div>",

She was the nicest nonetheless, and you decided to reach out to her for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You ran through the room, your feet pushing off of the cold tile floor, until your sprint left you at the giant bare right foot of Carly, sitting on the bench on her phone.

There was no signs of other shrunken people having gone before you, and the halls seemed to be empty. Everyone who was staying had already seemed to have reached their destination, leading to a larger congregation of people who you could get's attention in certain spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were certain that there had to be some teachers still lingering about, and that suspicion was soon confirmed after you reached the slightly cracked door to their lounge, and squeezed yourself inside. There were about four women, all teachers, and all of whom were simply lounging, hence the name of their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You recognized three of the teachers, Miss King, Ms Long, and Miss Ross. Miss King was a teacher you had in the past, a simple math teacher who was on the younger side of things, being no older than thirty. She didn't have too great of a body, but the boys swooned over her face more than anything else, the cute woman having long blonde hair to compliment her looks. She was a kind woman, and almost sure to help out a student in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ms Long however, was not a kind woman. An Indian woman in her early thirties, the curvy beauty was your current Biology teacher, and she had it out for you. Almost during every class period, she would call you out for the most minuscule of offenses, and out of fear what she would do to you at your current height, you decided it might be best to avoid the sexy beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Miss Ross was a teacher in the grade above you, and you had heard stories from your friends that she joked around with the class, acting more as a friend than an instructor. She was an older woman, in her early forties with brown hair, but her body seemed to age like a fine wine, nothing diminishing from her beautiful face, ample breasts, and fat ass besides a few wrinkles. The woman was apparently no stranger to telling her students about sexual experiences she had, or parties she had attended, often giving vivid details of her life. Going with her might be a fun experience, but not the most reliable of scenarios, as there was not telling what she would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The final teacher was a Latina woman, with a large rump but lacking in the breast region. She looked like she had just gotten out of college, and was in her early twenties. Contacting the woman would be a toss up, no way to tell what her intentions were with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then decided to</span></div></div>",

Already freaking out, you recognized the skin tone as belonging to the nightmare of a teacher Ms Long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were pulled up, before soon facing the giantess directly. She was pretty, no doubt about it, but the intentions she had with you were all but good based on your previous interactions with her. Without saying anything as to draw the attention of the other teachers, you soon found yourself in free fall, before landing in the open cleavage she was sporting. The skin was soft, and scented of perfume, but the sweat emitted from her pores soon greeted you, leaving you helpless to stop the Indian woman from carrying out her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She walked out of the room, and headed towards one of the faculty restrooms with a lock on the door, before tugging you from your flesh prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, well, well. Here I was thinking I was lucky having just found some shrunken boy, but now it turns out I found you Nick? How great is this.\" She said menacingly, the hot air emitting from her breath feeling like you were getting blasted by some kind of car heating system. \"Now my dear little Mr.Lewis, how exactly did you end up being so... delicate?\" She questioned, a grin being worn on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You thought about your options, something that Ms Long had seemingly noticed, before giving you a stomach turning threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now Mr Lewis, need I remind you what unfortunate scenarios you could get yourself into if you don't tell me? I mean, a lot of things could happen with you at your current size.\" You smelt the peppermint emerge from her lips as she warned of the consequences.

As you can see, I have Mr Lewis here already, and he told me he was simply walking the hallways alone and didn't know how it had happened.\" She shook you slightly in her hand, as if to emphasize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incidentally, I was going to let him stay safe and comfortable up top here, while I carried him. But for lying to me, he's going to have to ride in the back instead now! I hope nobody else is planning on lying to me like that as well, or it could get awfully crowded back there with him!\" Your teacher threatened. Then without further warning, as both your's and your friend's eyes widened in shock, she took the hand that was holding you in it, and roughly crammed you down the back of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to object as you were forced down into the darkness, pressed against the warm, soft flesh of your teacher's cheeks, but she just put one finger delicately against your back, and shoved you right down in between them. Your screams were swallowed up with you by the Indian giantess's soft, fleshy mounds. They registered to Ms Long as nothing more than a mild buzzing sensation in her crack, where her new pet Nick was held securely in place by her well-toned glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing tucked into your teacher's curves might have been cozy and comfortable up front, but in the back was a different matter. The soft yet unyielding walls had engulfed you entirely, radiating relentless heat that soon had you sweating profusely. The tons of flesh on either side of you pressed down against each other at the same time, crushing you like a vice and rendering you unable to move an inch against the fleshy walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time she took a step her hips would swing dramatically to the side in the process, then come to a jarring, crashing halt every time her feet hit the floor. But this was still better than when she sat down, at times, at which point the pressure became so great that you struggled to breath just enough to stay alive. Either way made it impossible to fall asleep like you had earlier, of course, though you still couldn't see or hear anything that was going on from inside your fleshy prison. All you could do was lie there, and endure Ms Long's sadistic punishment as best as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ms Long seemed to go still for an unusually long moment. Then the walls of flesh around you parted slightly, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happens next?</b><br>\r\n- Option 1: Vanessa lied and was found out; your prison's about to get more cramped.<br>\r\n- Option 2: Vanessa lied, but got away with it.

You all respect him very much<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom is an elementary school teacher. She loves kids, which is why she had so many. And now, as a teacher, in a way she has many more. She's pretty nice and you all get along with her pretty well for the most part. When dad's away, she's all you've got.

You and her get along fine, though she feels the need to prove herself a lot and likes to tease you. You can usually just ignore her, if you need to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's your 8 year old sister, Sophie. She has dark brown hair, taking after your mom. She's a third grader, so she usually goes to school with your mom. She's sweet and kind-hearted, though sometimes she lets out her mischievous side a little. You've always promised not to tell, though, so you get along great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly there's your 3 year old brother, Andy. He's a 3 year old, not exactly a lot you can say about him. He's cute, he's a punk, he's literally a toddler. He has brown hair like Sophie. But his nanny is kind of hot. She graduated high school recently, and she gets paid a lot to watch your brother every week day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, your family is pretty big.

You're a pretty happy bunch, though sometimes you suspect maybe the reason your mom wanted so many kids was to try and fill the gap when your father was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked through the front door and set your stuff to the side. You went to the fridge to grab a glass of orange juice, since it's a part of your daily ritual. It's something yummy and it beats water, so you always look forward to it after your walk home. You went into your room to change your clothes into something dry, since the chemical shower got you all wet. Once you were dry and in a better mood, you decide to go say hi to someone. Who do you visit?</span></div></div>",

Want me to go wash your clothes for you?\" you ask her. What you don't tell her is part of what inspires you to be so kind is what felt like a near brush with death earlier. You're lucky no one got hurt, there's no telling what that chemical could have done to your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, sure. That'd be cool. Thanks,\" she says, gesturing at her hamper. She then puts her earbuds in and goes back to working on homework. It wasn't showy or anything, but getting any form of verbal appreciation from Emily was rare, so you took it. You grabbed her hamper and took it down the hall to the washing room. You loaded everything up, waited, loaded it all into the dryer, waited, and finally you had done your good deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were pulling the last of Emily's clothes out of the dryer, you started to feel like you were going to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou faceplanted right into the full laundry basket.

It took you several minutes to comprehend that the field you stand in was just your sister's clothes. And the world out there was only the laundry room. It looked like a while new world to you, but in reality it's very small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to risk jumping to the ground, so you decided to sleep in the laundry.

Even the fresh cotton smell from the wash couldn't completely mask the stink that had accumulated at the toes of these socks. You had no doubt, you were in her right lucky sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had this pair of socks bought for her a couple years ago, and she thought they were adorable, so she had worn them. A lot. And as she entered high school and joined the track team, they had gotten abused more and more. Her first track meet she came in first, and the whole car ride back she bragged about it. You remember the day clearly from just how annoying she was being, and when you finally got home, she kicked her shoes off and pushed those same dirty socks in your face before running inside. You begrudgingly brought her shoes in for her too, since your mother was insistent you treat her nicely since she just won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed every track meet she wore those socks, even to most trainings, which you thought was odd. It wasn't until one went missing and you noticed her wearing mismatched socks that it struck you, she totally thought that sock was lucky. That's why she refused to throw it out and kept wearing it to track meets even when she looked ridiculous with one white and one dingy pink polka-dot sock on. Honestly, the things had to have stretched out, they were so old it was surprising she could still wear them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd knowing all this about your sister makes every jostle of your cottony prison the more terrifying, because you knew she had a track meet today... and if you didn't get out of here quick, you'd be along for the ride. Emily casually tossed the sock on her bed as she dug through her laundry for a decent set of clothes, mumbling about her stupid brother not bringing them back to her. Unfortunately, the sock landed bunched up on the bed, with you stuck at the faintly fragrant toe ends. You could see out a small, frayed hole in the off-pink fabric, and desperately struggled to move... however, even the miniscule weight of a teenage girl's sock was too much for you to budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in every detail of her impossibly diant room - even one of her few remaining favorite doll's was far larger than you on her bedside table. As she threw her night pajamas off, her surprisingly large chest reminded you that she was quickly outgrowing dolls though, and blushing you looked away as she put on a sports bra. Yep, that sealed it, you were definitely going out with her to her track meet if you didn't get out. Suddenly you had an idea, and brought your mouth up to the frayed hole, chomping down and yanking - only to spit out nasty sock fuzz left from the laundry. Yep, you were doomed. Your sister, now wearing red shorts and hopping on one foot to stuff a plain white sock on her left foot, soon reached for you. Now, of all times, you wondered to yourself why exactly she always wore that pink sock on her right foot... just another ritual?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus. You were about to be squished alive under your little sister's feet as she goes for a run, and you're contemplating her superstitious nature? You get one more look at her gargantuan face as she brings you downwards... waving with all your might, but getting no notice, as instead your face is brought down to her foot's level, where five wiggling digits greet you as they slide in the loose tunnel, driving you crawling backwards until you hit the wall... and you're pressed between the fragrant big and index toes of your little sister. They were fragrant from night sweat, no doubt she hadn't showered that morning, but at least she had since she'd run last, because if not you probably would have died by now. Knowing your sister like you did, maybe it was a good thing you washed her laundry for her, because she probably would've worn this damn sock anyway, and the universe seemed determined to keep you with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour placement between the toes was fortunate at least in that you weren't immediately crushed to death, though the toes did warmly grip you as she walked out of her room and down the steps. She grabbed some hot sundae pop tarts and a protein shake from the kitchen, then went to the front door to slide her feet into her slick new neon green shoes. Supposedly they had better arch support or something, but for you that just meant better insulation for when she got going. As soon as you were forced in with her foot, the temperature spiked upward, and she hadn't even started moving yet. Scarfing down the first pop tart as she slid on her other shoe, Emily looked at the time. Perfect, right on schedule to get a quick jog in to Hyperion High before school started, it would be a great warm up for the track meet later that day, even if she'd end up a little fragrant by the time she got there. She carried a sweat towel in her bag for just that reason (though no one had pointed out to her yet that puberty makes sweat grow in potency, so she hadn't added deodorant to her kit just yet for some reason...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a swig from her protein shake and jamming the last pop tart into her mouth messily, she shouldered her backpack and booked it out the front door - as you felt every near fatal foot fall along the way. Sweat quickly buoyed the cotton down, and within ten minutes you got what was probably the first ever front row seat to toejam being formed as pink glop seemed to magically gather in the toe area above you. As a sweat droplet fell from the toe jam, you realized that surviving until the track meet would make you lucky... or alternatively, wish for death. Preferably one away from your little sister's big, sweaty feet.</span></div></div>",

You didn't live very far from the high school, so Emily walked every day. Unluckily for you, today was a sweltering, humid day- and as the dingy pink cotton clung to your 14-year-old sister's toes, it was quickly dampened with fresh perspiration. You were trapped, and Emily had her big track meet today! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to be tagging along, and with a front row seat for the action. The dingy pink sock started to swelter in the heat, as the gunky toejam started to collect in the crevices of your little sister's toes as they clamp around your tiny form, your clothes quickly starting to tear and come apart from the acidic quality of a teenage girl's sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily makes it to her first class a little early, and practically bounces in place as she nervously thinks about the track meet later that day. Fidgeting in her seat, her toes clench at her lucky pink sock - reassuring her that she was going to do just fine! She had luck on her side, after all. Your mouth is shoved into the salty, hot crevice of the index and second toe as Emily fidgets, driving your poor head into the sweat-drenched crevice of her swampy toes. You gag and choke, but the slender digits of the high-school freshman were far too powerful for your to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass goes on, and you are treated to a front-row tour of every single one of your little sister's inquisitive, nervous, and glistening toes as the lucky sock reaches saturation with sweat and the interior of the shoe becomes swampy and steamy as she nearly nervously sweats her way to drowning her little stowaway. Your clothes were ruined, the seams splitting apart in the steamy conditions - no man-made material was ever meant to survive a 14-year-old-girl's nervous toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly are stripped by the ridges of the toes and the stinging, salty sweat, until there is nothing left between your sister's cheesy, vinegary toes, and your body.

What's worse, is you are under her boob, so while you are already pressed against it, gravity is also letting it rest on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no chance of escape like this.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide that there is no way in hell you're going to approach her while she's practicing. Your sister isn't exactly a soccer star or anything, but your size coupled with those cleats means her feet are fine-tuned weapons of mass destruction that you must avoid at all costs, especially with a soccer ball and a goal nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere were already near the goal, thankfully, so you make a beeline for that. You run through the grass, shoving aside the large blades that block your path at every step of the way. Thankfully, you're not so small that the grass acts more like trees, shoving them out of the way is pretty easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you longer than you're proud of to reach the post of the goal. Even though the world is massive now, you're still struggling with the concept of how far some small distances are now. You shuffle around the back side of the monolithic white pillar so that you are one hundred percent safe from any surprise incoming soccer balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea how long Samantha was practicing while you were knocked out, but  after about twenty minutes, she finally goes inside. She left the ball and the goalpost you set up outside. Well, whatever. Not like you can exactly pick up after her. You decide to head inside as well, but the task of making it across the yard seemed absolutely daunting. Yet that didn't stop you. You were on a mission. You would get your little sister's attention and help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you marched your way home. You pushed through blades of grass and ignored the sounds of nearby bugs to get home. Now a little more accustomed to the distance, it actually felt like it took less time than you expected to get home. You slipped through a crack in the sliding glass door as it wasn't closed all the way, and into your condo. The air conditioning in the room felt lovely, you were honestly pretty sweaty from your trek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the air conditioning, however, the first thing you noticed when getting inside was a terrible smell. It reeked of sweat and mud. Your first thought was that it was you! But you quickly realized that wasn't the case at all. To your right, sitting by the door, were Samantha's humongous abandoned cleats. They stunk to high heavens of sweat and feet. Once you get back to normal size, you are going to make her buy new cleats, these are disgusting. You pinch your nose and get as far away from the terrible-smelling cleats as you can. You head for the main hall, where thankfully Samantha's room is actually the closest to the back door. Some luck, finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore not too long, you find yourself squeezing under the crack to Samantha's room. Her room is honestly pretty messy, but you had no idea how much worse it looks from the point of view from the floor. Walking past immense discarded items of clothing makes it feel like you have little place to go, other than what the mess allows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's sitting on the edge of her bed, scrolling through her phone. You had hoped you had taken long enough getting inside that she would have showered and changed by now, but unlucky for you, she's still wearing her soccer uniform. After being near her cleats, you were most of afraid of the damp, dingy orange knee-high socks she was wearing as part of her uniform. But with her feet on the ground, and not moving all that much, it might be the best way to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you proceed?</span></div></div>",

Eventually, you come to the worst possible conclusion: Any other method of getting Samantha's attention requires too much effort and has too much risk associated. You would have to....get near her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the thought. Watching her toes wiggle within the confines of her damp sock is enough to put a shiver down anyone's spine. You always thought Samantha's feet were weapons before, what with her tomboyishness and all the soccer. But now? Weapons of mass destruction was more like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few moments to steel yourself, and then you push forward without further delay. Samantha is sitting still and reading on her phone, this scenario is far better than trying to catch her attention while she walks around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even get that close to her feet before your nose picks up the scent. It's subtle, at first. The air is normal, and then with every few sniffs you think you catch of a whiff of something foul. But as you get closer, it becomes obvious. All you can smell is a strong sweaty odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom afar, her feet seemed big, but manageable. Now that you're fast approaching, their size really becomes apparent. You didn't realize it before, but you know now: You're just a bug at her feet. You see her toes wiggle again, but this time, they're taunting you. Daring you to approach. They want to show you that they're gods, and you're a speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake yourself out of your daze. Are you deifying your sister's feet? It's hard not to, with their relative size to you, as well as the oppressive smell. You crane your neck upwards as you walk. Samantha is still fixated on her phone, scrolling, reading, occasionally typing. <i>She's</i> the real god, here. She's a goddess, lording over you without even trying. You hope she doesn't catch on to how humiliating of a position you're in before her. She might try to keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reach her feet. The sweaty feet smell is choking, the air is practically swampy this close to her. Her socks are clearly damp from all the sweat they soaked in during her short practice. And yet, despite all this, this is the only way you could think of of getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, you pound your fist into her massive toes. You go all out, you don't even care if it hurts her. You need her attention now, and fast. Before you pass out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the dingy orange monolith slides forward and barrels you over. You find yourself flattened under the damp cotton, surrounded in sweat and itchiness. The foot settles onto you, and you can feel thousands of pounds coming into place, comfortable keeping you underneath it. Then it rubs back and forth, grinding you into the floor. Before lifting away, freeing you. Leaving you in a pathetic pile on the floor of your sister's room, defeated. You look up, and finally her giant blue eyes have moved from her phone to you. She looks down at you, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She thinks she found a bug. Time to kill it? Or keep it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She recognizes you. She excitedly picks you up so she can hear what the heck happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. She recognizes you, but can't help but wonder why on earth you approached her sweaty feet. She comes to some conclusions you don't like...</span></div></div>",

Under any other circumstance, you would be embarrassed by such scrutiny. But right now is the first time a person has been able to see you since you shrunk, and you are thankful for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's eyebrows raise. \"Nick? Is that you?\" she asks, shuffling her giant sock clad feet on either side of you as she leans forward to inspect you further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so...small?\" she inquires, looking at you with incredulity, \"And why are you down by my stinky feet?\" she continues, wiggling her toes in her damp, orange socks as she says it. She looks from you, to her dingy socks, and back to you. Her eyes narrow for a moment, and then widen as her mouth opens in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhhhhh Niiiiick! I had no idea!\" she exclaims. <i>Uh oh, where is this going</i>, you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty gross, Nick. Sorry, I won't judge. Besides, maybe I can get something out of it. Who knew you were into feet, though. Especially your <i>sister's</i>,\" she said, surprised with her supposed revelation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What what what no</i>, you think. <i>Oh God no, she can't think that, that's so gross!</i> Samantha grins wide, her pearly white teeth glistening. Whatever she's about to say, she thinks it will be a favor for you, and that's so gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nick, I <i>guess</i> I'll help you live out your dream,\" she says, still grinning, \"but let's start simple.\" She reaches down and tugs off her knee high socks and drops them on either side of you, releasing waves of the horrid smell emanating from both the socks and her now-bare feet. She props both of her feet up in front of you, nearly blocking out your view of her face entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll give me a nice foot rub after I did all that practice...<i>alone</i>,\" she says, the last word coming out with a bit of ice. Well that's not fair, you intended to practice with her, it isn't your fault you shrunk! But it doesn't seem you'll get a chance to argue your fate. It seems now that you'll have to rub her feet for her to satisfy her and hopefully make her forgive you for 'ditching' her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe...there are other options?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Rub her feet. It can't be that bad, right? Just a quick little foot rub to pay her back, then you can try to talk to her about finding you help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Avoid her feet. Try to get her to talk to you, instead of immediately putting you to work. You need to figure this shrinking business out, and a foot rub isn't the way to do it! You'll find a way to pay her back for ditching on her once you're big again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Run for it. Look for a chance when she seems preoccupied. Get the heck out of here and try to get help from another sibling. Or even better, your mom.</span></div></div>",

And while rubbing your giant sister's smelly, post-practice feet is pretty bad, you've deduced that going against her wishes would be worse. So this is where you find yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Samantha. She's looking down at you, her smile returned. She seems eager for this. You groan and just decide to get it over with. You start by kneading your hands into the sole of her slightly-tanned foot. As you move your hands around, trying to really work your strength into her sole, you check up above. Her smile is wider. You must be doing okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, while you may be doing an okay job at the foot rub, you yourself are not quite doing okay. The air around you is ripe with the strong smell of over-worked feet. And you can't help but notice your hands are getting really wet, since her soles are still covered in a slight sheen of sweat from her practice. You'd ignore these things if you could, but it's utterly impossible. You just have to resist the urge to vomit and try to limit your breathing. And look forward to a shower later, when this gets resolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of massaging, Samantha, who had been on her phone, tells you, \"You're doing surprisingly well, Nick. Good job! I'm proud of you, big-er, I mean, <i>little</i> bro. Buuuuuut I have a feeling you can do a bit better. C'mon, put your back into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and let out another groan. You're gonna pummel her when you're big again. She goes back to her phone, meanwhile you start to ram your shoulder into her sole, really working with as much of your body strength as you can. After a bit of this, you hear from up above a sing-song, \"Thaaaank yoooooou!~\" Ugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're coated in your sister's foot sweat, not just your hands. This is frustrating, but there's nothing you can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend about half an hour massaging both of your sister's huge feet. It's quite the workout, and at the end you're exhausted. Samantha sits up and smiles down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot, Nick! That actually kinda made up for it. How come you never gave me foot rubs when you were big enough for it to be easy?\" she says. You would yell up at her some profanity, but you're too tired. You flop on your back and just lie on the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, I like it this way better, anyway. I could really feel you putting your all into it. You used your whole body just to rub my feet! That's dedication. You could never do that while big! You're so sweet,\" she said, smiling intensely. She noticed your heavy breathing while you lie on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All tuckered out? That's okay, you've earned a rest. I think it's almost dinner time, I'll make sure to bring you a little food when we're all done eating. But before I go downstairs....I think you've earned a reward,\" she said, getting up from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what she might have in mind for a reward, but you're excited. After the monumental and disgusting task of massaging her cleat feet you deserve a lifetime of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha reaches down and gently picks you up in her hand. For as much of a nuisance as she's been today, you can honestly say you feel comforted resting in her big, warm hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see her grab her orange soccer knee-high in her other hand. You remember that she's currently under the impression you love her feet. You curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately try yelling up at her, to tell her to stop, to put you down, to keep you as far away from that horrid sock as possible. She hears you yelling, but not what about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound excited! Hear you go, bro. You're welcome!\" she says cheerily, while she dumps your body into the long tube of the huge sock. The clean air you were just getting accustomed to is immediately replaced by the smell of damp, sweaty cotton. You slide down, headfirst at an alarming speed. It is somewhat dark, and all the light that is inside is orange, which somehow feels befitting of the thick, humid atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha balls up the sock, squishing you into the wet fibers. Then she stuffs it into her cleats and leaves. From inside, your atmosphere gets a little darker and more claustrophobic. And you hear the door close. Great. Now you're alone, and stuck in a gross sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you hope you were right about this being better than trying to defy Samantha. You have to pray that's true, since you're not sure how you would cope knowing you've made things worse for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when Samantha comes back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She removes you from her sock and gives you some dinner, just like she said she would. Maybe you'll get a chance to talk to her finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She remembered to bring you some food...but she also told one of your other sisters about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. She forgot to bring you food, and on top of that she gets distracted by something else and forgets to remove you from the sock. When she does remember, she thinks it's no big deal, since she was doing you a favor anyway.</span></div></div>",

If you're right, that's a little over an hour and a half where all the air you've breathed has been permeated by the stench of your little sister's sweaty post-practice feet. You miss fresh air. You miss how it smelled like nothing, or at least nothing to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try to say you've grown used to the smell somewhat, but it doesn't mean as much as you'd hoped it would. You'd imagined getting used to the smell would mean you wouldn't notice it anymore. This is unfortunately far from the case. The air still reeks of feet, the only difference is now it burns your nostrils a lot less. It's still unbearably noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you begin to really doubt coming to Samantha for help. Even if somehow she could regrow you in the next twenty minutes, you're not sure it was worth the entire hour and a half of breathing air permeated by the smell of her feet, or exhausting your whole body just to give her a simple foot rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you can hear the distant, soft thuds coming this way. You hear the door creak open, and then shut. And then a light giggle as your whole world shakes and gets jostled around. Gravity flips very quickly on you, and you find yourself tumbling down the length of the damp orange sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much ado, you plop into your sister's warm palm, her grinning face holding you at about chin level. You graciously take deep breaths, enjoying the fresh air as Samantha tosses her sock aside. Oh how you missed the smell of literally anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha, whose hair is still slightly damp and in a change of clothes, walks you over to her bed. She plops down and deposits you on her nightstand. Her other hand comes over and drops a brown chunk next to you. It's about the size of your  head. And it looks like...meat? You look down at it and back up to your sister's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's moved her face so it's about thirty feet (your scale) away from you. Which is to say, her giant face is pretty close. \"It's steak,\" she says, with a smile. Oh. Well, you like steak. You pick it up and begin to gnaw on it. Eating a giant chunk of steak which is only a teensy portion of a much, much more giant steak is harder than you ever would have suspected. But you manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're hungrily gnawing on your hunk of steak, Samantha speaks to you, her voice very loud this close up, even though she's talking at a normal volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nick...I've kinda calmed down about the whole ditching practice thing with me...the foot rub really helped with that, thank you...anyway, wanna tell me what's going on? How'd this happen? And...\" she pauses and giggles for a moment, \"why do you like giant stinky feet so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha leans in close and turns her ear towards you. You have to speak up for her to hear you properly, but you don't need to yell too loudly. Just a slightly raised voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You explain what you think is the cause, which is the messed up experiment you and some friends tried later. And you also take time to explain the misunderstanding, and how you most certainly do not like her feet at all. She believes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Same as before, but she thinks you're just trying to cover up for yourself because you're totally embarrassed about your love for her stinky feet. She's willing to bargain with you about how much time you have to spend with her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Actually, you're pretty pissed about being stuck in her sweaty sock for an hour. You tell her off for torturing you. She is hurt, and then angry. After all, from her perspective, she thought she was being nice. Even though she also found it really, really funny.</span></div></div>",

Honestly, you weren't sure that being flattened by a soccerball wouldn'tve been better than being stuck to dry along with your little sister's filthy orange knee-high socks. These things way are thicker than they had any right to be, and they acted like a damn sweat sponge, so even after nearly an hour they were still sopping wet. And Samantha was actually crazy enough to think you LIKED this shit? And she just balled you up in here, and then STUCK IT INSIDE HER DIRTY CLEATS. The preteen foot funk that pervaded the air kept you awake the whole time, though you'd much rather have passed out by now. Seriously, when was she going to get you out of here, you were starving now, even though the stench did little to whet your appetite. God, how could you have been stupid enough to actually give her a footrub, though? I mean, only a real pervert would go anywhere near her disgusting feet. Surely she would've forgiven and helped you, she was probably just teasing until you actually went along with it. You just hoped to get out of this ripe hell and into some fresh air, preferably a bath. And one at a normal size too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have to put up with the stench of your little sister's post-soccer feet for even a minute longer, you might actually go insane. Thankfully, for once you're glad to hear loud boomings, and an explosion that is most likely just your little sister's door closing. Finally, you're going to be freed from this damn hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear some rummaging sounds, and the TV in her room turning on. She'll let you out... any second now... As if to mock you, instead the only thing you can hear is her popping a soda can and opening a bag of chips. You can hear her chomping them down, what is at normal size just feet away. You yell at the top of your lungs, but you can't be heard over whatever game she's playing - probably Call of Duty, one of her favorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny second she'll remember you... \"Brrr, it's kinda cold in here,\" she off-handedly remarks as she rustles around above you, probably pulling her fluffy blanket over herself. Well, you were perfectly warm stuck in this fetid hell, so why didn't she get you out and put her socks back on? Honestly, at least that would get you out... and even if she kept you in them, they couldn't possibly reek more than her cleats. I mean, with as long as she was gone... it felt like an hour... she'd had to have gotten a shower by now. Surely she won't just leave you in here all night to starve to death? Well, dehydration would probably come first... even at this level, you refused to stoop so low as to suck the sweat out of your little sister's filthy soccer sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another round of the game, your little sister chugged the last of the soda in her can, burped, and threw it to the floor. Spotting her cleats laying there, she suddenly remembers leaving you there. Finally feeling movement, you couldn't be more grateful when you're unceremoniously dumped out in front of your big little sister sitting crosslegged on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya big bro... enjoy your time with my socks?\" she says, giggling and cocking her head to the side like she's being funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few breaths of glorious clean air, you're glad to see your prison tossed away - though not far enough away that it's lingering odor doesn't taunt you still. \"Seriously, Samantha?! You left me in there for like two hours! Did you at least bring me something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha pouts at your outburst. \"Jeez, you don't have to be so rude. I even let you rest in my socks like you wanted, and it's literally 7:20, soooo... it's been like, an hour forty-five max. And so uh, I kinda forgot to save you any food... I was actually really hungry... you know, from that practice you were supposed to do with me, so I kinda just super carried away and ate your plate too. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan. \"Okay, can I at least have one of those potato chips you were eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shrugs, looking in the bag. \"I kiiiinda already ate them all. I mean, at your size these crumbs might be a full meal though, so here you go~!\" and like that she dumps the remnants of the Lay's bag right on your shrunken form. You've been abused so much you don't even question it any more, you just grab the biggest chunk that didn't get stuck in your hair and ate it. You were starving, and this was basically nothing. \"Oh, I just got picked up for a match, gimme a sec Nick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister's not even interested in toying with you compared to her stupid game. You... honestly really almost preferred when she was teasing you before. At least you were being treated more like a human than a gerbil to dump food on. And those crumbs did NOT satisfy your hunger. You spotted a fallen chip under your sister's dirty foot that she must not have noticed. It had crunched in half, but... it still looked edible... and you were so hungry, so maybe just a little bit of it would fine. At least the side that hadn't touched her foot, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled over to her foot as she focused intently on the screen, tongue stuck out. Good, as long as you could at least keep your dignity, you could survive even this injustice. As you closed in, you could tell she had NOT showered, those feet still reek of preteen sweat, renewing the images of you giving her a footrub. Dear lord, this was nasty. You grabbed the half of the potato chip not ground into dust under Samantha's disturbingly huge foot, and scamper away. You have to brush a small piece of orange lint off it, and you know it's going to taste extra salty, and maybe even a bit cheesy from the sweat, but you were so hungry it didn't matter. It didn't take you long to devour it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, your sister's mouth had dropped, and she burst out laughing. \"Oh my god! Nick! Did you just pick a friggin' potato chip off my foot and eat it! I'm not sure whether to be grossed out or impressed, but you're way more entertaining than CoD that's for sure! I was just kidding about the foot rub, since you left me out for practice, but... jeez, did you really shrink yourself down just so you can, like, hang out with my giant, stinky soccer feet? That is so...\"</span></div></div>",

And now she had evidence. \"Don't even worry Nicky... you don't mind me callin' ya 'lil bro' right? I promise I won't tell a soul about this stuff if you play with me just a bit, whaddya say lil bro? You really needed to loosen up anyway~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed. You would never live it down if it got out. You had to go along with her and hope she'd actually let you get some help when she got tired of her games... though a shiver went down your spine when you imagined the possibility of still being stuck in your sister's fetid cleats as she became the state soccer champ as a senior. Maybe you just had to bide your time for escape... at least if you escaped, pride be damned, you'd have your humanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so clutching your potato chip almost like a shield, you begrudgingly yelled up, \"Okay, fine! What d-do you want!\"<br>\r\n\"Awesomesauce! I knew you secretly wanted to get closer to those bad girls when you put your whole body into that massage! But uh, this time I have a different idea. If you and my feet want to be true besties, and ESPECIALLY if you want to survive an actual game some day - \" - DEAR LORD SHE ACTUALLY WANTED YOU IN THERE DURING A GAME? - \" - then you're gonna have to get used to their... hehe, unique flavor, you know? I tried it once actually, when I was like ten, it wasn't that bad! Of course that was pre-game...\" God your preteen sis was disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please lil bro, I see boys sniffing their nasty feet plenty, girls can do it too if they wanna,\" she said in a huff noticing your disgust. \"You know, I WAS gonna start you off at Recruit difficulty, but you just got bumped up to Regular!\" she said, snatching your potato shield, the pieces under her feet (and rear) and dumping the rest of the bag into her huge hand, crunching the last of your food into dust. \"I was just gonna use your one chip and do like, a special chip n' dip type ah thang, but since you INSIST...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce satisfied it was a finely ground dust, she stuck out her right, pre-teen funky foot towards you. \"Go ahead and smell lil bro, I told ya I won't judge right? Besides, it's about to be your plate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god no. Sure, you'd massaged it, but that just got some sweat off the bottom, which is definitely back by now anyway... and nothing about the cheesy toejam in-between the toes. She surely didn't intend to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unceremoniously she carefully poured the crumbs over all her toes, most crumbs falling deep into the disgusting recesses and gunk inside. Oh god, the already salty gunk was going to be even saltier... oh god days of disgusting fetid build up... was it possible to get sick from foot bacteria? You didn't know, but you didn't want to figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha flicked you towards it with a finger. \"Come on, whadda they say in those weird shows you watch? Eet-ah-dahkee-mass! Go for it lil bro, I won't judge. Though, I'm TOTALLY watching.\"</span></div></div>",

While she had started out amused, you had noticed her tone gradually change as she began to piece together her own series of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, stared up at your sister, eyes watering. Of course, you weren't teary eyed that you had been found out and called out. The ripe vinegar-filled stench of Samantha's feet was actually irritating your eyes. Not to mention the taste of the sweat soaked chip you'd devoured was making you sick to your stomach. You were too busy trying to recover to argue, much as you tried to gasp. You took a step away, trying to find clean air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha, unfortunately, saw this as you trying to run. Her foot lurched forward, overshadowing you. A feeling of fear boiled up inside as you saw the sole, coated in dirt, sweat, and sock lint. Then in an instant it hammered down. Most of your body was trapped beneath the ball of Samantha's foot. Your head, however, was pinned under your younger sister's big toe as it pressed you into her bed below. You could feel greasy sweat washing over your hair, causing you to squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuk!\" Samantha cried out, suddenly pulling her foot away as she remembered what she had been so disgusted by, \"S-see! You're even fidgeting and shaking with joy that my sweaty foot is covering you up. Ewwwww....c-couldn't you find a different girl, like...seriously...I'm your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your tomboyish sister had no problem with her feet being smelly and sweaty, knowing that you actually enjoyed it was actually disgusting her. Enough that she might just take a shower. She glanced from her bare foot to you, laying face down on her mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no wonder you wanted to wait in my shoe,\" Samantha chastised again, reaching down to pick you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy, I-\" You begin to yell, finally picking yourself up. Your argument is stopped short as your sister's hand clamps down on you, practically squeezing the air from your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, bro, if you like smelly feet, cool,\" Samantha commented, sounding more disgusted than anything else, \"But you could literally have shrunk yourself around ANYONE but me,\" She said, another shudder running through her. \"I'll tell you what bro, I'll help you out. Maybe once you learn how bad feet can be then you'll get over this...thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, Samantha began to walk, pausing only at her desk to pull a roll of scotch tape out of one drawer. Between that and her comment of showing how bad feet can be, you were terrified. Samantha's feet had been horrific, enough to scar you. Just how was SHE planing to show you something worse. You soon got your answer as Samantha left her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright bro, this is for your own good,\" Samantha explained, ripping off a few pieces of tape and sticking them over your chest, waits, and legs. You gasped suddenly, moaning for help as you realized the tape on your chest had covered your mouth, leaving only your nose free. Your eyes dart around as you realize what Samantha is going to use to help 'cure' you of your foot fascination.</span></div></div>",

You'll be begging to never look at a stinky foot again.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha made her way over to where the Nanny was. Her name is Ashely. She's very pale, has long blonde hair down to her lower back which she tends to tie up into a pony tail. She's 19, in college, and nannies for some extra cash. She's at the house every week day and sometimes even on weekends. She always wears a similar outfit; a pair of black leggings with black flats and a simple blouse up top. Samantha walked over to the Nanny and asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><b>Hey Ashley, do you think I could borrow one of your shoes real quick? I want to try it on and see if it's my size. I really like them.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\"><b>Yeah totally!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley proceeded to peel off her right flat with her left one by digging the toe of her left foot into the heel of her right one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <span class=\"clteal\"><b>Just don't get your face too close to it, I've had these since my freshman year of high school and never washed 'em so they can't smell too nice.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><b>Hahaha don't worry, I doubt they're any worse than my soccer cleats. Those things are basically toxic weapons.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\"><b>Man, I feel bad for whoever gets near those things!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><b>Eh, I get there's some gross person out there who wouldn't mind. But they just don't realize how bad it would really be.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\"><b>Hahaha, one whiff and they'd immediately regret it I bet.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Samantha went back to her room with the flat and dropped it onto her desk. She plucked you out of her soccer cleat and dropped you on the desk next to the Ashley's flat. You squirmed as hard as you could and tried to talk through the tape covering your mouth, but no words could come out, only muffled sounds that were inaudible to anyone. You began rolling your body which caused you to nearly fall off the desk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><b>Will you stop squirming! Are you regretting this already? You haven't seen anything yet.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha lifted her right foot and crossed it over her left leg and tilted her sole up. She picked you up and then spread her toes, bringing you down into her sweaty toe clasp and sealed her toes together, locking you inside. You were completely surrounded on all sides by her stinky toe flesh and no amount of wiggling could free you. Each breath pained you with the scent of her stinky feet. Next she opened up a drawer in the desk and pulled out a small bottle that contained some thick glue. She opened the cap which revealed a thin wand with which you could precisely apply some glue, which is exactly what she did. She looked deep into Ashley's flat and noted a deep black and grimey looking imprint of Ashley's foot. As her face was near the opening she could smell the overwhelming scent of Ashley's cheesy feet. She smiled a bit and thought:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><b>This'll be perfect for him.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled you out of her toes which you were very thankful of, and without even looking you in the eye she began to apply the glue all around the tape on your body. Afterwards she slowly began lowering you into the flat towards the toe area. When you realized what she was doing and who that flat belonged to you began to scream in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\"><b>Nooooooo!!! Samantha please don't do it! Please anything but that!!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all that came out were a series of muffled screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><b>Alright bro here's the deal. I'm gluing you to the inside of Ashley's stinky flat right under her nasty toes. You'll see just how gross feet are when they're stuck right in your tiny face for a whole 24 hours. I left your nose out so you can take in all the smell. I expect you to find a way to get out by tomorrow. I'm leaving my soccer socks right here on the floor, so your job is to get back to my room in my socks by tomorrow, or else. If you make it, I'll believe that you really learned your lesson. If you're not in my socks by tomorrow, I'm going to find you and it's going to get a whole lot worse little bro.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha finally reached the toe area and pasted your mummified body down with you face up and your head right under where Ashley's big and second toe would go. She finally brought the flat back to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><b>Thanks! Sucks but it didn't fit me.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\"><b>Aww man, better luck next time.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley said as she took the flat back from Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\"><b>Man these flats do stink though.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said as she caught a whiff of it as she slipped her right foot back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a giant bare foot quickly approach you. It looked sweaty and had a tinge of red, and you also noticed bits of grime around the toe area. The smell was already bad, but it was mixed with a steady stream of fresh air. As her foot got closer and closer all the fresh air retreated from the flat and was replaced with pure noxious foot stench. With each inch your world became more and more Ashley's foot, until her toes finally settled around your body. Her toe flesh just barely touched you on all sides, making you feel claustrophobic, and the odor was so thick you could swear you felt it poison you as it entered your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley felt something but she figured it was just the tip of the insole bunching up from Samantha trying it on. Besides, she thought it felt good. </span></div></div>",

You love going to the park. You don't usually do much while there, maybe do some homework outdoors or read a book. It's more about the atmosphere, the people. The green grass, the blue sky, the chirping birds, the passersby. Everyone is at the park to have a good time, and thus the park collectively <i>is</i> a good time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you brought a book, you want to get a bit of light reading in this fine Saturday morning, especially since later you'll be preoccupied going to see your sister Samantha's soccer game. So you plop your tush on a bench and get to reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter maybe forty-five minutes of being absorbed into your book, you tear yourself away to get a drink of water. You're parched, and you'd barely noticed. You set your book down on the bench and get up to walk to the nearby water fountain. After wetting your whistle, you get ready to go back to your book, but you don't even make it all the way to the bench. You feel incredibly dizzy and nauseated. You wonder if maybe something leaked into the pipes at the water fountain. But then you wonder if maybe the events of yesterday were having a delayed reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, you were on the ground. Your vision swam, until it went black. Your body shrank until you were puny. When you woke up, the light assaulted your eyes. It took a moment to get acquainted with the situation, and remember what happened. Were you...tiny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the objects and people in the park around you seemed to confirm this. Worse yet, no one seemed to have noticed your shrinking. Rats. You'd need to get someone's attention if you had any hopes of returning to normal size. Who could you go to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Since you passed out and shrunk, a young woman and her daughter sit on the bench you were at. The mother, probably in her early thirties, curiously looks at the book you had left behind. The little girl, who seemed maybe 8 or 9 years old, was playing with a doll she brought with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. There's a shy girl with glasses sketching something in her art book under the shade of a nearby tree. She looks about your age, maybe a little younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. A girl who looks to be around 12 or 13 is walking down the path this way. She's got medium-length brown hair, and she's definitely got a laid-back skater girl vibe about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. A girl you know from school, she's in the same grade as you. You're not exactly friends, but...well, you at least know her name. Her name is Amber, she plays for the girl's basketball team at school. You hear she's pretty good.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl sketching under the shade of the tree seems to be a good option. She's absorbed in her work, so you think she's not likely to squish you by accident since her hand is about the only thing moving. The only thing between you and her, your hopeful savior, is what seems like miles of grass that's now as tall as you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're ready to take it on.You march forward with purpose, but you still allow yourself time to marvel at the size of everything. You never imagined you'd see the world from this unusual perspective. It made you look at everything in a different light. So much more emphasis was put on the way grass and dirt looks. There's so much clutter and variety down here. And the sky up above, well, it seemed less like a sky now. It was so impossibly and unbelievably out of scope for you, it was like the new space. And now your sky is what you used to consider the normal world. The world you will now have to consider the world of giants. They're behemoths that live in a plane above you, dominating the scene every second they can be seen or heard. It gives you an idea of what being a bug is like, because, well, in some ways, that's pretty much what you were now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the trembling of the steps of the gods above and their faraway but ever-imposing voices was nothing compared to reaching one up close. As you finally got close to the girl, you took into question everything you thought along your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to be about fifteen or sixteen years old, though her face, focused on her craft, seemed to exude an extra layer of maturity you're not even used to from your own age group, much less anyone a couple years younger. Her brown hair flowed down past her shoulders, and her face carried a set of black thick frame glasses, behind which two gorgeous brown eyes sat and observed her work. She was wearing jeans and dark blue shirt. Her left leg was outstretched, with her right bent out to the side. A pair of discarded moccasins sat a few feet from her, and her slightly dirty bare foot faced you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is, of course, how you would describe her as a person talking about another person they saw. From your vantage point, she was a creature of immeasurable size and unfathomable power. She was likely a goddess who could kill you with a swat of her hand. It's hard to look up at her and not feel like a pathetic bug in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strive to push those thoughts out of your mind. As long as you get her attention, she will see you as a shrunken person that needs help. So you approach her dirty bare foot, and pound your fist against it. You see her eyes look up from her work and hone in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She thinks you're a bug, and promptly attempts to flatten you under her foot so she can get back to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She is amazed at discovering a tiny person. She tells you to freeze, so she can sketch you. She likes the aesthetic of you next to her foot, it makes a great composition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. She pulls out a jar to capture you so you don't run away. Turns out her favorite mythological creatures are pixies and fairies, so she's going to take you home and use you as a model for a series of \"Fairy Trapped in a Jar\" sketches.</span></div></div>",

The two of you are practically frozen in time together. Despite the complete lack of movement, you can see behind her eyes her brain overworking to process what she is seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe standoff is only seconds, but it feels like an hour. Finally, she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey there...\" her voice is hesitant, nearly afraid. You lift your arm and slowly wave. She gives the tiniest nod. As if you reciprocating is proof she didn't imagine you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move,\" she instructs. Easy, you weren't hardly moving to begin with. She flips the page in her sketchbook and goes back to intensely working. She often looks back to you while she works, perhaps to ensure you haven't run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, she lets out a smile and proclaims, \"Done!\" She flips her sketchbook around to show you. It's a pencil sketch of her foot, and you standing next to it with a hand on it, looking lost and confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, she is very good. It looks just like you, and the expression on your face is magnificent. Most surprising to you, though, is how you look to an outsider at this size. You were so busy paying full attention to how you now see the world, that you never stopped to think about how the world now sees you. What really seals it in is seeing what you look like next to her foot. It makes you look....puny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really like the contrast between you and my foot. It does wonders for showing your scale and just how lost and overpowered you look,\" she says, almost as if reading your mind. She continues, \"I'd love to do some more sketches with you, but I'm kinda done here at the park. You wouldn't wanna go with me, maybe, would you...?\" she seemed nervous about asking, but obviously really wanted you to say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you wanted to go with her! She was your chance at salvation! You didn't come over here just to have a chat and then be off on your merry, tiny way! You need help, and going with her, letting her do some sketches of you, is the best way to do it. So you nod in response. She looks delighted, offering a cute smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Okay, well, I don't suppose you'd want to walk the whole way, so I'll help you out,\" she says, and reaches down to grab you. Your first instinct is to flee. After all, there are giant fleshy tree-trunks coming to smash you. But you force yourself not to move, she's trying to help. Her giant fingers wrap around you, and lift you into the air. It reminds you of an elevator moving, the way you can feel it in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she put you while she walks home?</span></div></div>",

You didn't wanted to, but because you didn't know what will comes next, you decided to lick her toe in hopes to satisfy your thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas salty and with a vinegar taste, but satisfied you for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Sophia felt something strange sensation in your position but was pleasant, so she embraced you with her toe as thanks.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gave her foot one punch and then another, before stepping away. The layer of dirt, combined with being cooped up in leather moccasins meant the artist's feet had a bit of a ripe earthy odor to them, further suggesting she'd been outside for most of the day. Looking back up at the girl, you find that her eyes have fallen on you. There seems to be some sort of sparkle, a glint of inspiration and realization. They slowly widen. A moment of quiet passes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith out warning, the girl's hand shot over you. Your only warning was a flickering shadow before the warmth of her finger settled around you and then caved inward. She had you clenched in her fist, too tight for you to even squirm, let alone move, yet just short of crushing you. One might think that such a timid girl would have better respect for personal space, but given how her hand was shaking, some form of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds passed, the time filled by the deafening beat of the girl's heart as your ear was pressed into her palm. Then, quick as it came, the pressure surrounding you releases....and you drop. You manage a brief panicked yelp, before you hit a solid floor with a thump. There is a metallic creaking and scrapping sound as a patch of shade covers you up. Slowly, you get to your feet, managing a quick glimpse around as your prison moves around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlass walls...rounded....a metal-looking top with a few holes poked into it. It quickly became clear that this seemingly shy girl had caught and imprisoned you in a jar like some sort of bug. The light began to fade as canvas walls appeared outside the jar...the girl was just shoving you into her bag now. There was a bit more clattering, and dull ringing thuds as she loaded up her bag with the rest of her supplies. Finally, you were knocked off your feet as she swung the bag onto her shoulder and began to hurry along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed....the jar shook around. And you had time to think, ask yourself questions. Why had she dropped you in a jar? Why did she have a jar in the first place? Did she actually think you were a bug? None of these questions would get answered for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, but was likely only a few minutes, the bag opened up. The jar was suddenly in motion once again as the shy artist excitedly retrieved it and set it on a desk in what seemed to be her room. It was a small boxy room with a single window against one wall and a door backed into a corner of the room. A twin-sized bed, a desk, and a dresser, the usual types of furniture. What stood out though, was the decor as well as the shelves that lined an entire wall. The wall over her bed had a large poster, depicting a fantasy scene of fey creatures, possibly her own work. The shelves meanwhile had dozens of  pixie and fairy-related items, from dolls to scenes in jars. It was slowly becoming apparent why you had been caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...h-hey...little guy,\" She commented, face suddenly appearing in one glass wall. You took a step back, one she didn't seem to notice, \"S-sorry for grabbing you, I...uh...I just think you'd be perfect. I...well...wanted to do a series of...well...pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....\" You say, confused, your voice reverberating off the glass. A moment passes and it becomes obvious that the girl can't hear your minuscule voice through the glass. Embarrassed by this, you meekly nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you!\" She exclaims, taking your nod as approval. She continued talking, stammering less as she got caught up in excitement. \"I-t's called Fairies in Jars. I already have a theme in mind too, they'll all involve...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will the pictures involve?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Fantasy and medieval clothing (The girl wants you to dress up in different doll-sized outfits, jester's clothes, a knight's armor, a princess's dress.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Scenes of peril (The girl wants to draw you in states of helplessness and bondage, such as stuck in a spider web, trapped in mud, and more.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The dirtier aspects of the modern world (The girl plans on her art juxtaposing you with various bits of modern day trash....starting with items from her dirty laundry basket)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...scenes of peril,\" The otherwise timid artist girl concluded. She had a very excited smile on her face and was actually shaking a bit in excitement. The fact that she got to execute one of her dream projects with something approaching an actual fairy was almost too much. In her excitement, she didn't even seem to notice your look of confusion and panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the heck does scenes of peril mean?' You found yourself mentally questioning this. Maybe she wanting some sort of damsel in distress set up like in old movies. It was something that sounded at best embarrassing and at worst terrifying. She could be thinking of tying you to a toy railroad tracks or maybe she was wanting to see you chased by a neighborhood cat. You pound against the glass a few times, finally getting the attention of the girl. She looks down at you, smiling sweetly and innocently. She seemed to mistake your expression of concern and confusion for one of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have you in scenarios where you'll be a bit helpless, not in danger though, I-I already have the...uh...first one in mind...b-but...it should be a surprise,\" The girl explained, nervously glancing away. She at least reassured you that you wouldn't be a victim of giant animal attacks, but that didn't seem like the best sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-come on, let's...uh...go outside,\" The girl announced, picking up the jar and holding it at her side as she began to walk. This resulted in an unpleasant jostling back and forth as she unconsciously swung her arms. You were slide from one side of the jar to the other, the girl's pants passing by as a blur. Dim light from the inside of the girl's house eventually gave way to bright light. It was still a sunny day out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, j-just wait here,\" The girl requested, setting the jar down on her back patio, a small square of concrete with little more than a small set of chairs. Despite that request, there was little more that you could do except for look around. The girl's backyard didn't look like any sort of neighborhood you recognized. It was a rather cramped affair, closed in by a high solid wood fence. There was space enough for a patio, a tree off to one corner, and a bit of a garden cordoned off by raised brick. That was the area the artist was currently at work in, despite there being no plants aside from weeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see she had turned on a hose, which she was spraying over a patch of the ground. She had a small gardening trowel in one hand, with which she occasionally prodded at the wet earth, scooping it up and turning it over. With each motion, you noticed the soil didn't look like the type for gardening, suggesting it hadn't been used in a while. Yet as time goes on, you noticed the shovelfuls becoming darker and wetter. The mature air the girl had once held slowly faded as she began to look more and more like a kid playing in the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestions of why she was doing this were soon answered as the girl stood up and walked towards your jar. The knees of her jeans were stained with water and flattened dirt which was slowly merging together. She picked up the jar, flashing you a pleasant smile, one which almost seem to contrast what she was doing. Stepping over to where she had been hard at work, you could see that a large patch of the earth within the brick enclosure had been turned into a thick muck. The hose was still on, feeding a steady stream of water into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, get ready...uh...h-here it comes,\" The young artist offered this as your only warning as she unscrewed the jar quickly. Any time you might have used to call up to her was instead occupied staring in confusion as she lifted up the garden trowel, belabored with a thick clump of mud. Holding it over the jar, she shook it off in a swift motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, with a loud squelch, everything went dark. You began to struggle, the thick gunk clinging tightly to you and resisting attempts to move. You thought you might drown, the wet earthy stench filling your lungs. The girl was fortunately kinder than she would appear. Fingers pinched your arm and dragged you to the surface. You arose, face now stained with mud, the rest of your body stuck in the amorphous clump below you. You were up to your shoulders in the stuff. Yet that didn't seem to be enough for the girl. Another spadeful of a wetter muck joined you, flowing around and filling out the space in the jar where the initial glob hadn't. The girl began to work, quickly filling the jar until it was about halfway full and you were up to your shoulders.Any time you tried to call out, you were interrupted by a mass of wet filth being dumped on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" She announced happily, screwing the lid on again before you had any chance to respond, leaving you trapped in the cool squishy substance. If her goal was to have you immobilized, she was doing a good job. You had one arm free, yet you were afraid of using that to push yourself up, knowing it would sink down. Any squirm was quickly stopped when you began to sink just a little bit. There seemed to be a more solid mass beneath you, but you didn't trust that to stay there. Even breathing was tough, with each rise of your chest forcing you to displace the viscous surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl didn't say anything, simply excitedly grabbed the jar and carried it back into the house, up to her room. You were deposited back on her desk, with her vanishing to clean herself up. Sitting there, you were trapped, barely able to do anything. There was one thing you could do...which left you with a choice...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The skater girl seems to be the easiest option. You would prefer an adult in this scenario, but any help is better than no help, you know that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the only problem is getting her attention in time, and hoping she doesn't stomp you walking down the path. You decide to go with the only effective thing you can think of, running in the path and yelling, jumping, waving your arms around, anything and everything you can do that might grab someone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraversing through the grass is surprisingly easy. It's recently been mowed, so it's like walking through tall grass that's thicker and a little harder to push. Still not all that hard. The hard part is when you reach the pathway. All the little details you never noticed before make for huge terrain diversity now. The ground is extremely uneven and you really have to watch your footing, lest you trip. Once you're sure you're about in the middle of the pathway, you steady yourself and look in the direction of the girl coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you feel her before you can see her. She's close enough now that you can feel the slight trembles in the ground as she approaches. With every single step, you can feel the ground shake just that much more. You knew people were huge to you now, but this....this really helps you conceptualize just how small you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's approaching now. You would still describe her as a skater girl, but there's definitely a sort of scene influence to her look. It doesn't surprise you, for the past several years, there were always girls her age that adopted that kind of look. But she didn't go full scene, as evidenced by her natural hair color and a lighter makeup load than you recalled for the type. She's wearing torn skinny jeans, a black hoodie with the logo of some band you don't know on the front, and ratty, torn-up DC high-tops that look like they've been re-colored with sharpies at some point, though not recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have much time. You jump, you wave your arms like crazy, and you yell as loud as you possibly can, though you have no clue how far your voice reaches at your current stature. You keep this up as long as you can. She gets closer and closer, the ground shaking more immensely with every step. Soon she looks like she's going to walk right over you, but then her eyes finally fall on you. She stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know if it was your yelling or if she just noticed all the movement in her peripheral vision, but you've never been more happy in your life. She looks equal parts confused and curious. You can hear breathe a quiet \"What the fuck?\" under her breath. You weren't much of one for swearing, personally, but you expected no less from her. Not to stereotype or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crouches down to get a better look at you. Every movement she makes causes you to practically tremble in fear. Yesterday, she would have been shorter than you. Today, every single movement her body makes contains more power than it would probably take to kill you in an instant. Not to mention how much more terrifying she is when she crouches, as every part of her gets closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watches you like a hawk. A confused hawk, but her giant blue eyes don't move away from you for a second. Now that you've got her attention, you've stopped exhausting yourself. You simply wave up at her. It's as if this one human motion confirms to her what she's seeing. A smile spreads across her lips. Normally you would be ecstatic, but something's wrong with this smile. It's not so blatant as to make you certain you're in danger, but...it seemed like an amused smile, more than anything. She has seen you, she has comprehended what you are, and her reaction is....amusement. This worries you, you were hoping for concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl pulls out her cellphone, points it at you, and says, \"Say cheese, little dude.\" Not that she would ever know, but you do mutter, \"Cheese,\" under your breath. However, you don't smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a snort of disbelief, as if it's just re-registered what she's seeing. \"This is so wicked. I can't believe you're a tiny little dude. You need some help, little dude?\" she asks you. Finally! You're relieved to hear her ask that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept...that amused smile, it still nags at you. It makes you worry that maybe she won't be taking this as seriously as you need her to. But you got her attention, and she literally just offered help. There's no way you'll say no at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright tiny dude. If you want my help, then you'll have to come with me. So get in,\" she says. She stands up to her full height, reminding you of how utterly puny you are. But what does she mean, \"Get in?\" Get in what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you see what she's doing. She takes the toe of her right foot and plants it on the heel of her left. Then she pops her socked foot out of her DC high top. She uses her newly-freed left foot and knocks her high top over, mouth facing you, then plants her socked foot on top of the overturned shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoes are obviously old and extremely worn. She's wearing dark gray socks, which you pray to God were always gray, and not once white. They're obviously a little dirty, and the bottoms damp from sweat. It is a warm day and she's wearing a hoodie, after all. You doubt today is the first time she wore those socks this week, and you're positive she must wear these shoes every day. Not to mention, there is an obvious smell coming from the mouth of her shoe, and probably her socked foot as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment ago, you were positive there was no reason in the entire world to turn down help from this middle school skater scene girl. Now, you have <i><b>strongly</b></i> reconsidered. Are you willing to crawl into the sweaty smelly cave of death in return for her help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her one more time before deciding. She still has that amused smile on her face, and you even hear her slightly giggle. Despite this being life or death to you, you'd wager she just finds it funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

So you decide to pass the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as you look into the mouth of the overturned high top. The sweaty stench alone could tell you, but it's also obvious just by looking at them that these shoes have been worn for years. You're seriously about to crawl into a cave that has soaked up foot sweat for multiple years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the plunge and crawl over the lip of the entrance. Every step you take forward, you feel the humidity rise. The air already felt impossibly thick, but it manages to get thicker with every foot inside. Not to mention the heat, too. It just keeps getting hotter as you venture inside. And finally, the smell. There's no way to overstate the smell. A reeking, cheesy, sweaty stench that pervades all your senses at once. It would drive you mad, but you have to do this. This is the path to help, this is how you pass the test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk further into the shoe. It's harder to hold onto your hope as the light dwindles at the same rate the heat, humidity, and smell multiply. Doubt fills your mind. Is this really the best course of action? Have you just walked into the sweaty, smelly shoe of a tween skater girl because she's the first person who <i>might</i> help you? You start to think perhaps you've made a mistake. Should you turn back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a massive tremble, immediately followed by gravity changing where it's coming from. You fall onto what used to be the wall on your left, but is now the floor. As you collide with the damp floor, and feel the light layer of sticky sweat on you, you remember the correct name for this floor: Insole. She's just turned her shoe right side up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light quickly fades. Down the end of the tunnel, aka shoe, you see a giant, dingy grey sock-clad foot enter the mouth of the shoe. And it comes barreling your way. You try to crawl as far as you can and as quickly as you can, but in mere moments you feel an incredibly heavy weight settle on your back. The weight lifts for a moment, which you use to roll onto your back and look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, a damp cotton wall wrapped around a set of the biggest toes you have ever seen in your life. You can only observe for a brief moment, because the wall settles back down on you. The massive toes rub on you, making you itchy and covered in sweat from sock. Finally, after they've played with you, they stretch apart and settle on either side of you, trapping you firmly by the net of the sock in between. Then they scrunch up together, smushing you and surrounding you in dirty sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be what hell is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour predicament is indescribably awful. It smells of sweaty feet. You can hardly breathe. You are trapped beneath the giant socked toes of a tween girl who probably thinks she's got the whole world figured out while managing to not wash her socks or ever buy a new pair of shoes. Not to mention, it's pretty hot outside. And soon you discover, she does not go straight home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, your sense of time is distorted. You think you must be trapped in your hellish prison for weeks. In truth, it was only about two and a half hours. This skater girl sure took her sweet time getting you home, despite knowing she kept you in her awful shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the sock-clad monolith lifts off you, and exits the shoe. Light pours in, and even that feels practically blinding. Before you know it, gravity flips again and you find yourself plummeting down the length of the shoe like a slide, until you are absolutely blinded by the amount of light you're exposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finish squinting, you see you're sitting in carpet. And above you, your punk skater 'savior' sits on the edge of her gargantuan bed, socked feet on either side of you. She's got that amused smile too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, small dude. I can't believe you actually survived in my rank shoe for that long. You've proven your worth,\" she said down to you. You beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your freedom at last! At least, that's what you thought. You assumed she meant you're worthy of her help. But what she actually meant was that you're worthy of becoming...</span></div></div>",

Her torn up jeans fold over the tops of her feet, slender and absolutely rank in the air around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finishes peeling off her second sock with a wet pop, the fabric like a soaked circus tent on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theeere we go\" She sighs, stretching her feet out. A creeping, foul reek fills the air as the bare feet flex around you like walls, glistening with sweat and bits of dirt and lint. The sour smell of tween skater feet chokes your airways, your eyes watering. Your \"saviour\" notices, and snorts loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAH, ohmygod, little dude, you good down there?\" She smirks. She doesn't really wait for an answer, stooping down to see y ou more clearly, pinching her nose a little. \"HahaAAH, wowww.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So lil dude, since you owe me and all, I think maybe you should Repay my feet for being such good roommates!\" She says with an amused little smirk.  \"Since y'know you guys are gonna be living together from now on, it'll be cool.\" She says with a toothy grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely manage to say-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are completely and utterly mortified by the words of the skater punk giantess who sits before you. You are speechless, motionless. What happened to getting help? She was supposed to be your savior! Yet here she is, saying that you'll be living with her feet and that you need to repay them?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish to protest. You wish to run. You wish to do anything at all but sit in front of two massive pale, dirty feet belonging to a decidedly horrible punk. But your shock in the face of such repulsive implications has rendered you useless. Until she speaks again, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, little dude. You owe me. I saved your ass. You need to repay me. And I like you down by my feet, like when you were in my shoe earlier. That was freaking hilarious,\" she pauses, her grin widening at the memory, \"so here's what we're gonna do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer humongous feet lower slightly, so that her toes are only hovering a few feet (your scale) off the ground. She spreads her toes apart, leans down, and points at her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna help me out big time. I get all kinds of lint and toe jam between my toes. Totally gross, I know right? I dunno if it's my socks or my skate shoes or what. Either way, it happens. This is where you come in,\" she does her best to hold back her laughter, then continues, \"you're gonna be a totally awesome little dude and you're gonna clean all that stuff out for me, kay?\" she finishes, her toothy grin a mile wide. Your first thought is that she must be joking, but after standing there, not doing a thing, her smile fades a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm not kidding. Get to it already,\" she says, expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've decided you fear her wrath enough that you're going to at least try to get through this. You'll push your limits for the sake of your life. Maybe if you really get on her good side, she'll actually get you the help you need. And then never, ever, never tell anyone what you did while this small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allow yourself a short moment to breathe and psych yourself into the right mind-space to do something like this. Of course, a moment to breathe just reminds you where you are. The air surrounding you still smells like young, ripe skater feet. So that doesn't help much. But finally, you just go for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk between her giant, pale toes. Her feet are filthy, and there's a musk of foot funk surrounding you, daring you to accidentally breathe too deeply so that it can suffocate you. You use your hands and you remove any large pieces of lint or mushy toe jam, and do your best to scrape off anything that's stuck a little too well. You're darn near ready to vomit, but if you puke on her foot you're sure she'll be pissed. So you try to hold it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom up above, you hear her speak again, \"Hey little dude, why don't you lick in there, clean it up a bit better than with just your hands?\" <i>What? Is she</i> crazy<i>?</i> When you look up from between the pale digits, you expect to see her stupid grin, but instead you see the back of her phone. Huh? It's awfully close for her to be using it normally-....oh. You realize what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's filming you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, say hi, little dude! I'm totally gonna send this to my friends, they're gonna freak,\" she says, excited. Oh good lord, no. Doing this disgusting act is punishment of its own, but there's no way there can be video evidence too. You've gotta speak up, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You signal for her that you need to say something. You discuss the situation. You propose that you'll still do the job, but she absolutely cannot film you doing it. It's too degrading. She agrees, then excitedly watches you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Same scenario. However, unbeknowst to you, she invites a friend or two over. If they can't watch you in a video, they've gotta see the real deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. You want desperately to speak up, but you don't want to risk further punishment, You begrudgingly continue your work on camera without saying anything. Afterwards, she sends the video to her friends.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ll never live it down. Seriously, how will you ever keep a girlfriend when sooner or later they\u2019ll notice you\u2019re the same guy from that disgusting viral video? You have to convince her to stop recording you \u2013 no, delete it entirely. Suffering now is one thing, but suffering forever is entirely different. And surely you\u2019ll grow back or at least get help eventually\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frantically wave and jump at the phone\u2019s camera \u2013 she can probably she you better through that anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, waving to the fans little dude? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m getting like, everything.\u201d You shake your head, and she starts to figure it out. \u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re camera shy, little guy! \u2018Cuz I gotta record you, no way my friends will believe I found a tiny guy to hang out with my feet otherwise, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to convince her to just turn it off, and if you press the issue you\u2019ll probably piss her off. You\u2019re gonna have to give her a good reason why it\u2019s in HER best interest to turn it off\u2026 maybe you can promise to do a better job in return, or\u2026 Wait, you have an idea.<br>\r\n\u201cHEY, WAIT! IF YOUR FRIENDS SEE A VIDEO OF ME, THEY MIGHT TELL SOMEONE, THEN SCIENTISTS WILL WANT TO TAKE ME AWAY! O-OR, MAYBE THEY\u2019LL WANT TO KEEP ME FOR THEMSELVES! DON\u2019T YOU WANT TO KEEP ME A SECRET? YOU SHOULD DELETE THE VIDEO!\u201d you yell up to her as loudly as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her stop and consider. \u201cY\u2019know\u2026 you\u2019re right, little dude. I mean, let\u2019s be honest, I really need a little foot cleaner, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna give up my new buddy. And knowing Michelle, she\u2019d totally try to take you. So I guess I should keep you a secret if I want to keep you around forever\u2026\u201d she smirks and closes her flip phone back up. \u201cJust having you to keep my toes company is enough for now. Just make sure you clean \u2018em up real good so I have a reason to keep you secret, \u2018kay?\u201d she winks down at you, giving another light girly giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, you feel victorious, but then realization dawns on you\u2026 You did such a good job convincing her to keep you a secret, now she really would. So, not only have you made the terrible decision to willingly spend your time in this tween punk\u2019s shoe, becoming her new foot friend and cleaner, but now you\u2019ve convinced her that it\u2019s such a great deal for her that she should never let anyone potentially more empathetic to your situation see you. That video would\u2019ve been super embarrassing, sure, but it\u2019s still decidedly better than potentially spending eternity stuck in this tomboy\u2019s shoes, eating her filthy toejam. You may have just sentenced yourself to permanently helping this little girl fix her feet\u2019s terrible hygiene practices\u2026 personally. Everyone around her would benefit from the help, but you sure wouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, little dude, get back to it already man. We don\u2019t have all night!\u201d she said, bringing her other foot over and using her big toe to give you a push back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled forward and yelped, tripping into the funky area between her big and second toe and getting a disgusting glob of sweaty toejam lodged in your mouth for the trouble. This caused her to start laughing uproariously at your misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAha! Oh my god, sorry little dude, I totally didn\u2019t mean to do that. Watch where you\u2019re going man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gagged and coughed the disgusting blob out, but the rancid taste stuck inside your mouth. If this is what all the accumulated grime on her toes was going to taste like, then you\u2019ve definitely made a huge mistake. You\u2019re really starting to regret ever considering approaching this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there's no backing out of this now, and she's only started watching you even closer since you convinced her to turn the camera off. Grimacing, you bring your face back down to the grimy pocket between the toes, scrunching your nose in an effort to keep the stink out, and failing. As instructed, you take a tentative lick. It tastes just as foul as the mouthful of gunk had, much to your disappointment. Even more distressing though is the fact that it truly is an effective way of cleaning the filth from between her grubby toes, you can clearly see cleaner pale flesh from where you licked. This was going to be a long night... and you were going to spend it all with her, whether actively cleaning her toes or some other demeaning task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you and my toes are gonna be like, best friends. I haven\u2019t painted my toe nails in a couple weeks, so you\u2019re totally gonna help me out with that real soon. Plus, I've got school tomorrow, so you can spend plenty of time with me then. It's gonna be a total blast.\" She laughs out loud at your suffering, either not realizing how she's torturing you, or completely not caring.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is difficult to describe the humiliation you feel. You feel utterly defeated. You are the size of a bug between the toes of a preteen skater punk, licking away the dirt and grime collected between the pale, sweaty digits while she films your every move on her smartphone. Her light, occasional giggles cause a sense of nausea as you come to terms with the fact that she is not likely to save you from your devastating position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided not to defy her. She has been relatively fine so far, but with her demeanor and her age, you have a feeling that perhaps if you got on her bad side you might come to really regret it. Plus, her feet were huge to you. You'd hate to know what it's like to be crushed under one. Still, that's not to say you have zero regrets right now. Obviously the demeaning work you're doing right now crushes your soul itself. If only you had not been stupid enough to crawl into her rank shoe to begin with. In hindsight, it seems so obvious as to why that was a terrible idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for right now, in the present, you are mortified to learn that licking up the grime between her toes is a surprisingly effective cleaning method. However, effectiveness aside, the abysmal smell of her odorous feet combined with the horrid taste of a hard day's sweat has you considering that perhaps there are many preferable alternatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laboriously clean between all of her toes, making them spotless. It's honestly really sad to finish a gap finally and then to step between the next pair of toes and feel like you're back at square one. If only this girl didn't have so many damn toes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou avoid looking up. You know she's filming you, and looking up at the camera will only smack you in the face with a reminder. You'd prefer to hyperfocus on your task and get it done and over with as soon as possible. You try your best to ignore the fact that you're in hell and it's at the feet of a tween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're halfway done on her second foot, your pale goddess deigns to speak to you.<br>\r\n\"Well little dude, I just sent the video to my friends. I can't wait to see their reactions!\" she beams excitedly. Ugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the loud notification noise her phone gives off. She picks it up and starts to read the reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do her friends react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Disbelief. They can't believe what they're seeing. They have to come over and see you right away to actually see you're real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. True Disbelief. They just straight up don't believe their skater friend. They think she just did some really cool video editing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Disgust. Same as True Disbelief, but they're also disturbed she would make such a video in the first place. They badmouth her and ghost her a bit. She gets upset, and perhaps takes it out on you.</span></div></div>",

By all means, you're certainly glad that the actual video evidence of you licking the grime between the toes of a tween skater punk is not being taken at face value, but at the same time you wonder how they could possibly doubt a literal video of it. You are quickly answered, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Zoey, your After Effects skillz are off tha charts,\" she read aloud from her phone. \"I can't believe they have an easier time believing I became amazeballs at video effects overnight than they do that I found a tiny dude,\" she continues to mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. You now had a name for your younger captress. Her name was Zoey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey sighed. \"Well little dude,\" she said, \"it looks like you're nearly done cleaning all my toes. That's super cool of you, to be my little toe cleaner.\" She smiled down at you, with a big, goofy grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made you want to punch her a bit, other than the fact of A. It wouldn't do much and B. If it did, you would have some serious regrets over punching a girl younger than you. That is, only if it could somehow actually hurt. As it stands, you're more than willing to punch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued, \"Tell ya what, teensy boy. You go ahead and finish cleaning out my toes, and then I'll go get us some dinner, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in response, and she smiles some more. This time it's more pleasant. More like an actual, genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still takes you a bit, but after a good fifteen or so minutes you finish cleaning the rest of her toes. She inspects your work thoroughly and praises your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously nice job, little man. You're better for my feet than a shower,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like the sound of that, hopefully she doesn't keep that thought in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'm gonna go grab us some food. You stay here, okay? Here, to keep you busy,\" she says as she taps around on her phone screen a few times before setting it down in front of you, propped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey walks away and out of the room, her footsteps causing immense tremors even on the carpeted floor of her room. The phone before you has Youtube open, and she put on what you assume is one of her favorite channels. It's one of the gaming Youtubers. You don't really keep track of them all that much, so you're not exactly sure who this one is. But after thirty seconds of watching this one video, you can deduce that he is very loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also that maybe Zoey forgot that at your small size, the volume would be much louder for you than it would her. You decided to watch the video from two to three Zoey-length feet away. The sound didn't feel like it was trying to burst your eardrums at this distance, and since the phone is so big to you it was kinda like being in the theater, so you didn't mind being a ways away from the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you do find this Youtuber and his unnecessary yelling somewhat annoying, you find yourself thinking that it was at least considerate of Zoey to not just leave you waiting with nothing to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how long it is before she returns, but once she's back she flops down on the ground near you, plate in hand. You can't help but watch how carelessly she sat down on the ground so close to you. You can't help but replay the way her but slammed into the floor with zero care for how the ground felt. It sounded silly put that way, but the truth was Zoey unintentionally put a new fear in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your mini-panic attack over the thought of being sat on by Zoey passes as she takes her phone, taps a couple times, and then the video appears on her TV behind you, right where it left off on the phone. Neat, she has a smart TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you find yourself mesmerized with her television. If you thought her phone was a big screen, her TV was something else. It was a monument unto itself. And it was so much farther and higher up. You could only imagine how awesome this sort of experience would be for a theater for normal-sized people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey seemed to actually like this Youtuber's seemingly-random screaming. She burst into laughter almost every single time. This baffled you, but you kinda just shrug it off. Different target audience? To each their own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zoey is absolutely enthralled by the man in the giant box so so far away, your stomach growls. You watch her munch down on the burrito she's holding. Truth be told it was a bit gross, Zoey may be a girl but she is far from ladylike. She's making an absolute mess, not to mention laughing with her mouth full, which is also pretty gross. But you're so hungry you can almost ignore all of that. You're just obsessed staring at half of the burrito she hasn't eaten yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time a quarter of the burrito is left, she happens to glance down at you. She sees you staring at her, and glances at her burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"El-oh-el little dude, ya starvin'?\" she asked, almost in a slightly teasing tone. She sets the plate down next you, and reaches her index and thumb into the open side of her burrito and pinches out some ground beef. She plops a teeny pile on the plate for you, then sticks her fingers in her mouth. \"There ya go man, hope that gets the taste of my feet outta your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb onto the plate and practically dive into the ground beef. It's heavenly, it's amazing, it's so delicious. You can't tell if the quality of the food seems so great because hello, giant food, or if it's just a relief for your tastebuds to be enjoying actual food as opposed to Zoey's foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you relish your pinch of meat. And to be honest, even though she gave you what seemed so little, to you it was still a sizeable pile of meat, and you didn't even finish that much. But you were full and content for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back up at Zoey and she shoves the last portion of the burrito into her mouth. The chunk was a bit too big to be the last bite, so she doesn't even close her mouth all the way while she works at chewing it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself that Zoey is pretty gross. She eats like a slob and obviously lacks decent personal hygiene. But, if more moments with her were like this, and less like licking the gunk from between her toes, then you think that maybe it won't be too bad hanging out with her for a couple days until she gets you the help you need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey wipes the burrito remnants smeared around her mouth off on her sleeve, then walks out of the room with the plate, hopefully taking it back to the kitchen. When she returns, she informs you it's time to get ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strips down to just her underwear and tosses the rest of her clothes carelessly onto the floor. She takes off her bra, thankfully away from you, and grabs a ratty t-shirt full of holes and puts it on. Still, it was a bit more than you expected or wanted to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry little duderino, hope you don't mind, I don't exactly <i>do</i> the whole pajamas thing. Not my style. Anyway, I've been thinking about sleeping arrangements, and here's what I've decided,\" she informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You're going to sleep right next her head, on her pillow. She jokes about rolling on top of you and smushing you with her head, but then more seriously warns you she does drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She's going to nestle you between her breasts while she sleeps. She says if it gets too hot, it shouldn't be too hard to get out, since she's no longer wearing a bra. She also warns you that she sweats a lot in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. She tells you she thought about it long and hard, but decided you're gonna sleep in the back of her underwear. She's not comfortable leaving you to sleep on your own, and it's the place she says she feels you're most contained. Based on her giggling and annoying grin, you can also tell she just thinks it's funny you'll be stuck with her ass all night.</span></div></div>",

They're probably pretty huge to an itty-bitty guy like you.\" Zoey snickered as she closed you into a loose fist. Now in bed, she was ready to tuck you away for the night. The only source of light in the endless void of the room was her smart TV. With her free hand, she pulled at the neckline of her t-shirt. The skater deposited you inside with a quick motion, giggling even more as your tiny form made contact with her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrinkled your nose as you were dumped into the hollow between her breasts. The stale smell of sweat was omnipresent, making it abundantly clear that she hadn't showered that day. Your plush surroundings were already a bit slick with fresh perspiration. This was gonna be a long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night, teeny dude.\" Zoey's teasing voice rumbled through her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night.\" You muttered back passively. After the day you'd had, you wanted nothing more than to rest. Even if it meant spending the night squished between a sweaty pair of tweenage boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curled up, sinking into the flesh around you. You wouldn't willingly admit it, but Zoey had been right earlier. Her modest chest provided decently comfortable bedding. Her smooth skin had more give than your mattress at home. Slender as she was, Zoey had developed enough up top to give you a soft little nook to sleep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkward intimacy and sweat aside, the girl's chest was an agreeable spot. You were engulfed by warm, cushiony mass. The gentle heaving of her lungs rocked you into slumber. </span></div></div>",

Who knows how annoyed she'd have been if you had woken her. No one likes their alarm clocks, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey shifts, and you find your whole world shifting at the same time. The boob opposite you peels away and drifts apart, indicating she must be on her back now. With some room to breathe, somewhat literally speaking, you can now see from what little light gets through the black canopy above that it must be at least morning enough to be light out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it appears you are somewhat plastered to the side of Zoey's left breast, a night of sweat and pressure lightly gluing you there. You begin to wish she had chosen almost anywhere else for you to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort, you manage to pry your arms free and push yourself away from her boob. As you're working on freeing yourself, the titaness beneath you moves again. The shifting pull of gravity gives you a heads up: She's sitting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially you are glad, as this means she's awake. But then you consider that you were just finally prying yourself free of her boob, and suddenly you wish to take it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it's too late, and gravity peels you the rest of the way off and you tumble down her midsection, bouncing between shirt and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you land headfirst onto the bed, you roll forward and look up. Zoey is sitting up in bed, hair disheveled and eyes blankly staring off into the distance. She's clearly barely awake, and not a morning person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you notice your surroundings. You are now between her pale thighs, face-to-face with her purple and black-striped panties, emblazoned with a cutesy angry skull on the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not where you intended or wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. It's okay, Zoey notices you and scoops you up. It's time to start your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Zoey shifts around in bed, reaching for her phone.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zoey's bleary eyes happened to shift their focus down to where you were, between her legs. She just stared for a few minutes, and blinked slowly. She seemed barely awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, little dude,\" she muttered sleepily, \"didn't feel you fall out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer large fingers wrapped around your body and lifted you up. The g-forces of rising so fast were disorienting, but you were just glad to be free of the looming image of the cartoony punk crotch skull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Zoey stand up and start walking. Being in her grip as she walked down the hall did feel a bit like a weird ride at a theme park, with the intense swaying back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you were deposited on a white marble counter top. The massive form of Zoey walked away to the fridge. You looked around her kitchen, and came to a surprising revelation: Zoey's family must be doing pretty well. Upper middle class, at least. Her kitchen alone seems much fancier than yours at home, or any of your friends' houses that you've been to. And none of your families are doing all that bad, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do find yourself quickly devolving into a mental spiral of considering the possible connection between Zoey's family doing so well and her desire to become a scene/punk/skater kid with a rebellious and grungy vibe. She obviously doesn't even shower all that much, her shoes are ancient and well beyond overworn. Perhaps she feels a need to distance herself from her family and their money? Maybe this is the way she needs to show she has individuality and is separate from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents must be relatively chill, you'd imagine most upper-upper middle class parents would not allow their child to dress, behave, and <i>smell</i> like they're poor. That being said, it's not a mansion either, so while they're well beyond simply comfortable, they're definitely not <i>rich</i> either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought does occur to you, though, that the reason you're seeing the rest of her house for the first time now is because the first time you passed through here, it was from the confines of Zoey's offensively horrendous skate shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your thoughts are interrupted with a loud clang. A huge, looming metal can has been set on the counter only a few feet from you. It's a giant Monster. It looms well over you, and at your size, you can feel the cold air emanating from it. Zoey's fingers reach for the tab and crack it open with a loud hiss. She sits at a stool in front of you, periodically sipping the energy drink and browsing her phone. Otherwise, she's more or less ignoring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does get up again when the spring mechanism of the toaster goes off. She hops up to go grab her breakfast. You had assumed Pop-Tarts of some flavor, but were pleasantly surprised when she plopped down a plate with piping hot Toaster Strudels near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sips her Monster, she glances over and notices you drooling at her strudels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead dude, you can nibble some,\" she said. She grabbed the strudel further from you and begin to munch on it, while going back to browsing on her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou excitedly march on over to the plate, climb on top of the knee-level ceramic surface, and immediately start scraping some flakes off to eat. You dip them into the frosting and enjoy. It's honestly heavenly to you, even though you're missing the filling. It would take too much work to burrow into anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you and Zoey finish up breakfast, and she carries you back to her room, much more awake than before. She sets you down among the large carpet fibers, and sits on her bed, over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright shorty, you did a great job on my toes yesterday, I'm like, super duper proud. So that's why I need your help again today.\" She reaches over next to her end table and grabs her high tops and sets them a few feet away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My skates are pretty rank, and while I like them nice and <i>used</i>, I'd love for you to freshen them up for me,\" she says with a toothy smile. Her facial expression implies she knows she's asking a big job of you, but also that she's treating it like whimsy, like she's demanding you rake her front yard. You are incredulous at what she's asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So go ahead and clean them up. You can get the insides and the tread on bottom, but don't clean the top, I don't want you to ruin my Sharpie artwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some artwork...\" you grumble to yourself, taking note of how shoddily the high tops are scribbled in with the blacks, reds, and purples of her choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they don't taste too bad. I don't know which will be worse, the tread or the insides. You should let me know when you're done! Make sure you do a good job, I want my shoes to look nice so I can impress Shelby and Angel before they see you in person. Then they'll like my video a whole lot more when they know you're real!\" she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, she still plans to show you to her friends. Honestly, you're pretty pissed that she's so blas\u00e9 about making you lick her shoes clean. She had started to grow on you a little bit, but it's clear now that she still thinks of you as her miniature foot slave. Not a good place to be in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey leaves you to your work as she walks out of her room. Where do you start?</span></div></div>",

How did you get to shrunken foot slave from there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou observe the giant DC high top shoes, and consider about how to go about this. You figure it doesn't matter much. So you climb up onto the toe of the shoe and use the laces as handholds to climb up to the mouth of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you get near the mouth of the shoe, you feel the air being permeated by the smell of feet and sweat. Breathing in that horrid smell, your heart sinks as you realize it's your job to remove that smell. With your tongue. How inhumane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing,\" you mutter, before vaulting yourself into the mouth of the shoe. You drop, and land onto the squishy surface inside. The smell is so much worse inside. You take a minute on your hands and knees, able to do nothing but breathe in the smell and try not to get sick. It didn't help that as your hands pressed down into the spongy insole, they felt damp from the long-ago soaked sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, you get yourself under control, and you're about to get up when you realize...this is already where you need to be. You groan, thinking about what you're about to do. But enough thinking, time to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean down, stick out your tongue, and run it across the rough surface of the insole. Your face contorts as you feel wet grime scrape onto your tongue, in a shocking amount. You let your tongue back into your mouth and swallow it, gagging a bit afterward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you see the small streak where your tongue picked up the filth. Even though it was a streak cleaner than its surrounding area, it still wasn't completely clean there, either. There was still more grime to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe at the thought, but give in. You lean down and run your tongue across the rough surface again, picking up a new mouthful of disgusting dirt and sweat. And once again, you swallow it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeat the disgusting process, over and over again. Your mouth should not be used this way, you think. But still, you continue. For three hours, you lick away at the filthy insole of this preteen's skate shoe. You are very thorough, and in this time you finish the heel and over half of the arch. The areas you've cleaned so far look nearly brand new, at least in color. Other things give away their age, like tears and the like. But you've definitely done your job well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate that you notice as you work your way down the arch and further inside the shoe that the taste of sweat and grime gets stronger, as does the smell. That, coupled with the fact that as you move way from the shaft of light pouring in from the mouth as you walk deeper into the dark, makes the process feel more and more grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been at it for a while now. But now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You continue and finish this insole. The entire thing looks great, you did a wonderful job. Just one problem. You can't get out of the shoe by yourself, and Zoey still expects you to clean the treads of this shoe, not to mention the insole and treads of the other shoe. Uh oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Zoey comes back to check on you. She is so impressed with how thoroughly and deeply you've cleaned what you have so far, she gives you a short break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Zoey comes back to check on you. Unfortunately, she expected you to be much faster, so she's disappointed that you haven't even finished the insole after three whole hours. She does take the opportunity to film you some more, though. </span></div></div>",

Please take me outta here! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she did she picked you up and placed you onto the palm of her hand , surprisingly soft. You'd thought someone like her would have rougher hands but you were wrong , looking up she seem to be a bit stuck.

The ground quakes and pitches with the lean behemoths. You groan as you\u2019re tossed about, sent rolling across the bedsheet as she moves. The simple act of her leaning toward the nightstand is enough turn your world upside-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal skater reaches her phone as you tumble to a stop. Disoriented and flat on your back, you realize you're in the shadow of something absolutely massive; Zoey\u2019s ass. To your horror, the inch of space between you and her panty-clad backside instantly vanishes as she moves back into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even have time to shout before you\u2019re buried under her butt. Tons of toned muscle, mercifully tempered by a layer of fatty flesh, nearly crush the wind out of you. Overwhelming body-heat radiates through the thin fabric of her panties. You're thankful for the striped cloth, the only barrier between you and an ass cheek big enough to squash a house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey shimmies briefly to get comfortable, obliviously grinding you into her sheet. The mattress creaks deeply under her weight. She settles in, likely scrolling through her social media with you unintentionally sandwiched between her soft bed and softer rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh.</i> You groan in your mind. The salty scent of sweat emanates from Zoey's huge cheek. To be honest, the pain isn't as bad as you would've thought. It\u2019s definitely uncomfortable but not entirely unbearable. Still, you can't help but be mildly irritated and grossed out. You're stuck under a giant <i>ass</i>. The drowsy girl sitting on you hadn't even noticed that you\u2019d fallen out of her shirt. She sleepily tapped through Instagram, clearly in no rush to start the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Eventually light pours in as Zoey feels something beneath her butt.

Her panties were riding up and, much to your dismay, dragging you with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wheezed a labored groan as her cheeks lazily engulfed your entire body. Wedged into a fold of thick cloth, you could do little to fight the massive mounds. Zoey didn't have much in the way of figure but her ass was more than large enough to hold something as tiny as you in place. It was a legitimate gorge of flesh, slowly but surely enveloping her underwear and, by extension, you. Darkness somehow became darker as you were forced into her crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey continued browsing on her phone, unaware of your embarrassing plight. You had no way of knowing how long your skater bedmate spent lounging. You sighed, entirely immobilized between the hills of her perky tush. Round and toned, her cheeks left you no hope of escape. It was up to her to get you out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fleshy prison began to shift as Zoey finally started to get out of bed. Some of her impossible weight lifted away and you were able to take a deep breath of stale air. You were rolled between the oblivious girl\u2019s glutes as she stood, humiliatingly tucked into an enormous wedgie. The pert walls around you ground against each other. She was stretching. You were mashed into an awkward position as muscle clenched behind soft fat. It kept you from slipping free while she moved around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLodged squarely between two meaty ass cheeks, all you could do is hope to be noticed.

And yet still Zoey was more fascinated with the latest stupid instagram trend. The further you were pushed, the more the old rancid sweat that had fermented since her last walk got to you, the ripe odor reminding you that hygiene was low on her priority list and she had NOT taken a shower last night. Surely high on her priority list this morning, but that didn't help now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook in bed, giggling at a 'guess he doesn't kiss ya' tiktok and sending you through the toned cheeks just enough to see her... eugh, her anus. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not like it was disgusting (more than the usual) or she didn't clean it like a normal human, she wasn't a savage. But really concerning was there was some kind of... bump, red, not far above the wrinkled, greasy hole. You didn't know what it was, and you probably didn't want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, truth is Zoey sleeps with her windows cracked. This time of year cold insects like to find warm sources of food, and well, a mosquito had somehow found its way down to Zoey's lower puckered butt lips. It probably died of poisoning because whatever came from there was most definitely good for no one, but it had escaped her panties alive at least, because you hate bugs, just slightly more than anuses. Unfortunately for you, the itchiness from the bite was starting to get to her as she woke up. She wasn't a huge fan, and she'd forgotten she had a little friend to help her in these situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with a wiggle, hoping it would go away with minimal movements. That only pushed you closer to the source and got the blood flowing as she angrily swiped through her feed. Now actively annoyed, she buried down on her butt, putting her full force into the wiggle. Your body, nearly indestructible, took the force but it shoved your face right into her fresh, night-sweat ridden bootyhole, the tips of your hair grazing the bite and resolving it a bit. That wasn't bad, but the itch wasn't going away that way. After stopping for a second to admire a hot hunk on instagram, she had an idea. Well, she was alone in her room anyway, so... maybe a little toot would drive the damn thing away. She could feel some gas in her guts anyway, so why not let loose while she was alone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel forces beyond your control building behind the preteen pucker. You had... a REALLY bad feeling about this. Her bootyhole got sweatier, and so did you, as the grumbles made their way closer, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I totally have to save up for these new kicks, they are totally rocking!\" Zoey said from above, distracted by an instagram ad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief - boom, a potent booty blast was unleashed, carrying the smell of methane, old dairy, and rotten eggs. The air was forcibly knocked from your lungs so you could fully experience it, and the pulsating anus slapped you a couple times for good measure. The bassy fart slowly tapered off, much to your relief. It was over. Please, just tell me so finally noticed me. Maybe even those nasty feet would be preferable honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this damn itch won't go away. Guess I'll just like, scratch it directly... eugh.

And then... she started to use you as a personal ass scrubber. All the way to the bottom of her freshly oiled butthole, to the top where the bug bite was, and back three times. You weren't going to get the smell - or taste - of all this out any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1 - She feels you as something weird, and pulls you out to look at you, shocked and sorry you got stuck down there. You like, totes deserve mad respect and a reward for that disgustingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2 - She feels you as something weird, and pulls you out to look at you, shocked and disgusted you crawled down there while she slept. Well like, if her foot disgustingness isn't fine enough for you, then fine, she's cool letting you stay there. Maybe she'll eat that week old ramen in the back of the fridge too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3 - She totally thought she was just using her panty tag for all that!

You couldn't help but feel grossed out. You were like a bug at the behemoth basketball player's toes. Shuddering at the thought of what they would be like bare, you grabbed onto a single shoelace. You began pulling, slowly undoing the tight knot atop her foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" You looked up in time to see Amber peer down from the sky, her giant cheeks still filled with water. Her dark eyebrows furrowed in confusion as she swallowed what would've been gallons of cool liquid to you. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smooth, sculpted legs towering above you began to bend as she crouched. Thick muscle bulged under the skin of her thighs and calves. An equally toned arm reached toward you, its enormous hand splayed open. You instinctively cringed as her fingers closed, swallowing you into a massive fist. You felt your dark prison begin to lift, carrying you into the heavens. Intense body heat radiated from the tough skin around you. As the tan hand opened again, you found it was about level with the hills of a tank top-clad chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring for a second too long, you yanked your gaze upward. The huge face looking back was admittedly rather striking. Deep, brown eyes were wide with shock. Full lips hung open, at a total loss for words. Even blown up to billboard-size, you couldn't see many flaws in her golden-brown skin. You froze, simultaneously a bit terrified and mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Amber recognizes you and wants to help. She ends her practice early to take you back to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Training comes first.

You were evidence of that, as you always go several times during the Summer. Oftentimes you don't even bother with the water, you just love the atmosphere. Everyone's having a good, carefree time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid your towel out and applied your sunscreen. It was time to sunbathe for a bit. Lying down on your towel, you felt a little sleepy. You hadn't brought your wallet or anything with you, so you felt no harm dozing for a bit, despite having come alone. You let the sounds of waves and all the people and music surrounding you be your lullaby as you drifted off into peaceful slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you could really feel the sun beating down on you. Somehow, it felt a lot more intense than before. You sat up, and looked around. Large, white fibers rose up from the ground in every direction, hundreds of feet all around. What was going on? Then you looked around you and saw the other beach dwellers. There was only one problem. They were absolutely mammoths. Every single one of them was humongous, and so far away. It didn't take long for you to realize that you had shrunken, and this strange expanse around you was your beach towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get help from someone, but from who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour options were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearby girl building a sandcastle. She looked about 7 or so. She looks very happy and positive, she could be nice to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo girls you see stomping someone else's sand castle. They both look about 10 or so. They're clearly bullies, but they're the closest people to you. You think you saw one of them eying the aforementioned girl's sand castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone who looks about your age, also sun-bathing. Getting to her would be quite a trek, but she's a lot older and would probably be more understanding. Plus, since her eyes are closed, you can approach her with about any method you desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lifeguard. She looks slightly older, probably 18 or 19. She's honestly pretty darn hot, but that's not why you want her attention. Clearly, if anyone is the authority to go to, it's gonna be here. But out of all of your options, she's the farthest. Anyone else is even farther, and not worth it. So who's it gonna be?</span></div></div>",

You figure you might as well go to the two girls stomping sandcastles, since they're a lot closer than most others. Sure, they don't seem like necessarily the nicest, but they look to be around 10 years old or so. Surely they would help someone in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin the arduous journey of simply making it off your beach towel. You take long strides to avoid the large fibers offering too much resistance. And you do your best to ignore the sweltering heat. You think it's not too bad, until you reach the sand. Then, the heat gets so much worse. The ground itself feels like it's throwing heat right back up at you. Your only reprieve is you're pretty sure you're getting a decent tan right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over the sand at your size is difficult, because it's like walking across dunes of gravel. After several minutes, you get the hang of it well enough, and you become focused on your goal. You zone in on the girls, they <i>will</i> save you, and you <i>will</i> get help. You continue your march.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>THUD</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flesh-colored monolith stomps into the sand in front of you. Sand rains from above, pelting your skin. In only a moment, the monolith is gone. There is a large crater in the sand in front of you. Taking a moment to get your bearings after what felt like a near-death experience, you peek forward and see the crater is actually a footprint in the sand. You look off to your left, and see a giant woman, far away and getting ever farther, jogging in the sand barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou alter your path to go around the massive footprint, since you don't feel like trying to go through it, and now you take extra care to watch your surroundings. You would hate to get absent-mindedly crushed just because you weren't looking both ways before crossing the desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you are finally near the girls. They are taking a short break, admiring the sandcastle they just finished turning to dust...er, sand. Their hands are on their hips and their faces filled with smirks. You do feel slightly concerned about them, but they're right here, now. And they're your best bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one do you approach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The girl on the left. She's wearing a blue one-piece swimming suit with wave designs, has pale white skin, and shoulder-length wavy brunette hair. Based on what you've seen from watching the two girls, this one might be the lackey of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The girl on the right. She's wearing a purple one-piece swimming suit with black accents. She has light brown skin and long, braided black hair. You think she may be the leader of their little duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Turns out they had a third friend...who came up behind you, and saw you before you saw them.</span></div></div>",

With the sun beating down, it would have been an even longer trek across what was to you a vast desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt downright puny as you trudged through the fibers of your own beach towel. It was a struggle just to get to the sand. Your bottle of sunscreen towered in the distance like a small office building. You were thankful for the lotion it contained, which was protecting you from the sunburn of a lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey across the sand was a nightmare. It shifted and sunk under your feet, nearly swallowing your entire lower body a few times. You were baked by the sun\u2019s oppressive rays. It had been hot before but at your new size you might as well have been in an oven. To make matters worse, you\u2019d occasionally cross paths with a colossal beach-goer. They lumbered by, never once noticing your minute presence at their toes. Their mammoth stomps almost buried you in a shower of white gravel. All things considered, you were lucky not to have ended up flattened in a giant footprint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were exhausted by the time you reached the edge of the girl\u2019s towel. Up close, the surreal landscape of her body was jaw-dropping. Having approached from her side, you were directly across from the bottom of her white bikini. It stood out against a warm complexion. Her light brown skin seemed stretch endlessly in either direction. It was hard not to stare. The sunbather formed a wall of latte-colored flesh, glistening with a mixture of sweat and sunscreen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could just make out her face as you glanced far to your right. It was framed by a voluminous cloud of dark hair. Her eyes were closed, giving her a relaxed air. Her humongous torso heaved with every tranquil breath. She seemed entirely at peace. Hopefully she would be too mad at you for interrupting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You head for her top. If you can make it up her chest, you'll be able to reach her face and get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You go for a safer (and less awkward) option, climbing into her hand. If you're felt, it'll essentially be an elevator to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Before you can decide, she rolls onto her stomach! You end up trapped under her belly button.</span></div></div>",

The dingy soles, once a pristine white but now worn smooth and tarnished gray, hover overhead for a heart-wrenching moment, before splitting away and slamming to the ground to both sides of you, resting on their toes with her heels against the chair legs. Her pale skin peeks out from a hint of ankle sock, leading to her towering calves that soared up and out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sink to your knees. How did this happen? You were a normal guy, just living your life, but now?

You're awestruck as her hand descends from above the table top; you watch, enraptured, as she jams a finger between foot and shoe, the sounds of her itching roaring over you once, twice, three times, before her forearm tightens, and with force you could never hope to muster, she pulls her foot free. The discarded trainer clatters sideways to the ground mere feet from you, its yawning mouth releasing a cloud of sweaty air over you, as she pulls the freed foot up and tucks it beneath herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw your hands over your mouth, struggling to catch your breath. <i>God, that's beyond rank.</i> Even at this distance, the air felt humid, as if her jogging had imbued the very atmosphere with her sweaty essence. Still, this presented an opportunity. The discarded shoe was stationary and made of rather worn out fabric, an easy climb. If you could secure yourself on it, you could hitch a ride with this woman until a better chance to grab her attention arose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shift in air currents blows another fresh gust of her scent your way, and you have to hold back a gag. Then again, it might be better to stay far away from that rank, dank cave. Her other foot, still completely shoed, was only a little further away. Maybe you could just climb that? It seemed still enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a waitress's thick slip-proof shoes stomp over, her voice ringing out above. \"What can I get for ya?\" Time was running out, before your closest chance at salvation got back up and stranded you.</span></div></div>",

Each step covers only fractions of an inch, yet the towering teen seems to grow further and further as you approach. Still, you head on, focused on her, or more specifically her flats. The exposed skin is your best bet to getting noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. Can I get your order?\" A voice rings out from the heavens, and without warning a wall of black drops down before you. The force knocks you from your feet, and with a yelp you tumble into the hard rubber. The waitress who's shoe you just slammed into doesn't react. You peer up, heart dropping as you realize that you need to crane your neck to even see the pale strip of ankle between sock and trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl speaks her order, the waitress rocks her foot forward, resting her weight on its ball and revealing its towering sole to the world. It soared over you, a dark, scuffed maze, with foodstuffs of all kind jammed in the treads. You gulped, frozen in fear, staring at chunks of fries and pastries and sandwiches, each large enough to feed you for a month, and each trampled beneath the woman's steps beneath her notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as soon as it had appeared, her foot vanished, the rush of displaced air pulling you to the ground. \"I'll be right back with your drink~,\" she said, her voice echoing in the distance, already becoming lost in the coffee shop's din.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to your feet. The image of the waitress's sole was engraved in your mind... You couldn't help but see yourself among it, a red splotch hidden between other stains she carelessly trod upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your plan to get the bookworm's attention seemed hasty. Sure, you could probably touch her skin, but now that you've seen just how insignificant you are, how were you going to ever get her to feel you? Her skin, usually soft and delicate, was now a tough armor, thicker than your body! Plus, the so called \"easy\" path still involved getting on top of her shoes, which in hindsight would require you to actively climb the floral flats on her feet. What if she moved? Or what if she just didn't feel you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had the sudden feeling that you were going to die like this...</span></div></div>",

If she moves, you're gonna be flung off, and if she sees you its only gonna be as the speck you are, nothing but a bug to be squashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the seconds pass. You start to sweat, the heat radiating off her skin getting to you. Everything was still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with speed that shouldn't have been possible, she moved, her foot rocketing backwards. You're thrown back, your screaming form slamming into the fabric of the bow, clutching to it with all your worth as the goddess moves.

Her eyes, the same shade of brown as her cascading hair, flitted about, scanning the area for whatever graced her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle back to your full height, ignoring the throbbing bruises she created just by shifting her foot. \"Oi!\" you shout, projecting your voice as best as you could. \"Miss, I need your help!

However, things weren't quite as simple as driving to Hyperion High and dropping it off, mostly due to the fact that Emily didn't go to Hyperion High. After junior high, your mom and Emily had talked it over and Emily had gotten her way. She got to go to Selene School for Girls, a girls only high school on the other side of Atlas City with a notable reputation for its athletics program (and the associated college scholarships its students often received).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you did as your mother had asked, and drove over to Selene. Along the way you did fume a lot about having to do this for Emily. You and her had already had a pretty bad argument the other day that left you feeling bitter. Not to mention, you felt like her bringing her lunch revealed how spoiled she could be, considering you bought your own lunch at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you arrived at Selene School for Girls, a far more prestigious looking set of buildings than Hyperion. It even had a gate and wall around the school grounds, which you nervously walked up to once you had parked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have business here?\" A feminine voice spoke up, amidst a bit of static, after a confused look around, you eventually noticed a black intercom box, a light indicating it was active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I'm Emily's brother, she forgot her lunch at home,\" You replied, feeling a little odd about being here. You held up the bag and gestured to it, unsure if the voice was watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, her mother called ahead and cleared it, please bring it to the main office straight ahead.\" The voice replied, her tone serious and businesslike as if to suggest you should not wander of. Accompanying this, the gate ahead shuddered and slide open while the light on the intercom went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had any questions they'd have to wait. Still the instructions were clear enough as you walked into the central courtyard. Inside the wall, you saw a three story building ahead at the end of a well-kept lone divided by crisscrossing sidewalks. It was flanked on either side by longer two story buildings that looked to be classrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage a few steps before you're overcome by a sudden bout of dizziness. You end up dropping Emily's lunch sack as you fingers go numb. Clutching your head, you end up going down on your knees. Your ears ring for a moment, your vision goes white and the whole world shoots up aground you. Coming to a second later, you glance back and see you're in the shadow of Emily's lunch bag, barely an inch tall. The only cause must have been the accident in school almost a week ago, but for now, you needed to figure out what to do...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weekend had gone by without a hitch, though you were still fairly nervous as you went into school that day. A jittery feeling of anxiety haunted you at the start of the day as you worried about whether or not someone involved had told a teacher or the chemistry teacher had noticed something amiss in the class. It faded by the end of the day though as you managed to avoid getting into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point, you had bigger things to take care of. On Monday, your mom helped out with one of several after school programs. That in turn left you, the oldest, in charge of making sure you and your siblings were fed. Today would be a nice change of pace though. Emily had a cross-country meet which would no doubt be followed by a trip to the mall. Samantha had an away soccer game that would have her out till late in the evening. Sophie was over at a friend's house to have dinner. Then finally Andy had been taken on a playdate with his nanny's niece. In short, the house would be your's and, more importantly, you could eat what ever you wanted without having to take any of your siblings' picky tastes into mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast food seemed the best option, a bit of a treat considering you usually just heated up TV dinners or made mac and cheese (one of few foods all your siblings would enjoy). It was also an excuse not to put in extra work on cooking. Still, fast food left you with plenty of options, options you debated as you sat in your car, watching Hyperion High's parking lot slowly clear out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan Burger was the go-to fast food place in town, a bit of a local icon actually. It was famous throughout the city for its thick, greasy burgers and signature chili fries. You even got tourists stopping in the city just to try it. Downside there was, of course, it would be pretty crowded and busy at this hour. Students stopped in there after class, families came in for an early dinner, college students snuck in for cheap meal. It might be a slight wait, it would definitely be noisy, but it had been so long since you had a Titan Double Cheeseburger that it would probably be worth it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice of Heaven Pizza, on the other hand, was a much smaller place, hidden in a strip mall on the other side of the grocery store. Most people passed it up in favor of larger chains, but as far as you were concerned that was a very big mistake. Slice of Heaven had some of the best pizza in Atlas City, not to mention a generous selection of toppings, sauces, crusts, and cheese. There was only one downside. Shelby, their new delivery driver, has hated you since you turned down her friend's romantic advances. Still, a walk-in would minimize your chances of running into her and hopefully prevent any tampering with the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCirce's Subs and Sandwiches was probably the worst choice of the three places you had in mind. Circe's was a small local chain of sub shops that let you customize your sandwich, sub, or wrap in one of four cookie cutter establishments. It was a bit of a healthier option, yes, but also a bit more expensive. There was, however, one thing that would encourage you to go there. You knew from previous visits that this Circe's hired a lot of cute girls for part-time positions AND had a pretty hot manager running the place. Add in the fact that Monday was a slow day and you might be able to start something up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drummed the wheel, watching as the last few cars exited the lot. With a nod and a smile, you turned the key, put it into drive, and started to head for ______.</span></div></div>",

The pit of your stomach feel heavy, and the room starts to spin. The arcade was mostly deserted, save for a handful of kids and tweens, and in the dim light nobody noticed your rapid loss in size. Your body dwindled in an instant, your tiny form stumbling near a handful of groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your left was a group of young boys all clustered around a fighting game. Two of them were intensely focused on the buttons while the rest cheered or jeered them in response to the moves. There had to be 5 or 6 of them, and they looked relatively young- you'd guess they ranged from 7 to 14. They seemed really interested in their game, but one of them might see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your right, there was a lone girl in a heavy sweatshirt and sneakers who looked to be playing to beat the high score. She looked like she had been here a while, her hair kind of greasy - she didn't seem to care about appearances, and she must have been somewhere from 14 to 18 years old. She was pretty focused as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more arcade to search, if you wanted to go to the skee-ball racks, you might find someone more easily approached. </span></div></div>",

The weekend felt very intense, with the nagging feeling that someone might have told a teacher or their parents. Monday passed with the same feeling, but by evening, it had faded. Tuesday in turn was a normal day and by the end of it, the incident was in the back of your mind. Partially that was due to you having more important things to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nick, please stop at Rhea's Market and pick up a gallon of milk, a dozen of eggs...' The list went on from there, but you had the basic idea looking over the text message from your mother when you finally got out of school. Rhea's Market was a grocery store that you passed every day on your way back from school. It would be a slight detour, but there wasn't much point in arguing about it, especially via text. At the very least your were confident your mom would reimburse you for what you had to spend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you'd pulled into the parking lot for Rhea's market, parked, and gone inside. The grocery store wasn't too terribly crowded, stepping in you saw at least a few people there. Though glancing around, you grumbled as you realized no shopping carts were present at the entrance. Hoping, with any luck, you might find one abandoned further in the store, you begin to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part the customers you passed looked to be a bit older than you, likely college students restocking their dorms after classes. Some seemed a bit more drained than others, as you could confirm when you brushed shoulders with a tired-looking blonde as she hobbled around the corner. She turned to face you for a moment, giving you a good view of the typical too-lazy-to-care college girl attire; graphic t-shirt, sweat pants, and Ugg boots.She grumbled something, but otherwise continued on, carrying a basket belabored with junk food and ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was a lot better of an encounter than what you found on the next aisle. A mother in her early thirties, wearing a frustrated expression stepped past you, her two pretreen children parading after with cheers and screams. The mother was pretty good looking, especially given her red hair and hefty chest, but her two bratty kids definitely encouraged you to shuffle past her in your continued search for a cart. You glanced back, silently hoping a look might quiet the two kids down. The brown-haired girl, likely the younger one, was constantly trying to sneak items from the shelves into the cart. In contrast to the red-head who waited till the right moment to tell on her sister, in hopes of getting her in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just need to find a cart and get out of here,\" You muttered to yourself, briefly thankful that as much as your sisters got on your nerves, none of them were that ill-behaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe task you spoke of would soon become that much more difficult. As you exited the previous aisle, you felt a wave of nausea. Your vision wavered and faded for a second as you stumbled backwards onto your ass. The world around you felt like it was expanding as your stomach did a flip. You blinked a few times, your vision returning to you as you held back a wave of nausea. The tiles beneath you shook. Boom. Boom! BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive black object landed to your left, lifting up a second later to reveal a dusty tread pattern. It took a few seconds to realize as you watched the object continue to rise and fall. You'd been shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching with new realization, you saw the the black object was actually a massive tennis shoe. Following it up, you quickly made out a dark-skinned woman, probably only a year or two older than you. Judging by her outfit, black shoes, black pants, and a green apron...she was a worker at Rhea's Market. Admittedly, you couldn't help but stare as she squatted down a few dozen feet away from you, backside pressing against her tight pants. She stared at a display of cereal boxes ahead of herself, regarding it with a bored expression that suggested she was feigning working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around at the sound of more foot steps, you saw that more people were closing in on this intersection. The mother of two was pushing her cart down, the wheels closing in dangerously face. The college girl with the basket was coming up the aisle you'd just come from, not really paying attention where she was going. Fortunately, rather than all running over you....they stopped. The mother stopped to scold her two daughters as she caught one trying to sneak a chocolate bar in. The college girl paused to look at the prices of mac and cheese. You had time to make a choice now....which would you try to get the attention of?</span></div></div>",

It should be a lot easier to get her attention higher up like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't bother running, because you know you'll spend a lot of energy climbing.

A pair of shoes in the distance look like huge looming buildings to you. When you finally approach them, climbing them suddenly seems a lot easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your time to asses the shoes, you notice something peculiar. These shoes seem dirtier and more worn than you would expect. You find a decent grip near where the ball of the foot would be inside, and manage to pull yourself up on top of the shoe with some great effort. Up the laces was easier, they acted as decent footholds but some climbing effort was still required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat got tough was transferring from one shoe to the other. The heel of the other shoe was propped up on top of this shoe. You struggled to find somewhere to pull yourself up, but eventually you found some decent dips in the  designs of the shoe that you got enough friction with your skin to pull up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all climbing both shoes took you a good fifteen minutes, but eventually you were pulling yourself up on the rim of the mouth of the shoe, beneath the dangling blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pulled yourself up, you were met with even more surprise. A strange smell...faint whiffs of sweat and foot odor...oh my gosh, did the inside of these shoes stink? It wasn't a strong or overwhelming scent, these shoes weren't worn <i>that</i> much...but they were definitely worn enough to stink of sweat and feet still. It finally hit you, Ariana must actually use these shoes to work out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you idolize and adore her, had you known these were Ari's actual running shoes you wouldn't have risked coming over here. It takes your idol down a peg when you're forced to breathe in the scent of their sweaty feet. Gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, if you can just get up on the couch you can be free of Ariana's smelly shoes. You pull yourself all the way up and stand on the rim of the mouth. It's not great footing, and the blanket seems like a bit of a reach. You definitely don't want to fall! But you have to try, you stretch your hand out, and reach for the blanket while trying to maintain your balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your hands wrap around a dangling thread from the blanket just as your feet slip and you lose your footing. Below you is the cavernous opening to Ariana's running shoe and the only thing preventing you from plummeting into the stinky depths of the pop star's footwear is your own upper body strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were never the most athletic, but you held your own in gym class. You at least did your best to remain mildly fit and not too sedentary, and today that bit of effort finally paid off for certain. With great effort, you reached up further, grabbed a handful of blanket, and hoisted yourself, one handful at a time, pulling yourself higher and further away from the terrible fate of falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strain was getting to you before you made it to safety, though. You were becoming exhausted, your muscles beginning to scream with the effort. You had made it maybe fifteen feet up, but you still had plenty to go. You appreciated that the further you climbed, the less you were able to smell the running shoe beneath you. However, no matter how high you climbed, looking down revealed that if you didn't make it all the way to the top, you would still drop into the shoe at any height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed through the pain and exhaustion, and kept climbing. You used both positive and negative encouragement to try and push yourself. If you can climb up, you can get Ariana's attention, and you'll be saved, and only be stuck at this pathetic size for a few hours. And also, if you fail, you'll fall into that smelly running shoe and be stuck for hours, unable to breath fresh air the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure which was more helpful, but regardless you eventually you see victory above. You were just a few feet from the top. Your next handhold changed things, however. As you grabbed and pulled up, you felt the blanket beneath you shift. You saw the top of the couch slide several feet further away. Uh oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour weight finally caused the blanket to slide. With renewed vigor and fear, you started to scramble, trying to climb faster. The blanket seemed more affected by your hurried climbing, and it slipped even more, causing one of your hands to let go. You were dangling by one arm, on a slowly sliding blanket, hovering above the opening to one of Ariana Grande's used running shoes. This is the weirdest and most dangerous predicament of your life thus far, for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun yourself back around towards the blanket and the couch, and grabbed at the blanket with your right hand once again. You took a few deep breaths, and continued your climb slowly. The blanket slipped a little here and there, but now that you were pacing yourself and not hurrying, the sliding was much more infrequent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour muscles were almost completely done with you, you were losing feeling in your arms and in several instances it took you more than one try to muster the strength to pull yourself up further. But finally you slowly but steadily pulled yourself to the top, climbing over the edge and onto flat ground once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid there, flat on your back on top of the blanket that was both your savior but also part of your menacing doom, on top of the couch. You just laid there and let yourself breathe, your arms sprawled out, throbbing in pain. That was really, really rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you did it. You got on top of the couch. This was the beginning of the end, your rescue would be at hand soon. Well, not too soon. You needed to rest a for a little bit, let your arms recuperate. And your chest, your chest hurt too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were wondering if you wanted to take a quick nap, you heard something in the distance. It was a difficult to describe sound. It was as if a boom were really muffled, yet also still much louder than it should be. It only took about five seconds for you to find out what the weird noise was, though. It was footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, in what felt like the impossibly caged sky, you saw two impossible things simultaneously. Your idol, and all-time favorite singer and celebrity crush, Ariana Grande, in the flesh. As well as an impossibly huge titaness, unfathomable in her size and power. This was the first time you had seen a person since you shrunk. And it was surreal. You've never seen Ariana Grande IRL before, to be fair, but you knew she was five feet tall, which gave you a whole foot on her. Well, it used to. You knew Ariana was supposed to be somewhat petite, but not to you. To you she was now a walking goddess, her mere act of walking changing the air currents you felt in the room around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she looked so beautiful. I mean, when didn't she? She was dressed very casually and comfortably. Her hair was down, of course, and she wore a short white tank-top, with her stomach exposed. She had on dark blue fuzzy pants, and she was walking barefoot. She looked like such a normal woman, comfortable at home, it was almost easy to forget how massively famous and talented she was. It also normally would have reminded you how she's a person, just like you. However currently, she's gargantuan and has more strength in her pinky finger than you do in your whole body, so she still seems larger than life to you now, pun somewhat intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ariana walked into the room, she set a clear pink cup with a lid on the counter near the kitchen area and walked towards the couch. Towards you. Oh my gosh, this is it! Oh lord, but your muscles, you're not sure if you can hop up and wave your arms right this second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Ariana walks over and sits down on the couch cushion next to you, and turns on the TV. You can probably attempt to approach her this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Ariana walks over and sits down right on the couch cushion you're on. Oh no, can you avoid being sat on?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Ariana walks over and lies down on the couch, her head at the other end...which means her feet are coming right for you!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You started to at least prop yourself up on your elbows to get a better view of the titanic Ariana as she approached, but even that was hard on your arms right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you watched as the giant girl approached and began to sit on the couch. Except she didn't turn to sit like you expected, she was facing your direction as her butt made contact with the couch, causing you to feel the tremors all the way from over here. As she sat, she laid back, resting her head on the other armrest. Oh! She was lying down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her gargantuan form up so close was awe-inspiring. She was huge, a powerful titaness, teeming with strength and power. And yet you knew her frame was supposed to be relatively small. Still, every slight movement of hers you could feel through the couch. The shifting expanse of her legs shook you to your core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you admired the colossal body of your celebrity crush going through simple, routine movements, you were extremely late to notice that her bare feet were sliding towards you. Uh oh. You tried to use your elbows to drag you back but even at full strength you would have been far too slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge, tanned feet towered above you, leaning ever so slightly over you, her toes wiggling up above. Watching her feet absentmindedly shift and move, and her toes scrunch and wiggle told you at her feet was a dangerous place to be. They basically had a mind of their own, and they were much bigger and stronger than you. You'd have much preferred making contact with her hand, if possible, her feet seem scary from here. Not to mention you just had that run-in with her running shoes, so you're not on the best of terms with Ari's feet right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to try to stand up, her right foot shifted, and you had no time to react as it landed right on top of you. Your whole world was thrown into turmoil as you were smashed between the soft blanket and the warm, smooth flesh of Ariana's sole. The tan wall of skin bore down on you, rubbing you up and down into the blanket. Once again, you were surprised and disappointed to learn that Ariana's foot...didn't smell good. You didn't know you expected anything, because you would never dream of doing something as gross as smelling her feet, but you expected them to smell like lotion or something, not...feet. They didn't smell awful or anything, not even as bad as her running shoes, but they definitely didn't smell good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled as the huge tan sole bullied you, harshly rubbing your body, smothering you completely. You couldn't hardly breathe, and when her foot finally lifted slightly and you were able to get a little bit of air, it smelled like feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, her foot shifted further and you scraped along the sole of her foot, to the ball of her foot, and then finally her huge toes were above you. You were a little smaller than her toes, which was incredibly disheartening. Her big toe smashed into you and continued to smother you like her sole had before, but then you slid between her big and second toes, which scrunched together and grabbed your body between them. It was an intense vice grip, squeezing the air out of your lungs, and her foot arched upwards, lifting you away from the blanket and the couch. You struggled in the grip of Ariana's toes, wondering if this meant she discovered you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, her toes let you go and you dropped back to the blanket, with her foot hovering above. It began to gently bob up and down, while you caught your breath and took a moment to recover from the assault. You caught glimpses of Ariana's face from beyond her feet and legs and she...wasn't looking this way at all. She was just watching television. And before you knew it, her left foot slid over and pushed you along with it until it slammed you into the back of the couch. You were sandwiched between her sole and the material of the couch. All this torment and smothering she was putting you through was exactly what you feared, just her feet absentmindedly playing with some object on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled in your confines, and her foot lifted away from the couch and let you fall to the cushion. You need to get out of here, you can't just stay here and let Ariana Grande abuse you with her feet. What do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Run! You run towards her body, going past her feet and legs. You <b>need</b> to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Run! You need to get away as fast as possible. You'll even dive off the side of the couch. After all that effort, being subjugated underneath Ariana's feet is worse than the strain of climbing that blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Think, you can't just be completely reactionary and book it. Ari's feet are dangerous, <i>however</i> they are also probably your best bet of getting her attention. You just have to be careful, and go in with a plan of action. You can do this.</span></div></div>",

The colossal tan sole remained mostly still, however. While you walked towards it cautiously, it shifted ever so slightly. It was a very small movement, but still, with the size of that foot, even \"small\" movements seemed like a bus sliding across the ground, pretty intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you walked right up to it, and tentatively placed your hand on the huge sole. You may have had a terrible experience with them, but you had to admit, Ariana had soft feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou balled your hands into fists and beat them against her sole, repeatedly, hoping this would alert her to your presence.</span></div></div>",

Between her beautiful appearance and lovely singing voice, there was nobody you would rather have won a chance to meet. The first meeting between the two of you was to happen today at noon, in a room of a prestigious hotel downtown. The appearance of the singer was unknown to anyone but you and her team, hence the lack of coverage of it on any television network in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were currently waiting at around Eleven Fifty Five, when the door opened, revealing the wonderful artist in all of her beauty. You could hardly believe it, Katy Perry herself standing no more than ten feet away from you, and walking closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You must be Nick! I'm Katy, but I'm sure you already knew that, hence why you signed up for the competition.\" She laughed, approaching you, before giving you a hug. She smelt great, the perfume engulfing your senses as she wrapped around you. She pulled away, and looked you in your eyes. \"More handsome than I would have thought too.\" She spoke, making you blush as she gave you a little pinch and smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well I thought we could spend some time in Atlas City before we fly out to California. I hear there's a nice...\" She continued on as your head started to grow woozy, before your hearing leaving you completely. It wasn't before long that your sight was next, and soon you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When you awoke, you felt strange. The ground you must have fallen onto was soft, so you raised your head off of it to get a good look. It was tan, and for some reason moving. You turned around onto your back, only to find the shock of seeing a gigantic Katy Perry looking down at you in an expression of shock. You realized that you must have been shrunk, and the ground you had thought was just strange carpet was nothing else but the palm of the superstar, holding your small frame in front of her face so that she could get a good look at the magic that just unfolded in front of her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n She looked at you before saying</span></div></div>",

There was a gap of time where nothing eventful happened, besides her explaining to her agent that you hadn't showed, and the entering of her car. Then, you heard jet engines. This was accompanied by manicured fingers reaching into her cleavage, only to pluck you out by the back of your neck, raising you face to face with Katy Perry, who was sitting by herself in the cabin of a private jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well little guy, wave goodbye to your old life.\" She laughed as she held you in front of the window of the plane, taking off and leaving the city of Atlas behind. \"Well little guy, now that we have some time to ourselves, why don't you </span></div></div>",

You had always found her to be beautiful, and the chance to get with her was one you usually wouldn't turn down, but never in your wildest imagination would it take place like it was about to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The manicured claw of her hand scooped you once again, and before you knew it you were being lowered to the waistband of her pants that she was prying back with her free hand.

You nearly came at just the sight of such a large vagina, clean shaven without the hint of hairs even growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The fingers let go of you as you fell into the fabric of her underwear, and started to slide forward, until eventually you were pushed against the pussy itself. The finger still loomed in the panties above, as you soon found out, it pushing against your back in an attempt to get you inside of her private parts. There was no fighting it, and boy did you try as the force was unrelenting. What must have been a gentle nudge to Katy was nothing short of powerlifting to you. She easily pressed you hard enough, until you penetrated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were soon thrust inside of her, helpless to escape as she laughed, just a faint sound you could make out from the cavern you were currently entrapped in. The slimy walls welcomed you as she grew more and more wet. It wasn't before long that you were soaked in the juices of the pop sensation, and still being toyed with. You bounced from wall to wall as your mistress pleased, having no option but to swallow her cum as it filled your mouth.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>Important Note:</b> <i>This city is a custom, original setting. It is not a reference to any book/movie/TV show. It's simply meant to be a sandbox setting for any number of stories.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Nick Lewis. You are 17 years old, you attend Hyperion High School, and you are a pretty normal guy. You have a decent amount of friends, you're kinda popular, but not too much, you're actually pretty smart with decent grades, but you're not the best of the best or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story will include a variety of venues in Atlas City, including your home, your high school, the park, and the beach, just to name a few. The goal is to provide a set character and other important cast, to cut down on choice chapters, but still allow a lot of settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Try your best with your writing. If your chapter is unsalvageable I may have to delete it. If you are unsure about your writing and would like some help or if you notice you've made any errors that you'd like to fix after the fact, feel free to message me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Try to stick to second person perspective for all of Nick's chapters (\"You ran into your hiding space.\"). You are allowed to do perspective shifts, but if you do, preferably stick to third person for those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Please no chapters that only have one choice, unless of course it's the end of a storyline. I don't want to see any chapters where the only choice is \"Continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Nick Lewis is pretty vanilla and isn't harboring secret fetishes. He is not a closet macrophile or foot fetishist or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Feel free to be kind of vague about Nick's size. It's okay if it doesn't always match up. Down the line, size changing can be allowed if you introduce it into the story organically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. You may also feel free to be just as vague about his durability. <br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent: There is an 18+ tag. I'm fine with most things. Preferably no scat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's about all I've got. If I update this page, I will make edit notes at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy reading the story, and a special thank you to anyone brave enough to add to it. We all appreciate our writers that keep these interactives interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><br>\r\nEdits:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2/12/18</b><br>\r\n-Strawpoll<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>10/24/18</b><br>\r\n-Lengthy thanks to contributors<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3/20/19</b><br>\r\n-Removal of previous edits, light trimming on intro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>6/17/20</b><br>\r\n-Lots of edits to intro and rules.<br>\r\n</span></td>",
