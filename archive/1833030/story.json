As the guests arrived Eggman monitored them through a camera system that could pick things up throughout the park and was surprised by how many victims the rabbits brought with them and smirked at the chance of taking down heavy players like Tails, Amy, Silver and Blaze.

In the lower wards, near the ground level, was a robot production facility that was already producing hundreds of robots for Eggman's theme park back home. Below the tower, hidden underground, were the arrangements for Eggman's slaves. They had their own recreation center, laboratory, and living quarters. There was also a slave processing facility. A conveyer belt took any prisoner and subjected them to hours of hypnotic therapy which gradually subjected them to Eggman's will. Eggman had plans to modify on the process in due time but for now his concerns lied elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman was considering his next move. He sat in his chamber with Blaze, Marine, and Silver standing beside him. He was speaking to the submissive feline of the group regarding the topic of locating the seven Sol Emeralds. \"Now, Princess, given your connection to the Sol Emeralds and their energies I trust you should be able to find them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it's not that easy, master.\" Blaze replied. A hint of regret could be heard in voice. Eggman's temper shot up as he demanded to know the issue with his orders. Blaze explained. \"I can sense their energies but it will take time for me to appear. I can only sense them at random intervals. Apologies, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman groaned in frustration. He had hoped their wouldn't be any complications for his plans and until now it seemed like a certain success for him. Taking a moment to gather his thoughts he accepted the terms Blaze had provided him and wait for the emeralds to appear. In the meantime he could work on productivity with his subjects. He pulled up designs specs of Silver for a uniform he designed and considered his next move. Either he could turn his subjects into females or dress them in uniforms based off his own. If he was going to wait he might as well do something to entertain himself.</span></div></div>",

Silver decided he would make this the base of operations until he returned to Eggman as there was little chance anyone would stumble upon it, with the Chao being only eggs he figured it would be easier for Eggman to use them as grown Chao could put up a fight. <br>\r\nNow he had to decide for himself whether to leave the garden to search Station Square for the emeralds and recruits or to take the motor boat he was told would lead him to the Egg Carrier crash site where he could scavenge around for supplies that may help in the mission.</span></div></div>",

And it wasn't affecting her for the most part- She had lost herself looking in clothes. If this was what Amy got into when she was going shopping for outfits, she wouldn't mind coming along just to get a set of clothes given just how nice it felt! ...

For now, he kept rolling, hoping that he would be able to disguise himself in some way. Doors would make it obvious where he was thanks to how obviously they slid open with a distinctive noise- This meant that it would be easy to tell when someone went inside, but thanks to the predominantly blue interior, he stood out. It would be far too difficult to hide- What would he do? After all, with what was going on, trying to trick the armadillo was definitely going to be a bad idea- He was probably going to get knocked into oblivion. So what would he do?

But what could it be? And more importantly, could he manipulate it to his advantage? After all, if it was an opponent of some sort, he could hang back, saying something to cover his non-combat. After all, he could make up something like the idea that it had been a long time since he had fought, so he had to stay back and make something. As he approached, he sighed- There was obviously some sort of mess going on, even if he had no idea of what was happening regarding the threat that caused Rotor to call so suddenly.

The first being him getting payback for all the times Sonic humiliated him, the second being an excellent way to advertise his theme park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's anything I've been told it's that sex appeal sells.\" He finished. \"So throw the switch and let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbit and Cubot shrugged before proceeding to activate the machine as Eggman continued to grin with anticipation. Inside the machine Sonic's mind was being warped to suite what the doctor had dictated she'd become while her own original memories were being removed and archived by Eggman. The machine also forced her to believe her name was Sapphire. After a few hours, during which Eggman acquired and devoured a number of custom-made sandwiches, the machine was done and the door opened. A figure emerged, the same now-female blue spiked Saphhire, but her personality was different than when she had entered the machine. That being she wasn't a monotone zombie slave. She now Klee herself in an enticing pose, showing off her impressive chest and hips, while keeping an index finger closer to her puckered lips as she gave off a sultry stare aimed in no particular direction. Saphhire then noticed Eggman and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master! I'm ready to serve and uh... Obey!\" She said though having trouble with the last word with her now reduced intelligence. Eggman was already enjoying the results of his machine's work and began laughing aloud. Sapphire, clueless as to what her master was so happy about joined in before Eggman cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do the evil laugh, that's my bit.\" He said. \"Besides, you need to start work after you get dressed in your uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okey-dokie, Master.\" Sapphire smiled. \"I'm ready for work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman proceeded to have Orbot escort his new bimbo slave to the nearest changing room where she was given her new attire. It took design from Eggman's natural attire but had a number of differences. The jacket was let open besides the top button leaving Sapphire's chest exposed were it not for a pair of white straps with gold buttons covering the center of her breasts. Her leggings had a hole in between each leg where a pair of matching black underwear covered her privates yet it was clear her panties were on display. Complete with a matching pair of gloves and high-heel boots Sapphire was ready to work as Eggman's theme park poster girl.</span></div></div>",

During rehearsal she had to change outfits to avoid suspicion and was now dressed in magician's tux, the chest region unbuttoned to show off a fraction of her cleavage, with a thong and pair of stockings. Eggman had to cover his eyes as Sapphire showed no shame in undressing before him before putting on her new outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her shrunken intelligence Sapphire found herself unable to pronounce her master's full title to the theme park and Eggman decided he'd assist her by taking direct control of her during the advertisement.

He made her stretch and bend in countless provocative ways that would make any male come running for a piece of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the commercial was finished Eggman ordered Orbot and Cubot to find a way to broadcast the video while he congratulated Sapphire, who of which had no idea what had occurred a few moments ago. \"Wha?

A small white alien followed close behind the fox making a series of noises in an effort to communicate with Tails. Every now and again both would stop so Tails could try and work on his Miles Electric in hopes he'd be able to translate the alien's language, however the inclusion of searching for Sonic made things difficult. Eventually Tails decided to take a break from both tasks so he could gather his thoughts and decided exploring Tropical Resort was the best way to do this. As he journeyed throughout the area he noticed a series of monitors showcasing a blue hedgehog advertising Eggman's theme park. She was dressed in a way to show off every curve of her body with seductive movements to match. The sight of the spokeswoman made Tails sigh in sorrow before the alien approached him in a comforting motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing.\" Tails responded. \"It's just that I'm started to worry about Sonic. It's typical for him to wander off on his own but he's never been gone this long. Maybe I'm just getting paranoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien consolidated Tails and despite the language barrier between them the fox felt better knowing there was someone looking out for him besides Sonic. With his spirits ignited once more Tails resumed his search, stopping only to attempt modifying his machine once more, yet unaware that his movements were being monitored. Orbot and Cubot, who had been watching the monitors, informed their creator of Tails' location and the doctor set out once again to acquire a new brainwashed slave, laughing with enthusiasm the entire time as he left his lair. The two robots looked to each other and shrugged before returning their attention to the monitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman, flying above Tropical Resort in his Egg-o-Matic, tracked down on Tails' coordinates with his hypnotic ray gun at the ready. He located the fox wandering about near an information kiosk and thought of a plan to make his attempt at capturing Tails easier. Pressing one of the many buttons on his hovercraft' control panel he activated an Egg-Pawn stationed at the kiosk which caught Tails' attention. With the twin-tailed fox now distracted Eggman aimed his hypnosis device at Tails and fired.</span></div></div>",

I bet the cute guys would like me even more if I had some other hot gals to take pics with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They just happen to be some of my enemies, too, so we can kill two birds with one stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you wanna kill birds?\" Sapphire snapped out of her excitement, pouting. \"Birds are cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an expression, Sapphire.\" He groaned, removing his glasses and pinching the bridge of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okie-dokie, Master!\"</span></div></div>",

A gift? For her? Like a young child she started jumped with joy whilst hugging her master, pressing her breasts against his head making him feel uncomfortable, as she asked what it was. Eggman's response, once he pried the bouncy hedgehog from his form, was for her to follow him before ordering her to get dressed first. Sapphire saluted her master and quickly gathered her uniform before putting it on. With his servant fully dressed Eggman led Sapphire out of her room - ordering a robot to clean her room as he left - and escorted her to where he had left Tails. Upon arriving in his lab Sapphire noticed the twin-tailed fox sitting in a funny looking chair with a helmet on and asked who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" Her master addressed. \"Is your new partner. She used to be a nuisance to me but after some adjustments she'll be your assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire drew a large grin across her face as she began imagining what she would do with her assistant once they were together. Whatever was creeping through her mind made her blush while Eggman became disturbed and wanted to refrain from trying to imagine what the bimbo was thinking of. He continued expositing his plans for the fox and followed up with a plan for the women that Sapphire was going to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once Tails here is fully educated on her new lifestyle I will send you two down to the planet so you can deal with those rude girls personally.\" He began. \"Now since you're wearing my outfit they will recognize that you're both working for me which is something we want to avoid. So you'll need a new outfit for yourself and Tails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you want them to know I work for you?\" Sapphire asked, finally escaping her fantasies. Eggman explained that he wanted to give her and Tails the element of surprise when they faced the girls. Sapphire partially understood but nodded her head anyways. Her master went on about the plan when she noticed a creature floating in a nearby container. She approached the creature which caught Eggman's  attention as he yelled at Sapphire to stay away from the alien. Sapphire apologized and backed away from the container before asking what was so important about the creature inside. Her master began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That creature is called a wisp and it can give one incredible powers. This one in particular was found snooping around my base and I had it captured.\" He glared at the captive wisp making it shutter in fear. \"Normally I would send the thing to be turned into energy for causing such trouble but I thought of a better use for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Sapphire asked with intrigued curiosity. Eggman looked at his servant then the wisp before answering with devious sneer. \"Why don't we try out now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(*NOTE: Wisp's can be absorbed like normal but exit the host's body after use.)</span></div></div>",

Both tried to get a reaction out of the wisp but nothing seemed to work. Eggman suggested for the hedgehog to try commanding the wisp and when Sapphire did the alien did as she ordered. While Sapphire bounced with joy, thinking she did a good job, Eggman was pondering the results of the wisp being absorbed by the hedgehog. He asked Sapphire further questions about the wisp and if the fusion had any side effects. Sapphire could only confirm that her breasts felt heavier than before. Did her reprogramming work on the alien's mind? Did they have a mental link? Would absorbing more wisps have similar effects? Eggman decided further study would be necessary to confirm his theories. If the fusion really did turn the wisp obedient then he would have an easier time capturing any stray wisps before converting them into energy. The mere idea made Eggman begin to burst into laughter. Sapphire was about to follow suite but a quick glare from her master stopped her from going any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his moment of laughter Eggman put the obedient wisp back in the container and told Sapphire he would need to study it further to see the effects she had in absorbing it. Sapphire, only understanding half of what her master said, nodded and allowed the alien to be placed in a protected canister before being locked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter locking up the wisp Eggman spoke to Sapphire. \"Now that we have that out of the way, let's check up on your partner.\" </span></div></div>",

He left the room, making sure to turn off the security camera for good reason, and left the two alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire kept her lips glues to the unresponsive fox and began fondling Tails' breasts. She loved how soft and squishy they felt, reminding the hedgehog much of her own tits, and continued to play with them. The hedgehog giggled as she made them jiggle. \"Squishy, squishy.\" She laughed. After a time spent playing with Tails' cleavage Sapphire decided to undress herself , since Tails wasn't wearing anything, and proceeded to remove all articles of clothing she had. Her bouncy breasts wiggled as they found themselves free once more. Sapphire then strutted back to her captive partner and sat in Tails' lap before resuming her kiss from earlier while her hands explored more of the fox's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the hedgehog her efforts in molesting Tails were producing results as the fox's IQ was being drained faster than before.

Soon she would be just another bimbo like the girl sitting in her lap.</span></div></div>",

Sapphire realized this but didn't think to break the kiss. She wanted to enjoy herself and it seems Tails did as well. Now with the fox awake Sapphire could go all out. While one of her hands continued to grope and massage Tails' breasts another descended to the fox's swollen snatch and began rubbing against the lips. Tails released an audio moan of approval which gave Sapphire more incentive to go further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her lips from the fox Sapphire lowered her head to one of Tails breasts, the one she had been fondling the whole time, and wrapped her mouth around the areole. She began to suckle on the breast making Tails scream with joy. While she may not know who this hedgehog was for now it wasn't a concern to her. All that mattered now  to Tails was getting off and this hedgehog was doing a fine job. The fun continued as Tails felt the hedgehog slide her fingers into her pussy, slowly filling the interior of her uterus with her digits. Tails could only beg for more from Sapphire and the hedgehog obliged her, glad to see the fox was invested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sped up the thrust of her fingers inside Tails' snatch and swirled her tongue around the breast she had been sucking from. Now her goal was to get the fox to cum and Sapphire as not one for patience. Sliding her fingers in and out faster with each thrust the hedgehog could feel the fox getting ready for a climatic end. Knowing this would be accompanied by a scream of erotic joy Sapphire replanted her lips back on Tails own as her fingers worked the fox over. In a matter of seconds Tails released her anticipated scream as she came in her seat, covering Sapphire's fingers as well. Once Tails was done screaming into Sapphire's mouth the two separated their lips once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to gather some air, Sapphire greeted her partner. \"Hey there, sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Hey yourself.\" Tails responded with a smile. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire. Yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most people call me Tails but I, totally, prefer Miley.\" Tails answered. \"I've also been called, like, Tailsko to but I don't get why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire couldn't figure out why either but thought that she would call the fox Miley for now. As for what to do with her the hedgehog had to consider. Either she could let the fox out in order to repay her for the free finger fuck or deliver Tails to her master. Her hormones were saying to make the fox eat her out while her simple but obedient mind told her to see Eggman.</span></div></div>",

These effects were specifically the body modifications which would result in the target acquiring an appearance similar to his current pair of bimbos. If his theory was correct this new weapon would turn whoever was hit by the ray gun into an obedient bimbo servant for his theme park.

The interior had black loved seats and frames with silver trim. There were dim lights which made the interior glow a dark pink. The stereo system was state of the art and was equipped with speakers surrounding the entire cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire and Miley fell silent as they just stared at the hover car. They were speechless as Eggman proceeded to explain about the vehicle. \"I see you like the look of your new ride. You'll be using this to transport yourselves and the girls you collect between the planet and here. I installed a communication device inside so I can contact you and learn of your progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we need to call you, master?\" Miley offered. \"Y'know for, like, important stuff and junk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman answered her question then carried on with his presentation. \"I'm afraid you won't be able to contact me as the communicator works one way. One last feature to note is this vehicle also has autopilot so you don't have to worry about driving or getting lost.\" The real reason for the autopilot was because Eggman didn't have the confidence to believe either of his slaves could drive the vehicle without crashing or getting lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What do you girls think?\" He asked. His answer came in the form of both Sapphire and Miley hugging him, pressing their bodies and chests against his larger form, as they cheered. \"We love it, master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Eggman shook the girls off of him Sapphire and Mikey climbed aboard their new ride and set off back to the planet below to find their targets. The trip would take a few minutes and already Sapphire and Mikey were bored. Their master hadn't given them any music to listen to or other means of entertaining themselves leaving the two girls to stare out of the car's cabin with sullen expressions upon their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after a moment of silence that Sapphire was struck with an idea. She reclined her seat and gained Miley's attention as the hedgehog tugged her shorts down and pulled her tube top. Her rack and snatch were now on full display as Sapphire started to rub her fingers against her pussy while fondling her breasts. This was her means of relieving boredom and Miley just stared while her nipples became erotic and a damp feeling began creeping between her thighs.</span></div></div>",

Instead she slid two finger from one of her hands inside and began thrusting them in and out of her partner's pussy. Miley drove her fingers in until all but the rest of her hand waiting outside Sapphire's folds. While she was busy fingering her hedgehog friend Miley was using her remaining free hand to finger her own dripping cunt. Although the feeling of her own masturbation caused the fox girl to moan with self-approval it did little to settle the internal heat within her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her friend was fingering her pussy Sapphire was going mad feeling the fox's digits thrust in and out of her. The hedgehog kept herself occupied, and built up her own sex drive, by fondling and groping her own breasts. Her peach colored melons jiggled as Sapphire played with them. On occasion she would pause and begin tugging at her perk nipples. The feeling made Sapphire scream with erotic bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Oh god! Yes! More!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley heard her friend's cries and decided to grant Sapphire's wish. The fox moved her head closer to the hedgehog's folds and began licking them once again. Mikey could not enter Sapphire as she was still thrusting her fingers in and out of her friend which left her only able to eat the hedgehog's pussy from the outside. Through this and Sapphire's own efforts to bring the hedgehog closer to her climax it was not long until their efforts were rewarded. Sapphire screamed as she sprayed Miley's muzzle with her juices. Miley herself swallowed as much of her friend's cum as she could but some of it remained out of her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy.\" Miley purred cleaning licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire was left silent with the exception of her heavy breathing. This was her first experience having another person eat out of her and it was intense. More intense than she could ever have suspected yet she wanted more. Once Sapphire had gathered her breath she requested Mikey come closer to her. Miley obliged her friend but was caught off-guard as Sapphire spun her around until the fox's dripping folds were now in her view. Sapphire wasted no time and proceeded to lap her tongue her partner's throbbing pussy, drinking whatever juices were already dripping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley shivered upon feeling Sapphire's tongue brush against her snatch while a stuttering moan escaped her lips. \"Oh yes! God work that magical tongue of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire obeyed and dove her tongue as deep into Miley's cunt as she could. Inside she swirled and wiggled her tongue all around the fox's hole while picking up whatever precum had accumulated inside. It was a sweet flavor which drove Sapphire into wanting more to drink. Miley arched her back as she fell to her hands for support. Sapphire was caught off guard by this shift but noticed continued to eat from the fox's slit all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike herself Sapphire discovered Miley was coming close to her own orgasm and accelerated her efforts to make the fox cum. After a few more licks Miley squealed as she released her juices upon Sapphire's face. Sapphire was able to clean most of her friend's cum but some remained on her face. This did not last as Miley shifted over to meet Sapphire face to face and began cleaning the excess cum off her partner. When both were cleaned the two girls rested beside each other. Both were exhausted from their fun and hadn't put their clothes back on leaving them to rest the remainder of their journey completely naked.</span></div></div>",

Too much information, Nicole.\" Sally interjected not wanting to hear any more. She made a mental note to discuss this issue with Bunnie when next they met but kept her attention on Nicole. \"Alright. So you know how to... Pleasure yourself when needed. So you know about sexual attraction, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded knowing where her friend and crush was going with her theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So since you do that only leaves one question. Who were you thinking about?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole blushed again. Despite her knowledge of where this subject was going it didn't make it any easier. In fact it may have made it harder. She looked down and mumbled a response. \"Oh. No one special. Just an old friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally ordered the lynx to speak up and Nicole complied. After hearing the phrase of \"an old friend\" she began asking who it was. Antione? Rotor? Tails? All were met with a disapproving shake from Nicole. Sally went on to list more names, even girls and robots, and was met with the same response. This was becoming annoying to the chipmunk and eventually Sally snapped. \"Nicole! I demand to know who it is that you are interested in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, seeing no way out of her situation, acted quick and dashed towards Sally. She wrapped her hands around the chipmunk's head and pressed her lips against Sally's. Sally was caught off guard and was feeling a mixture of shock, surprise, and confusion as she Nicole continued to kiss her. She looked into her friend's eyes and saw them as if they were pleaded, begging, to continue.</span></div></div>",

Sapphire and Miley simply watched the display, both wondering what to do now, in the face of the incredibly arousing display they were being shown. They could easily run in and join the two girls, but Bunnie might be a problem there. Perhaps they could bimbofy her while Sally was occupied with her amorous friend's love...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire grinned, and blasted the cyborg rabbit in the back. Her eyes went wide and filled with spirals as she slumped to the ground, her transformation beginning. Leaving Miley to guard their newest captive during her change, she strutted toward the trapped princess, and let out a giggle, just loud enough to get the girls' attention. Immediately, Sally forced her friend away, staring, wide-eyed at the newcomer. Nicole's cheeks turned an even deeper scarlet than before, as the horror caught up with her. She'd been spotted doing that to Sally! Her all-too brief organic life would be over before she even got to live it. She would be banned from ever appearing physically again for this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, meanwhile, was in shock.Not only had she learned that her best friend of well over a decade was in love with her, but the revelation had come in the most forceful way possible. The sheer cauldron of confusion, outrage, shock, and yet, a surprising level of arousal and curiosity had left her in a state, and to make matters worse, she seemed to be confronted by the very same bimbo she'd disparaged online a scant few hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like, who's the slut now?\" She giggled. \"It's you, hot stuff! Sneaking off the hotsprings to,like, make out with your cutie-pie secret girlfriend! That's totally hawt. And, like, letting her rub herself off to your bare body in a public space? That's even hawter! And, like, totally making out with her? That's sooooo sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who are you?\" The princess managed. Her dignity was gone, but she could still stand up for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I', like, Sapphire! Sapphire the Hedgehog! And, like, you said super-meanie things about me when I showed my hot little bod, and, like, you walk around with your titties and pussy out! That's super-not-cool, baby! But don't worry!

Nicole watched on in horror before anger took over and turned to Sapphire who was grinning with a smug attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to her!\" Nicole shrieked making Sapphire only giggle in response. \"Like I just said. I can, like, totally make you and your slutty girlfriend, totally, super happy like me. Just look at her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole returned her attention to Sally and saw her body was changing. The chipmunk's breasts grew from their petite B-cup size to a hefty E-Cup. Her areoles became swollen but her nipples remained erect the entire time. Sally's waistline narrowed while her hips and backside grew. In a matter of moments she had a body that could rival a certain thieving bat making Sapphire and Nicole stare in amazement. Both were becoming aroused by the sight of the new Sally, though Nicole would never admit it, which prompted Sapphire to move to the next step in her plan. She napped her fingers and issued an order to the passive Sally. \"Alright babe. Let's, like, put that sexy bod to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire pulled her top and shorts off before diving into the hot spring. Nicole couldn't help but but stare at the hedgehog's equally curvaceous form and was beginning to feel jealous. This feeling, along with a return of anger, developed when Sapphire forced a sloppy kiss onto Sally's lips. Nicole was about to march at the hedgehog when someone new appeared, an orange fox with two tails and another ray gun like Sapphire's, threatening the lynx not to interfere. \"I, like, sooo totally wouldn't do that if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Nicole demanded. Miley answered her question saying that her slutty princess of a friend said some mean things to Sapphire and she wanted payback. Nicole froze, fear taking over her body, as she switched between looking at Miley and Sapphire. The hedgehog had now begun to grope Sally's enlarged breasts yet the chipmunk herself made no response beyond an occasional moan. The sight was beginning to arouse Miley as one of her hands drifted towards her crotch and she began to rub the folds of her pussy. Sapphire was going to take her time and she was getting horny.</span></div></div>",

The same applied to her rear as it wasn't as large as Sapphire's or Miley's but it could still jiggle if given a hard slap. Miley looked over the lynx and was pleased with the result.

Miley grabbed the back of the lynx's head and closed the gap between them, leaving Nicci's mouth pressed against the fox's cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it, babe.\" Miley ordered.

She groaned while shaking her head trying to get a train of thought started but only managed to remember her name but that's it. Her past was a complete mystery to her. Trying harder to remember finally caused something to jog in her memory. She remembered enjoying the feeling of being exposed to the elements without any clothing to get in the way. There were also images of her frequently masturbating or in the sexual company if another mobian, either make of female. This information made Bunnie conclude that she had a erotic past and she was fine with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked with her memory having returned to her and directed her attention to her body. Her one piece was constricting her body, wrapping tight around her hips and chest, and seemed ready to burst. Bunnie thought \"why wait\" and tore the cloth clean off her body revealing her form to the open. Her breasts were massive, a pair of F-cup sized tits, and the same could be said about her rear. She had more bust than rear but she didn't mind as Bunnie began to fondle her breasts for amusement. The sight of her mounds jiggling as she played with them made her giggle until a nearby sound caught her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie paused before turning around and peaking through the bush to find quite the sight. She saw four girls, all just as built as herself, going at it in a hot spring in pairs. A busty blue hedgehog was fingering a chipmunk babe while a twin-tailed vixen had a lynx eating her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, oh mah stars.\" Bunnie whispered. The sight was breathtaking for her and erotic as she felt her loins become damp with precum as her crotch became hotter while she stared.  Bunnie felt her hand beginning to rub her privates as she watched the group continued. Sapphire now had Sally eating out her pussy while Miley was fingering Nicci while the Lynx was on her arms and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These girls are, like, the perfect sluts.\" Miley commented with glee. \"Hot bods and totally horny as hell. Just the way I like 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally, sister.\" Sapphire agreed. \"I wonder if master will, like, make them our slaves. I bet this babe would totally look super hot in a two-piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie heard the two girls talking and imagined the chipmunk and lynx wearing nothing but skimpy bra and thongs. The imagery made her masturbate faster before driving her to orgasm. Her juices coated her fingers and the ground beneath her before she licked her digits clean. She hummed with approachable as she tasted her cum, sensing a semi-sweet flavor to it. Despite having just climaxed Bunnie was eager for more and thought that these girls were the best for the job. She walked out from behind the bush, not worried that she was completely naked, and approached the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, excuse me?\" She asked, earning Sapphire and Miley's attention. \"Ah couldn't help but notice ya'll are, like, super hot and Ah was wonderin' if I could join ya'll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire and Miley considered their options and smiled between each other before turning their attention back to Bunnie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why sure, Bunbun.\" Sapphire replied. \"We'd, like, love to have you join us. These two girls have been naughty and they need to be punished. Think you could handle them? Or would you us handle you? Either way is, like, good with us.\"</span></div></div>",

While she was eating out of her mentor's folds Bunbun also tightened her grip on Sapphire's ass and slipped a finger inside. This did not go unnoticed by the hedgehog who was occupied screaming with euphoria to comment. If she could Sapphire would have moaned in approval to the rabbit's rear insertion. Bunbun was just glad to hear the hedgehog sounding pleased and continued to eat out of Sapphire's pussy while gently thrusting her finger in and out of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley watched the two and was impressed by Bunbun's skill before turning to Sally and Nicci to see them masturbating to the display before them. It seemed as if their new personalities had become fixed in their minds and had become full-fledged bimbos. Miley smiled with this revelation and allowed the two sluts to continue playing with themselves. Sally fondled one of her breasts whilst her remaining hand used her fingers to thrust in and out her moist cleft. Nicci was facing the ground with her backside in the air and was also fingering herself alongside Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God. Bunbun is, like, so good as eating pussy.\" Sally commented whilst she continued to masturbate. Nicci muttered in agreement. \"Totally. I can't wait for her to eat me out too.

Fuck! Fuck! You're so good! Keep going!\" Bunbun complied with the order and doubled her efforts to satisfy the bimbo above her. Moments later Sapphire was sent screaming as she climaxed, her cum spraying all over Bunbun's face. After her orgasm Sapphire fell backwards as she gasped for air while Miley approached the rabbit responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's my turn to teach you, babe.\" The vixen addressed. Bunbun only smiled and readied herself to satisfy Miley just as Sapphire gave an exhausted thumbs up. \"Go for it, sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no further instruction Miley grabbed the back of the rabbit's head and pulled her in close to her cunt. Bunbun was not expecting the vixen to be so forceful but picked up her efforts and began licking Miley's folds. Much like Sapphire Miley shivered as she felt the hare's tongue brush up against her lower lips while Bunbun massaged her ass. She panted while trying to control herself from cumming too soon. \"Oh god. Oh god. That feels so good!\" Bunbun heard the compliment and continued with her routine. She slipped a single finger into Miley's ass and teased the vixen while diving her tongue deeper into the fox's uterus. Bunbun could feel Miley's walls throbbing which told that she was close to reaching her limit. With a few more laps of her tongue Miley released a spray of cum and coated Bunbun's muzzle. Miley then fell to her knees in exhaustion while Bunbun licked the fox and Sapphire's juices from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire, who had noticed her friend's collapse, spoke to Miley. \"Whaddaya think, sis? Is she, like, a professional slut or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say more than skilled, babe.\" Miley breathed. \"She has, like, born talent or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunbun heard the two talking about her and finished cleaning her face of the girls' cum before speaking to them. \"So... uh, does this, like, mean I passed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With flying colors.\" Sapphire responded. Bunbun squealed with joy and began jumping in place with excitement. While the rabbit was occupied with cheering for her success Sapphire was asking Miley what they should do next. Her sister suggested that they should return to their master since they got the girls they were looking for. Sapphire agreed and stood up, her knees still shaking from her earlier orgasm, before helping Miley up next. Both girls turned to the trio of new bimbos, noticing the remnants of their clothes reduced to ribbons, and addressed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Like, listen up, girls.\" Sapphire began. \"We're, like, gonna go on a super-cool trip back home and want you all to totally come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcement made the trio of bimbos cheer before Miley interjected. \"But there's, like, a problem.

Just a moment ago she was happy to be going back to her master but now she was dreading it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no point in wasting time Sapphire started up the hover car and moments later the group was flying back to Eggman's theme park. The ride was silent at first until Sally perked up with a question. \"Hey, girls. Like, what did you mean by calling that voice \"master\"? Is he like your boss or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Miley replied, her loud voice catching the rear trio by surprise. \"He's our boss and just likes to be called master. But he's super cool because he...\"</span></div></div>",

All that fun we had, like, totally left me tired\u201d Without another world the rabbit went to sleep. Sally and Nicci were next. The two snuggled up against one another before drifting off into a peaceful slumber leaving contented smiles as they dreamt. Miley stretched her arms with an audible yawn as she maneuvered her twin tails to act as pseudo pillows for her head to rest upon. Sapphire remained awake wondering if Eggman would indeed punish her for showing disrespect. This was indefinite as soon she began to succumb to her own fatigue as quickly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dreamt Sapphire found herself suspended in the air by a series of leather straps. Her body was the same as she slept, devoid of any article of clothing, yet this made her nervous. \u201cW-where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilent, slave!\u201d An unknown voice shouted. Sapphire yipped in fear before the voice continued. \u201cYou disobeyed my orders. Disrespected me in front of others. You are more trouble than you\u2019re worth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster?

However I\u2019m certain someone else can find use for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice cackled with laughter, fading into the void of silence, before Sapphire heard the sound of hissing and metal footsteps. They drew closer and soon a pair of red ringed eyes appeared from the darkness. The owner of the sounds and red eyes stepped into the light. Sapphire gasped with equal horror and disbelief as the stranger revealed to be a robot imposter of herself. The robot had the same body design and even possessed large synthetic breasts that rivaled Sapphire\u2019s own pair. The imposter also supported similar hip size thus carried a similar sized ass behind her. There was one glaring difference that caught Sapphire\u2019s attention and made her shiver with fear and slight arousal. Between this metal faker\u2019s legs rested a large metal cock that was already erect and dripping with precum. Going by the expression the robot had the cause of this was none of than Sapphire herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSapphire, meet your replacement and new owner.\u201d The mysterious voice declared. \u201cI call her Metal Sapphire, or MS for short. Enjoy your time together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire whimpered as MS drew closer, one hand stroking the metal cock it possessed, until the nose was pressing up against the hedgehog\u2019s cleft. </span></div></div>",

When at last the faker stopped Sapphire was coated in and leaking its fake spunk with a dumb smile spread across her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could relax Sapphire heard the robot moving again and found it stroking its cock above her face.

Sapphire said she's explain her dream later as they approached their master's theme park. The girls in back stared in awe at the sights while Sapphire and Miley remained unusually quiet. Sapphire worried about her likely punishment and Miley for her sister. For once neither wanted to see their master so soon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they walked, the trio of new arrivals took the time to ask the duo questions about themselves, Eggman, and the theme park. Miley and Sapphire answered them in mostly truths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, you said your master could come and get us.\" Sally began. \"So, like, what does he want with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well master wants more hot girls to showcase his park so we, like, totally thought of you since you're all, like, smoking hot.\" Sapphire replied. Of course omitted the her reason of wanting pay back on Sally but since the chipmunk girl was a bimbo now she let her grudge go. \"You'll love it here. We get sexy uniforms and no once criticizes us for being so hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally smiled, liking the sound of this job, as Nicci spoke her question next. \"So, like, what do these uniforms look like? And why don't we see you wearing them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley decided to answer next, letting Sapphire lead them onwards. \"They look like master's clothes but fit for our size. He lets us keep the top open and we get to wear thongs and leggings. We also get hot tattoos. Wanna see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group obliged the vixen and Miley proceeded to remove her choker as her master's brand appeared across her tits and backside. The girls 'ooh'ed with approval as Mikey addressed the lynx's second question. \"As to why didn't, like, wear them it was because we couldn't draw, like, attention and be really sneaky. For real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunbun was the last one to speak and asked about job and if more girls would be joining them. So far the duo had done a great effort convincing her and the others into wanting a job like theirs. Sapphire replied with a devious smile. \"Oh the job is awesome. We just shake our bodies for the guests and we get paid. It's, like, super easy. And we're looking for more girls to join us too. More hot girls, more fun I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the group agreed to Sapphire's final statement and continued on their way to the brainwasher located in the laboratory. When the found the laboratory they all entered one at a time before Sapphire closed the door behind them. The lab looked the same as Miley and Sapphire left it as the duo escorted the Sally, Nicci, and Bunbun closer to the brainwasher machine. When they were close enough the two turned to the trio and asked who would like to go first.</span></div></div>",

This idea was reconsidered when she thought that this would make things \"unfair\" amongst the girls.

Looking around she noticed a doorway that was designated as storage. With her curiosity peaked Miley peaked was about to peak inside when she heard a knock on the door. Fearing that the knock belonged to her master Miley rushed back to her original spot and waited before a small robot resembling a sphere entered the room holding a stack of clothes followed by another robot resembling a cube carrying an assortment of boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former of the new arrivals was first to speak to the vixen.\"Greeting, Ms. Miley. The doctor has provided your newest additions some uniforms as well as one of your own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley beamed with a overjoyed smile as she grabbed the tiny red robot and pulled him into a tight hug, squeezing him between her massive melons, all while thanking him. \"Oh my gosh!

Indeed.\" Orbot muffled into her chest. \"But if you could please release me as I have other duties to attend to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley complied with his request and released her grip on Orbot. With his freedom restored Orbot proceeded to hover out of the room while dragging a dumbfounded Cubot behind him. Before leaving Orbot offered Miley to inspect her private quarters and wait there until the brainwasher was finished. With his piece declared Orbot left with Cubot in tow leaving the vixen to get dressed. After putting on her new clothes Miley thought about what she should do next. </span></div></div>",

Recognizing only her maid outfit the robot proceeded to restrain her as it spoke. \"Female sanitation unit requested in organic recreation center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room the robot referred to was the base's private lounge. Of course, Miley couldn't know of the room's existence, having been around for only a day, and the robot's description didn't help. While the automaton kept its grip on her Miley remained still as she was transported outside the lounge room's entrance. Upon arrival the robot removed its hold of the twin-tailed vixen and offered a spray bottle and rag for cleaning before departing without another word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley, somehow figuring out what the robot wanted of her, proceeded to enter the doorway to the staff lounge. Inside she was surprised to see how different the room's interior differed from the rest of the base. Instead of stainless steel walls, ceilings, and furniture the room had a sense of style to it. The floor was covered in carpet and the furniture had a sense of style to them. The lighting was dim but there was enough to see the room. There was even a bar and stage on opposite ends of the room. Miley had never seen a room like it before and was amazed beyond compare before remembering the robot ordering her to clean the lounge. She started on the nearest object and started fulfilling her new duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, doll face.\" An electronic voice called. Miley turned to see another unfamiliar robot looking at her, this time located behind the bar. She went to greet the friendly robot and started talking to him, her memory of cleaning completely gone. The two made small talk after introducing themselves. The robot, who Miley kept referring to as \"Barbot\", explained his job as a bartender and repeatedly made flattering remarks to the vixen's body. Miley blushed each time he did this and would do a little teasing in return. Their fun was not to last as one agitated voice called out to Barbot with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, robo-pervert! You better not have stolen my outfit again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley turned to see the owner of \"her\" new maid outfit was...</span></div></div>",

Behind the green deer was her younger sister Cassia who, alongside wearing similar attire to her older sibling, possessed a knowing yet mischievous grin across her face. Clove approached the bar, ignoring Miley's presence, and slammed her hands onto the bar. She looked at Barbot with a gaze filled with anger as she pulled him closer. Barbot quivered while trying to muster a response to the enraged doe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shove it!\" She snapped. \"Tell me where you hid my outfit or I'll reboot your hard drive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Is this yours?\" Miley piped up earning everyone's attention. \"I found it in a closet by the lab. I was actually looking for the girl who owned it. Guess I found her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClove remained silent trying to process what she was looking at. Before her sat a busty fox girl, wearing HER maid outfit, who seemed to have more air in her head than a balloon. Although she was still angered by the perverted bartender for hiding her outfit she took a deep breath and thanked the vixen for \"retrieving\" her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, miss.\" Clove offered. \"You don't know how much it means for me that you found this so quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Miley asked. \"I think it's a cute dress, especially when I wear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClove didn't respond, pondering if the fox just threw a soft insult at her, but her sister Cassia answered instead. \"She failed the boss and has to do maid service as punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassia!\" Clove snapped. Despite the love she had for her sister she did not appreciate Cassia gossiping at her expense. Taking in another breath to calm her nerves she confirmed her sister's remark. \"Yes, it's true. I failed Master Eggman and as punishment he makes me wear this maid outfit and clean the base. If not for the attire I could work with cleaning as a punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you know the boss.\" Cassia interjected. \"It's humiliation he wants to see. You dressed as a sexy maid is exactly what he would do. That or have you dressed as a Mobius Playgirl in his theme park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully he has some mercy towards his followers.\" Clove remarked before turning her attention back to Miley. \"Still, thanks for finding this for me. You've saved me a lot of trouble with the boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure.\" Miley grinned before her tone shifted from pleasant to sinister towards the green doe. \"But if you ask me I think you need an attitude adjustment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could react Miley pulled out her ray gun and fired in Clove's direction.</span></div></div>",

I, like, saw how mad you were about being a maid and I thought I could, Y'know, make you happy and stuff by making you look like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a prolonged silence amongst the group as no one knew what to say. Clove was angered that this new girl would think becoming a bimbo would make her happy, just so she'd enjoy being a maid. At the same time she was hesitant towards berating the vixen given Mikey's spared intelligence and that she was only following orders. Of course she still needed to get her maid outfit back as well so she couldn't risk making the fox girl run off or damaging the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Think I understand.\" Clove spoke, not sure whether or not to accept the fox's apology. \"But Eggman needs his officers as much as he needs you and your fellow... Bimbos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Clove disliked having to utter that last sentence it seemed to do the trick and brighten Miley's mood. She wrapped her arms around Clove's waist, pressed her chest against the deer's, and pulled her into a tight embrace. Clove was silent, unsure of what to think about in her situation, while Cassia was trying to hold in her laughter. Barbot was enjoying the sight and downloaded an image without anyone's notice. Eventually Miley released Clove and the deer gave a steady \"thank you\" which Miley returned in kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we have that settled. Perhaps we could talk about you returning my uniform somewhere else?\" Clove turned to give Barbot a menacing glare while speaking to which Mikey replied with glee. \"Okie-dokie. I'll take us back to the lab. I need to grab my other uniform anyways. If you ever want to switch places though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Clove interrupted. She didn't want to hear the fox's offer any further. \"But I'll have to decline. Perhaps now you could lead us back to where you found my outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley nodded and proceeded to escort the twin does out of the lounge and into corridor leaving Barbot alone with a sense of disappointment. To their luck, or precisely Clove's, they didn't run into the robot that apprehended Miley earlier and they journeyed through the hallways back to the lab. A moment later they arrived at the lab and Miley opened the door to which both deer gasped at what they saw.</span></div></div>",

Five members of the illustrious Freedom Fighters, sworn enemies of the Eggman Empire, had been turned into loyal, and busty, servants for their lord. The information was almost too much to comprehend for either sister yet before they could attempt understanding the situation any further Miley pipped up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're these people, like, a chipmunk princess, a cute Lynx, and a robot rabbit?\" She asked asked. Both siblings nodded their heads and made Miley gasp. \"Like, O-M-G! That's, like, the same people who were making fun of Sapphire! Good thing we caught them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of her blue friend Cassia and Clove turned to look at the now female blue hedgehog then at the three remaining girls who all sat in the brainwasher machine. Cassia asked Miley what she meant when referring to the Freedom Fighters making fun of Sapphire. Miley explained, to the best of her ability, that the chipmunk girl sitting a few inches away was saying rude remarks about Sapphire when she showed her body to some guys online. Eggman said they could make her and some other girls see their side and become \"super happy\" by turning them into bimbos too. They got their ray guns, flew down to the planet, and brought the three girls back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Miley's underwhelming vocabulary both sisters could understand what she was saying and made a reminder never to insult any of the girls for their bodies less they become bimbos too. With the explanation out of the way Clove asked once again for Miley to return her maid uniform and the vixen was happy to comply. She began to strip down, not caring that the deer siblings were standing before her, and offered Clove her uniform earning a nervous thanks in return.</span></div></div>",

Sapphire became and intrigued given her previous encounter with a wisp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second hologram showed Sapphire's outline again but joined by one of Miley.

Bunbun looked intrigued by this since she was already half robot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third hologram displayed a building on Mobius. Eggman described a former ally he had named Breezie who turned traitor and made an commercial empire for herself. He wanted the rebellious billionaire eliminated and devised a plan involving the girls disguised as strippers. This caught the girls attention as they began dreaming of them running the city, a city filled with more sex-driven bimbos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir delusions were cut short when Eggman shouted, demanding an answer on who would take on their next target.

Amy resided inside an apartment, a rather expensive looking one, while Rouge owned a nightclub. Amy was hazardous with her hammer and could pummel an army of badniks before tiring. Rouge was a greater threat given her government training as a spy. Her training in stealth and explosives could hinder Eggman's operations should she attempt getting into the park. Both could be valuable to the doctor as spokesgirls for the young and old bringing in unsuspecting guests into Eggman's trap. The very idea made the doctor laugh aloud with glee. The other girls joined, not know why, until Eggman ordered them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProperly turning his attention to the twin bimbos Eggman gave his instructions. \"You know the drill by now. Search for your target while in disguise and bring them back here. Pick your target and head out.\"</span></div></div>",

She got picked up by a robot and taken to the lounge where she met the deer. Miley tried to zap her, upon which Sapphire was annoyed hearing that her sister missed, but they made up afterwards so long as she never tried again. Despite being told against the act Sapphire began thinking about turning some of her master's girls into bimbos. The idea made her wet with arousal but she resisted urge to play with herself. She had an assignment and didn't want any distractions, at least for now.</span></div></div>",

Both were tempted to flash her for kicks but knew they must not scare Amy aware as that would make their mission harder. Instead Sapphire just poked fun at her as she winked at the nervous girl. \"Like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. No, no, no, no.\" Amy pleaded. \"It's just distracting is all. I'd never be so open about my body in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire wasn't sure but she thought to have sensed a feeling of deceit in the Amy's retort. She ignored it for now and continued talk to the hedgehog, this time without the teasing. She asked Amy aout her life in Empire City and the pink hedgehog went on to explain. She arrived in need of a break from the Freedom Fighters and settled down in one of the finest inns, the <i>Red Ring Hotel</i>. She was lucky enough to get a cozy suite with plenty of living space and a balcony with a great view of the city yet Amy pointed out that is was not cheap. When asked how she could afford such a place the live in Amy only answered that it was private. Sapphire and Miley agreed not to touch the subject any further but couldn't help but think about Amy's suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then went on to ask about one Rouge the Bat and a night club she owned. Amy frowned, not at all interested in talking about the bat's place of business. She did share what information she had. Loud music, drinking guests, and loose girls dancing on various items - sometimes even the guests - which made Amy uncomfortabe to talk about. Again, Sapphire felt a tinge of untruth in her words but pushed her instinct aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope that answered all your questions.\" Amy continued. \"I really need to get changed.

A large center room that with a television, accompanied by a few gaming systems, with a large couch and two chairs. Beyond the room was the kitchen and dining room sitting at opposite ends with the entrance to the hotel balcony between the two areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think?\" Amy asked. She failed to receive an answer as both Sapphire and Miley were still staring in awe of Amy's room. The only thing the two could think of was  wondering how on Mobius their pink friend could afford such a place. Sapphire was keen to find out but before she could ask Amy was stepping into her private room as she called out to her guests. \"Make yourselves comfortable. I'll be out in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the door behind her, a locking click followed shortly after, leaving both girls alone in her home. Sapphire wished she could zap Amy while getting dressed but remembered being sneaky was the best course of action. Otherwise the pink hedgehog would attack her with that hammer she kept. Seeing no other means to succeed in her mission Sapphire plopped herself on the couch, Mikey following her example, and waited for when Amy would next step out. She turned to her foxy friend and snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she steps out we're gonna zap her then raid her closet.\" She grinned. \"If she can offered this place she's bound to have some sweet clothes.\" Miley chuckled at the idea as she agreed to her sister's plan.</span></div></div>",

The water pelted her backside in a relaxing manner before sliding down onto the floor then into the drain. This is what Amy needed after a long day of working on of her two jobs. Since her break from the Freedom Fighters and moving to Empire City Amy worked as a waitress at a local diner which earned her some money but not enough for her suite. It wasn't until she met with Rouge and the two struck a deal that Amy acquired the necessary funding to live in her current lifestyle. Although it granted her many luxuries she felt dirty ever since making the deal with Rouge. She wanted to quit but knew what that would cost her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy continued to wash herself she began to think of Sonic. Although her new \"guests\" encouraged her to remain confident she still missed the blue male hedgehog. Memories began to fill her mind which brightened her mood and brought the hedgehog to smile. Next came the fantasies. Simple things like picnics, dates, and eventually weddings made Amy even happier. Then came the more lewd imagery. Sonic pounding Amy on her bed, plowing her in the shower, fondling in the living room. Amy's imagination made her hand slither down to her privates where she began to rub the folds of her pink cleft. She stifled an audible gasp as her fingers penetrated the entrance to her pussy and began filling it. The feeling was intense but nothing Amy wasn't use to by now. She would masturbate whenever she felt a need for Sonic. It was the best she could do to ease the stress of her longing for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrusting her fingers faster with each passing second Amy could feel herself getting closer to her climax. She started to pant louder as she felt herself building up until releasing a loud scream upon reaching her long desired orgasm. After her moment Amy took a few seconds to ease her nerves and enjoy the remainder of her wash. Once she was done she grabbed a nearby towel to dry and walked into her closet. As expected from her large suite her closet was almost a gallery of clothes. One side housed her normal attire such as her red dress and boots while another side held a different variety of clothes. Short skirts, leggings, high heel shoes, and even tube tops. Amy went to her more risqu\u00e9 selection and picked out her new clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new attire consisted of open toed, high-heeled, platform shoes accompanied by long red stockings. She then picked up a pair of black tight shorts that clung to her hips. Last was a pink tank top that was covered by a black leather jacket. Amy didn't want anyone to stare as she left her residence despite that her lower half was still in plain view. Giving herself one last look in the mirror Amy formed a shy smile, somewhat pleased with herself, before making way back to her bedroom door and exiting to the living room once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm heading out. If anything happens-\" Amy didn't get the chance to finish before a beam of energy hit her body making her body feel a tingling sensation as spirals filled her eye sight. The last thing she remembered was a mischievous expression on Sapphire's face whilst holding a ray gun and Miley laughed behind her friend. Afterwards, Amy's mind went blank as her attackers stood up from her couch and approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy.\" Sapphire remarked with confidence. Miley could not help but agree as she looked at the entranced Amy. \"Yeah. We, like, must be getting good at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their newest victim pacified the two girls were set to start the next phase of their plan. Before they could Sapphire wanted to see Amy's closet and grab a few clothes. It would have been a shame to let such things go to waste.</span></div></div>",

They were almost too tight but they managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire picked out a frilly red skirt that was shortened in length to accommodate her wider hips. One could almost see her privates between her thighs and the new pair of panties she sported. Although the hedgehog preferred going commando given her skirt's size she didn't want to risk getting arrested for indecency. The panties she wore were white and the string that cling around her hips showed just above the top of her skirt. Covering Sapphire's chest was a simple red t-shirt that failed to cover her midriff in order to adjust for her ample chest. There as some writing on the front that read out \"Sweet Treat\". Sapphire looked at herself in a mirror and grinned with approval. The only thing that could make her happier was finding out why such a girl like Amy Rose would have such risqu\u00e9 attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley took a while to find an outfit she liked and soon she found it. First was a pair of jeans that wore tight around her hips. So much she had to slide them down somewhat to expose her newfound panties. They were the same white pair that Sapphire possessed, who she shared the same sentiment in regards to underwear, and were just as tight as her friend's. The leggings on her new jeans felt snug around both her legs but reach only to her ankles. Unlike Sapphire Mikey couldn't find a top that fitted her and settled for a sexy alternative. She removed her regular top, put on a makeshift bra of red fabric, then dawned a small white jacket she kept open. Far more risqu\u00e9 than Sapphire's top which was what Miley preferred. She had to hand it to Amy. When it came to sexy attire she really knew her stuff, even if what she had was a bit tight for both her and Sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their new clothes acquired and with more prepared for their return Sapphire and Miley stepped outside to see Amy's transformation was complete. Her hips were of the same width as theirs and her breasts had expanded into a D-cup. Her waistline was slimmed down completing her new hourglass figure. Alongside her physical transformation Amy's mind had been successfully reprogrammed. When she saw the two girls she could not help but gasp. \"Like, oh my gosh! You two look so hawt in those clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Amy.\" Miley replied. \"The same goes for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushed at the vixen's compliment. Despite her new appearance the pink hedgehog's attire remained on her person albeit feeling tighter than usual. It was Sapphire's turn to speak next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two. Now that we're all dressed for a night on the town we need to make our way to Club Rouge. Once we get there we'll find the owner and turn her into a bimbo like Amy here. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Miley nor Amy raised any concerns which prompted Sapphire to lead them out of the pink hedgehog's suite. Whilst they journeyed through the corridor Sapphire at last inquired to Amy why she had such skimpy clothes alongside her normal ones. Amy beamed with air-headed bliss as she answered. \"Oh that's easy. It's because I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Stripper selection grants employee back room access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Prosititute selection grants front door club access.</span></div></div>",

Amy confirmed that working at the club was her second job and what allowed her to own such a fancy hotel suite. The tips were good and the patrons were always happy to see her dance on stage. Whenever she wasn't dancing she would be serving drinks but earning just as much attention and tips as if she were on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, like, I was super shy back then.\" Amy continued. \"But now I'm looking forward to heading back and shaking my money maker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small feeling of pride when both Sapphire and Miley heard this. Where as Sally, Nicci, and Bunbun just adapted to being bimbos Amy seemed genuinely happier because of it. Now there were willing to accept the pink hedgehog as a member of their personal group. As the trio departed the hotel, earning many stares along the way, they started making their way to the club. Their walk took them through a shady part of town which made the three girls start to shiver in fear. They could see Club Rouge lit up in the distance and in order to escape their current location made a dash for the night club.</span></div></div>",

Two guards were stationed outside with the intent of preventing unwelcome guests from entering. Upon approaching the security pair Amy smiled and showed her employee card. The guards permitted her entry but did not extend that curtesy to Sapphire and Miley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alight, boys. They're with me.\" Amy spoke up. The guards were not swayed as one responded. \"Madam Rouge made explicit orders for no one but staff to enter through this door. These two are not employees and therefor must go through the front entrance like the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire grabbed hold on her bimbo ray gun and was ready to pull it out then zap the twin guards but Amy spoke up again. \"Actually they are employees. Madam Rouge set up an appointment with them and wants to give them a test as performers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked to each other then to Sapphire and Miley. Seeing their seductive yet innocent faces was good enough to be convinced to let them through. Amy thanked the two guards, giving them both a playful wink and kiss, before leading the her friends inside. The guards were stunned at the pink hedgehog's expressing of thanks but were quick to regain heir posture. They were on duty and could not afford to slip up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the building Amy escorted Sapphire and Miley to the women's changing room and filled them in on the activities of the club staff. Girls would switch between drink serving and pole dancing depending on the staff's schedule. Rouge would normally appear on stage and welcome the guests before the first act then proceed to watch from her private booth. She had a single bodyguard, one Shadow the Hedgehog, who kept a close watch on things and was capable of handling any situation. The sound of all this made Sapphire smirk. After zapping Amy being so simple she could use a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the trio arrived at the girls changing room. Upon first inspection Sapphire and Miley's eyes widened with joy for inside the very room was an assortment of attractive females. The two could hardly control themselves at such at sight.</span></div></div>",

Amy introduced the fox girl as Fiona as the vixen scanned the pair of newcomers. She felt a sense of familiarity with them but could not put her finger on it. There was also a sense of hostility but given that both Sapphire and Miley kept making passing glances at her body Fiona assumed it was body. Though what they were jealous of she couldn't tell. Seeing no danger from the duo she welcomed them before returning for her preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl, a yellow cat with black hair, ran up and began inspecting to duo. She was more curious than suspicious like Fiona. She \"ooh'ed\" and \"ah'ed\" as she looked at Sapphire and Miley. Just as Amy introduced the girl as Honey said feline had already pulled off both girls' tops to reveal their massive mammaries. This left everyone speechless but Honey proceeded to play around with the female duo's newly revealed tits before another girl spoke up in demand to inspect Sapphire and Miley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next dancers to approach were  a pink echidna with purple dreadlocks and a red one dressed in black who was introduced as Julie-Su and Lien-Da. The two girls gave off conflicting auras. Julie-Su was cautious but accepting but Lien-Da was feisty and domineering. Lien Da was the more adventurous and would grope either Sapphire or Miley without notice. She proclaimed it was curiosity, to which both girls believed, but both hedgehog and fox were convinced it was more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl to inspect the two was a lavender hedgehog who bore a resemblance to Sapphire. Amy introduced the girl as Sonia. Unlike everyone else preceding her Sonia was polite and just asked questions about the two girls which they answered in kind. They then asked questions of their own and they learned Sonia was another another princess like Sally but her entitlement to her family's kingdom was given to her brother. Sapphire felt sympathy towards Sonia and made a reminder to get Manic back for taking Sonia's throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith introductions out of the way Amy led the two girls towards the wardrobe to get change. Sapphire considered her options. She could play along and go after Rouge or zap every girl present before going after the bat. </span></div></div>",

I look super hawt!\" Julie-Su beamed as she looked herself over while posing. She noticed her ass cheeks jiggle and found amusement in such movement. Julie began groping and slapping her rear making her moan, giggle, or gasp with each effort. While she was having fun she noticed another person was touching her and turned to see Honey grabbing her ass with a cheeky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite the booty, Julie.\" Honey commented before proceeding to slap said ass. Julie gasped yet begged for more which her friend was willing to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Julie and Honey were having their fun Lien-Da and Sonia were engaged with each other as well. The red echidna had found a riding crop, to which no one knew where she acquired it, and proceeded to smack Sonia's rear cheeks before moving her muzzle closer to the hedgehog's snatch. Lien-Da proceeded to eat from Sonia's cleft earning the hedgehog's aroused moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire watched the girls with glee. As she watched them her hands drifted to her breasts and pussy before she began to play with them. Sapphire fondled and groped her breast as she fingered the insides of her cleft making her fall to her needs. Her fingers were fast and filling as she continued to thrust them in and out. She could barely contain her grunting from her sexual exercise, not that anyone noticed. Sapphire continued to masturbate whilst playing with her cunt and massaging her breasts. Before she knew it she was cumming onto the dressing room floor and moaning as she did so. Sapphire fell backwards from exhaustion and began to take deep breaths of air. While she rested she noticed Honey crawling towards her with a cheshire grin. Sapphire could see the yellow cat eying her drenched and exhausted cleft and proceeded to put a hand on the feline's head before she could try anything. \"No pussy licking now, Honey. You got a job to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney frowned as Sapphire rose to her feet and addressed the girls, earning their attention. \"Listen up, girls. Now that you all look super sexy and stuff I need your help. I want to turn your boss into a hot bimbo too and need you girls to do your part.\" She then instructed each of the girls to go on stage and give their best performance which made them grin with excitement. \"While we keep everyone's attention Miley and Amy will take care of Rouge and her bodyguard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'We'?\" Honey asked with expanding hope. \"Do you mean you'll be up on stage with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Sapphire answered which was followed by sounds of approval.

Her orange fox friend thought for a minute before being struck with an idea. She looked to her new friend with a lust-filled stare before pressing her lips against Fiona's. Her friend was caught by surprise but welcomed Miley's affection anyways. The two foxes had their tongues battling for dominance as they swirled around in each other's mouths. They could only moan and pant as a means of communication. Amy, who had been silent the entire time, was beginning to feel aroused by watching the two vixen's and blushed while she began to rub her fingers against her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to make out with her new girlfriend Miley's arm slithered down Fiona's body until she found the red fox's cleft and began to rub her fingers against the folds. Fiona mewled in approval as a response and wanted more. Miley was more than willing to oblige but wanted to hear her friend beg for it. She continued to tease the red fox with great pleasure in watching her squirm. As this happened Amy had fallen to the ground with her back resting against a nearby wall. The hedgehog had shedder her top and had her crotch exposed as she was busy thrusting her fingers in and out her own cleft with unreserved vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time of teasing her new girlfriend Miley at last penetrated Fiona's folds with her fingers and began to pump them in and out the crimson vixen. Again Fiona moaned with delight before removing her lips from Miley's in order to breath. Her knees began to falter as she slowly fell to the floor with Miley doing the same whilst still fingering Fiona's cunt. The orange fox smirked at her friend's expression. \"I bet that feels good, huh Fifi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifi moaned aloud in response. \"Yes! Oh god, yes! Keep going! Don't stop!\" This made Miley giggle. \"I have no plans to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill watching her foxy friends Amy was still masturbating. Her fingers were sliding in and out of her folds faster than ever making her scream as she was coming close to he end her limit. Amy huffed with arousal as she mentally screamed at herself to climax already. When she saw Miley do something expected it was then that she reached her anticipated orgasm. She watched as the orange vixen latch her mouth into Fifi's ample breasts and begin to suckle them like a thirty newborn. The sight alone was enough to drive Amy wild as she scream with euphoric pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona was screaming as well as Miley continued to toy with her body. The feeling of her fellow vixen stimulating her nipples with her wet tongue whilst thrusting her fingers inside her folds was overwhelming. Miley's tongue swirled around her perked nipples while digging into the rest of her tits. When she was done with the first breast she moved on to the next and repeated the cycle. This was becoming too much for Fiona as she felt her body preparing to release an inevitable climax but failed to warn Miley in time. With a loud scream she ejaculated herself onto Miley's hand which below. The owner of her now cum soaked hand removed herself from Fiona and examined her own hand. A moment later and Miley began cleaning her fingers by inserting them into her mouth. Once she was done she looked at an exhausted Fiona with an seductive grin. \"Well that was fun. Though you could've lasted much longer than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona tried to mumble an apology but all she managed to sound was a tired groan. Miley could not hold back a series of giggles as she watched the red fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Fifi, you wanna be girlfriends?\" Miley asked. Fifi gasped. Despite her exhaustion she formed a massive smile across her muzzle and accepted her now girlfriend's request. She hugged her orange girlfriend with overwhelming joy. \"Yes! Yes! Yes! I so wanna be your girl, Miley! Nothing would, like, make me happier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We'll celebrate after we turn your boss into another bimbo.\" Miley finished while she readied her ray gun. She proceeded to stand up and continue down the club's corridor. Fiona followed behind her girlfriend with a joyous skip in her step, eager to catch Rouge and make out with Miley afterwards. They left Amy on the floor letting the link hedgehog rest in a puddle of her own juices. Amy herself rested against the wall as her thoughts drifted from one fantasy to the next. She thought of Sapphire and suddenly remembered her task of following Miley to Rouge. She stood up, not caring her clothes were still scattered along the ground, and began racing down the hallway - in the completely wrong direction.</span></div></div>",

Scourge had abandoned her for another girl who had lower standards, and, with no home, no friends, and no support, all things he had taken from her to force her to tether herself to him, she had been lost. In desperation, she had allowed herself to be taken in by the bat, knowing that humiliation awaited her, but she never quite expected the form it took. She'd expected to be stuck as a maid, or a servant,but instead, she was a stripper, thrust in in front of the public to expose herself and dance for their voyeuristic pleasures, and she'd made no secret of her displeasure, especially when the bat added \"Handjobs and lapdances\" to her list of duties. Eventually, she had begun to enjoy the attention, being adored by a crowd, hungry for any small gratification, and had only complained a little when told that her services would now include blowjobs and titfucks. She always scowled around Rouge, and the bat new this, but she also knew that, privately, she enjoyed herself.

There was one last picture on the back wall which had Rouge completely naked and giving an inviting stare to he viewer. Looking at this image made Miley remember how Rouge said all those nasty things to her sister Sapphire about her body. It made her frown as she concluded the bat was a complete hypocrite like Sally only worse. Miley reconsidered her plan with Rouge. She wasn't just going to turn the bat into another bimbo. She was going to turn the bat into a complete slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sit, Miss Miley.\" The bat insisted. Miley, snapping out of her angered train of thought, shook her head and complied with Rouge's request. She sat herself down in the nearest chair. Rouge followed suite in another chair behind a desk, conveniently covering part of her naked picture, and began interviewing Miley. \"So Miley, why do you wish to work at my club? And how did you meet Fiona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley cleared her throat as she began crafting her faux story. \"Well, Miss Rouge, I've known Fiona for a long time. We were, like, the best of friends until one day she vanished. I don't know what happened to her but I heard she fell in with some bad people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very bad people, indeed.\" Rouge interrupted. \"Thugs who are no longer around anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Miley agreed before continuing. \"Well a year or two ago I found Fiona again and we decided to catch up. She told me you hired her as a dancer and remembered how we used to strip naked and run around as kids. Nowadays I prefer wearing tight clothes but I wouldn't complain if I could strut around in my birthday suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Rouge very intrigued as a confident smirk grew on her muzzle. Miley seemed like the perfect girl to take advantage of in her club. Rouge began thinking of shows with Miley and Fiona on stage dancing, kissing, and groping with each other. The crowds would go wild. The next thing that came to her mind were private showings she hosted which customers could fuck her girls in private. Miley, alongside the reinvigorated Fiona, seemed like the best kind of girls for the job. Rouge thought of these ideas with a emerging sense of arousal before she returned her attention back to Miley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have no aversion to nudity, Miley?\" Rouge asked. \"Would you care to prove that to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you join me.\" Miley beamed. Rouge, seeing no harm from the idea, obliged the fox girl. She stripped herself of her bodysuit until her body was completely nude. At first glance Rouge's breasts appeared to be just as big as Miley's. Her hips looked smaller than the fox but Mikey only had a short time to look before Rouge sat down once again. After Rouge it was Miley's turn to remove her clothes. Upon inspection Rouge was quite impressed with Miley's body growth. An ample chest like her own and big hips. She asked the fox to stand and turn around in order to see her backside. Miley did as she was instructed and allowed the bat to get a good view of her ass. Rouge stared with approval at the vixen's behind as she felt her loins starting to flare with heat. She told Miley to sit back down before standing up herself and approaching the fox from behind her desk, her hips swaying with every step. She stopped only when her face was inches away from Miley's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm ready to hire you, Miley.\" She whispered. \"But before I do would you mind if I performed a private examination on you first? I'm curious to see how much endurance you have.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rouge continued to have her way with Miley, taking the time to test her new employee's mettle, hearing the orange fox moan in response. This was music to her earns as she continued to thrust her fingers in and out Miley's folds. On occasion Rouge would look to her side and see a look of envy across Fiona's face and smirk. While she was still curious about he red vixen's new appearance and girlfriend, who was busy screaming in sexual euphoria, Rouge decided to focus finger fucking Miley. While she kept twin-tailed vixen was moaning Rouge switched tactics and lowered her head before her mouth was level with one of Miley's erect nipples. Without warning she latched her plump lips onto the fox's tits and began to suckle with vigor. Miley screamed once more begging for Rouge never to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat snickered as she continued to play with the fox's tits. \"My, my. What large breasts you have Miley. So plump and bouncy. I'm almost jealous.\" Miley could only mutter a feeble \"thank you\" in response in between panting breaths. Rouge continued on her suckling of the fox's tit, enjoying the screams of joy the owner produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona, who was still not enthusiastic about seeing her girlfriend being handled by her boss, watched the two with reluctant arousal. She could feel her inner thighs dampen as she monitored the two, biting her lip in an effort to resist the growing temptation to collapse to her knees and masturbate. There was another reason behind her hesitation beyond envy. Before being interviewed by Rouge Miley offered her ray gun to Fiona to prevent the bat from noticing. To her luck Rouge was too preoccupied with Miley to even notice Fiona's poor attempt at hiding the device casually held behind her back. As she continued watching Miley and Rouge grope and fondle each other, her frustration growing ever larger, Fiona considered using the ray gun but immediately reconsidered. She had no expertise and didn't want to risk zapping Miley by mistake. So she continued to watch until Miley gave her instructions to hand over the ray gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enough teasing Rouge decided it was time for Miley to please her. She climbed a top her desk before spreading her legs allowing Miley and Fiona to see her feminine glory hole. As both fox's stared Rouge interrupted their fixation by giving Miley her next order. \"Lick me, fox girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley approached Rouge until her muzzle was an inch away from the bat's cleft. When she was close enough she began to press her lips against the folds of Rouge's pussy. Rouge herself did not scream with the same sexual excitement as Miley had but did release a number of satisfied moans feeling the fox lick her privates. She commended Miley with her talents before encouraging the fox to press on. Miley heeded her boss and slithered her tongue past the entrance to Rouge's vagina. Her tongue wriggled inside tasting the immediate interior of her partner's uterus. She could feel traces of the bat's natural lubricant beginning to appear and knew Rouge was beginning her approach to a climax. Miley accelerated her efforts, shocking Rouge in the process, as she hurried to making the bat orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Slow down. You c-can't rush this.\" Rouge ordered Miley but she did not listen. Rouge began to pant as she tried to hold off her approaching climax. Miley noticed her boss's efforts to delay her cumming and paused before climbing a top of Rouge herself then placed a wet kiss on the bat's lips. Her hand attached to Rouge's breast while the other rubbed her lower lips before thrusting inside. Rouge moaned in response which encouraged Miley further. Her hand groping the bat's tit repeated to fondle, smack, and even pull on her nipple. Her second hand had two fingers rapidly inserting and retreating from Rouge's cleft which became coated in the bat's natural lubricant. Both girls could feel Rouge was being driven closer to her end and as Miley looked at her partner's eyes one last time she decided to put an end to their fun. With a final series of thrusts from her fingers Miley at last made Rouge orgasm. The bat's juices coated her fingers before dripping onto the desk. Their mouths separated allowing them to regain their breath before getting off from Rouge's desk and returning to their regular seating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona was silent with awe. She had been watching the two girls and was envious to a new level. Miley had held back when they were in the hallway and now Fiona could only dream of if her girlfriend had used all her skills. Her imagination once again stoked the fire of her inner sexual desire. Fiona suppressed these thoughts, at least for the moment, as she approached Miley. She ensured that her girlfriend's device remained out of Rouge's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was I, boss?\" Miley inquired, not at all attempted to hide her self confidence. Rouge smirked as she answered the fox's question. \"Now bad, Miley. Although you did rush things I must admit you work wonders with that tongue of yours. I think I'll have you teach all my girls how to fuck like you. Congratulations. You're hired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Miley and Fiona cheered with convincing enthusiasm as Rouge searched for a contract in her desk to give to Miley. The two vixen's had fooled Rouge and were ready to put the bat in her place. Miley took her ray gun from Fiona and was prepared to aim the device at Rouge when both heard a knock on the door. All three girls turned to face the source of the noise as Miley concealed her device from Rouge's sight. Rouge approached the entrance to her office, not concerned that she was still devoid of any clothing, and welcomed the new arrival.</span></div></div>",

We can sit there and zap her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome idea!\" She beamed. Fiona took her hand, and led her dazed partner to the couch, which Rouge was standing a few feet in front of. They flopped down, Miley miming tiredness (Even though she could likely go on like that for hours), and Fiona coddling her. Miley held up the ray, and held it out to Fiona. \"Care to do the honours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona nodded vigourously, and took the gun, aiming it at Rouge.</span></div></div>",

Her legs lost control as Rouge fell to her knees with a horrified expressed plastered across her face. This did not last as her eyelids fell and her mouth hung open indicating she had now entered an entranced state. Fiona and Miley cheered with success before embracing each other. Sapphire, who had watched her friends' sneak attack, was not as happy as the two foxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

She dropped the subject and asked Miley what they should do next. In turn her foxy sister asked about the other girls and Sapphire stated that they were all dressed up for their show before telling of an unexpected addition. When asked who it was Sapphire just called out towards the office door. The door opened to reveal an ebony black hedgehog with red highlights entering the room. Like the rest of their victims the hedgehog possessed an hourglass figure with a heaving chest and ample backside. She was dressed in an erotic police girl uniform complete with handcuffs. Sapphire began with the introductions. \"Miley, I'd like to introduce Shady.

The bat stood up and groaned. Everyone noticed Rouge's physical changes and were silent in awe and envy. Rouge now had a pair of F-cup size breasts similar to Bunbun, larger than any other girl present, and her rear was a similar story. Her waistline had not narrowed but it was somewhat slim before her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, where am I? Why am I naked?\" Rouge asked, her speech reflecting her lowered intellect.

As the group of bimbos watched the display of affection Honey nudged Sapphire and whispered to the hedgehog. \"I think she likes it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miley broke her lips away from Fiona's she finally spoke her opinion on the dress. \"You look so hawt, babe. It will almost, like, be a shame to rip those clothes off you later.\" Fiona blushed before kissing Miley on the cheek as gratitude to her compliment. Miley smiled before turning to look at another maid dress resting nearby. She winked to her girlfriend before grabbing the dress then proceeding into the closet to change. While she would not object to changing in front of the other girls Miley wanted to surprise her Fifi. Once she was done getting dressed she emerged from the closet in a traditional black colored maid outfit. Once again all the girls whistled with approval before Fiona approached Miley and placed her in a warm hug. Their large breasts squeezed against each other but remained confined in their dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone dressed Miley turned to the group and nodded at her sister. Sapphire smirked and began making a short speech to the gathered bimbos. \"Alright girls. It's time to, like, go out and give that crowd the hottest, sexiest show ever. Let's go out and, like, get some!\" The girls cheered, ready to get plowed by the countless men and women in the audience outside. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One by one the girls walked onto the stage after Rouge's announcement. Rouge was one of the first to perform alongside Amy and Honey. Each of them twirled and danced around a metal pole while showing off their irresistible body curves. As their dance continued they started to remove pieces of clothing until they were all naked for their audience to see. The crowds of men and women cheered them as they stripped away their outfits. After a few minutes Rouge offered herself to the crowd and a single man took hold of her arm before tugging her off her stage. Amy and Honey followed suite and vanished in the mob of customers ready to get their hands on them. The other girls followed the same routine as the first group and were soon taken away until Sapphire and Miley were left. Amidst the chaos of the sexual frenzy Sapphire and Miley kept watch on Amy and Rouge when they could. They wanted to see their former enemies act like the bimbos they had now become. What they saw did not disappoint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was in one of the lounge corners sitting in a man's lap. Several other males sat nearby, their eyes glued to her jiggling body. She giggled every time the men talked to her before the one she was placed upon started to get grabby with the hedgehog. He groped both of her massive tits beneath her bra making Amy moan with aroused approval. Moments later the man removed the bra entirely. Next he unzipped his fly before pulling out his growing erection. His dick squeezed tight between Amy's rear cheeks which made the hedgehog blush. The surrounding group of men followed suite and proceeded to unveil their own erect organs making Amy giggle with excitement. \"Oh my. Look at all these big cockies I have to play with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd concealed Amy from view as they began taking full advantage of her willing attitude. As Amy was just starting to let her audience have their way with her Rouge was already ahead of her pink companion. Her body was placed face up on one of the club's tables as a crowd of customers surrounded her. Within seconds Rouge was being conquered by the crowd of men as they filled every one of her holes with their meaty cocks. When those were occupied Rouge held her arms out and started stroking whatever dicks came within her reach. One guy was bold enough to kneel above Rouge and squeeze her breasts around his erection which Rouge could only grunt with approval feeling her tits being fondled. She could only giggle to herself how amazing it felt to be fucked by so many men at once. Without warning she felt the man using her mouth flood her throat with his spunk forcing Rouge to swallow. Her gag reflex allowed her to savor every drop before performing an audible swallow. Once she consumed the semen she giggled and looked on the men in front of her. \"Don't hold back, boys. Fill me up with all you got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men needed no further instruction hearing her words. Those who were already fucking her came inside her before other men took their place. All of them were eager to fuck the owner of Club Rouge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy and Rouge continued to take on men eager to use them as cum buckets each of the men fucking the, donated their seed into whatever whole they were using. Those who were stroked by the their hands or using their tits just ejaculated onto the bodies. Amy and Rouge soon became covered in semen but they didn't complain. They enjoyed it. Having their bodies stretched and filled with cum was a pleasure to them and they never had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire and Miley could hear Amy and Rouge crying out in euphoric pleasure as they continued to satisfy their crowds. The same followed for the rest of the girls which made both the hedgehog and vixen very pleased. After dancing for a few more minutes Sapphire and Miley surrendered themselves to the crowd and joined in the massive orgy that took place.</span></div></div>",

The twin-tailed vixen was sitting on the lap of a man, bouncing up and down on his member, while he jammed her feather duster's rather phallic handle into her pussy, another, this one a bird grabbing handfuls of her breasts and using his wings to suspend himself over her and push his penis into her mouth. Her hands were jerking off two more customers, as her tails ran up and down the lengths of another two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona giggled and skipped over to the site- WHereas Rouge's flirting and interactions with Miley had enraged her, this seemed far more natural to her. Perhaps it was the career hooker mentality taking over now, but she was happy to see her love being so successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun, baby!?\" She called out above the din. Miley glanced at her and winked, just about the only signal she could give without stopping her ministrations. However, Fiona realised that several of the customers waiting their turn with Miley were now staring at her. \"Like, hi there everybody! Miley here is my new GF, and she's totally hawt, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of murmured approval went up from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Now, if any of you are waiting, we'd be happy to service you together!\" She giggled. Immediately, people shifted toward her. \"One condition: The dress has to be intact at the end. You can take it off me, but you can't, like damage it. If you all succeed... I'm half-price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona grinned as she found herself being grabbed, this time by a woman not that much bigger than her. She was forced to her knees in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick.\" The woman presented her bare folds, and Fiona licked her lips before diving in and giving a long, slow slurp across her entrance. Then she felt something hoist her back end up, and slam into her own vagina, pumping their hips against her. At this end, she couldn't tell if the newcomer was rubber or flesh, but she didn't care. She simply let herself go on autopilot and service the happy customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she and Miley had eventually fucked everyone around them, the two of them bowed, before cleaning each other off with their dusters and kissing for the spent crowd's enjoyment. Fiona picked up her still-in-one-piece uniform and donned it, before making sure to note that her customers only had to pay half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, let's go find some more!\" Miley giggled, grabbing Fiona's hand and dragging her away. As they stumbled through the crowd, exchanging stories about their respective encounters, Fiona felt a heavy hand on her shoulder, holding her back. Miley noticed her sudden stop, and backed up to see what the issue was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, remember me?\" A voice called, as the hand turned Fiona to meet a face that her bimbofication had only slightly affected her recollection of. After a few seconds of waiting, Fiona realised that she was face to face with...</span></div></div>",

You can just call me \"Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master...\" The word gave Miley pause for a moment. She was sure she already had one of those. She tried to remember past the euphoric daze of the evening, grasping for any clue as to whom that might be. Rouge owned this place, was it her? No, she took orders from Sapph. Was Sapph the Master then? No, she seemed to have one too. And besides, her Master was totally a boy. She seemed to remember someone large... but beyond that, she had no idea. She shrugged, if she didn't remember, it probably wasn't important anymore, her other Master must've just been another customer who wanted a maid to fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter, Miley?\" The wolf asked. She looked him up and down, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Master!\" She purred, leaning on him. Fiona did the same, and the two of them entered the back room together.</span></div></div>",

He looked her up and down with a mix or sexual hunger and barely-contained rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I'd find you again, babe. Doesn't matter how far you go or who you whore yourself out to, I'll always be there to take you back to where you deserve to be. Under my heel.\" He said, his voice low and menacing. Fiona's ears folded back, as her memory finally clicked into place. SHe knew why she was afraid now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" She shouted. Her yell caught some attention, and suddenly, everyone around them was staring at the brewing altercation, the people behind them stopping too. Eventually, even Shady and Amy, poledancing up on the stage, stopped and stared at her. Sensing that something was wrong, Miley moved closer to the red vixen, eyeing the green hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That the best you can do?\" He asked. \"And besides, I don't have to go anywhere... I'ma paying customer, and I've heard you give out little private sessions. So why don't you and I go into your little private room, and work everything out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I don't need your money, and I'm, like, never letting you touch me again!\" SHe growled. Miley walked up beside her, thankful that, of all the paired costumes Fiona could've picked, she'd grabbed one with pockets. Her fingers closed around the handle of the bimbo beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, babe, it won't hurt that much... I know you like it rough.\" He drawled, stepping closer. His hand gripped her shoulder more tightly, enough to make her wince. \"And let's be frank. You deserve it. Nobody get to ditch me, especially not if they're then gonna go and whore themselves out. You're mine, you little two-faced bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from my Fifi, you ugly, creepy bastard!\" Miley hollered, as she whipped out the bimbo beam. SHe'd already keyed in the settings she wanted, and let loose with the beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Scourge could rant any further, a blast of pink energy filled his vision, and he felt all thoughts leave his mind, along with all of his rage, and everything except lust. He crumpled to the floor, as his body began to rapidly take on a new form, oversized breasts spilling out of his chest, penis wilting away into pussy- not a virginal one like Miley, Sapphire, and Shady had received, but a heavily-used one, hairy and pierced. His lips puffed up, as if they'd had too much collagen, as her backside ballooned outwards. His limbs reshaped as his quills became wild, unkempt hair, and she stared dumbly at the crowd around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need cock!\" She gurgled, in the throaty voice of a chain-smoker. Fiona stared down at her, and her rage finally subsided. She fell back into Miley's arms, tears flowing down her face, holding her lover tightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Miley...\" She whimpered.</span></div></div>",

Soon, his voice came back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miley, what is it?\" He demanded. \"THe cars are already on their way for you and your captives, and Clove, Cassia, Sally, Bunnie, and Nicole are all fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like, I bimbo'd Fifi's ex. But he was yucky and ugly and smelly and he's still all four of those things so I don't wanna bring him.\" She said. Eggman rolled his eyes a little at her failure to count adequately, and pinched the bridge of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you come to capture Scourge the Hedgehog?\" He groaned, exasperatedly. For slaves that he was expecting to just be humiliating fates for his former foes, park mascots, and sex-pets for his real soldiers, the bimbos had somehow managed to accomplish more in a day than his army had in a year. Even he was struggling to keep up with their astounding pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like, he just showed up while we were performing. He grabbed Fifi and said he wanted to hire her, and he was getting really annoyed about her leaving him or something!

No need to cause suspicion, even if it is with a few desperate perverts.\" Eggman sighed. \"Did you bimbofy Scourge on-stage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda. No-one seemed to care. Some of them are fucking her ugly butt now.\" Miley seemed to swell with pride at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, very well. The cars will be there by the time you close.

When he had heard of their success in once again over-achieving in their mission the doctor froze. He had intended to use the two girls as cannon fodder but with only two missions complete they became his most prized asset. Even now Eggman had trouble processing this revelation. \"To think all I would have needed to conquer the world was turn Sonic and his annoying friends into walking sex dolls. Not armies or weapons of destruction but just a couple of girls. It's just crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doctor was working, preparing to construct a new transport for Sapphire's company, he began to hear shouting coming from outside. Moments later the entry to his chamber opened and in marched an angry Clove tugging a whimpering Sally Acorn by the ear. The green pronghorn's eyes narrowed at the bimbo princess as she spoke to her emperor. \"My lord, with respect may I inquire why there is no one to watch over your new staff? I caught this one trying to seduce my sister and it seems she and her friends have been putting ideas in her head that I don't approve of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally pulled herself free of Clove's grip and offered a retort. \"Like, hey! Don't be mad at me and my friends for, like, offering to make your sister look sexy. I mean, like, what's wrong with looking like me or the other girls?\" Clove did not waste a second responding to the simple chipmunk. \"Cassia is my sister and she is too young to be thinking about looking like some cheap whore. I don't want you or your friends hanging around her if you plan to corrupt her into a bimbo like yourselves.\" Sally was becoming more angry at the deer and was about to reply before Eggman spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! Both of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Clove and Sally froze and fell silent upon hearing their master yelling. The doctor arose from his seat and approached the two. A livid frown crossed his face as looked at the two girls with a face of disapproval. \"In case you've forgotten I'm trying to take over the world and I have no time to deal with your petty bickering! Unless either of you wants to be punished I order you both to stop your arguing then kiss and make up. Am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord.\" Replied Clove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master.\" Followed Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls turned to each other and apologized. Clove for calling Sally a cheap whore and Sally for putting ideas in Cassia's head. What happened next was unexpected. Sally proceeded to physically kiss Clove on the lips catching both the deer and Eggman off guard. The kiss lasted only a few seconds but even when Sally pulled herself back Clove's cheeks were still glowing bright red. Eggman, seeing that the two made up, ordered Sally to leave for a moment while she talked to Clove. Sally complied and strutted out of the room leaving the two alone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Sally gone, Clove turned to her emperor and apologized for her behavior. \"I'm sorry, Master. I don't feel comfortable with Sally and her friends alone with Cassia. I don't want them to make her do something she'd regret later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like turning herself into a bimbo?\" Eggman suggested. \"I doubt she'd regret it should that happen, which for your sake you best hope it never does.\" Clove felt cold as she heard her master's threat but remained silent, for Cassia's sake. With her silence Eggman changed the subject. \"On to the subject at hand. I received contact from Sapphire and Miley. They have once again succeed in their mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it this time, my lord?\" Clove inquired. \"The targets were Amy Rose and Rouge.\" Eggman answered. \"However they once again over-achieved in their mission and added Shadow to the collection. This is turning out more wonderful than I could have hoped for!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClove felt her heart stop. While her master chortled in victory she felt the world collapsing around her. Sonic and Tails being brainwashed was bad enough but now Shadow and Rouge as well? It seems fate had turned into Eggman's favor and was growing with each mission he sent the bimbo hedgehog and vixen. It would only be a while before Eggman had achieved his victory. Clove knew she couldn't let that happen yet she could not confront her master. Not yet. She remained silent, hoping something would come to her, as Eggman finished his fit of laughter. Once he was done he dismissed the pronghorn while saying he had to prepare transport for the new additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Clove had an idea and did not hesitate to make her master aware of this. \"Wait! My lord!\" She yelled before lowering her tone. \"May I make a suggestion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you won't shout again.\" Eggman answered. \"Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it not be more efficient to transport the necessary equipment to Sapphire's location? Instead of traveling to your main base and back to the planet we could establish a base where it would be more convenient to travel planet-side. Also we could send you recruits once the conversion is complete. It would be better than making multiple trips to Mobius and back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman considered Clove's proposal. She did have a point about efficiency and travel time. There was also the fact that Sapphire and Miley have already doubled their last success rate and there was no telling if they'd do the same. Indeed it would be better to have a hub of sorts to work from to make the conversion rate accelerate. Plus Eggman could avoid having to witness more of Sapphire's naked exploits. He could live without that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Your idea is sound.\" Eggman declared. \"Wherever Sapphire and her friends are we'll send the equipment and make a base. However, this is your idea so you and your sister are in charge. If this fails I'll know who's to blame.\" Clove gulped but verbally acknowledged her master's statement with respect. \"Good. I'll also send Sally and her friends down as well so they can start their mission too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What mission, my lord?\" Clove asked, unsure if she could stomach any answer. \"Nothing you need to worry about. Go tell your sister, Sally, and her friends to get ready. I'll be deciding who will act as the trio's chaperone.\" Clove saluted Eggman before rushing out the door to find Cassia. Eggman turned to his monitors and sneered as the thought of conquest entered his mind once more. He started to burst into laughter once more as he readied his next plan.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clove rushed back through the base, heading for the bimbos' quarters. She needed to do something to hinder this plan, but it wasn't like she could do anything about it here. SHe'd need to be away from his watchful eye before that could happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea struck her- Eggman had mentioned that he wanted her and Cassia to be the sluts' handlers, and perhaps she could use that to get herself transferred to wherever Sophia had set up shop and work on things from there. At the same time, betraying Eggman at this juncture didn't sound good- She'd be cutting off her only access to Cassia's treatment. SHe knew now that Eggman wasn't actually helping her, just stalling the disease, and a real doctor could probably do a better job... But it wasn't like she was being paid for her services. The soldiers, even the leaders, were paid in lodgings, clothing and food. Clove was just as impoverished now as she was when she made the desperate decision to join Eggman for Cassia's treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan was shoved into the back of her mind when she entered the room to find Sally and Nicci on the waterbed, embracing. Sally had most her hand inside the lynx, who herself was jamming a rather large dildo into her squirrelly partner's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, imagine when we do both of these to Sophia!\" Sally giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be so hawt!\" Nicci beamed, before letting out a loud moan. Clove sighed, and walked over to the couch to find Bunbun lying down, hugging the sleeping form of Cassia. Immediately, a hundred different ideas, each as terrible as the last, began to echo through her head, all following the same train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to her!?\" Clove demanded, glaring at the former cyborg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuthin'! Sally-gal says we'renot allowed to talk about how good bein' a bimbo is, so I just snugged her and she fell asleep. I think it's because my boobies are like pillows!\" She beamed, seemingly unfazed by the angry reaction. \"You wanna snuggle too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, look, I have a task for you three.\" She shook her head, blushing a little. \"Your Master wants to see you three for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, okay.\" Bunbun sighed. She carefully got up, and lifted Cassia into Clove's arms, before turning to her two friends. \"Gals, Master needs us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome disappointed moans and hasty cleaning up later the trio dressed themselves and allowed Clove to lead them back to the doctor.</span></div></div>",

Once they were granted access the group found Eggman standing before them. The girls formed a line and saluted the doctor as Clove announced her bringing of the bimbos to him. \"Here are your subjects, master. As you requested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, Clove. Good to see you still know how to follow orders.\" Clove remained stoic suppressing the brewing anger at her superior's backhanded compliment while Eggman made his statement to the trio of former freedom fighters. \"As you three may know you are here thanks to the efforts of Sophia and Miley. You were shown a new life and gifted with new appearances.\" Sally, Bunbun, and Nicci beamed knowing their master referred to their transformation into obedient bimbos. Eggman continued. \"I have received word that the duo have succeeded yet again and turned more of my enemies into loyal slaves. At Clove's insistence I will be sending you three to the planet to join them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the trio of sluts cheered with excitement, overjoyed to hear they would be joining their friends below. Eggman went on to explain his plan of turning Club Rouge into a forward base for the bimbos to reside and work. This was not heeded by the girls except Clove and her sister. The elder deer sister remained silent while waiting for a chance for a plan. Her chance came sooner than she expected when Eggman announced who would be escorting Sally and company down to Mobius. \"And to make sure you are all doing your duties I will be sending Conquering Storm to monitor your progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! My lord, you can't!\" Clove covered her mouth but it was too late. She had already spoken and everyone was staring at her, especially Eggman. Thinking fast Clove cleared her throat and explained herself. \"I mean, master, is I would like to request myself and Cassia for that position.\" Everyone was taken aback by Clove's request. Sally, Nicole, and Bunnie were surprised, Cassia was shocked, and Eggman was intrigued. The doctor demanded further explanation on the green doe's request. \"I have spent more time in close proximity to the girls and I think they'll benefit from my presence. A morale boost, if you will. Storm, with all due respect, is too strict and will not use Sally and the others to their full potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I agree.\" Sally perked up. \"This Stormy person doesn't sound fun. I want Clovey to lead us.\" Nicci and Bunnie followed in agreement. Eggman thought of the idea and couldn't disagree with Clove's logic. He agreed to let the pronghorn and her sister take charge. Following this were orders to prepare for immediate departure. The girls saluted the doctor before leaving the room to prepare.</span></div></div>",

She'd almost blown it, and her scrabbling to recover her cool might've made the doctor more suspicious if she hadn't received the backing of her three charges. She made a mental note to thank them when they could no longer report her to Eggman. The pieces were beginning to fall into place, but there was still the major concern of Cassia's treatment, and ow she could get that before Eggman decided to cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group arrived at the room, and Clove let them in, stepping in afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, girls-\" She was cut off when all three of the bimbos hugged her, trapping her between their busts. Giggling and cooing followed, as they snuggled and massaged her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Clovey!\" They chorused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought we were gonna get stuck with that mean ol' Stormy person but then you saved us!\" Sally giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that woulda been totally lame!\" Bunbun added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We love you, Clovey!\" Nicole said softly. Blushing furiously, Clove managed to squirm free, and looked at the trio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome... as long as you don't call me \"Clovey\" ever again.\" She said, managing a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" The trio chimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as I was saying.\" She folded her arms. \"I want you to gather your belongings, clothing, anything else you have here, and pack them up. Bring everything that belongs to the hedgehog and the vixen too. Then we'll go to the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Clove!\" They beamed, before setting to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClove let out another sigh, and flopped down on the couch, as Cassia sat beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stressing out a bit, sis?\" She said, leaning on her. Clove wrapped her arm around Cassia's shoulders, and smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little, yes... It's not every day you end up as the caretaker for a trio of mindless giggly sluts thatused to be your enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, true. I think you're kinda missin' the trick with them, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll do anything you say. I mean anything. If you give them boundaries, they stick to 'em. As long as you're nice about it, they'll probably decide they love you, and then you've got it easy. Sure, they're dumb. But they're dedicated, which is more than can be said for some of our old troops.\" Cassia grinned. \"Bunbun's basically my pet now, it's great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Well, I'll keep it up.\" She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Say, if you're struggling so much with these three, why'd you want to escort them?\" She asked, raising an eyebrow in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can't say. Not right now. When we get to the ground and we have some time alone, I'll tell you, but at this juncture, it's too risky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, sneaky. I like where this is going!\" She giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cloooove! We can't get all our stuff in this case!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then use another case, Sally!\" She called back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie-dokey!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After their private talk Cassia and Clove joined in preparing for their trip with Sally and company. To their dismay upon opening their closet they discovered it to be empty aside from one item. Clove picked up what seemed to be a small communicator and activated it. On the screen was a recorded message from Orbot and Cubot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Officers Cassia and Clove.\" The red sphere robot greeted. \"If you're watching this then I'm sure you've noticed the lack of clothing in your closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see. Funny story.\" Cubot muttered. \"Since you agreed to look after Sally and her friends the Boss said you had to 'look the part'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which, in turn, meant throwing out most of your uniforms.\" Orbot continued. \"Remember that this is a stealth mission so you can't wear your Empire outfits. Don't worry though. Sally and her friends have agreed to help offer you both disguises so you'll blend in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck you two.\" Cubot concluded before the recording stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe communicator fell to the ground as Clove's face froze as her eyes widened in fear. Cassia felt nervous, uncertain what Sally and the others would choose as their attire. To their dismay they found out moments later. Without warning the trio of bimbos rushed into their room carrying an untold amount of clothes for the sister to sample. Cassia and Clove resisted as best they could but their efforts were fruitless. Minutes after being assaulted by the three sluts the two pronghorns now sported new outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassia now possessed a pair of yoga shorts and a sleeveless shirt. Her top had the phrase \"Cute with Attitude\" written across which made the young doe blush with embarrassment. It was better than the other options Sally and the others had. The other shirts had more carnal writings including \"Anal Angel\", \"Looking for a Fun Night\", and \"Cum Dump in Training\". Given those options Cassia took the least erotic but made a mental reminder to go shopping at the first chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClove had it worse. She was forced to wear a pair of ass-less pants leaving only her underwear, a thong, to cover her privates. Along with the backless pants Clove also sported a tank top which had a low cut collar exposing some of her chest. More than Clove would have preferred. Though her alternate did not stop there as someone snuck on a new pair of shoes. Not just any shoes but high heels or more accurately \"fuck me\" heels. The trio of sluts cheered in approval of their decisions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-M-G. You two look, like, totally hot.\" Sally commented. Nicci joined in. \"Totally. I wish I could just eat you both, like, right now. I'm getting so hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh.\" Bunbun followed. \"Ya'll know how to make a girl feel jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Cassia was embarrassed by her new look Clove prayed for the mercy of death. Anything was better than this. Almost anything. With the two deer dressed Sally, Nicci, and Bunbun gather them, their belongings, and dragged them out of the room to meet with Eggman one last time. The doctor was waiting for them in the loading bay with their supplies. He spotted the group and addressed them, then he spotted Cassia and Clove's new outfits. \"An... Interesting choice in clothing, you two. I can only imagine you had help with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the pronghorn sisters spoke. Eggman continued, feeling the awkward tension rising. \"Well, I suppose that's what you get for volunteering. No turning back now, I'm afraid. Anyways, your transport it ready. It's also carrying the equipment needed for converting bimbos at the club. There's also a few new creations I added to make the job easier. I suppose that only leaves your assignments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClove looked towards Eggman, though half-hearted as shame still dominated her mindset. The doctor began explaining her missions. \"After you've set up shop at Club Rouge there are a few targets you'll need to take care of. Closest is Breezie in Casino Park. You'll need to infiltrate her office as strippers to get close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next is the Wolf Pack. Their leader has been spotted and it would be wise to take advantage of the oppurtunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last is an anomaly my sensors detected. Last time something like this popped up that plant-headed albino hedgehog appeared. If it is him you must capture that hedgehog. His time-traveling abilities may be of use to my empire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the details explained Eggman bid the group farewell before leaving for his lair. Clove boarded the transport and took the helm. Cassia sat beside her sister while the trio of sluts led by Sally sat behind the sisters. Moments later their craft lifted off before departing for the planet below.</span></div></div>",

All the girls were sitting at a table in the corner of the room talking, at least some were. Those who weren't talking were having their slits licked by the others or fingered. From her angle Clove could see Honey and Sonia were the ones handling the licking and fingering. The sight made the<br>\r\npronghorn unsettled which made her cough out of reflex and to get their attention. This worked as at least Sapphire noticed her and leapt from her seat to welcome her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clovey! What are you doing here?\" Asked the blue hedgehog. Clove flinch at the slut's use of her nickname but responded anyway. \"Our master sent us here to improve your progress. Now he wants Club Rouge and the entire city turned into a staging ground for our operations. He sent the essential equipment to accomplish this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master sent us new toys? Yay!\" Sapphire cheered. \"I can't wait to play with them. Where are they?\" Clove gave her answer. \"They are being unloaded now and should be here in a moment. I do have some right now but they're for our new recruits. Can you call them over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire complied and called over all six girls. Amy, Rouge, Honey, Sonia, Fiona, and Lien-Da got up and approached Clove. The doe revealed a set of badges shaped as Eggman's smiling logo and handed one to each of the bimbos. Clove then instructed the group to place them on their foreheads and they obeyed. Once the chips were in place the six sluts stood up straight with blank expressions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire, Miley, and Sally's group were impressed despite not knowing what happened. Miley spoke up asking Clove what just occurred. \"Mistress? What do those badges do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The badges are meant to take control of the host turning them into an obedient drone.\" Clove explained. \"However their effects only last while on the host's forehead. If removed the victim regains control. Watch.\" As a demonstration Clove removed Honey's badge and the yellow feline went back to her regular posture and mindset. \"Wha? What, like, just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClove didn't answer but instead put the badge back in Honey's head. She turned to the remaining bimbos and instructed them not to remove the badges unless ordered otherwise. Sapphire, Miley, and Sally's trio obeyed with a mock salute. Once the order was established Sally raised a question. \"So, like, what do we do now?\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't so much to protect Cassia, though that was a good reason, but rather to keep watch of the girls. The troop of air head whores may have managed without guidance but with their growing numbers they needed leadership. Out of those present Cassia was the best choice. Although the younger pronghorn did not enjoy being left behind she did like the sound of being a leader even if it was temporary. \"'Captain Cassia'. I like the sound of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClove chuckled at her sister's antics but remained firm in her decision.

Now you have to prove yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decision made Sally, Nicci, and Bunbun giddy with excitement. At last they would be going on a mission. They surrounded Clove in a thank-filled embrace which made the pronghorn blush. Another effect was a slight feeling of arousal as her nipples became erect and her slit began to moisten. Clove ignored this and just ordered the trio off her. They obeyed and proceeded to follow Clove out of the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clove's team was gone Cassia began instructing the crew of Egg-pawns where to place the equipment. As the robots worked Sapphire and Miley became bored. With the remaining present bimbos off-limits they needed to find a way to keep themselves entertained. To their luck Miley had an idea. She rushed over to Cassia and inquired to the young doe. \"Hey, Mistress Cassia? I had, like, an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An idea? Well this should be good.\" Cassia commented with a bit of snark. Miley nodded her head, oblivious to her superior's tone, and explained her idea. \"So master wants the city to be a base, like, right? So I was thinking what if we, like, turned the whole city into sexy bimbos like us? Wouldn't that be, like, totally hot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassia considered the notion but was unsure. It would accelerate the plan but it would probably tick off her sister and Eggman. Before she could answer Miley continued with another idea. \"Or we could see what new toys master sent us. Those badge thingies looked super cool. Imagine what else he gave us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had Cassia's curiosity. Eggman did say he supplied them with some new tech. And with a team of obedient bimbos, not including Sapphire or Miley, they would be the perfect test subjects. She had to think about it and told Miley she'd consider it. As the vixen sauntered away Cassia figured the fox's ideas would at least make things interesting.</span></div></div>",

Despite their numbers there was still plenty of room for them. The car had a larger interior as Eggman described with four seats filled hat left another four vacant for new recruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clove navigated the hover car she went over the plan with the girls in a painfully simple description for gem to understand. \"When we get to our target I will take lead. You three stay close behind and be ready with your blasters. When I give the signal you'll shoot our target and we'll bring them back for programming. Everyone understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three busty girls nodded in agreement. \"Yes, mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the bimbo trio were excited about going on their first mission. For most of the trip they talked endless about what they would do once they caught their target. Aside from turning him or her into a insatiable cocksleeve they shared fantasies between each other. Bunbun would wear a strapon and have bimbos lined up with their backs in their air. She would fuck each one until she collapsed she told. Nicci shared her ideas describing herself in a gloryhole room. Either a pair of breasts or a girl's cleft would appear and she's suckle and lick the body parts until she was satisfied. Sally told of her fantasy of being blindfolded as countless girls giggled and used her for their entertainment. All three were becoming aroused as they talked which only resulted in them continuing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll through their talk Clove had to listen to the three and the pronghorn found herself blushing a brighter red with each turn they took speaking. It seemed as though they forgot about her presence. Although Clove was prepared to order them into silence she kept getting distracted. Every time she turned to face the group Clove would glance at Sally's erect nipples before swiftly returning her gaze to the view in front of her. Once again she felt an inner heat building from within as she heard the chipmunk's lustful moans. The pronghorn's body began to tingle as her nipples became erect and her folds began to moisten again. Clove knew what was happening but did her best to reject the idea. She refused to believe it. However the image of Sally Acorn, absent of any clothing, becoming to her with a voice of desire kept playing in her mind. Her body's heat continued to rise as the idea trailed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who are we going after, mistress?\" Nicci asked. Clove snapped out of her trance and stumbled trying to respond to the lynx's question. \"That-that is a good question. For now we're going after...\"</span></div></div>",

In fact without warning they began to undress some of their clothes leaving their chests and privates exposed. Nicci and Bunbun began to cuddle before quickly advancing towards making out and groping each other.

Like, I was afraid of being seen as a total ditz but now, like, I can\u2019t stop enjoying this super-hot bod.\u201d Sally was pleased with her response and continued asking questions. \u201cSo what\u2019s your hottest fantasy? Mine is sex on a balcony with crowds watching.\u201d Except Bunbun, no one noticed Nicci twitch with delight at Sally\u2019s confession. Clovey giggled and admitted her fantasy. \u201cLike, my favorite fantasy was hot sex with the Freedom Fighters. I\u2019d think of being taken prisoner, tied up, while everyone had their fun with me. I get wet just from thinking about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, taking advantage of Clovey\u2019s confession, jumped her mistress and pushed her to the ground. The pronghorn was about to retort when Sally plunged a pair of fingers into her soaking pussy.

God, yes!  I want to be your bitch! Yours and the other Freedom Fighters! Just keep banging me!\u201d Sally obliged and continued to play with the doe\u2019s cleft.

Nicci watched with some envy, wishing she was in Clovey\u2019s place, while Bunbun was thinking about Clove\u2019s sister. Although young she felt pleasant around the young doe. The rabbit began to fantasize about herself and Cassia being together and ravaging each other\u2019s bodies without restraint. These fantasies drove her to the point of orgasm as she sprayed the grass floor beneath her with cum. Nicci followed suite before both noticed that Sally and Clovey were finishing as well.

The remaining three girls watched as the slumbering feline became like them. Her breasts enlarged to meet their size range before adopting a narrow waistline and wider hips. As a result of her new body shape her clothes wore shredded from the expansion. Blaze\u2019s facial features also adjusted. Her eyelashes grew out as dark eyeliner appeared alongside. Her lips turned gold with materialized lipstick. Blaze\u2019s hairs curled more than before and adopted a fire detail work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four bimbos cheered as Blaze\u2019s transformation was finished. They finished their mission and no doubt made their master proud. As they were ready to pick up Blaze and carry her back to their hover car the feline in question began to stir. Moments later her eyes opened as she tried standing on her two feet. She saw the four other bimbos before her but did not recognized them. In fact Blaze did not remember anything before her turning into a bimbo. She started asking questions to the four. \u201cLike, hello. Who are you four sexies? What\u2019s going on? Who am I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls looked to each other but it was between Sally and Clovey that Blaze got her answers. The pronghorn spoke first. \u201cLike, your name is Blazey the Kitty. We came to you because our master wants everyone turned into hot bimbo girls.\u201d Sally followed up. \u201cWe found you sleeping here and turned you into a sexy bimbo like us. Now we get to take you back to master and be all happy and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze listened to the two and accepted their explanation. She didn\u2019t have any reason to doubt the group and became pleased knowing of her purpose. Before anything else could be done Nicci asked Blaze why she was sleeping. The kitten thought hard in hope of learning her past as the four bimbos waited.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like, I found all these shiny jewels and was resting before I fight this meanie called Captain Metal.\u201d None of the group knew what the ditzy feline was talking about but the mention of this \u2018Captain Metal\u2019 caught their attention. Bunbun asked first. \u201cWho is this Captain Metal? He sounds powerful.\u201d Blaze nodded her head and told about her enemy as best she could. \u201cHe is. He\u2019s got this army of robot pirates and he\u2019s, like, their boss. He wanted these gem thingies but I got them first. I forgot why though.\u201d It was Sally who perked up with a response. \u201cOh! Maybe this Metal guy is, like, your master and you wanted to get the gems thingies for him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Blaze\u2019s memory lapse she found the squirrel\u2019s proposal sound to her. Captain Metal was powerful and her bimbo mindset found that attractive. Since she couldn\u2019t remember any of her own reasoning to get the gemstones Blaze accepted Sally\u2019s logic. She beamed as her unexpected sense of accomplishment surfaced. \u201cYay! Master will be so happy with me! Oh! I hope I still have those shiny things.\u201d Blaze couldn\u2019t remember at all if she still possessed the emeralds she collected and used all her diminished brain power to recall. Moments later several gemstones appeared around her, floating in the air. None of the five knew how Blaze made the emeralds appear but none of them cared as the cat jumped with joy at her success, now eager to return to her master with the shinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining four bimbos watched the giddy cat bounce with joy with amusement. Clovey\u2019s smile turned down when she remembered her mission to bring Blaze back to her master. Now it seemed Blaze was more interested in returning home to serve Captain Metal. A sense of conflict arose in her as she tried to think hard about her choices.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

True, when he had started out, the bimbofication was just to humiliate Sonic, but now, it was becoming a much more useful scheme. While the new slaves were dumb, they were surprisingly competent. On their first mission, Sapphire and Miley had over-succeeded by a whole 200%, and managed to enslave Nicole, the one person who had, at the time, posed the greatest threat to his rule. He had created a new breed of slave, one that would happily obey, but could function without input. Truly, all he needed to do with them was make sure they had food and they could go on living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he did have plans to experiment with roboticization and wisp use, those would be long-term projects. Sapphire was not present to absorb wisps, and robot bimbos would rather defeat the object of bimbofying them in the first place, and would be much harder to disguise. Once he had more bimbos to experiment with, they would be more worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Breezie plan remained on the table, though he did similarly desire more slaves before he would engage her. Still, perhaps he could begin \"working things out\" with her and making sure the remaining bimbos could play the part of pole dancers.However, it was all too tempting to continue messing with the bimbos and others around them.</span></div></div>",

The task of cleaning their leader's lair was bearable but the harassment and teasing from their fellow Egg Bosses was insufferable. Clove felt her dignity being erased as the catcalling continued but Cassia remained oblivious. It seemed she didn't care about what the other bosses were saying since she knew that her and Clove's punishment was only temporary. That and after meeting with Sapphire, Miley, and the brainwashed Freedom Fighters the punishment of cleaning duties in a maid outfit did not seem as bad compared to being converted into a bimbo. As the two were finishing their cleaning efforts in one section of the base Eggman's voice bellowed through the intercom. \"Cassia and Clove Pronghorn. Report to the command center immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two deer siblings sighed. Cassia spoke first asking what her older sibling thought Eggman wanted with them. Clove only answered that her guess was as good as any. So long as they weren't about to be transformed like the Freedom Fighters she did not care what their master threw at them. The two proceeded to store their supplies in the nearest storage closet before making their way to the center of Eggman's lair. After a few minutes of walking they arrived at the command center and bowed in respect before Eggman. \"You requested our presence, my lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent timing, you two.\" Eggman replied. \"If I didn't know better I'd say your punishment has improved both your attitude and responsibility skills.\" Both girls remained silent but neither took their leader's remark as a compliment. Eggman proceeded to continue speaking. \"I just sent Sapphire and Miley out on another mission. While they are away that leaves the remaining Freedom Fighters here to fulfill whatever task I require.\" Just as Eggman mentioned the trio right on cue Sally, Bunbun, and Nicci entered the room and saluted their master. The mere presence of the trio gave Clove shivers as she remembered who each girl was before their reprogramming. Cassia nudged her sister to get her attention as Eggman began speaking again. \"Seeing as Sapphire and Miley have proven to be quite successful for their first mission I want to test the reliability of my newest additions by sending them on their own mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master.\" Sally grinned. \"I promise to, like, do just as good as Sapphire and Miley.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall see about that.\" Eggman replied before turning to the deer sisters. \"Which is where you two come in. I want you both to watch over these three during their mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made both seers almost visibly shutter but they kept their composure and, with reluctance, thanked their leader for the oppurtunity.</span></div></div>",

He chortled with uncontrontrolled enthusiasm as he made his way back to his lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of flying across Tropical Resort Eggman returned to his hideout. As he docked his craft the doctor noticed Orbot, Cubot, and Sapphire waiting for him. The hedgehog harlet bowed as she welcomed her master. \"Welcome back, master. Did you get that cute fox boy like you wanted?\" Eggman coughed as he explained the situation. \"Not exactly, Sapphire. It turns out we had more unexpected guests in the park and I had to take care of them.\" Eggman then pulled the entranced Amy and Blaze out of his machine allowing Sapphire to see. The blue hedgehog screamed with excitement before rushing over to the docile pair. She grabbed one arm from each and rushed them to them to the brainwashing machine, leaving her master and his two robots stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet Tails was paying attention to other things- Cameras. After all, she was in Eggman's Interstellar Amusement Park. He had cameras everywhere, so she was looking for anywhere that didn't have a camera in sight- That would be her safe haven. Sure, she was fast with her tails, but as of late, she'd been out of practice. As such, she needed to do her best impression of a certain government spy and a certain ninja- She needed to stay out of sight. After this, she would be glad to take the elevator back down to Earth- She could use a space ship to infiltrate the amusement park another time...</span></div></div>",
