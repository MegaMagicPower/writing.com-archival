            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree usually active fillies lay around a treehouse. One, Sweetie Belle, was propped upside down in the corner trying to think of a cutie mark that she and her two friends could pursue today. They had exhausted Skydiving, Snorkeling, Orienteering, and even Studying. Scootaloo was still drying her wings from snorkeling, which was a fun activity in theory but one that ultimately resulted in a trio of cold fillies. Even Applebloom was opposed to the idea of any more water-themed activities for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not even late yet, there has to be something we can try,\" Scootaloo had turned onto her stomach and was facing the other two fillies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don' know, we should really have a list for these things,\" Applebloom sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang was quickly losing morale, until Sweetie Belle suddenly perked up and exclaimed, \"I've got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The other two both said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go ask Zecora if she has something for us to do, maybe we can get Cleaning cutie marks or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Sweetie Belle, cleaning cutie marks?\" Scootaloo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Unless you have a better idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ahgree with Sweetie Belle, we should go to Zecora's, even if it is cleanin', at least it's somethin',\" Applebloom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo let out a long sigh, \"Fine, but you both owe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Everfree Forest was still a scary place, but the three fillies had been through it enough that the multiple growls and howls of forest creatures didn't really bother them anymore. However, something was different about these sounds. They were somewhat more guttural and even included some moaning, also there was a horrible stench in the air. Like a cross between rotten eggs and cabbage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, this is sooooo gross,\" Sweetie Belle tried to breathe as little as possible through her nose, but she seemed to even be able to taste the smell. There was an unnatural haze in the air that pervaded every sense, today was an abnormal day, even for the Everfree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh deal with it Sweetie Belle, you were the one who wanted to go to Zecora's place,\" Scootaloo was just as bothered by the smell as her friends, but she couldn't show that to them. Not the cool Scootaloo. But for some reason she was getting really hungry. \"Hey, do you guys want to find something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the Everfree?\" Applebloom looked over at her friend. Granted that Applebloom was kind of hungry too, but eating stuff from the Everfree was never a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, it's just that I'm kinda hungry and... Wait, Sweetie Belle what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo and Applebloom both looked at their friend to find that she was currently munching on some yellow-colored grass. \"Fhff?\" Sweetie Belle tried to say through the tuft of grass in her mouth. She swallowed and tried again, \"Well you were both taking about how hungry you were and I was too. This whole place smells really gross, but this grass stuff smells really good, and tastes good too!\" Sweetie Belle went for another large bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom and Scootaloo both looked at each other and walked over to where Sweetie Belle was. After a cautious first bite, the two found that Sweetie Belle was indeed correct. The yellow-grass not only tasted great, but smelled great too. And their hunger was starting to go away! While the three fillies sat and munched on this new food, their original purpose was soon forgotten. Before long, the three fillies were trotting back to Ponyville with full bellies and content smiles, chatting about school and life in general. Each, however, would let out small belches as they went, hoping the others wouldn't notice.</span></div></div>",

Bonbon braced herself, knowing what was to come. The stomps slowed down, and were soon accompanied by ragged panting as they entered the room behind her. Her nose wrinkled. This must not be a bath day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bonnie, guess *huff* what?\" Lyra gasped, plopping down on the sofa next to her, throwing an arm around her girlfriend and leaning into her with her sweaty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Bonbon said, trying to sound cheerful as her lover pressed her soft, damp body against hers. She wasn't disgusted, she didn't want to be disgusted by her one true love, but she couldn't help but think this whole feedee thing was going a bit too far. Lyra had always been a little 'eccentric', so when she mentioned to Bonbon that she wanted to gain weight, it seemed almost normal. That was months ago, though, and while Bonbon had anticipated some chub, she could never have anticipated the enormous slob her girlfriend had become. A extra few pounds became a few dozen, and then a hundred, and then she got too big for the apartment's tiny shower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I broke 600 pounds today!\" Lyra squee'd, letting off a bassy fart, \"Isn't it wonderful?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure, hon-\" Bonbon started, only to be cut off when Lyra pulled her face towards her own and kissed her. Bonbon couldn't breathe, there was just the taste of her greasy lips, the smell of her last five meals... And then Lyra belched in her mouth. She fought back tears and sickness, pretending to enjoy the kiss for as long as it lasted. She had long ago promised to please her girlfriend however she wanted, and Bonbon never broke her promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Bonnie, it's time for some sweet, hot...\"</span></div></div>",

She yawned, scratching her bushy armpit as she made her way to the locker room. After a long day of training new recruits, there was nothing she liked more than a hot shower. It wouldn't clean her up at all - If anything, the steaming water would just make her even sweatier - But she loved the feeling of warmth across her sagging flab, and the company of her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused at the door to let out a massive, rank fart, filling the hallway with a toxic cloud that could suffocate anypony dumb enough to breathe it for too long. Then, swinging open the door, she squeezed her enormous backside through and into the room. There was a curtain between the locker room and communal shower, but she could hear the high-pressure nozzles hissing, as well as the sounds of ponies using them. Creeping up to the curtain as quietly as possible, Spitfire smirked, throwing back the curtain to reveal...</span></div></div>",

Looking over her shoulder, she could see the sound engineer grimace as the sound reached his headphones. She truly wished the colt could come into the booth and enjoy the smell, too, but this was just one of those sacrifices he'd have to make for his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new album was coming along perfectly. Instead of the usual pop music, Sapphire had decided to try a different genre, one never tried before: Bodily functions! Her 600 pound body helped her along, providing the loudest grumbles, the bassiest belches and the wettest farts imaginable. And to think, the final track was almost done. Soon, the album would reach store shelves, and ponies all across Equestria would hear their favorite popstar as they'd never heard her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the window, the sound engineer gave a thumbs up and pressed the button to talk over Sapphire's headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was, uh,\" He paused, retching inwardly, \"That was sure something, Miss Shores! I think that's a wrap. The album will be in mastering by tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire smiled, letting out a fart as she passed the helpful engineer, who only gagged in response. She didn't mind; In fact, she was rather pleased with his reaction. Most ponies would pretend to like it just to get closer to her. She waddled out of the studio and into her waiting limousine. The doors were extra wide, and the seats were extra long, extra wide, and extra stain resistant... Not that they weren't still darkened with smears and stains that could never be washed out. The driver hit the gas, and Sapphire looked down at her schedule. The next stop was...</span></div></div>",

Thanks to a handy mini-fridge, the slobstar was able to snack on all sorts of hot, greasy food on the way. Quadruple patty cheeseburgers, donuts fried in bacon grease, heck, just pure grease when she needed to wash something down. Her former life as a thin, beautiful singer was long gone, and with a diet like this, it was never coming back. Not that she minded. Even with her new size and obsessions, she still had her fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCase in point, when the limo pulled up outside of a music store for a record signing event. The rear suicide doors swung open, and a dozen cameras began flashing. In the 10 minutes it took Sapphire's assistants to peel the beige mare off of her seat and onto her hooves, hundreds of pictures had been taken. She waddled slowly, huffing and puffing down the red carpet, while dozens of fans waited on the other side of the security fence. It was a far cry from the screaming crowds she used to attract, but when Sapphire let out a long, hissing fart, and saw the assembled ponies all lean in to catch a whiff, she knew she was making the right decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the blob reached the signing table right in front of the store. She couldn't help but let out a moan as she sat; Her enormous ass felt super comfortable, even without any cushions! The security guards lined everypony up carefully, and one by one, they each stepped up and handed her a record to sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soap is for posers,\" She wrote on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat on,\" She scribbled on another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the various ponies' records had been signed, along with a few chunky asses and old fast food wrappers. Sapphire sighed and stretched out her back, feeling pops up and down the length of her spine, as the last pony in line stepped up. She had been waiting so patiently for so long, that despite having the urge to pack up and go to bed, Sapphire simply sat back down, uncapped her pen, and looked up at her final fan. Her eyes went wide when she realized it was...</span></div></div>",

She let out a wet fart, staining the carpet below her as she stood up to greet her old friend. Rarity winced, but didn't recoil as much as most ponies, probably thanks to the clothes pin pinching her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity didn't have a record for her to sign. Instead, she placed a sketchbook down the the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Shores,\" Rarity began, only for Sapphire to cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Sapphire! I flush Miss Shores down the toilet every day!\" She snorted and laughed, \"Hawhaw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity wrinkled her nose at the thought, but continued regardless, \"Sapphire, I've been following your recent, um... 'Work', very closely, and I've got a proposition to make. I've done a lot of research, and I believe I can solve your current fashion predicament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire looked down at her body, and in particular, the white silk dress it was currently wrapped in. It was one of her older dresses, from long before her transformation. The only reason it wasn't utterly shredded was the stretchy material, which had reached its limit around a hundred pounds ago and was ready to snap. It was absolutely covered in stains; The only pony who knew this dress was once white was Sapphire herself, seeing as she'd done to much to change it to the current brown, red, and yellow hodgepodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I understand the, erm, 'slobstar' lifestyle revolves around conspicuous consumption and laziness, so I came up with a few designs which really exemplify and enhance your attributes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity opened her sketchbook and began flipping through it. Each page had a picture of an obese mare in various outfits. A fashionable cocktail dress with a window to show off her belly, a shorter party dress that exposed her cellulite-covered lower ass cleavage, even a colorful yoga outfit, with sweat stains already drawn on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire's eyes lit up, and before Rarity could react, she gave her a kiss on the lips. Rarity's cheeks puffed up, and she placed a hand over her mouth before running out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" Sapphire said with a smile, \"I do have that effect on ponies.\"</span></div></div>",

Grabbing a random document, she wiped it off, leaving a smear on the antique mahogany surface, and took another bite. It was alright, she guessed, but nothing compared to the food in Canterlot. She belched, imagining her political future in that gleaming city. She'd be carried around on a platform, waited on hoof and claw, treated by diplomats and heads of state... But not yet. Bringing herself back to reality, she set down her burger and glanced over the stained document. Something about zoning regulations and a new shopping center. She grabbed a quill in a greasy hoof and signed it, tossing it into the 'approved' box for her secretary to deal with. With a sigh, she went back to her meal, the fourth one of the day, and it was only noon. Hey, politics takes a lot of energy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer office was a mess, littered with crumpled up papers, stacks of documents, and piles of old fast food wrappers. A stench of flatulence and stale grease hung in the air despite all attempts to remove it; A pair of useless air fresheners hung from the doorknob, and a pile of burned-out incense sat on a side table. She'd throw it away sometime, but she just had so much to do. Her body, likewise, showed the effects of physical inactivity. An overabundance of cheap food had turned the spry young mare who had been elected into a slovenly mass of flesh, oozing out of her creaking office chair. Her bloated, hayburger-filled gut pressed into the desk while sitting and hung to the floor when she stood, not something that happened often. Her backside suffered from endless hours of sitting in a comfortable chair, each cheek being almost the size of a carriage wheel, huge, pliant, and somewhat flat from constantly being sat on. The beautiful face that graced election posters every few years had likewise expanded, growing soft cheeks and drooping jowls, flecked with crumbs and stains from her gorging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she had become the typical fat politician, not that she cared. Ponies should care more about her ideas than her body; She was elected for her platform of economic growth and social responsibility, not her flank, dammit! Besides, she'd start working out once she reached the next stepping stone of her career, she swore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame Mayor?\" With a crackle, a voice came over the intercom, \"You have a visitor from...\"</span></div></div>",

Also, most of them are not all that great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven all the junk food these little fillies consume on a daily basis, I'm surprised they aren't all at least chunky.</td>",
