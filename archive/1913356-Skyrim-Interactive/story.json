When you've been in the Dark Brotherhood as long as I have, you get very good at making escapes. Regardless, I quickly equipped my gear, and we began to make our way out of the prison. Being as there were likely dozens of Thalmor here, I told my rescuer that this would require a subtle approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell just by looking at him, that subtlety was not his specialty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeds to say, I took the lead, sneaking up on any guards we encountered with cat-like tread, and quietly cutting their throats. A few times, we came across a locked door, or a trap. But with my nimble fingers and careful feet, we easily avoided them. There was only one obstacle I couldn't see a way around. We were nearly out of this prison, when we saw the edit to the outside. Unfortunately, it was at the other end of a room full of a dozen Thalmor soldiers, and a couple justicars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way past them.\" I whispered \"There's no way we could take them on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw my companion changing shape. Before I could register what was going on, a enormous werewolf ran past me, charging into the room with a deafening roar, catching the thalmor off guard. Some of them managed to get off a few shots with some arrows, but they were no worse them pin, pricks for the ferocious beast, as it tore into them sending blood and corpses flying in all directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, thenroom was completely painted with Thalmor blood, and my companion stood in the center of it before changing back to his former self. I had never actually seen a werewolf before, and for brief moment I was shocked, but I quickly wiped it away. When we finally made it outside, I asked \"Why did you rescue me?\" </span></div></div>",

Daedla started a quick fire, and pulled out a map with markings all across it. He could hear the noise of the assassin sharpening and cleaning off his blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, before you go on about this quest, how do you know me?\" Valen asked curious to the man's knowledge. \"I've seen your work, especially the work with that Thalmor Justicar before your capture.\" Daedla replied. \"You know about that,\" Valen asked. \"Well, I'm the one who preformed the Black Sacrament in order for you to kill him. I went right to Nazir, was it, with the coin. You know, saving face.\" Daedla replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaedla could see the initial shock of the assassin to the information. \"Well, can I at least know who you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaedla set the map down and stood, walking to Valen.

When you're Listener for the Dark Brotherhood, the last thing you want is for all of Tamriel to know who you are. Glory on the other hand, he already had respect and glory as Listener, but you could never have too much. \" Will there be any sort of material reward at the end of this journey? Gold, perhaps?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaedla nodded \"More than you can count.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Valen's interest. He had made quite a tidy sum of cold during his career, but he had spent a large deal of it repairing the Dawnstar sanctuary. \"Alright, I guess I'll go along with this, but it had better be worth my time.\" Daedla chuckled \" Don't worry, it will be, you can count on that. Now, as I said, we need at least four of us, so we must recruit two more companions, a thief and a mage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I''ve got a contact in the Thieves' Guild.\" Said Valen \"A Breton by the name of Delvin.

I'm surprised that they'd just hand a thief over suddenly for...whatever this quest is.\" Daedla began to pace around the fire, \"The Theives Guild is back in Skyrim. I believe you already know this. But as good as a standard run-of-the-mill thief would be, I have a better candidate.\" Valen still looked confused, \"Still, why are they handing him over to us?\" \"The Theives Guild happened to corrupt a mercenary in Riften by the name of Jacob, an assassin. I have some ties with him. He may be willing to help. He is connected to the guild, but is more of a...freelance thief,\" Daedla finished. Valen then stood, \"Alright, you better be right. We staying the night here?\" \"No. It's best to move during the night, attract less attention. You ready?\" Daedla said approaching the mouth of the cave after putting out the fire. Valen sheathed his blades and followed, \"Let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek across the started with the two men getting on each of the horses and moving through the forests to avoid detection. On the way, Valen had some questions. \"So who exactly is this guy,\" Valen asked. \"Well,\" Daedla began \"he was once part of the Companions, the inner circle and everything. But he left, the coin didn't fit his needs. He was...well, is good-natured. However, he needed gold. He joined the Thieves Guild a few years back. I'm surprised you don't know him, with you being with the Brotherhood and all.\" Valen still had some questions, \"Why'd he leave the guild?\" \"Well, he got bored, left, and went back into mercenary work. Now, when you see him, he may wear a mask and look very sinister. But he's the best thief I know.\" The next day they arrived in Riften.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob wandered the street on his way back from the Temple of Mara.

Thoughts of bedlam and fishing jobs filled his mind...good times. He walked past Honeyside when he heard something behind him. He pulled out one of his daggers and held it at the ready. \"Who's there,\" Jacob said with Authority. Daedla stepped out of the shadows with Valen behind him. \"You seem jumpy,\" Daedla said. \"By the divines, don't do that, Daedla!\" Jacob said sternly sheathing his dagger, \"what do you want?\" \"Buisness,\" Daedla replied simply.

Jacob paced for a minute or two, stopped, looked back at Volgern, and let out a sigh. Jacob moved over him and threw him over his shoulder and walked with him toward a back exit. Jacob opened it as it led to the forest. Jacob set the man down for a moment and felt his body begin changing. Fur grew across, muscles filled his body, and his senses sharpened. He let out the howl of a werewolf and now looked down at the man. He carefully placed his jaw around him and carried him that way. 'Urgh....Disgusting..' Jacob thought as he ran with this man in his jaw until he reached a cave. He laid the man down and changed back.

Never seen anything like you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a Dunmer,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your kind certainly has changed since I last laid eyes upon them,\" the Dwemer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would make you over five thousand years old!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"That's impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you're skilled enough in Longevity,\" the Dwemer said. \"Now, would you kindly get me out of these chains? It's been so long since I've last laid eyes upon Tamriel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this,\" Vedvenin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're worrying too much,\" Jacob said. \"You know the court mage in Solitude? I hear she's been alive for several hundred years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These circumstances are very different, but okay,\" she said, drawing her dragonbone swords. She thrust a chain, cleanly severing it from the wall. The Dwemer then reached over and pulled at the other chain, causing it to snap. He walked toward the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\" Vedvenin shouted. \"You're no longer a normal mortal. Even I couldn't break those chains, and I'm one of the strongest people in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, girl,\" the Dwemer said. Vedvenin began to walk toward him, but not of her own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing to me?\" she asked, feeling fear for only the second time in her life. \"Release me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" the Dwemer said as she was near enough to him. \"Your soul looks... tasty.\" Her eyes went wide. He touched the space between her clavicles, and a small, glowing, golden dragon appeared. It looked as if it were bound. \"So strong, yet so helpless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go!\" Jacob shouted, charging him. He smacked the pommel of his Nightingale Blade into the back of the Dwarve's neck, breaking his concentration enough for Vedvenin to fall free of the elve's grasp. The tiny dragon's bonds disappeared, and the dragon itself dissipated. The Dwemer then turned around, grabbed Jacob, and hurled him through the doorway and closed the door without moving an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until next we meet, lovely,\" the Dwemer said. He sprouted dragon-like wings and launched himself into the air, breaking through the rock ceiling. Vedvenin felt an intense burning in her chest, and let out a blood-curdling scream as an inferno engulfed her and filled the room, causing the stone and metal to glow red. A pipe ruptured, releasing a lot of steam. Water began pouring out, creating even more vapor as it cooled any stone or metal it touched. As the inferno died down, and the water was nearly at her feet, Vedvenin passed out.</span></div></div>",

His back was worst for wear, but he could take it. He was trapped and looked towards the door. \"Vedvenin! Vedvenin, you there?\" Jacob yelled. No response. \"I gotta get in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob looked at the wall and saw that the heat still made it weak. Jacob ran to the back of the room and yelled. \"Fus, Ro Dah!\" The wall had a hole blown in the center as steam and heat poured in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was taken back initially, but quickly recovered and ran through it. He saw in the center of the room, he saw Vedvenin passed out on her back as the water was rising. He ran over her and saw her armor glowing slightly. He grabbed her by the back and legs and held her as she burned against the armor slightly. Jacob ran to a wall and used telekinesis to pick up a broken boiler pipe and tossed it through a wall. He ran outside holding Vedvenin, and quickly ran down one of the roads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob ran for a few minutes until he saw two Stormcloaks walking down the road. One of them had a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother! I need a horse!\" Jacob hollered moving towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stormblade! It's an honor. As you wish,\" the Stormcloak answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob laid Vedvenin on the horse and jumped on as he rode down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed until Jacob had reached the cave. He was hidden inside an abandoned bandit camp. A hatch inside the camp led to the cave underneath. Jacob laid Vedvenin down and looked over her wounds. \"...That's gonna hurt when she wakes up.\" Not knowing any healing magic, he bandaged a wound on her forehead and removed the top of her Daedric armor and replaced it with rags. He bandaged the wounds and noticed the dragon symbol on her back. Jacob finished bandaging her back and flipped her over gently and began bandaging the rest of her. Jacob finished bandaging her and placed her armor and weapons in a chest at the foot of her bed. He checked over her from time to time, but rested as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The man I knew as my father always said I was different from the other children, always wanting to learn combat and go hunting, rather than go play with the other kids. By the time I was thirteen, I was already as skilled as the average soldier, but I kept working at it, and eventually I became quite dangerous by the time I was able to legally enlist in the Legion. The soldiers feared me for my skill. Most of the ones that started training at that age hadn't held anything more than a knife. About a year ago, the one I knew as my father passed away, but before he died, explained everything. Once he passed, I went to the tavern to drown my sorrows in mead, at which point I was being harassed by the Orum gang. They tried to brand me a whore, and in retaliation, I took out seven of their lieutenants, but when I was ambushed in a dark alley by them, I became surrounded. Lucky for me, an Altmer mage showed up and killed the ones I had been unable to. Enough about that, though. I don't know why I always wanted to dominate the opposition. It just felt natural. You two are close to the beast blood, but what if I'm close to tapping the full potential of the dragonborn? Was that inferno I unintentionally unleashed just a sample? I want to find out what a dragonborn is truly capable of, and I won't rest until I figure it out. Perhaps it lies in Alduin's elusive soul? Or maybe the answer lies with that Dwemer. Either way, I want to become stronger and smarter. I want to know the limit of power a dragonborn can posses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's quite a tail,\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what's your story, Jacob?\" Vedvenin asked. \"Why are you in Skyrim, and why have you sided with the Stormcloaks?\"</span></div></div>",

He taught me what he knew and I kept training. Then, vampires attacked when I was a young man. I fought a few of them off, but then one got the upper hand on me and took me out.\" Jacob pulled the mask down and showed scars lining the left side of his face, his eye was white and blind. \"I woke up and a small Imperial brigade had entered the town when I woke up. I tried to ask for help, but a Thalmor was with them. He tossed me aside and left me. When I went to the house I grew up in, the smell inside and the trails of blood was all I needed to see. Gathering what money was left, and stealing some, I traveled to Windhelm. On the way, a werewolf attacked me and infected me with Lycanthropy. I was crazed by the hunt and went on a rampage. When I came to, I ran to Windhelm. Ulfric took me in and I was a Stormcloak. Any other family I had went missing, probably because they worshipped Talos...I was sent down to Riften and found the Theives Guild. After doing some work, Brynjolf came to me and joined me into the Nightingales and I trained there. Then I joined up with the Dawnguard. After all that, I started traveling as a hired mercenary. And here I am. All I can do to not lose it is fight. I try to keep as many alive as possible, but I can't always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob stared at the fire and looked up at the two. \"Sorry about that.

But she doesn't let her mind get clouded or distracted by petty things, which makes her all the more lethal on the battlefield. Battle-hardened soldiers have come running back to Windhelm, badly wounded and frightened like children. They told of a mysterious woman they had encountered, who had destroyed regiments. Most of them only saw a silhouette at most before they were dead or scared off. I suspect that was her they were talking about. My advice to you is, if you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you watch your tongue around her. She's dangerous, and is apparently not afraid to cut off the head of a subordinate who's not following orders. I'm pretty sure Tullius knows of her skill, and I suspect he's given her permission to kill any Thalmor she comes across. I've seen the bodies. So many soldiers have died by her hand alone. We need to avoid making her angry, because if you saw what she did to the Thalmor, it would make the deaths of my brothers and sisters look merciful.\"</span></div></div>",

It looked kind of like a dragon. After I hit him with the pommel of my sword, he dropped her to the ground and hurled me through the door we came through, at which point I got knocked out. She can explain the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the Dwemer hurled Jacob through the door, he sprouted etheral, dragon-like wings and lept through the rock ceiling,\" Vedvenin explained. \"It was only a few more seconds until I felt an intense amount of heat building up in my chest and the room was filled with fire. I don't remember much after that, other than I heard someone scream in pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I came to, the door I was thrown through was glowing a red color, probably meaning it was quite hot, and a wall had been made brittle enough for me to use my Unrelenting Force Shout...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up,\" Tullius ordered. \"Unrelenting Force Shout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUS RO DAH!\" Jacob Shouted toward the ceiling. The outskirts of the Shout was enough to cause Tullius to stumble back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Tullius said. \"Please, proceed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Jacob began. \"I used my Unrelenting Force Shout to knock down a section of wall, and it was unbelievably hot in there. Rock and metal were glowing a bright red color, a pipe had burst, and was leaking water, which helped cool things down a little, but made a lot of steam. Everything in that room, even her armor, was so hot it was glowing. Anyway, I picked her up, brought her to the surface and got a horse from one of my comrades. After finding an abandoned bandit camp, I treated her wounds to the best of my abilities, and here she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem that not all Stormcloaks are mindless thralls, huh Ulfric?\" Tullius retorted, causing Ulfric to grunt. \"But yes, I do agree that this Dwemer could be a bit of a problem, seeing as he nearly killed my most elite soldier. So, what is it you wanted to discuss?\"</span></div></div>",

She sheathed her weapons and approached it, \"What in Oblivion is this doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly fell straightforward as something knocked her over, tied her legs and began dragging her. Vedvenin clawed at the floor trying to get a grip, unable to see her assailant. She was then flipped up with her back against a large, thick tree as a rope came around her chest and arms tying her down to it. She struggled against the ropes, unable to get out. She looked forward and saw Jacob sitting in front of her. \"Jacob?! The hell do you think you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob pulled down his mask and hood as he walked to Vedvenin and knelt in front of her. \"Listen,\" Jacob said, knowing this may be his final time he could help Vedvenin with this, \"you can't keep running from your past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVedvenin was already shaking, her eyes watery. \"N-no. You don't understand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob brought his face closer and turned his head to show the left side of his face scarred heavily. \"These scars are from my past as a child. You have that one too don't you,\" Jacob said motioning to the scar across her cheek. \"That past, whatever happened, it forged you. It tempered you. It made you who you are, Vedvenin. You can't keep running from that, or else your only gonna live these thoughts of pain for the rest of your life. Come on, Vedvenin, talk to me. Face your past, and learn to live with it.

As she entered the house that was still standing, she found a considerable amount of evidence that it had been abandoned for some time. A thick layer of dust blanketed everything, and a strong gust of wind came through from the south, stirring up the dust and making it hard to breathe. She laid her belongings down on a bare patch of floor, and started to dust everything off, from the highest spot to the floor. By the time she was done cleaning the place, she had a pile of dust about nine inches high and three feet around just outside the door. She took a broom and spread it out. She then began to hang up the weapons she never uses, and stacked potions and poisons on an unused shelf. She followed up by placing alchemical ingredients and the rest of her belongings in other places. She did, however, leave hundred of precious gems and miscellaneous items in the chest she brought. After all was said and done, she thought she'd go and pay her last respects to the remains of her parents. When she reached what was left of their house, she found two charred skeletons. She nearly fell to her knees at the sight. She knew the pain they went through when they died. Another gust of wind came through, exposing a cellar door.</span></div></div>",

After some seconds, she dismounted Arvak, and took a leap of faith off the cliff and right into the middle of the Dremora horde, killing all Dremora within ten feet of her landing point, and wounding others a little farther away. She drew the blades Vedvenin (Black Wind Master) and Faasnuhavnodun (Fearless Brutal Grace) and began cutting down any Dremora that stood before her. Some were still in shock at her entrance. It was starting to get dark, and she was still tirelessly fighting Dremora. One hit her on her back with a Battleaxe, only for it to get deflected, and the Dremora knocked back. Claire stuck Faasnuhavnodun through him and cut the head off another with Vedvenin. By the time she was done fighting and the Dremora had retreated, it was dawn. Blood and bodies covered the ashen ground, and the Redorans and Telvannis stared at Claire, standing amongst the massive amount of bodies, facing them.

Not in these times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should ask her some questions only your real Thane would know,\" Proventus suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would probably be best, Proventus,\" Bulgruuf said. \"Tell me, when you came before me, where did I send you, what did you retrieve, and for who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first time I came before you, you said your court wizard, Farengar, needed an able assistant with some research on dragons he was conducting. As such, he asked me to go to Bleak Falls Barrow and retrieve an ancient stone tablet for him, which turned out to be a map of ancient dragon burial mounds that Delphine wanted. Immediately after I got back, you were speaking with a guard, who said a dragon was attacking the Western Watchtower. When Irileth, a few guards and I arrived at the scene, the dragon had left for a short time, but returned. After killing it and I consumed its soul, the Greybeards called on my way back to Whiterun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've verified yourself enough,\" Bulgruuf interrupted, raising a hand. \"Cut her loose. So, tell me, what is your name? How did you find it, and where in Oblivion did you get armor made of solid gold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire Delgreind, last heir of the forgotten Great House Seranaan, and descendent of the dragon priest Kohnarin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any proof regarding your claimed history?\" Bulgruuf asked, skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right here in this journal,\" Claire said, handing Bulgruuf the large, red book she found. Bulgruuf flipped to the first page, and found many entries by Kohnarin, and as he flipped through some more, eventually finding entries by Saveros. \"But that does not explain how you got the armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my way there, I noticed some Thalmor having trouble with an  invisible, magic barrier. I passed through without issue, and every time I held the sword Vedvenin up to an alter, the wall split into fourths. I am without Konharik's protection now, but he said I would no longer need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were the odds?\" A guard asked. \"A descendent of a dragon priest, Morrowind royalty, and dragonborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Claire began. \"I must see General Tullius immediately.\"</span></div></div>",

He quickly through Claire over his shoulder and carried her swords in there sheath as he placed her over  his horse and rode back to Solitude. \"Hang on Claire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob burst through Solitude's gates as he rode in front of Tullius, Ulfric, and Eoin. \"Eoin, check back outside, can you make sure I wasn't followed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" he replied as he went through the gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General Tullius, do you have an infirmary somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but it's already overflowing,\" Tullius informed him, \"We need another place to take her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob realized the perfect place, \"I know where. Ready forces from the Falkreath Gate, that's where the rest of them are coming from.\" Jacob then ran toward the Temple of the Divines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob burst through the door and quickly looked around. Vacant. Jacob found one of the beds of a priest there and laid Claire down. He placed the two swords next to her bed and the helmet on a nearby nightstand. Jacob then took old fine clothes and ripped the linen, using the strips as bandages. He bandaged Claire up and waited inside the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Such a child was to be the last heir of House Seranaan, a forgotten Great House of Morrowind and a direct descendent of the dragon priest Kohnarik. Only that child would have been allowed into Kohnarik's tomb with the sword in hand. The other sword, Fassnuhavnodun, which translates as Fearless Brutal Grace, was found next to the suit of gold armor I am currently wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't gold a soft metal, useless for armor and weapons smithing?\" Eoin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no ordinary gold, Eoin,\" Claire continued. \"It's like Stalhrim, almost completely indestructible, and requires a specific tool or process to mold it.

He tried to breath deeply for one last defiant Thu'um, but his lungs would simply not co-operate. He gave a weak cough, blood spilling from his mouth as he did so, and began to slip off Alduin's blood soaked talons, falling the short distance to the ground. Both Stormcloaks and Imperials lay in heaps, their bodies ignored by all as Tullius and Ulfric stood atop the mountain of corpses, engaged in a fierce duel, neither able to see Alduin as he encroached upon them, about to deliver one last shout that would seal the rate of the world-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzalvaunt jerked awake from the nightmare, taking a few seconds to realise where he was and that Skyrim had not been ground underfoot by the World-Eater himself. Rubbing his eyes, Azalvaunt slowly sat up, the sheets receding as he slowly got out of bed. Azalvaunt sighed. This was the second time within twice as many days that he had experienced a nightmare, something that had not happened since his childhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the distinct possibility that his lycanthropism was connected to it somehow. He had heard several of the companions, engaged in their own conversations, muttering about the impossibility of experiencing true rest at night. Hopefully the onslaught of terrifying visions plaguing his slumber was simply caused by the immense stress of trying to save the world. Yes, that sounded likely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. If stress was contributing to his nightmares he would need to find a way to somehow get Nazeem to shut up, at least for a while. The arrogant Redguard never stopped talking about the Cloud District with whoever was in earshot, and Azalvaunt couldn't give less of a shit about the pretentious farmer's daily activities. Ahlam's comments about him stuffing himself up Balgruuf's rear helped to alleviate the rage one felt when dealing with him, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigurd was little better, always enthusiastically spouting his position at Belethor's store as if his life depended on it.

He was ready to bring justice to the lawless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he exited his home, he noticed a woman in Daedric armor with a sword comprised of what looked like dragon bone quickly walked past. The air about her bristled with magic energies, as if she were a living conduit of immense magical power and had no choice but to irradiate the residuals into the atmosphere, though a fair amount of him felt it was just her armor. Quickly, he picked up a brisk pace toward the Bannered Mare to get at least one bounty before they were all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hilda noticed him enter immediately and said, \"The woman that just walked out took the last bounty letter I had. I can, however, mark on your map, where she was headed. If you hurry, you can still catch her.\" The Breton feverishly handed Hilda his map, and she marked the location of his target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fort Greymoore wasn't too far of a walk. Maybe four hours, but he had made much longer treks. When he finally arrived at the ancient fortress, however, the scene he found was grizzly. Bandits had their weapons and armor cut to ribbons by what seemed to be a very sharp blade. A bandit in scaled armor limped up to Azalvaunt and collapsed at his feet, dropping a steel greatsword, in which much of its blade had been shewn clean off about an inch before the cross-guard. There were no visible fractures in the blade, just a smooth, featureless cut that had rendered the weapon useless. Azalvaunt felt pressure on his legs and looked down to see the bandit clawing at his armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please,\" the bandit cried feebly. He had a strong look of desperation in his face. \"Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Azalvaunt looked at him more closely, he had numerous lacerations in his skin, some deeper than others, and metal studs in his armor suffered the same fate as his weapon. The bandit succumbed to his wounds and fell limp, into a heap on the blood-soaked earth. Drawing his mace, he made his way into the fort, where he was met with more death and a lot more blood. After taking a few steps and surveying the scene, he was pressed against a wall by a Daedric shield, and there was a sword against his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're no bandit,\" the woman pressing her shield into his gut said, flustered. \"They would've foolishly fought back to their last breath.\" She removed her sword and shield from Azalvaunt's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You- you're the same one from earlier in Whiterun,\" Azalvaunt began between breaths as he gathered himself to assess the figure before him. \"You killed all of those bandits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What kind of question is that?\" She asked. \"Of course I did. Those bounties don't complete themselves, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If I may, can I see your face, so I may recognize you if we meet again?\" Though he wasn't expecting her to actually fill his request, she removed her helmet, revealing a young Dunmer with short, silver hair that didn't extend past her neck, with a few strands in front of her left ear, garnet-red eyes, and pale, blue-gray skin. She left without another word.</span></div></div>",

As was the case with most bandits, several carried small coin pouches, which Azalvaunt looted. Seeing the bandit that had pleaded to him for help twitching slightly, he moved silently over to the marauder and stamped down hard on his neck, several slight cracking noises signifying that the bandit was definitely dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking his money pouch while walking and verifying that he did indeed have enough money for a horse, Azalvaunt rolled his shoulders and began to sprint, enjoying the enhanced... Well, everything, that the dragon souls he absorbed granted him. More magica, more stamina, and even harder to kill, making him that bit more deadly with each slain dragon, yet somehow not affecting his appearance at all. You'd think someone who could survive a greatsword blow to the stomach would resemble a stone wall, but Azalvaunt's figure remained the same as it was when he had first entered Skyrim: tall, well muscled although not to the extent of the Nords, and still sporting a somewhat gaunt appearance despite the rich food of Skyrim's cities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzalvaunt began to salivate, and the battlemage had to consciously stop himself from running his tongue over the bottom of his canines as his thoughts briefly drifted to venison stew for a few seconds.

Keeping the rein in his hand while balancing on the rock, Azalvaunt hooked his leg over the saddle, finding the extra height made it much easier to mount the horse. Azalvaunt made a quick mental note to learn how to better mount a steed without any assistance from Skyrim's landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging his armoured heels into the horses sides proved sufficient to spur the mare into a gallop, Azalvaunt guiding her to the right, in the direction of the western watchtower. Scenery passed by in a green almost-blur, a slight wind touching Azalvaunt's bared face. A genuine smile, one unmarred by sadistic bloodlust or drunken stupor gradually widened on Azalvaunt's face as he brought the horse down to a quick trot, showing teeth naturally sharpened just enough to make an attentive person somewhat uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther slowing the Kate's speed to just above that of walking, Azalvaunt let out a contented sigh. Yes, this had definitely been the right choice, he could barely even remember the fear he had experienced less that half an hour ago. Cracking his neck in both directions, Azalvaunt began to think of possible names for his steed. Simply calling it 'Horse' wouldn't do, and would most likely not register as snake within the animal's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat name does Azalvaunt choose?</span></div></div>",

Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, whom Hulgar recognised as a Nord due to his accent, indicated the man with tattered clothes by tilting his head to Hulgar's right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Stormcloaks... Skyrim was fine until you came along, the Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I'd have stolen that horse and I'd be halfway to Hammerfell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stopped scowling and looked Hulgar straight in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there, you and me, we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nord in front of Hulgar snorted through his nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all brothers and sisters in binds, now, thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Imperial turned his head towards them. <br>\r\n\"Shut up back there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief turned to the Nord at Hulgar's right. \"What's wrong with him, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first Nord's face displayed anger - not quite rage, but somewhere in between that and mild anger. \"Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true high king!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ulfric, jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion, if they captured you - oh gods, where are they taking us?\" The first Nord's face displayed a look of resignation. \"I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits...\" The thief's eyes bulges out of their sockets as his face flushed white. \"No, this can't be happening, this isn't happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first Nord's voice grew gentle as he spoke, trying to calm the thief. \"Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?\" The thief turned to him. \"Why do you care?\" The Nord smiled sadly. \"A Nord's last thoughts... should be of home...\"<br>\r\n\"Rorikstead. I'm - I'm from rorikstead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe occupants of the cart grew silent as it continued on its journey, growing closer to wherever they were being taken. Hulgar sighted thatched roofs and stone fortifications, and a sense of fear and dread settled in his stomach. </i></span></div></div>",

Claire turned from the side of the rock, almost destroyed from the blast and saw flames, rows of ice, and lightning arcing in a large radius around Jacob's body. \"Jacob,\" Claire yelled as she ran by his side and flipped him into his back. Large wounds covered his charred, frozen body. The electricity causing his arms, legs and fingers to twitch slightly from time-to-time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C...Cla-\" Jacob began but was interrupted by a fountain of blood that coughed up from his mouth and dripped from his mouth. Just from his looks, you could tell he had some massive internal injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You went missing in the two hundred third year of the Fourth Era. By that time, you were twenty-six. So, if we do the math, you are about two hundred thirty-five years of age. That's quite a feat of age, even for an elf. What's even more amazing is that neither of you two seem to have aged a day.\"</span></div></div>",

She quickly equipped it, and left the room, her helmet was folded onto her upper back, appearing as just another part of the armor. When a young, off-duty soldier caught sight of her, he immediately blushed, stood at attention, and gave her a salute. His armor was different from the rest. Very flexible and appearing much more delicate than her own, with a maroon and black pattern on the padding.

Three pillars rose from the ground. They appeared to be made out of some kind of steel-like metal. He then handed Claire both of her old swords and their sheathes, which she immediately hooked up to her suit. She drew both Vedvenin and Faasnuhavnodun, charged the pillars, and in the blink of an eye, left two deep gashes in each of them. While her swords may not have cut all the way through, the cuts in the pillars were almost the whole length of the blades. \"Impressive. Now that that's over, I want to see how you handle a new type of weapon. Let's start with the hand gun.\" He tossed her a strange-looking weapon with an open end. A paper target in the shape of a person lifted out of the ground, and the pillars were lowered back into the floor. \"I wouldn't recommend pointing it at your face. Too many accidents with people looking down the barrel of a loaded gun and accidentally pulling the trigger. At any rate, try shooting some targets.

Apparently something horrible happened there. Nothing but rubble, as far as the eye can see. The wildlife and foliage have taken over what's left of whoever left all that technology behind. We've found things from children's toys to massive, steel war machines. Even found some working music disks, and that world. That world is much more massive than our own, but has the same gravity, and resides in a spot in the universe almost completely devoid of magicka. In all there records, there isn't a single mention of elves, except in their works of fiction. I don't know how those people got that far technologically without magic. Buildings and towers, some higher than the Throat of the World, all without magic. It would seem that centuries ago, those people feared what they considered magic, heretic rituals that supposedly conjured evil and pagan gods. Whatever civilization previously inhabited that planet, they're all gone, now,\" the soldier said with a somber tone. \"That gun is a surviving, perfectly restored relic of a dead race of humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awful,\" Claire said. \"Any idea as to how an entire planet's civilizations could have been wiped out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have any idea.

Jacob charged at it, bolted to the side, and swiped across the dummy's chest, tearing straight through. \"Excellent, also, your fangs can work the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded when he saw something on his armor pop out, it seemed circular as she saw it lead to a thicker piece in the armor. \"That is a GP-40 grenade launcher.

Jacob felt it's weight as it was placed on his back and locked into place. \"That is a railgun. Using magnets, it launches high-velocity rounds. Give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room grew longer as Jacob felt the electricity bolt around him and the gun before he fired it. It launched down the room and burst into a wall with a large explosion. The man removed the railgun and took it away. \"That concludes your training.

It's as big as he is!\" The Private exclaimed. \"But if you're right, and that's a woman, if she's hot, I'm asking her out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see soon enough,\" said the Lieutenant. \"It's the final round of the training session. When their are no more hostiles, the helmet on the suit will automatically deactivate. Still, though. It takes a good amount of strength and dexterity to use a HI-Laser rifle, especially a Model 19BR, like what the new trainee's got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End match, well done. Very impressive. All that movement and almost no collateral damage,\" the match room's controller said. Claire's helmet disengaged and molded back into her suit, revealing to the young officers that she was, in fact, a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya so,\" the Lieutenant snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I told you that if she's hot, I'd be the one to ask her out,\" the Private retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare for rejection,\" the Lieutenant responded just before Claire entered the control room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your paper-work,\" the training room controller said. \"Be sure to look that over tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're new here too, right?\" The Private asked. \"Wanna talk about your experience so far over dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer, but no,\" Claire said.</span></div></div>",

We'll contact you once we've fixed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Jacob said through the speaker without moving his mouth. The door to the lab opened as Jacob left the lab and saw Claire in the hallway.

They want us to rest up, so I guess we should visit it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Jacob replied as they walked down the hallways until they reached the designated room. A large \"RM-208\" was printed vertically on the door. Claire opened it to see simply two beds, a couch, and a table. Claire walked and and took a look around and noticed under the beds were chests of sorts for their armor. Claire deposited hers inside and looked to see Jacob just sitting there. She also saw some kind of device close to his neck. \"What's that,\" Claire asked Jacob. But she was already reaching for it and had her hand on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Claire wait!

After a moment of barking, she realized what it was. \"I'm sorry. Here,\" Claire said. She knelt next to him and began to place it back in correctly. \"Did that work?\" She asked, only receiving a whine from Jacob. \"Alright, how about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's voice came back through the speaker. \"Better. Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire laid on her bed as Jacob laid at the foot of the bed.

As Claire was heading outside to see what was going on, she stopped by the armory to grab a Model 19BR HI-Laser rifle, and a rail gun. Soldiers manning the guns were firing away furiously at something, and Claire saw what it was. A small, enemy formation heading toward the base. She hurriedly equipped a scope to her laser rifle, spotted a small, nimble enemy, and fired off a shot. Less than a second later, there was an explosion, and debris was sent flying, some of it landing in front of her. A soldier was firing off a rocket launcher, and wasn't able to hit anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me that!\" Claire exclaimed as she snatched it from him.

One even managed to fake being a hover tank pilot and take off with one of their weapons without them even noticing. I guess those things are surprisingly easy to pilot. They must be quite arrogant. Our navy is still in decent shape. The USS Nimitz, USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, USS Iowa, and USS Missouri, and a dozen missile destroyers are all ready for combat, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We attack at the soonest available moment. We can't allow that Emperor to claim another planet. We don't have anywhere to run, so it's either fight back, or go extinct. I say that if we go extinct, we go extinct fighting,\" the officer said. \"How many fighter jets and helicopters do we have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have full stock of F-35s on both aircraft carriers, and all of our F-22s are well hidden, sir. As I said before, the tanks are undergoing repairs, and should be completely finished within the hour,\" the soldier said. \"But we don't have the ammo or the technology to compete with these guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we still have nukes?\" the officer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but to attack with those is unthinkable! It would render the planet completely useless--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If our race goes down, soldier, we're taking our planet with us! We will not leave anything useable for those Totalitarian bastards! Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! Yes, sir!\"</span></div></div>",

Mobilize all units!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire quickly equipped her armor, grabbed her weapons, and hurried outside, where she saw nimble hover tanks that resembled the Imperial's Mk. II, and heavily-armed and armored heavy tanks. Massive air ships took flight, and soldiers were running every which way, trying to figure out where they were supposed to go.

Hammerfell, High Rock, Elsweyr, and Black Marsh have already mobilized their forces to combat this hollow Empire. Hm?\" He took notice of Claire. \"Why, if it isn't the good lady herself! If there is anything I can get you, just let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a gun for Jacob?\" Claire asked. \"He's in his wolf form for now, and I was wondering if you guys had any weapons you could attach to him?\"</span></div></div>",

But when he was defending Riften, there was a flash and then...That's all he could remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly felt something grab him. Jacob would've fought back but felt nothing as he was dragged and then held by his shoulders. He felt his legs and lower torso lay against something. \"Jacob?\" He heard a voice say.

Jacobs felt his eyes close and his body move when a flash caused him to regain sight. He was now in the body of a wolf.

You look over the stands of food, thinking about getting something for dinner, when a tall man in Ebony armor accompanied by a group of Imperial soldiers rush down the road, towards the entrance of the town. Filled with curiosity, you follow them. The group heads outside. The sentries in the watchtowers look to be alarmed. You follow the band of men towards the stables, where a pool of men have gathered, putting up wooden barricades. Captains bark orders, yelling out positions, and whether if \"they\" are getting any closer. In response, an arrow flies towards his head, finding it's target, sending the ill-fated man off his horse. A large horde of bandits appear, all in a sprint, some stopping to let arrows fly. The bowmen behind you fire a volley of arrows at the mass, striking them down with efficiency. You stand there gawking. You can't believe how bandits could form such a force without killing each other, nor have the audacity to attack this place. The man in the Ebony armor shakes you, \"Quit standing there like a fool, and ready yourself!\" You look back at the incoming army, and tense up. 'This is it. I'm finally going to get some action.\" And action you shall have. You are standing in the front of the defending force. One last volley of arrows flies. More bandits are slain. They are just a few feet away. You unsheathe your sword, making an arcing motion as you do, your blade meeting the flesh of the enemy's neck. He falls into you. You grab him and steady yourself as the next man plunges his dagger into your meat shield. You throw the body away, grab the now defenseless man by the collar, and stick your sword through his chest, bring it back out, raise your arm, and bring the gored blade down the the next man's head. His eye that still functions rolls back in his head, as you have cleaved through his head to the other eye. You drop the sword, not taking the time to pull it out, and take another weapon, bracing for another attack.</span></div></div>",

The bandits seem to be fodder, to spend the defenders forces and energy. You spot the man that seems to be leading them. Then, you remember that helmet the he's wearing. It's picture takes you back, into the past you strongly remember. You see your family's faces, then their hands rolling, severed by that very man's blade. More pictures flash by, but you snap back to reality. (ATTENTION: The entire next paragraph is back story stuff, not even about the current event. If you would rather continue the battle, skip the next paragraph.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know this man and the atrocities he and his followers have committed.  He's the very reason why you've spent training ever since the fateful day of the murders of your family, and the rest of the village. He's the reason why you've became a killer of evil men, although not a hero, disregarding justice to achieve it. You became a blood-lusting vigilante. When you realize you've become a monster, throwing away lives of innocents, just for fun, you isolate yourself, trying to regain your humanity. You finally gain your sanity back, and become a guard, after vowing to never again become what was the evil that you sought to destroy, and to protect the lives of the innocent. But that didn't mean that you would forget about that man. That of which he caused. The chain of events that place you where you are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou well up in anger. walking towards the man, then break into a flat out run, blind with rage. A bandit steps into your path, and raises his dagger, holding it upside-down. You catch is arm and drive his very own weapon into his stomach. You push him on as you run, A bandit clotheslines you, and brings down a battleaxe, barely missing your head. You kick him in the stomach, jump up, take his relinquished weapon, and swing horizontally, chopping into his side. He screams as the axe is then removed, and driven into his neck. You turn around to see the man you remember not even two feet away, holding a Imperial soldier by the collar. You know what he's doing. Eating the man's soul. \"YOU BASTARD!\" you bellow with rage. He looks at you, drops the man, dismounts his horse, and stares at you. Then time stands still. All but you, and the man and his followers. The man sheathes his war-axes, and begins to draw a massive claymore,  when one of his followers walks forward, and says in a deep, foreboding voice, \"I'll handle this.\" He comes forward, sword in hand. You glare at him. He rushes at you. You try to sidestep his charge, but he moves like a blur, tackling you. He is on top of you, and is about to plunge is blade into your heart, when you take one of his daggers, and shove it into his right shoulder. He is taken aback by this, as his victims are clueless and dazed at this point. You push him off and pick up a weapon off the ground. You swing at your assailant, and as the weapons meets his armor, the iron shatters, but leaving a dent into his armor. You then wrench his blade from his hand, as he is still vulnerable. You then take a mighty swing, and his hands claw at where his head was seconds before. The men in strange armor are surprised and appalled. But not the leader. He shows no movement, not a flinch. He then walks to you. You try to raise the weapon, but you can't move your arms. He stops in front of you. He looks at the sword in your hand, and you drop it. You then bow on your knees, and remove your helmet, all against your will. You look up at him. He steps back. Your marred face he remembers. He remembers his hounds maiming you as a child, and the execution of your family before your eyes. \"You...\" his raspy whisper of a voice says. \"Yes, me.\" you seethe. \"I thought you had learned your lesson,\" he spoke in the voice of a boy, \"that you shan't attempt to defy my will. (spoken with the voice of a woman)\" \"Your will is damnation, death, and destruction.\" you speak angrily. He spoke this time in what seemed to be a thousand voices. \"My will is law. It is order. It is what is going to save this world.\"   \"You will save nothing. You will only annihilate, enslave, and devour. You are not a savior, but a great evil. A monster. A disgusting abscess. Your name shall be remembered with hatred.\"  \" Hmm...I was expecting one of your long-winded speeches about how you will be rid of me.\" He chuckles, but pauses. \"You say that I shall be remembered with hatred, meaning you think you can kill me? I think not. I think you will be hated. For opposing the the cure for the disease that everyone carries. And for that, you shall join the others who had not followed me. Those who had not accepted their new god.\" He draws his blade, and runs you through. You taste blood. You feel pain. This is what you expected to happen. This is what you wanted. He begins to feed on your dying soul. Your vision fades... </span></div></div>",

Instead of just focusing on your character, other writer's/people's characters can jump into the story and interact with each other. I have only three rules for this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Don't be controlling over a story or end it abruptly. Let it play out into a new one or allow another writer to take a turn in it.<br>\r\n2. Keep the stuff in this from Skyrim and it's DLCs.<br>\r\n3. Have fun!</td>",
