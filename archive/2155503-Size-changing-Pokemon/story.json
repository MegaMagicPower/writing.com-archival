The world where human and pokemon exists or only pokemon are the only kind in the world? Reason for asking is that if its takes place in the world where pokemon and humans exist, then i would appreciate if its possible to keep the pokemon there to not speak to humans, unless they're psychic, in which case keep the communication to a minimum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the size changing pokemon exists the pokemon only world, then feel free to have the characters talk to each like normal.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Squeezing through a gap in the picket fence you left the berry farm with your prize. A trio of Oran berries were dangling from your mouth by their stems, swaying as you joyfully swaggered back into the forest. Setting up right next to the small agricultural town of the humans was the best decision you've ever made, there were cultivated berries of all types and a staggering amount of them to boot so you never went hungry. You may have had to dodge and sneak past the odd Pokemon that were helping the humans guard them, but it was a non-issue for an illusionary fox Pokemon like you. While you were just a small grey thing you made up for it with pure cunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking deeper into the forest you found a sunny spot to enjoy your meal. You were still feeling proud of today's heist. A Houndoom that was guarding the particular patch you were invested in stealing from simply refused to wander away to give you a moment to snatch the berries so you decided to do something bold. Instead of waiting, you decided to simply take the berries right in front of him by disguising yourself as a man that was tending to the next field over. The Houndoom was thinking none the wiser as he watched your illusionary human body bend down and pluck a few Oran berries. You even had the nerve to walk up to him and make your illusionary human pat him on the head! He acknowledged you and turned away to go patrol some other corner of the patch, allowing you to sneak away without worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the culmination of years of experience in trickery and deception that had made your illusions so extremely powerful and realistic, they perhaps even surpassed what a Zoroark could pull off. You were right to be proud of your abilities; there was only a select few Pokemon that could see past your illusions. Although, just as fate would have it, you could see one of them approaching you right now as you were getting ready to eat your food. Your heart sunk as you recognized the grey and black fur of the larger Pokemon. It was Mightyena, the forest's resident bully and he seems to be eyeing your berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as you might, this guy more often than not sees past your illusions. Having a keen set of senses and the experience of scuffling with you many times made him a difficult Pokemon to deceive. Still, that didn't mean you wanted to give him what he wanted. You felt anxiety welling up in your chest as he slowly approached you. \"Hey, small-fry! Did you get those berries for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Their mine.\" You defiantly muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad. I'm taking them.\" He said. Mightyena was a very intimidating Pokemon, especially since he had the reputation of being the most toughest male in the entire forest but that still doesn't mean he should get your berries. Your thoughts were darting between running away and suffering the shame of defeat or trying a new illusion on the off-chance that it might scare him away. Looking down at your small pile of Oran berries inspired a surge of determination as you remembered all the other times he stole your berries. You decided to risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have to be something big that would scare the likes of any strong Pokemon, something that would trigger their in-built survival instincts and get them to run away in fear. Not only that, the illusion would have to be <i>perfect</i>. Mightyena was still waiting for you to mutter a reply of defeat which gave you time to envision your grand illusion. You imagined yourself getting bigger, almost standing taller than the trees with your paws pressing hard into the forest soil. Concentrating with a focus you never thought you had, light began to bend around you as your illusion rapidly began to develop before the Mightyena's eyes. Your body quickly expanded and not a few seconds later you were at the size you envisioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, something was off. Usually, if you were using an illusion to take on the form of something else your point of view was still that of your original Zorua body. In this situation you should be hidden in plain sight between your illusions two ginormous legs, yet instead you were looking down at the Mightyena from a giant's point of view. Shrugging it off, you lift your paw and slam it on the ground next to Mightyena, imagining the weight the body would have and what sounds it would produce as its paw would impact the forest floor. A large thud echoed through the forest and you noticed that you could feel what the illusion was feeling, too. Were you getting so good at deception that you were literally fooling yourself now? The display was definitely worrying Mightyena and for a moment you thought he was going to turn tail and run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately it would seem it wasn't enough. Mightyena knows you and while he seemed shaken at first, he quickly got a hold of himself. \"You think you can trick me? I'll show you!\" He roared. Watching from above you flinched when he charged at you, fully expecting him to bash through your illusion and send you flying but all you got was a gentle thud against your forelimb as he bounced off of you. You were both just as confused as you tried to comprehend what that exactly implied. Testing, you brought your leg up and flicked a paw against his body, effortlessly making him tumble backwards a few feet as if he was no heavier than one of the berries you collected. Then it clicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour illusion <i>wasn't</i> an illusion. It was real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you had managed to make yourself bigger. The thought left you giddy as you stretched your head to peak over the canopy and became more aware of how the weight of your paws were making them sink into the ground. Looking back down you were saddened to see that Mightyena had taken the opportunity to run away, leaving you alone in the small clearing. As much as you would love to have a moment to fantasize on the things you could do to him at this size, you felt that learning about this new ability to be a more pressing matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of having to concentrate on the intricate process of crafting an illusion, you found that merely thinking about changing size was enough. You shrunk yourself to your original size, then made yourself shorter than a blade of grass and then made yourself big enough that the trees were only up to your ankles. The sudden increase in size demolished a bunch of trees at your feet as your stance widened and you shrunk down to your original size again when you quickly realized the whole town next to the forest could most likely have seen you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly it seemed your other random illusions you know weren't physically manifesting and no matter how hard you tried you just couldn't materialize that deluxe Poke Puff. Still, suddenly gaining the ability to change your size at will filled you with adrenaline as you considered that it quite possibly made you the most powerful Pokemon in the entire region. You were no longer hungry for the berries you pilfered earlier as you contemplated all the ways you could have fun with this new ability and you were keen to test if it worked on Pokemon besides yourself. And what if it worked on humans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away you were keen to test out this newfound power. You could finally get back on Mightyena for being a massive jerk to everyone, or you could go and find a way to play with the humans.... The possibilities seemed endless.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you slowly make your way back to your cave you let the blizzard stop and you look at your creation. It's a gaping hole in a small field, the only representation that a village was really there. As you reach your cave you shrink down yourself to your normal size, thus shrinking the village smaller with you, though the villagers don't notice. As you walk into your small cave you set the miniscule town on a ledge and look at it, your pupil about the size of the village and the chunk of earth that came with it.

One of the missing persons happened to be him and if you could at least find him one way or the other then you could bring her closure. You sipped the cold coffee a bit more, looking back at your bag. You'd only been out here for about a day but you already wanted to make back for town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the hell happened...probably shouldn't have come out here, stupid prick.\" You muttered. You told yourself one more day, then you'd head back. This was a crummy way to spend your extended weekend, but you promised your sister you'd try. You didn't know why...you were pretty sure the guy was abusive anyway. You went to get up and get ready to keep looking before you felt something odd...almost as if some eyes were on you. You turned to look at some bushes, not seeing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's way too early.\" You muttered, pocketing your phone and going to grab your bag. The second you did though, something wrapped around your arm and sent you flying into the air quicker than you could think as you soared, only to find yourself dangling by your arm, a rope wrapped around it. \"Hey, what's the, ow, ow ow...\" You said as your arm started to hurt and you looked down to see your bag...and what looked to be something riffling through it. Probably a wild pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey...hey! Get out of there!\" You yelled, getting no response. You started to grab at your pockets, trying to get your knife to cut the rope before you suddenly felt yourself plunging to the ground, the rope having unwrapped from whatever was supporting it, you gulped, getting ready for a rough landing as you hit the cold ground, the wind knocked out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laid there, groaning before a chuckle...a feminine sounding chuckle entered your ears. \"Wow, guess I didn't quite make the rope tight enough. Oh well, live and learn.\" You heard as you looked up, seeing dancing blurs of color in front of you. \"W-what...\" You said, reaching to your lip to find it bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, ow...\" You said, trying to sit up, though you found that your whole body ached from doing that. \"Wow, you're a tough one, aint'cha?\" The same voice from earlier chimed as your vision started to come back. You looked in front of you to see...a small black fox, with piercing blue eyes, and red tinging its fur...a zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" You said, trying to process things, that voice...pokemon can't talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That really all you got to say?\" The zorua asked nonchalantly, throwing your assumption back in your face. This zorua...wait, you also saw it was eating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's my stuff!\" You said, staggering to your feet as you tried to make for the zorua, it just grinned at this and hopped back from your feeble attempt to grab it as it casually had the bag of chips it swiped from you in its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad so sad for you, if I were you, i'd take that bag of yours and make for the exit to this forest.\" The zorua said, at this point you were pretty sure it was female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"Would that I could, i'm out here for a reason.\" You said annoyed, and the zorua sat down. \"Oh?\" She asked, a bit curious. You looked her over and pinched the bridge of your nose in annoyance. May as well vent to an open ear, and maybe get some info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey uh...do you just go by Zorua?\" You asked and she nodded. \"Can I show you something?\" You asked and she gave you a wary look. \"This isn't a trick right? You'll really REALLY regret it if it is.\" She said and you held up your hands in defense. \"No tricks, promise, I was just wondering if you've seen someone, i'm stuck out here looking for him...\" You said as you went to pull out your phone. The zorua approached you as you got down on your knees to her level to show her the picture of the guy you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...him?\" She said, not seeming so surprised. You looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you uh...know what happened to him?\" You asked and she nodded, looking a bit proud of herself. \"I sure do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please tell me?\" You asked, hopeful now that maybe you'd be led to him and you could just leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You reeeeaaaally wanna know?\" The zorua asked, smirking. You just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suuuuuuuuuure?\" She asked, you not noticing the more sinister smile she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I need to find him so I can leave.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well okay. I killed him.\" Zorua said nonchalantly, as if it were nothing. You blinked, processing this information. Zorua just smirked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" You asked, not entirely comprehending what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, that guy came out here, drunk one night and off his rocker. Pissing on my favorite tree and then when I tried to stop him he kicked me. Me! What a grade A moron! An idiot! A bad person...and bad people get what's coming to them.\" Zorua said ominously as she lifted a paw and crushed a twig. \"Just like that he went...ah well, I doubt anyone would miss him...that's what I thought at least, until you.\" Her sadistic grin ringing alarm bells in your head to flee. You staggered back from this fox, now incredibly worried about what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm hmm hmm, and now ya know. You can go home, right?\" She said, almost sugary sweet, you jaw hanging open as the Zorua seemed to be getting...bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you can't go home, nope. Not an option anymore sadly.\" Her voice almost seemed to be getting louder too as you couldn't tear your eyes from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a shame you came out here looking, but I can't let you leave here.\" She looked down at you, at this point her form looking as large as a great cathedral to you, the grin from earlier and her piercing blue eyes nearly making you piss yourself, you didn't know if this was an illusion, but you didn't care, you had to get out of here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA paw raised slowly, as if she was making a show of it and loomed over you, you shut your eyes, expecting her to render judgement before the great paw descended and pinned you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...should I dispose of you? Hmm? Maybe keep you around? I dunno, are you a good person?\" She was musing to herself, but she had already made up her mind as she looked at her prey. It was then that you finally took in your surroundings and found out what had truly happened.</span></div></div>",

But if that was the explanation, why the paw that was on you felt truly heavy like it was actually there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour agitated mind was interrupted by the sound of the Zorua's voice, who finally spoke up again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Tell ya what,</span>\" she intoned with childish, yet sadistic glee,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I'm gonna assume that you coming from that guy - may he not rest in peace - means that you're a good person.

Your sister will move on... eventually!</span>\" she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, realizing that you had no way out of this; trying to escape would only result in this vixen changing her mind, leading her to crudely dispose of you like she initially thought about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Ah, wipe that expression off your face, shrimp. Ya should cheer up, actually, </span>\" the Zorua gained a smirk while saying this, her azure eyes sparkled with malicious glee and her fangs shined sinisterly,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">After all, ya got yourself-</span>\"</span></div></div>",

She owned you...you gulped as you tried to look away from her, not wanting to meet her gaze, only to see your surroundings once more, towering over you. Even your bag looked positively mountainous. Why? Why did you come out here? Why did he come out here? How many-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Z-zorua?\" You asked, your voice clearly laced with fear. She smirked as she looked down at you. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Yeah twerp?</span>\" She said, in a confidant tone. \"H-how many humans have you had, or k-killed?\" You asked, afraid of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Oh? Odd question...well honestly, you're the first i've spared after I shrunk, so you really ought to consider yourself lucky. Other humans have either been like the guy you were looking for, trainers looking to catch me, or actually smart enough to give me a wide berth and move on from here.</span>\" She said, your stomach had butterflies as you had to swallow a sense of dread you had. That's when you realized how easily she could kill you now. With wide eyes you looked up and squeaked out. \"T-thank you for not killing me!\" You said as the Zorua lifted her paw off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Oh man, you are absolutely terrified, aren't you!</span>\" She said, grinning, showing off her razor sharp canines that could easily shred you to pieces. She lowered her muzzle down to you, making you yelp as you felt a large suction of air around you, she was sniffing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yup, you're mortified!</span>\" She said before she giggled a bit. You tried to curl up away from her before she offered you a toothless smile. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Listen shrimp, I genuinely need you to calm down. You don't realize how good you've got it! Do you know how many people or pokemon mess with a zorua that can change the size of anything at will? The answer is none!

It was then that a small thud sounded off near you as you looked up. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Take your damn bag, but know that any snacks from it will be grown and eaten by your lovely new owner~</span>\" The Zorua cooed. She had shrunken your bag...at least you had your stuff with you. Unfurling yourself you sighed, trying to calm your nerves before you reached for the bag and took out a bottle of water, opening it, you chugged it greedily, emptying its contents in seconds before you sighed and put the bottle in your recycling pouch on your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Better?</span>\" Zorua asked and you sighed. \"No, but it doesn't really matter.\" You said, at least no longer having fear in your voice. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Hmm, well you'll adjust, my little human.</span>\" She said. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Grab your bag, we're out of here.</span>\" She said as her muzzle lowered down to you. You grabbed your bag as you walked over to her towering face. \"So what do you want me to do?\" You asked. She rolled her eyes at your question before a grin crossed her face. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Relax, i'll help you this time.</span>\" She said, laughing a bit before her mouth opened wide, showing you her cavern as the face approached you much too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, don't eat me please!\" You said before the mouth that was coming towards you suddenly lifted and bit at the scruff of your jacket. \"Huh?\" You said, holding your bag as suddenly you went soaring into the air. \"Aaaaaahhhh!\" You screamed as you flailed about, landing quicker than you expected on something soft. All around you was dark fur....you had landed on Zorua. It looked like you landed on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yeesh, I expected to catch you off guard but you're so absolutely fragile right now. We're gonna need to work on that.</span>\" You heard her loud voice in front of you, almost felt it beneath you as suddenly, she rose to her paws, the sudden ascent making your stomach lurch. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Now come on...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

It's kinda refreshing...and pokemon tend to avoid me for various reasons, so I get a bit lonely out here.</span>\" She said, her breath wafting over you as she explained this on what you assumed to be her attempt to see you eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And honestly, that dude you were trying to find, you know he wasn't worth it, right?</span>\" She said and you sighed. \"That isn't the point...it was for my sister, he's her...WAS her boyfriend...he was a sack of shit but I did say i'd try to find him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Aw, what a sweet brother you are~</span>\" Zorua cooed down at you. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Though i'm sure she's better off without him.</span>\" Zorua snickered and you clenched your fists, though you were way too afraid to try anything. \"That isn't...the point.\" You said, sighing. \"And there's no way my sister is better off without me, right?\" You said, though the look in Zorua's face didn't change at your plea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hmm, well...maybe, but like I said, she'll move on! Honestly, two disappearances in a row, maybe humans'll wise up and just stay away for a bit.</span>\" Zorua said, raising her head once more into the heavens as she towered above you at her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"You really are a decent sort, aren't you? Well I just want you to trust in me pipsqueak, because we're gonna have the best of times together!</span>\" Zorua said, the ground shaking as she walked away from you to get your bag. She picked it up between her teeth and brought it's mountainous form over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Okay, climb in.</span>\" She said, You looked up at your bag to see an open pouch...one you were sure you left empty. It was at this point that another thought crossed your mind. \"You say i'm the first human that hasn't pissed you off...does that mean...\" You said and she grinned down at you, her fangs showing as you shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Do you really need me to answer that, my mate?</span>\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no, not really...though I do gotta ask, how does a Zorua gain the power to talk? Or change the size of things? Or...I guess that's it really.\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Eh, just came over me one day. Since then i've pretty much ruled the roost.</span>\" Zorua said as you sighed, getting ready to climb into the towering structure of your own camp bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! One more thing, when you say i'm your mate, uh...what exactly do you mean?\" You asked, not sure how you'd feel about this answer.</span></div></div>",

Zorua seemed to have a skip in her step...and this lasted all of 5 minutes before your movement was halted and the bag was set down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Phew, what did you pack in this thing!?

Oh...</span>\" Zorua seemed to be reacting to something as you peaked out of the bag, you saw the titanic Zorua's side looming over you, then moving your head a bit you saw a titanic Bidoof in front of her too...and it looked frightened as all get out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">B-bidoof? Bidoof?</span>\" It said with a bit of fear as it looked at the Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yeah, another human was here...why should it really matter though? I handled it like I always do...honestly, I don't know what you all would do if I WASN'T around...</span>\" This was a huffy side to Zorua you weren't familiar with.

You weren't sure if this was a usual thing or if she was just eager to mess with you some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Bidoof! Bidoof!</span>\" The Bidoof sounded grateful, but then it turned around and walked away as quick as it looked like it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">...Annoying.</span>\" Zorua said with a sigh before turning her attention to the bag. It was then that she smirked as she saw you peaking out, and you ducked back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Y'know, it's kind of a pain that you packed this bag soooo full. It's so heavy! It really is a good thing I have a trick for that! If not then I might have to tire myself out carrying this thing! Welp, let's get too it!</span>\" You didn't know what was going on, as you'd ducked back in...but it didn't take you long to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">THERE! THAT SHOULD BE A MORE MANAGEABLE SIZE!</span>\" The voice rang through your head as you clamped your hands to your ears, her voice now a booming thunder to you. You peaked back out of the bag to see something that truly terrified you...if Zorua was big before, she had to be the size of a mountain now! She shrunk the bag down!? It couldn't have been bigger than a small piece of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">SO UH...HEADS UP! DON'T GET OUT OF THE BAG AT ALL UNTIL I SAY! AT LEAST, IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!</span>\" Zorua said as a shadow cast over your world, her mall sized head lowering to you and the endless cavern of her mouth, with teeth as big as buildings and as sharp as swords surrounding you. You expected death, you expected it all to end as you were thrown about in your tiny pouch, trying to get your bearings while ducking down back in as Zorua sucked the bag to the side of her cheek, safely out of the way as she continued her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no time to rest as you clamped your hands to your head, and curled up as the world shook and a thunder roared around you as she hummed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only hoped this hell was temporary as you thought about your life up until now...no more work...no more drinks with friends...no more games, or sports...just a life with this pokemon of mischief...and one that wasn't afraid to shed blood should you so speak back either. At the very least she didn't seem to want to kill you, she even said you were her 'friend'. You weren't sure what measure of that made her care about your well being though, and you weren't about to test those boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with this thought that your world started to move once more as you rapidly started to feel a falling motion. She had spit out your bag, and you were at least cushioned when it landed by your own pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">ALRIGHT! YOU CAN COME OUT NOW!</span>\" It took you a moment to work up the courage, but you started to climb out, only to find yourself adhered to the outside of the bag by her...warm saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! A little help!\" You cried out, yelling as she tilted her head in confusion at your squeaks, but she eventually comprehended what you had said and looked at you, stuck like a little bug to her saliva, and she stifled a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">O-OH MAN! YOU REALLY ARE PATHETIC, AIN'TCHA? NEED SOME HELP HUH?</span>\" She was laughing, the roar now descending uninterrupted, your hands stuck to her saliva as you winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just grow me! Please! At least to the size I was at before!\" You pleaded as she raised a godlike paw to her chin in mock thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">HMM? YOU SURE? I COULD JUST KEEP YOU THIS SIZE Y'KNOW? I MEAN, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?</span>\" She said, as if she didn't see the issue, the grin on her face definitely betrayed her true thoughts though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please! I don't want to stay this size!\" You pleaded once more. It was then that she lowered her paw and spoke.</span></div></div>",

You want me as-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Can we continue this conversation after you've climbed in this damn bag and I've gotten far enough from pokemon who know me?

And yet, it was, and you couldn't explain how. How frustrating it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the vixen, she quickly had enough of your hesitation, and of the awkward conversations, and quickly moved up behind you, the ground under you quaking each step the dark-type giantess took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">In ya go.</span>\" she spoke quietly, her voice not carrying that mocking tone she used so far; no, this was pure embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get back to your senses to even think about protesting, you were plunged into the darkness of the pouch you were assigned to by your new 'mate'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, the whole bag began moving,  dragged by the Zorua from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Urgh, what did you bring along? I hope it's all snacks in here...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left flabbergasted by how quick this had escalated and gone out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came in these woods hoping to find your sister's boyfriend, but found his executioner instead; the same executioner who was now sentencing you to be hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in darkness and silence, which was only broken by the huffs and groans of the vixen who was dragging outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with your thoughts, you began wondering if you could escape. You couldn't care less about your size right now, you had to get away from this crazy, murderous pokemon that could kill you easily if you ever made the mistake of saying something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind told you that it would be impossible now, and you would only anger the Zorua, leading her to get rid of you for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, another thought retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zorua wasn't really paying any attention right now, busy as she was trying to drag your bag. Would she notice if you 'accidentally slipped out' of the pouch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould you take the risk?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thought left your head almost as quick as it entered. If you somehow got out of the bag you'd be left alone in this forest at a pitiful size, and if a pokemon happened to find you it would definitely know that you crossed paths with this Zorua, and it'd either finish you off or give you back in which case...she's probably finish you off. Much as it frustrated and frightened you, your best shot at surviving this was sticking with Zorua, and you did NOT want to be her next victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her grumbling outside, probably about how heavy your bag was. Truth was you had packed a decent amount of snacks, though you'd packed a lot of hygiene and grooming necessities, some survival gear, clothes...stuff you'd need if you looked for him for a while and even stuff that'd help the bastard if you had found him alive. You shuddered to think about how he went out. Zorua snapped a twig, but he was probably crushed and mangled pretty thoroughly if that's what she did...what a way to go. A part of you couldn't help but think it served him right for the way he treated your sister, and even you sometimes though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get comfortable as the whole world seemed to shake around you, with this gargantuan vixen that had decided to make you her...mate dragged you along with your bag to god knows where. It at least seemed to settle down after a while as everything was still and quiet for a moment...and it was then that you heard her voice. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Alright dude, we're home, go ahead and come out!</span>\" She said as you looked up at the opening of the pouch you were in. You gulped a bit, trying to steel yourself for talking to Zorua more, with a shaky resolve you started to climb out of the pouch, it taking a surprising amount of effort on your part. To think this was your own bag too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally managed to get out, before you felt yourself dropping a small distance. You expected to land harshly on grass or rock, but your landing was surprisingly soft...you looked down to see that you were on a blanket. Zorua looked down at you, a smile evident on her muzzle and a spark in her eye. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Well, what do ya think? Nice place, right?</span>\" She said, eager for praise it seemed. Though when you looked around, all you could feel was a pit in your stomach as you started to feel weak in the knees and shuddered a bit. All around you was bags...empty pokeballs...some discarded snack wrappings...various trinkets that must've come from her victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem to notice your terror though, just that you were quiet. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Speechless, right? See, even if you're absolutely puny and far from human civilization, you're still gonna live in comfort with your mate, so don't stress about a thing~</span>\" She said sweetly as you tried to stand up, feeling shaky on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...y-yeah...\" You stammered out, trying to figure out how to proceed from this. Zorua for her part decided to lay down in front of you, dropping to her stomach as her paws sprawled out from beneath her. This caused the ground to quake as you fell back down, and she smiled a bit. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Sorry about that, here...let me help ya.</span>\" She said as a paw reached forward for you. You nearly yelped, half expecting to be crushed beneath its immense weight, but surprisingly, it just reached gently behind you, making you stand up as she started to move you close to her face...was she going to eat you? You closed your eyes, but instead of razor sharp teeth and a moist cave, you were pressed against a soft and plush surface...warm too. You opened your eyes to see her hugging you to her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">See, this ain't so bad...right?</span>\" She said, her voice loud and close to you. You blushed a little bit too before you shook your head. This Zorua was a dangerous killer...one false move and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You're scared, I can tell, but i'm serious dude, I like ya...I know i've killed quite a few of your kind but trust me, they had it comin'</span>\" She said. You gulped before retorting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but all this stuff, h-how many have you...\" You started before she cut you off. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Oh? Most of this I just nicked off of idiot travelers or campers that never even realized I was there. They left my forest grumbling about lost or stolen stuff, but they left alive. Only humans that have tried to catch me or be a jerk have faced my wrath.</span>\" Zorua said casually. She then broke the hug as you stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you've killed trainers, they're just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">What, just trying to catch and trap members of my kind and force them from their homes to fight or be pets?</span>\" Zorua said, you looked down, fearful of her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you felt a stiff breeze as you were blown onto your back, she had blown on you. You scrambled back as she giggled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Couldn't resist.</span>\" She said. You looked into those eyes of hers, those large pools full of mischief and mirth, but at the moment, nothing malicious. She didn't see trainers as good people, but then there was your sister's boyfriend, the guy that got himself killed and you stuck here...that guy...you couldn't help but blurt out something that even caught yourself off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy was beating my sis...I know he was...I hoped I wouldn't find him.\" Zorua's eyes widened at this before she grinned. \"<span class=\"cplum\">It was a good thing I took care of him then, right?</span>\" She said. You didn't respond to this, but you stood back up and looked Zorua in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mate huh? Why me?\" You asked before her smile got gentler. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I told you, pokemon either fear or annoy me, and most humans aggravate me or are targets for me to pilfer. You were the second before my trap didn't hold...but you never once tried to attack me after that, which is refreshing, hell you even tried to carry a conversation...you're a good guy, and...</span>\" She blushed a bit. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Kinda cute I suppose...</span>\" Was she serious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true you'd never had a girlfriend, but this was NOT what you expected to happen. Was it worth trying? Hell, it wasn't like you could escape this situation...and turning her down may not end well.</span></div></div>",

In the end, you decided to reason with Zorua, since you quite certainly couldn't stay like this, shrunken and with a potentially murderous Zorua. What if she was just messing with you? What if she was just luring you into a false sense of security before actually striking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't risk that. But you didn't want to join your sister's former boyfriend either, so you picked your words with care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Zorua?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Whaddya want, shrimp?</span>\" she asked teasingly, clearly enjoying reminding you of who called the shots in this so called 'relationship'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... as much as c-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Don't you say that.

Anyway, I don't think it would work... us, I mean.\" you told with your heart slowly going in your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's teasing smile fell and she set an intense stare on you. She wasn't angry, but she wasn't sad either. You honestly couldn't tell how she was feeling, at least not from her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed, and a deafening silence filled the entire cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if her voice was coming right from the hell below, Zorua spoke a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Why.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she really asking that? There were so many reason, with the first being her being a pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's kind of... illegal?\" you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Illegal.</span>\" she parroted back in a sarcastic tone,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You think your silly laws would have any effect here, human dear?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you hesitated,<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua went back to staring at you in silence for a few moments, before speaking again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Let me ask you something,  then: who do you think calls the shots in this forest?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back, beginning to realize the real threat this Zorua represented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You?\" you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black and red giantess gave a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And whose laws do you think prevail here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">So is there any problem if I say you're mine?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">So when I say you are my mate, are you my mate or not?</span>\" she asked, and you knew this was the final question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you answered wrong, you feared you were going to end up as a small corpse on what basically was a giant blanket inside of a cave, a little bit of civilization, a home away from home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you hesitated again, for longer this time. You pondered which one was the correct choice of words and, in the end, you opted to reply to her question with another,<br>\r\n\"If I... were to say 'no', so to ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">How do you taste, so to ask?</span>\" Zorua asked, grinning while she did, showing you a full set of razor sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled at the sight, your face becoming nearly as white as her teeth, but the giantess suddenly started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Kiddin'!</span>\" she exclaimed, before making a poor attempt to straighten her face; the look on yours backed her into laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">N-No, seriously,</span>\" she said after a while in which your face gradually collected enough blood cells again,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">As I said, I like ya. Quite a lot in fact, so I don't think I'll get rid of ya.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's awfully nice of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And that's why I'll just kick you outta here at that size and leave you to wait for the first pokemon out there to come out and deal with your furless lil' butt.</span>\" she finished, causing the color to drain from your face once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiled in a somewhat cute way, and you wondered how you could find her devilish muzzle cute in such situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Of course...</span>\" she continued,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">That is if you refuse to be me mate. 'Cause, otherwise, you get a life free of responsibilities... except, of course, pleasing me. What's not to like?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would be right, you mused, if she wasn't a <i>freaking murderer!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you preferred this to the alternative and, since you seemed to not have any other choice, you did the only logical thing to do in a situation like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay.\" you said, lowering your head and taking a deep breath, not able to believe you would throw all your life away to start a new one with your next few words,<br>\r\n\"I will... I will be your mate then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Good choice, shrimp.</span>\" Zorua praised in approval, before leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shadow engulfed you and, before you knew it, the giantess was right in front of you with a grin on her face once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And wipe that look from your face. You should be happy, ya know,</span>\" she said, bringing a paw forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feared she would knock you back or mess with you in any other way, but instead she brought her paw behind your back and pushed you closer to her; black fur invaded you from every angle, except your back, which was pressed against Zorua's soft paw-pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I promise I'll make this great for ya...</span>\" she said, before briefly rising her eyes to the sky, then looking back at you with a grin,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Until you piss me off, in which case I can guarantee I won't be so great.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou adopted a frightened expression and made a mental note not to anger this Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, for the foreseeable future, you were stuck with her.</span></div></div>",

Eevee looks down and instantly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eevee,vee vee, Eevee~\" She continues to make her noise as she smiles in glee like she wants to show you something. She pulls away from your hand and rushes outside while still giving off her cheery tone. You quickly follow her outside until you caught up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, what exactly you want to show me?\" You said as you try to understand what your pokemon is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee gives you a gesture that says to cover your eyes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of a needy Vaporeon echoed throughout the house as you browsed your computer. Turning around you could see her sitting in the doorway, staring back at you expectantly before letting out another whine. With a smile you give her an exaggerated sigh before you stood up and started to walk towards her. What she desired was to go for a swim. Ever since she was an Eevee she loved swimming and it was no surprise that one day when walking her along the beach she suddenly transformed into the water type evolution. From then on her love for everything water only increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon flitted her head back to you as she pitter-pattered down the hallway, making sure that you were still following as she made her way through the house. Luckily for her, your house was situated rather close to both the beach and a large freshwater lake. She enjoyed visiting both places equally but more often than not she chose to swim around the pool in the backyard. While she had access to the pool at any time, she liked either swimming with others or having an audience. Today you were opting to just be a spectator. Watching a Pokemon swim around might sound boring in itself but that wasn't the case with your where Vaporeon was concerned. Her evolution gave her the strange power to manipulate water, an ability she learned to use in the most spectacular ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you reach a sliding glass door with your Vaporeon looking up at you as she waited for you to open it, her thick tail twitching behind her in anticipation. As you slid open the door you could hear her paws slap against the beige sandstone-bricked path as she bolted for the pool. Nearing the pool she catapulted her self into the air and leaped towards the water. It was like she melted straight into the water when she made impact, her body barely producing a ripple in the still pool as her form seemingly disappeared. Barely a moment later the water bent upwards as the form of her head breached the surface, her happy face beaming at you as she began her performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled up a wooden deck chair and sat as you got ready to watch her. Vaporeon was an entertainer at heart and always enjoyed turning her swims into a grand show. Every time she came up with new and creative ways to manipulate water, pulling off wild tricks and making fantastical displays. Eventually you started entering her into Pokemon Contests, her abilities allowing her to snag a winning place a lot of the time. For now though, she was performing just for you. You got lost in her displays as the water around her seemed to lose gravity and arrange itself in bizarre patterns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on to making watery recreations of different Pokemon she met you were awe-struck at how much her abilities were improving. Standing on top of the water as if it was frozen over, a water sculpture of a Charizard was standing looking toward you. The water she used was holding form so well it was like the sculpture was made out of pure, unblemished ice rather than a liquid. You were even more amazed when she started to animate it, making the Charizard move its arms, legs and tail like it was a living being. You watched as it stretched out its wings and braced its leg as if it was about to take off, and at that moment that it would have flown, the sculpture exploded upward in a shower of small droplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sparkling water trickling back down accompanied by a pretty rainbow, your Vaporeon was proudly staring back at you. You gave her a round of applause as she began leisurely swimming around the pool, her performance coming to an end. \"Amazing as always!\" You cheer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back you close your eyes as you decide to sun-bathe considering she finished her show only to be interrupted by her a couple of moments later. \"Eon!\" She barked as she tried to grab your attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging on to the edge of the pool she looked over to you. It seemed she still had another trick to show you so you stood up and walked closer to the pool to see what she had in store. The excitement on her face was palpable and you had to say, it was infectious. It was obvious she put a lot of effort into this one and desperately wanted to show you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she...</span></div></div>",

Taking a few long steps backwards she gives you an affirmative nod to let you know she was going to begin her new trick. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. For a few moments nothing seemed to be happening but then you noticed the water surrounding her body was acting strangely. The water started moving towards Vaporeon and seemed to continue flowing into her. You recognized that she was using water absorb, an ability all Vaporeons shared. You've never seen her use it in one of her displays before, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your focus went from the water to Vaporeon herself you noticed something was happening to her, too. It looked like she was getting larger. It started slowly but as you watched her double in size it seemed to pick up speed. You scratched your head as you watched. She had made a giant watery version of herself before but that was transparent and obviously artificial. This, however, looked more authentic. Her body still looked solid rather than liquid as it slowly took up more space in the pool and you swore you could hear a faint sound like leather being pulled. As her feet reached the bottom of the pool she gently perched her front paws on the sandstone surrounding the pool as she slowly opened her eyes and looked down at you with a satisfied grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of giant Pokemon always entertained you and you couldn't help but be amazed at how real she was making it look. The water level in the pool was dropping as Vaporeon's increasing size allowed her to absorb water faster and faster. You could just see behind her and how much space she was taking up in the pool, her tail slowly curling around in the pool as it tried to search for more room. Eventually she ran out of water to absorb and her growth crawled to a stop, leaving her about the size of the pool itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her growth finished, Vaporeon shifted her weight and adjusted herself in the pool so that she was standing, making you flinch as she created a series of small tremors. \"Vaporeon?\" She boomed as if to ask if you liked her new trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubt began to seed in your mind as you watched her grinning down at you. Her voice grew louder as well... And it felt like her body actually had a solid weight to it. You cautiously approached the giant Vaporeon. Her arms alone were taller than you the fact she was leaning over you as you got closer made you feel even smaller. Reaching a hand out you touch her ankle and feel the flesh on her arm depress as you rub your hand along her smooth skin. You could feel it - a healthy amount of fat and hard muscles underneath as you pushed down even harder. Solid, not liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look upwards to your Vaporeon in shock as you realize why it all looked so real. It was simply because it <i>was</i> - she absorbed water to make herself bigger! Your now-giant Vaporeon bent down towards you and your vision was obscured as something hot and wet brushed against your face making you stumble backwards. She softly giggled at how flustered you were before she exited the pool and stood at her full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when could you do that? That's crazy!\" You exclaim. She looked like the same old Vaporeon. Just much, much bigger. With a guess, you assumed she must be a bit taller than 15 feet from her paws to the top of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noticed another thing. The only factor that limited how much she grew was how much water was in the pool, so that begged the question... \"Can you keep making yourself bigger as long as you have a supply of water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon~\" She cooed happily, giving a definitive yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Was all you could mutter. Her body was already truly massive and the concept that she could keep making herself bigger blew your mind. The curious part of you wanted to see that though. To see what ludicrous heights she could grow to. Your thoughts were interrupted as her huge nose pushed into you as she attempted to nuzzle you. She looked at you expectantly with the same look she has when she wants to go out somewhere. It was clear Vaporeon wanted to explore her new ability just as much as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go for a walk somewhere, don't you?\" You say as you rub a hand along her cheek. Vaporeon simply nodded and lowered herself to the ground. She motioned her head towards her back and shot you that same expectant look. It took you a moment to piece together what she was asking of you and you broke out into a grin as you realized. She wanted you to ride on her back! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching her you place a hand on her smooth hide and attempt to scale the giant Pokemon, the water type leaning away from you to give a better climbing angle. With a bit of effort you managed to climb up her extremely soft body, holding onto her back tightly as she slowly rose back up to her full height. You let out a chuckle as she took a few experimental steps around the yard, feeling her strong muscles move below you. Vaporeon stopped when she felt you were comfortable and turned her face to the side to look at you. It seemed she wanted you to pick a location to go to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to narrow your options down to either the nearby lake or the ocean. The lake was surrounded by forest and wasn't that far from town. It was a fairly expansive and you think it would be interesting to see how other Pokemon or even humans would react to your giant Vaporeon. The ocean however also sounded appealing - you could only imagine how big she could make herself in an environment that was mostly water, the perfect testing grounds for learning the limits of your Vaporeon's new ability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon's large tail swayed to and fro as she awaited your decision. Where will you go with her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How about we go to the Ocean?\" You asked her. The corner of her mouth curled up into a grin barely a second after the words left your mouth and you jolted as she suddenly went into motion. Judging by her reaction she might have been hoping you would make that suggestion, quickly stepping over the fence of your backyard into a gravel alleyway. Already the sea was visible as the walkway descended a fair distance down to the beach, it's dark glistening water contrasting with the clear light blue sky. Riding on the back of your Vaporeon like she was a regular riding Pokemon like a Rapidash or Gogoat was definately a strange experience, especially since you could see right over the corrugated iron fences into people's backyards on either side of the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone always thinks their Pokemon is special, but as you gave awkward waves to stunned onlookers that were pottering around in their yards until a giant blue creature leisurely strolled by you reckoned that was especially true for your Vaporeon. Myths of giant Pokemon had always been popular throughout the ages but they were exactly that, myths and legends. It made you feel thrilled that your own Pokemon had developed a unique skill that would make suddenly make that concept non-fiction. As you were leaving the confined space of the alley it looked as if Vaporeon was almost as thrilled as you were as more and more people stopped to gawk at her. Whenever she passed by a particularly large group she might give them a cute nod or a flick of her large tail but she still continued her determined march toward the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took great care to tip-toe on the sidewalk and not disrupt traffic as she descended down the road leading to the beach but her effort was for naught as cars slowed to a halt so their passengers could watch the giant Pokemon pass by. Thankfully the road was short and soon her paws were sinking into the pristine white sand. The commotion of people eager to see what this huge Vaporeon was up to combined with all the beach-goers created a sizable crowd and you were honestly surprised to see that Vaporeon was ignoring. Whenever you were down at the beach with her while it was busy you would often find her migrating over to where the people were to show off her water-manipulating skills and put on a show, yet it seemed today she only wanted to perform for you. For now, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracefully as always she delicately entered the water, her body barely upsetting the small waves as they slapped against her her legs. You felt the cool water dampen your feet as she sunk down into the water and sensed the muscles on her back take on a different rhythm as she began to swim. Looking back you could see that she had already put a good distance between herself and the shoreline, the confused people scratching their heads on the beach getting more distant each second while her tail was snaking side-to-side to propel herself faster through the water. Guessing wildly you judged she was going as fast as a speed boat by how hard the wind was hitting your face. You were glad she was able to give you such a smooth ride over the water because you think you would have been thrown off by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just enjoyed the ride as she swam and swam, noticing now and then that your hands would randomly slip off of her coinciding with a sudden burst of increased speed, something that you were beginning to suspect was Vaporeon trying to discreetly make herself larger. In time, she slowed to a stop. Judging by how the land you departed from looked like a thin layer on the horizon, it was obvious she took you out to really deep waters. The waves were rolling wider and higher while the great expanse of deep blue stretched on for what felt like forever in every direction. It made you slightly nervous but the face of your Vaporeon looking excitedly back at you filled you with reassurance that you were safe. \"Va-Vaporeon?\" She barked to you in a questioning tone. She was asking if you were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her a nod she turned away and she slowly began to descend into the water until you were kicking your legs to stay afloat. Living next to a beach and having an extremely active water Pokemon made you a proficient swimmer but you still hoped she returned soon as you watched the tips of her ears dissipated beneath the waves. A large splash a fair distance away from you caught your attention. A mass of water seemed to 'fall down' into the ocean as if a large chunk of it were removed. Shortly after a large splash twice the size of that occurred as more water got removed. And then one twice as large as that that made the waters crash and foam. You were starting to get worried as you watched the turbulent waves try and restore the disturbance in the water level and felt yourself being pulled towards it until something soft and malleable pushed against your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water bubbled white and bent upwards as something incredibly large began to breach the surface below you. Like an island emerging out of the sea you began rising as the solid blue ground pushed harder against your feet, making you stagger as you struggled to maintain your balance on the rubbery surface. You yelped as you began to fall over but were relieved when your body came into contact with a dark-blue wall. In a style very unlike Vaporeon's usual grace, water crashed loudly down below you as it ran off her much larger body and as she raised her head higher and higher into the sky you realized that 'wall' you fell against was actually the ridge running down her spine. It took your brain a few seconds to compute the shear enormity she made herself as she had probably made herself quintuple her previous size, if not even larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer white frills on her neck whistled in the wind as she turned her head back to you, a smug look plastered on the side of her face. At a wild guess you assumed she probably grew to be nearly 100 tall. You struggled to prop a shoulder over the ridge of her spine as she carefully began swimming around the water quite slowly and deliberately. It was strange <i>before</i> to feel her strong muscles work as you sat atop her but now with your feet sinking into her expansive hide you could almost feel each cord of muscle tensing and relaxing as she shifted about in the water.  It was a testament to how powerful her increase in size made her and frankly, you were awestruck. \"Wow...\" You muttered under you breath as your admired her in all her enlarged glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon?\" Her voice boomed out. Even her vocalizations commanded a power about them as they echoed along the waves. The volume even caught her off-guard and she called out to you again, trying to talk to you again in a quieter tone. \"Vapor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" It took you a moment to try and decipher what she wanted considering you were still getting used to reading the facial cues of a creature almost twenty times bigger than you. \"Oh. Are you asking me what we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Vaporeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it was a good question. A few ideas did come to you, though. For a long time you've wanted to go exploring the ocean; visiting deserted islands or diving into hidden underwater caves. You often fantasized about adventuring through undiscovered places with her but never did though since most of the opportunities that came up required you to join a large group of other people. However, you were now alone with Vaporeon and her larger size would theoretically make traveling to one of these destinations a piece of cake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of larger size, you could also ask her to make herself a tad bigger again. Being in the presence of such a large Pokemon that was undeniably loyal to you was exhilarating and If you're out deep as you think you are, the sea floor is still a long, long way down. With plenty of water around for her to absorb you think that she might have been holding back and you were still quite curious to see how far she could take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon awaited your answer. The choice was yours.</span></div></div>",

You fell into the pool water and try to swim up to the surface. As you do, you felt a strange feeling on your entire body, but pay no attention to it as yoy got to the surface of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon, what in the world?!\" You said as you cough up water and try to wipe the water in your eyes. However, as you do, you notice something increadibly strange, you seem to be in a vast ocean. Confuse, you try to figure out where you were. That thought was interuppted whe. You felt a strong current underneath you. You look down and could see a massive shadow swimming in the water. What's worse is that its getting bigger as its heading towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicing, you try to swim away from the shadow, with no luck as whatever the shadow is, its much faster than you are. In one minute, the ocean rumbles as the source of the shadow surfaces and you felt yourself being lifted up to the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything shakes and your were daze and confuse as to what happened. Its only when you hear a familiar, yet extremely loud, noise that you saw what was swimming around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon~!\" Vaporeon, now far more massive than anything you seen, shouts out loud as she looks at you in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Va-Vaporeon?!\" You were confuse, wondering how you adorable pokemon got so massive. You didn't got a chance to ask her as you felt her swimmimg again. You look and saw what looks like land, except it looks familiar. It when Vaporeon got closer that you reconize the land as the edge of you pool. Its right there you realizes that Vaporeon didn't grew, you shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a simple movement for the aquatic pokemon, Vaporeon jumps out of the water and walks towards a nearby chair to set you down. Now on a more solid ground that wasn't shaking, you had time to question you pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon, you can shrink me?\" You ask, still having a hard time believing this situation. Vaporeon only simply giggles and nods to you. You were amaze and confuse that Vaporeon somehow is capable of doing something like that, though there is something that concern you. \"Wait, can you grow me back?\" You ask, fearing that you might be stuck like this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eon...\" Vaporeon gives a look that says yes, but also pouts at the idea, probably enjoys seeing you at a small size more. She then change her expression, mainly that she wants to change the subject somehow and wags her tail, indicating she wants to have some fun with you at this size. As adorable the idea might be, you are a little nervous of playing with her at this size. Then again, you are curious of this shrinking ablilty and want to see just how capable Vaporeon's power is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While being a fraction of your previous size was nerve-wracking, you were utterly fascinated at Vaporeon's new ability and you were curious to know to what extent she could control it. \"Uh, Vaporeon...? You said as you looked up to her. Your words got caught in your throat as you were still trying to take in her size, towering over you even while you were perched up on the deck chair. \"...So just how small can you make something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eon.\" She plainly said, making a so-so gesture with her paw. You just blinked at her. That certainly didn't explain much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Can you show me, maybe?\" You said at her with a slight blush. It was a bit embarrassing submitting yourself to your Pokemon and letting her have even more power over you, but you were eager to know just how far she could take her new powers. The request obviously caught her off guard as she tilted her head and stared at you for a moment before breaking into a happy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon!\" She affirmed, her tail lashing excitedly behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Phew</i>. You sighed as you mentally prepared yourself for your requested shrinking. You waited for Vaporeon to extend a paw for you to hop on so she could take you back to the pool, but it never came. Instead, a shadow loomed over you. \"Uhh...\" You could only murmur as you saw her huge paw hanging above you. Instinctual fear overtook you as it started gaining speed and rushed down towards your small form. You braced your hands above yourself but as soon as the paw would have impacted and crushed you, it seemed to meld all around you. Not a moment later it felt like you somehow broke the surface of her paw and found yourself submerged in what seemed like warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon used Acid Armour! Parting your eyes you could confirm it, your blurry vision able to see that you were trapped inside the middle of her liquefied paw. Looking up you could just make out the shape of a smug face staring down at you, but it fell into obscurity as it got blurrier and blurrier. Turning around you could see that the edges of paws were stretching out until you couldn't even see them, either. Before long you were left in a vast, weightless blue void. It was really quite weird to think you were <i>inside</i> your Pokemon like this but you held on. You just floated in the liquid for a while, unsure if you were still shrinking or not while thanking your lucky stars for your uncanny talent for holding your breath for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of movement assaulted your senses at it felt like you were being pushed around by gravity. The sensation was like being in a car or an elevator, a possible indicator that Vaporeon was moving around. It soon stopped and then your felt another sensation all around your body. The warm water flowed all around you and seemed to push against your back until you softly impacted something solid. With a wet 'pop' you found yourself on dry land again. Instead of the wooden chair you were on before, the landscape was course and rocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and brushing some of the excess water off of your body you decide to turn around and look towards your Vaporeon. Only you found yourself looking up... Up... And up until you fall on your behind from craning your head back too much. She was indescribably massive from your perspective as she stood over you, a cute smile plastered on her blue face. You've been to the big city before and the comparative height she seemed to reach blew the towering buildings you saw out of the water. Even her paws looked like they were hundreds of feet tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were trying to find another object besides the blue giantess to get a grasp of your size, your view came down to the hundreds of small beige rocks scattered about the place. Picking one up the rocks revealed it to be course, jagged and surprisingly light, just about the size of a large watermelon. Your eyes widened when you realized it was only a single grain of sand that made up the sandstone path around the pool. Your body was the size of a few grains of sand! The far off grass at the edge of the path was like a great forest and the backyard fence behind that comparable to distant mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched as you witnessed the god-like Vaporeon move above you and saw her lower herself closer to you, almost hearing the air being displaced as she did so. <br>\r\nShe seemed to be deep in thought as she gazed at you. Now would probably be the best time to speak up if you wanted to be bigger because it seems she's trying to think of something to do with you, although you <i>were</i> curious with what she could possibly come up with. Maybe you could join her and think of something to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You fumbled with your custom Pokedex and waited for it to boot up as you watched your Espeon quietly groom herself on the sofa. Bringing the small hand-held computer up and pointing it towards the psychic type prompted an image of her species and stats to pop up on the screen. It displayed exactly what you would expect; her stats, what moves she knows, her nature, et cetera. The difference with this Pokedex was that it could display levels over a hundred. The local Pokemon professor explained 'levels' as a measure of the Pokemon's experience and how strong they are, usually reaching a complete plateau at one hundred. However, as you waved the device towards Espeon it was displaying a value almost twice that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you first captured her as an Eevee it was obvious something was different about her. She defeated every wild Pokemon that came her way with relative ease and every fight she won made the consequent ones all the easier. She was so proficient at battling that you never saw the need to capture any more Pokemon for your team and after she evolved you beat gym leader after gym leader with her psychic powers alone. Curious, you took her to a professor and he confirmed that she somehow breached that level plateau and was continuing to get stronger. By this point you were certain she could give legendary Pokemon a run for their money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowadays you just take her to the odd battle tournament and live off the cash she wins. In this world having a Pokemon that can knock out any other Pokemon in a single move turns out to be a good source of income, although you do have to remind her to tone it down. More often than not she would accidentally knock the opposing Pokemon out in a single move and while it was impressive, the crowd tends to find it boring. Telling her to put on a show for the audience yielded good results and her showmanship even ended up winning her a small cult following. Quite often she would nag you to read off positive comments from social media to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally something like this would be something to celebrate and while you did enjoy the perks of having a completely overpowered Pokemon, a lot of strange things have been happening around her lately. Usually psychics can interact with the world using their psychic powers, such as making objects levitate. Espeon, however, gained the ability to take that interaction one step further. It was pretty innocuous you had to admit, just small pranks and tricks. For example one day she kept changing the color of your shirt between red and black randomly for some reason. It was a harmless prank but it deeply unsettled you how she could alter reality just by thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told her this and, surprisingly, she swore she wouldn't do it again. The only stipulation she presented was that she was allowed to use one specific ability when she learned how to do it. She refused to elaborate but you reluctantly agreed. Ever since that day she kept reminding you of the deal by chiming in with her telepathy, teasingly mentioning how you're going to love it. The mischievous look she always has on her face when she talks about it never reassured you, though. In fact, she had the same look on her face now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what level am I now?\" Espeon telepathically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred and twelve,\" you stated. \"You've gained two levels this week and all you've been doing is sleeping. You're not sneaking and fighting wild Pokemon are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a quick laugh. \"No, although I considered it since there's not much else to do cooped up in here. Can't we go to another tournament or something? I'm bored!\" Her forked tail thumped against the couch as she gave you a pleading look of mock sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there are no other tournaments in the area for a while. Maybe next month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed. \"Okay. That one ability I've been working on is nearly ready, by the way. I was thinking we should test it out together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You said as you set down the Pokedex on the table and let out an anxious laugh. \"I was just thinking about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm,\" she hummed. \"Don't be so nervous, though. I know for a fact you're going to like it. Admittedly, you won't at first but you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the rest of her species Espeons had a knack for precognition so you gave her words some credence. \"Will I, now?\" You weren't sure if her assurances was making you more or less anxious about whatever she had planned, though. She stared at you with happy eyes as she sat down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to find out?\" Espeon asked. It was then you noticed the red gem on her forehead was starting to brilliantly shine. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first nothing happened, then you noticed Espeon seemed different\u2026 Was it just your imagination or did she suddenly take up more of the sofa? Her smile turned to a smirk and she strutted over  and sat in your lap. She was definetly heavier and you could feel her weight increasing by the second.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith her body beggingint o stretch acorss the sofa it was obvious she wasn\u2019t her usual size.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cEspeon you\u2019re growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a chuckle in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou certainly have a firm grasp of the obvious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re too stunned to think of anything clever to say, mesmorised by her growth. She had nearly doubled in sized and was still. She left your lap and climbed onto the arm of the chair, her hindlegs resting on it. She suddenly placed her front paws on your shoulder, the unexpected and increasing weight momentarily throwing you off balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took advantage of this and pounced, pinning you down. She wasn\u2019t big enough to keep you pinned... you think, you weren\u2019t sure how pyshically strong she was, since she always relied on her psychic attacks when battling, but you lay there and let her lick your face. You heard her voice in your head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty surprised, but it\u2019s nice. Though I thought you were plenty strong already\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nuzzled your face, her head now larger than yours. You could feel her fur brushing against your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven the best has room to improve. And I\u2019m sure I could put on an even better show for all my fans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? You can already one hit pretty much anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue but this would give another way to play with my foe.\u201d Now her smile looked like a cat playing with a mouse. You couldn\u2019t help be slightly unnerved, even though she was friendly \u201cLike this.\u201d<br>\r\nShe put her front paws on your shoulder again. She was big enough to  engulf you now, you could feel a carpet of fur push against you. She was clearly bigger than you now, but you couldn\u2019t guess how long. Clearly enough to fill the entire at the very least. You tried to sit up but felt pinned. She winked at you. She didn\u2019t seem be exerting much force but had you pinned down. Just how strong was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to wiggle out, slightl slipping out from her grip, but when you try to sit down, she pins you down with one paw. She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah. Just how big are you going to get anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around whimsically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo idea. I\u2019m curious to see how big I could get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon if you keep going I don\u2019t know how much more this couch can take.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m fat?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no not at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just teasing you, you don\u2019t need to be scared. But I know if I grow as big as I can here I\u2019ll wreck the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed she said house, not sitting room. Just how big could she grow? Did she have any idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped off the coach and landed with a boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving got a full view of her you could now appreciate how large she had become. She was taller than you, and considerbly longer than tall. She doesn't  seem to notice your astonished reaction, casual moving through and navigating the sitting room despite her new size. She looked over her shoulder, noticing you wern't following her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we still doing this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sorry, I'm coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush after her and walk together. Hmm even at thise size you could use her as a ride Pokemon.... If she'd let you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reaches the door frame Espeon shrank slightly, enough that she could slider through ti with a little manuvering. You both get a short distance from the house. She looks at you  and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon's gem shone again, this time brighter than before. This time she made no effort to be subtle about her growth, instead surging in growth. In seconds she went from being about your height to doubling it. She loomed over you and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"From down here you look like a tiny Eevee!\"</font> Even though she spoke telepathcially her voice sounded louded, not as though she was shouting but as though even her mental voice had been amplified by her size. Was she doing this on purpose or was it a side effect of her growth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used to be a tiny Eeevee up to here. \" You gesture below your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly put her paw on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Then let's turn the tables!\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gem shone again and she surged upwards, growing bigger than your house. In seconds you were less than knee sized to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she plan to do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Espeon still held her paw lightly upon your head while she finished making herself bigger. Looking up and cradling two of her toes you were almost certain that the entire paw could cover up a large portion of your body if she wanted to but judging by the increasing pressure, she did. You tried to push against it but eventually you gently fell to the floor and she had you pinned down and softly rolled the ball of her paw around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this point It's probably more accurate to say you're like a Joltik,\" she telepathically joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully you were blessed with fresh air as she stopped pinning you down and looking up at her mischievous grin you could only throw your hands up in surrender. Struggling back to your feet you could feel the ground tremor slightly as Espeon took a few steps to adjust herself. She stood so incredibly high and was so large that it was almost awe inspiring and you had a strange feeling in your gut that she was holding out on her growth, so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched your head as you talked up to her, \"So, uh, what are you planning on doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle filled your head after you asked her. She slowly lowered herself until she was sitting with her two arms crossed and still she was towering over you. \"You're letting me choose?\" she said playfully. \"I thought the trainers were the masters in these types of relationships, I mean, you <i>did</i> capture me after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smug overtone made it clear to what she as alluding to. Many times you had let her do her own thing and she made a similar quip but this time it felt like the suggestion held more weight to it considering the sheer size difference. For just a moment you felt flustered before you pulled yourself together and spoke again. \"Knowing you, I bet you already had something in mind that your were planning anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we could make a trip to the city,\" she said and upon taking notice of your furrowed brow, she clarified. \"And no, I'm not going to go on a rampage or anything before you ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to counter her idea by saying it would attract a whole lot of attention but you had a gut feeling that was exactly what she was after. Scenario after scenario was running through your head and any elements that might be deemed negative could be interpreted as quite the opposite by Espeon. No doubt she would enjoy the chance to duel any Pokemon the police send her way and you figured she would find scaring people with her enormous size to be humorous. As you were brainstorming you barely noticed the psychic energy wrapping around you, suddenly jolting you upwards and lifting you up in in the air. After a moment of flailing, you found yourself being dropped down on the fluffy pink fur of Espeon's back and she wasted no time before standing up and setting off toward the city. From her back you could see well over a lot of the houses in the neighborhood and already see the city skyline in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get to it, then,\" she sang. \"At this size it should only be a quick walk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few massive steps she had stepped over the fence of your backyard and made it to the road, a couple of cars screeching to a stop as she blocked their way. Now walking the length of the road you could hear her paws crashing down on the asphalt and concrete below, her new massive weight causing it to buckle and crack. Even if she wasn't actively terrorizing the neighborhood you could hear people down below yell out at the sight of her and the fact she was taking up the whole road only made more cars swerve out the way. Taking a peek behind her you could see the paw-shaped impacts she was peppering the road with and the numerous amount of cars that ended up having to swerve out of her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really a good idea? You've already caused a lot of damage,\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, I'm good at levitating things but I still have trouble when it comes to levitating myself so the road will just have to bear with it. The last time I tried that I accidentally threw myself at the enemy and nearly knocked myself out, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only tried it that one time a real long time ago,\" you reasoned. \"Can't you just do it a little bit so you're not destroying the road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" she flatly said. \"Besides, it's not causing <i>that</i> much damage to the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by a loud crash after she veered off to one side of the road, her shoulder clipping a tall light pole and causing it to spark and fall to the ground with a metallic thud. For a moment Espeon stopped to look at it before she continued without saying a word. You decided to break the brief silence by asking her a question. \"Are you sure this is a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a fluke, I'll be more careful from now on,\" she insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left it at that. As much as you wanted to steer her away from her current path she was absolutely determined making it to the city and even as her trainer, you doubted she would listen at this point. Instead of reasoning with her you pressed yourself down on her long, luxurious fur and watched the scenery from your high vantage point go by. You could feel her much larger muscles tensing and relaxing beneath you as she casually stomped her way to the city and soon enough you noticed some of the buildings getting taller. One building in particular was covered in reflective glass panels and you could see Espeon happily walking along with a very small human hitching a ride on its back. It was a strange image that you would have never foresaw that you would be a part of but strangely enough you didn't mind. Even with the probable large sum of dollars in damages she was causing to the local infrastructure you felt that this might be a nice change to your lovable psychic Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while you noticed she was having trouble stepping over the sheer amount of beeping cars so you asked her a question while she carefully maneuvered around them. \"Right, so what were you thinking of doing in the city, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have used your social media account to announce an event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" you said as you fiddled with your pockets. Thankfully you had left your phone in your pocket and when you flicked on the screen the first thing you saw was one of the posts she made. Just like she said, while pretending to be you on your account she had organised an event at the heart of the city and before you scrolled down to read the rest you could already imagine what she could have planned. She could have just called for a meetup with her fans or perhaps promised to show off her new ability but there was always a chance she challenged the gym leader that lived in the city. Espeon always had a grudge against him since he declared that the tournaments she likes to take part in were a waste of time and you could definitely see her calling him out to a Pokemon battle to publicly shame him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe post Espeon made in your stead already had a large amount of reactions that made it apparent that an extreme amount of people had already seen the it. It started off assuring a grand event they'll never forget and scrolling down further she clarified in your place exactly what you, or rather what she had promised...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I bet my Espeon can wipe his team without taking a scratch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo boy. Well L.T Surge could be a bit of a jerk and a bully, and you wouldn't mind seeing him humbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, when did she post this? You had your phone in your pocket. Could it be when she had you pinned down on the couch? But you would have felt your phone leave your pocket. And could she have typed this in that small a window of time, especially while playing with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless.... She used her reality warping powers to post this.  Had she become even more powerful than you realized? Maybe she had been practicing in secret or hid what she could really do?  You want to scold her for disobeying but right now you feel like a Caterpie on her back. Besides you were curious to see where this could lead. He was kind of a jerk so maybe he was due for comeuppance. You just hoped she wouldn't cause to much trouble.<br>\r\nScrolling down most of the replies were amused or excited by Espeon's post, though some angry Surge fans had posted defending him.  Oh boy would they be there to? How would they react to your colossal pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon's paced quickened as she drew closer to the gym. The ride became bumpy, as you could feel her excitement in each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to, now looking like a kid about to enter a candy store<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" You don't know how to answer. You suspect it doesn't really matter what you say as you know she's going to do it anyway. \"Be careful Espeon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't I always?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The city might disagree.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gesture to the marks she left in the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph they should really build accommodation for a Pokemon of my stature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She put her head up pridefully and posed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Don't be alarmed.\" Her voice boomed around  telepathically. You're pretty sure she was doing that deliberately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"it's just me, albeit bigger and stronger than ever!\" Some people cheered though others slooked scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached slowly and sat down, stretching herself out across the street.<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid i'm not here to hurt anyone. Though I am here for a certain so called Lighting Lieutenant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and approached the gym and slammed a front paw against the wall. She didn't appear to put much effort into that strike but the building shook and the part of the wall her paw struck crumbled. Had her psychical strength increased beyond her size or ha she always been this strong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer telepathic voice filled the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" \"Lightning Lieutenant\" I hear you've been insulting  my favorite tournaments, telling everyone only wars, or gym battles or the Pokemon League matters. I'm here to prove you wrong, I'll show just how powerful those tournaments have helped me become.\" She gave the building another strike, shaking it again.  \"Come outside and face my \"puny power\".<br>\r\n\"Hey! Stop messing up my gym! I'll be glad to come and pound you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon giggled. You could feel some of the muscles on her back tensing in anticipation. Everyone could hear the sound of Surge's heavy boots.. Seconds later his burly frame emerged from the door frame, holding a pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok where are you?\" He looked left and right, not noticing the large pink pokemon a short distance away.  I'll crush you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon giggled and pounced,, landing right in front of Surge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crush me? I'd like to see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurge's gawked up at the enormous espeon, his mouth hanging open for a moment. <br>\r\n\"Those \"worthless\" tournaments have helped me grow as strong as I have. That and the love of my adoring fans.\" She turned to them and did a wink and a smile and some cheered back..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Right now I'd say I'm so powerful I could defeat your  entire team without using a single  attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurge bristled, suddenly forgetting his fear. He had instinctively taken a combat stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah wise guy? Prove it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a guy. But I'll gladly prove it.\"She bent her legs, assuming her battle pose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone please clear a space for me  and Thunder Thighs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurged shouted at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's lighting lieutenant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysics energy wrapped around as she lowered you to the ground. She gave you a reassuring look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hardly feel a thing but I wouldn't want you to get shocked by Thunder Thigh's  pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good to know she was still thinking of you. But she had already caused some destruction just getting her. If they fought here, you didn't know what she might do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait shouldn't you battle in a wider area? If you fight here you could do some damage to the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about it for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.. This gym is near the beach. I suppose we could it there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Ok lighting butt, lets take this to the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's SURGE! But fine whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her fans and swished her tail forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along everyone, follow me to the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked onwards to the beach, alternating between watching her fans and the road. <br>\r\nSurge grumbled but walked along and talked to fans. You had to respect his courage. Though maybe he was just acting tough for his fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven walking slower to mingle with her fans, Espeon still reached the beach first. She stepped onwards, seemingly amused by the confused people there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean you know harm I'm just here to settle things with Sergeant Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S L.T SURGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored him. \"Clear a space for us. And feel free to watch the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon waited for people to clear an area for them. Crowds formed around them. You were sure Surge has to be sweating bullets, but he still hadn't lost his bluster. He looked up at Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care how big you are! Fighting in tournaments is nothing compared to war! I don't need my entire team to crush you, go Raichu!\" He threw his pokeball and Raichu emerged.<br>\r\nWow Raichu already? Surge didn't normally start with his strongest pokemon, Espeon must have gotten under his skin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raichu!\" It yelled with bravado as it came out of it's pokeball. Then it caught sight of Espeon and ran behind Surge.  She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nL.T Surge was flustered. He put a hand on Raichu's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raichu don't be a baby! You know what they say, the bigger they are the harder they fall, give it a Thunderbolt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu hesitated for a second but put on it's best game face, standing up straight and facing Espeon. She waited to see what it would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RAIIIIIIIII-\" Electricity built up around it's cheeks and then it's body. \"-CHUUUUUUUUUUU!\"<br>\r\nA brilliant flash of lighting burst fourth from raichu, the light briefly hurting your eyes. Espeon made no attempt at dodging the attack, looking on with casual dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thunderbolt struck Espeon, electrocuting her entire body. However she didn't didn't twitch or show even the slightest hint of pain, in fact she looked bored, even as the lighting danced on her. Surge gritted his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHUUUUU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lasted about half a minute before the Raichu stopped and panted for air. The lighting cleared, Espeon was completely unharmed, the only indication she had even been struck was some of  her fur was standing straight up. It didn't even look blackened. She licked her paws, and tried to comb down some of it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe casually walked towards, looming directly above Surge and Raichu. Raichu shook and dived behind surge. Surge's face twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raichu don't be a coward you can take that oversized pussy cat! Use Body slam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu ran at her then leapt into the air, aiming to come down on her front paw. Espeon effortlessly moved it out of the way, causing him to crash into the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu tried another body slam, but Espeon merely took a step back, once again causing Raichu to crash into the sand. She repeated this a few more times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine for pity's sake I'll let you get a hit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't  move and Raichu slammed down on her front paw. She showed no sign of injury or pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow.\" She said in a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoisted Raichu up by it's tail, pulling it like a you. Raichu yelped as it was flung into the dangling upside down, as she slowly raised it towards her face. She grinned like a cat going in for the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm you know what they say about cats and mice....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu ran on air trying to get away from her, but her grip was too tight. He fired other thunderbolt, lighting up Espeon but not hurting her in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both know that wasn't going to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as though Surge didn't know whether to be scared or furious. \"Put him down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth wide, dangled him over and let go. He tumbled into the blackness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't really going to eat him was she?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu fell, its screams filling the airs, but it stopped midflight caught by Espeons telekinetic power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm scratch that, you look like your high in fat anyway..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted him out of her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurge was stamping his feet in the sand  \"PUT HIM DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't MY lieutenant, Thunder thighs you don't give me orders. But just this once I'll listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released her mental grip and Raichu feel through the sky. It first tried to flap his arms like a bird, then tried to grab onto something, but with nothing around it Raichu fell. <br>\r\nSurge and the crowd watched in suspense, but just when Raichu was about to hit the ground, Espeon teleknetically caught it and lowered it down gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu breathed a sigh of relief, only to suddenly find Espeon's paw onto of it. He struggled with all his might to push the paw off him, but Espeon pushed harder, still not putting much effort into but looking like she was going to crush him. He pushed as hard as he could and Espeon increased the pressure ever so slightly, looking bored while doing so. As it looked liked Raichu was about to be flatted she smiled at Surge grunted and returned Raichu to his pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter and cheers filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Private Pluse? See how powerful those \"worthless\"  tournaments have helped me become? Forget your team, at this point I could probably take on your entire army! Do you really want to continue this display? Though I'm happy to put on a show for my fans.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surge looked absolutely livid. \"Oh, I'll give them a show alright,\" he said as he grabbed another Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means,\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing it a short distance a metallic Pokemon made of screws and magnets was released; a Magneton. The three conjoined Magnemites immediately began to levitate and orbit around Espeon and Surge wasted no time giving them orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magneton, use zap cannon!\" he demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon's mouth crept into a smile as she casually ducked the first shot and it was clear that the Magneton was not going to relent as it continued firing electric bolts at her. The crowd forming the circle around the fight widened as she started briskly walking around the beach to dodge the attacks, her great size giving her a surprising amount of speed. Still, as large of a target she was, a few of the attacks eventually connected but she paid them barely any recognition. You weren't sure if she was showing off to the crowd or toying with the Magneton but she continued evading the attacks, her feet kicking up large volumes of sand. Eventually she must have grown bored and the gem on her forehead shined as she held the Magneton in place with her psychic powers. Suspended mid-air, Espeon brought a paw up to the Magneton and started flicking at it with one of her clawed fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clang... Clang... Clang...</i> On the last flick the psychic aura around Magneton vanished and it got launched down to the ground at Lieutenant Surge's feet. He quickly retrieved the fainted Pokemon and began fumbling for more Pokeballs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next,\" she sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just a fluke,\" Surge growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I doubt that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Surge sent out his next Pokemon you noticed that he threw not one, but two Pokeballs. A pair of Pokemon similar in shape and colour emerged from the balls, two confident looking Electrodes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sergeant Sparky,\" she chided. \"I didn't know this was a double battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurge ignored her comment and ordered the two Pokemon to attack. \"Both of you, use explosion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit worried when the two ball Pokemon began bouncing towards her. Explosion is typically a move used for last ditch efforts and usually results in the creature fainting in exchange for dealing a large amount of damage. Even though there were two of them, Espeon seemed almost amused as they approached. With one last bounce, the pair flew up and bumped into the violet fur of her chest before being engulfed in a bright glow. You and many spectators shielded your eyes and ducked for cover as they both detonated in a deafening explosion, engulfing the beach in black smoke. The dark smoke lingered on the battlefield and people were whispering to each other as they tried to guess the outcome of Surge's risky attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke slowly dissipated and you were relieved to see Espeon still standing strong. The fur on the front of her body was covered in black soot and a quick shake made most of it fall to the ground. Espeon chuckled, \"I think I felt that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What <i>are</i> you?\" Surge blurted out in complete disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just an Espeon,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurge had only one Pokemon left after he retrieved the two Electrodes and from the look on his face he seemed to know he was defeated, especially since his desperate tactic failed to work. Despite that he still threw the last ball and released a yellow and black Pokemon standing on two legs; an Electrabuzz. Once it gained its bearings after being released  it nearly tripped over upon seeing the large Espeon and looked back to Surge as if it was questioning his judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon sighed as she looked the electric Pokemon down.\"You should have just surrendered,\" she said as she raised a paw above the Electrabuzz. You jumped in fright as her paw suddenly sped towards it and crashed it into the ground, the force kicking up a shock wave of sand. The <i>thoom</i> her paw made was followed with an eerie silence as she kept her paw down but eventually she raised it to reveal a fainted Electrabuzz. Surge quickly retrieved it back into its Pokeball and kicked the sand at his feet in frustration. It made you feel slightly uneasy at how quickly and effortlessly she dispatched his team; even holding back, the amount of power she held over the other Pokemon was just too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You win,\" he begrudgingly said. Surge turned to leave before Espeon coughed rather loudly to grab his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you forgetting something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The badge,\" she said. \"You're a gym leader and I beat all your Pokemon, give my trainer a badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly found a lot of eyes pointing towards you, including Lieutenant Surge's. \"He didn't even participate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you watched some of the tournaments I take place in you should know that we communicate psychically,\" she said, winking at you. \"He told me what moves to do. I admit, I did some improv here and there but he's still the trainer that called you out and beat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of that was right, you do actually tell her what move to use psychically but you usually use it as an excuse to let Espeon take some creative liability during the fights. It was an aspect that gave you your own persona of being silent and calculating at  the tournaments and you enjoyed it since not many people bothered you because of it. In this case, though, you weren't sure if you deserved the badge but it was clear that Espeon merely brought it up to further attack Surge's pride. The massive smug grin she was sporting was proof of that. Surge rolled his eyes and started digging deep into his pockets, eventually finding one in hidden away in his shirt. When he approached to hand you the badge you had to crane your head up as you accepted the Thunder badge from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the badge you pocketed it and watched as Surge silently removed himself from the beach, his head hanging low in defeat as his fans rushed to his side. Meanwhile, Espeon looked <i>very</i> pleased with herself; it was clear that she wanted to do something like this to him for a long time. With the battle over, many of the spectators moved in closer to her and some even dared to pet the fur on her legs, the confidence of the crowd urging even more onlookers to be courageous and get a closer look. Espeon was practically basking in the attention the people were giving to her but you were more concerned about the large group all keeping a serious gaze on her from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were people in police uniform and riot gear cautiously watching on. Pokemon of every shape and size were standing by their side and from their demeanor, you assumed they were poised and ready to strike on a moments notice. You couldn't blame them for being wary, it was almost expected that the authorities would quickly catch on to a giant Pokemon entering the city and deploy to meet it but that didn't mean their presence wasn't making you nervous. The giant Pokemon was yours, after all. The possibility they might close in and attempt to subdue Espeon crossed your mind but given her performance in the battle against Lieutenant Surge, you were more worried for them rather than her. Your attention was taken away from them as Espeon spoke to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun!\" she beamed. \"And we got you a nice shiny badge, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I deserve it, you did everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, \"you were my moral support. Hey, speaking of badges, we should definitely go challenge the other gyms. Think about it; it would give us something to do while we wait for tournament season to come around again and we can go and travel around like we used to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true. You never really bothered with the whole gym scene but it would be a good way to spend some time with your new and improved Espeon as you journeyed the countryside. If anything, it would be more of a comfy tour around the region rather than some horrible gauntlet of challenges thanks to her immense powers. \"Maybe,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered it for a while before you noticed that the police squad had discreetly moved in closer and you were fairly certain that you even saw a tank or some armored vehicle behind all the police and Pokemon. You had to calm yourself down as you realized that they probably wouldn't try anything with the large crowd surrounding Espeon but their presence was still concerning. Espeon seemed oblivious as she mingled with the large crowd and she even sat down and let a few of them climb onto her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene was oddly wholesome if you ignored the powder cache waiting to blow just behind her. You just hoped the crowd would deter them from doing anything silly. What is it you decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't want to  cause too much destruction but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully their just here about the potholes you made through the city.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glowers at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they brought a tank for that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tank and cars drew closer. Espeon's crowd of fans looked tense, muttering among themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they don't know what you're like or what you're capable of, and have probably never seen a Pokemon of your size. But let's try and talk things out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but if this goes sideways  I'm grabbing you and clearing an escape route. I don't need to seriously hurt anyone, if I overturn that tank and a few cars I should be able to sprint away ith you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets hope it doesn't come to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were almost upon you and Espeon . You step forward and hold your hands up<br>\r\n\"Don't shoot! She's with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon looked att he crowd for a moment and they stepped back, watching on nervously. You wonder what she said to them. Hopefully that things we're going to be OK and to clear away if they wern't. Though she was never prepared for failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vehicles stopped, but tension still hanged in the air. Espeon kept her stance, as though she was expecting an attack.  A moment later a green haired lady emerged from the police car, holding a megaphone. Other Officer Jenny? Did they grow them in cloning vats or something? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Officier Jenny glared at you and shouted through the megaphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you own this pokemon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon looked at you expectantly One could only imagine how she'd react if you said yes. But you also couldn't say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... We're partners.\" Phew. Dodged a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is she so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh she had recently discovered a new ability and we were testing it out. Sorry about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's stern face soured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how much damage she caused?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I avoided hurting anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny seemed momentarily surprised Espeon could respond to her, but took it in stride. Had she encountered a talking pokemon before? She looked at Espeon with the same scolding look she was giving you. If she was at all intimidated by Espeon's size, she was a doing a great job hiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You caused thousands of Pokedollars worth of damage to the city! Damage to the road, the and some of the buildings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Espeon a quick, dirty sideways eye. \"I told you to be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hissed. \"I'm still new at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow wasn't the time to argue you with her. You turned back to Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry officer. We'll try to be more careful next time. Is there anything we can do to make up for this? We aren't here to cause trouble, we're just here for Espeon's fans and maybe some pokemon battles, but we'll try and keep it out of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny let out a sigh and her shoulders relaxed.. She was still tense but didn't seem as as angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I can tell you didn't do this maliciously but you still did hundreds of thousands of pokedollars of damage and it will take us a while to fix the damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Give us a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at espeon. She actually looks sheepish for a second. Huh, you don't remember the last time you saw her look that way.  You hear her voice in your head and you're sure she's only speaking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I know a made mess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An expensive mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I do make a lot of money\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck up her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might even say I'm the breadwinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically we both are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph. Anyway what if we didn't have to pay hundreds of thousands of Pokedollar to fix the city. What if I used my \"other\" powers.\" That smile returned to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know....\"  You were worried what she could do with them, especially if they had got any stronger and what if she did damage further damage using them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile didn't leave her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that or empty our coffers, if we even have enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It's obvious she wanted an excuse to use them again, but did you have a choice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say a pokemon trainer has to trust their pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat felt like a cheap shot. But she had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok but be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't I always?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I usally am, I just got carried away today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you don't get carried away this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon looked back at Jenny and the vehicles assembled. She projected her thought speech out to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine officer what if I was to repair you good City?\"  Oh boy she was trying to turn on the charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could Espeon be so sure of a power she had never used before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok but no funny business and be careful with the city time!\" She had to have stones talking your Espeon like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pay attention to all you little people.\" She flashed a winning smile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away from Officer Jenny \"Espeon are you sure about this? How are you even going to walk through the city without causing more damage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already thought of that.\" She said impatiently, as though it should have been obvious to you. \"I  didn't want to use telekinesis to lift my entire body, but If I just lift my paws slightly I should be able to avoid making imprints in the road. Let me practice first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashed that same smile to the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment officer! I'm just going to use my power so I can walk through the city, please do not be alarmed.\"  Espeon's gem glowed. Some of the vehicles affixed their weapons on her but Jenny held her arms out. Espeon concentrated and jer paws glowed. She took a small step forward, making a thinner imprint in the sand  han before. Her gem glowed again  and she took another step, barely marking the sand. As per usual Espeon looked satisfied with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Nothing to it. Now let's clean this place up.\" She picked you up in her aura and lifted you onto her back and headed towards the city. Even with the impacts of her steps reduced, you could still feel a strange spring in her step...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Espeon moved back into the city and quickly returned to the road she took to get to the beach. You heard no cracks coming from the asphalt as she stepped on it this time but leaning to the side from her back you could still see many paw-shaped potholes she made in the road. With Espeon craning her head down and focused on it you saw the cracked rubble begin to shake, bounce and levitate before they all started joining together, even the paint of the road lines seamlessly coming back. Officer Jenny walked to where the hole once was and cautiously poked at the area with her foot before giving Espeon the thumbs, quickly backing off and joining the formation of officers and Pokemon stalking just behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know you could do that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, just did,\" she simply said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetracing her steps, Espeon moved throughout the city and continued working on fixing all the damage she had done and from the look of things, that was a lot. Getting deeper into the city, around where Surge's gym was, you began to see a myriad of flashing orange lights and high visibility vests. The city council was out in full force trying to fix the damage to the roads and getting traffic moving again. From how many of the workers threw their hands up at upon seeing Espeon showed they were more annoyed at her returning than anything else. They were still too intimidated by impede her approach and stood to the side to watch, however, they were pleasantly surprised when they noticed she was somehow repairing the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Espeon eventually sped up until she was just casually walking across the city again and was starting to leave the police in the dust. For a moment you suspected she was pulling a runner but looking behind you noticed that all the potholes and cracks in the road had been mended as good as new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got good at that quick,\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, almost easy as just thinking about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike earlier you found yourself idly resting on her back as she made her way through the city, this time repairing all the damage in her path as if she was on some sort of reverse-rampage. You guessed that both everyone and yourself was very lucky that she was so friendly despite her mischievous streaks. On top of being able to turn herself into a giant she could alter the things around her with a passing thought; it was scary to think what would have happened if a malicious Pokemon possessed the powers she had. As if sensing your thoughts, she spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, so why don't you like the idea of me using all my powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, well,\" you stuttered, caught off guard. \"I mean you're pretty strong and I've never heard of any other Pokemon that can do the things you can. Maybe legendary Pokemon, but most of what we know about them could just be myth. I don't really understand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe <i>I'm</i> a legendary Pokemon,\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed, \"maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't abuse them if that's what your worried about,\" she explained. \"And from now on, if i'm not sure if I can fix it, I won't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said, rubbing the long fur on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly noticed but Espeon was starting to enter the suburbs again and the police were starting to catch up after being free from the congested traffic of the city. The size of their group was very diminished and even lacked the heavy weaponry you saw before. You assumed it was thanks to Espeon fulfilling her promise of repairing the city which might have gained the trust of Officer Jenny. After a while she stopped at a familiar light pole she accidentally tackled and it was a spectacle seeing the metal pole upright itself and stick down into the ground, the light briefly flickering as she turned away from it. As she continued walking, though, you noticed something else strange. You remembered what the sight looked like from her back when you were coming into the city and this looked different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her walk you focused and felt the sensation of slowly going up, just the same as being on an elevator. When you became aware of that that her back felt a bit more spacious and her fur seemed a bit longer. You had to bring it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you making yourself bigger?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to be discreet but I'm surprised you didn't notice earlier,\" she chuckled, stopping her growth. It might have been a little game she was playing with you to pass the time but you weren't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you were silent before you posed her a question about this whole scenario. \"So why do you want to be bigger, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother silence followed as she thought about how to reply. \"I know it sounds conceited but I'm not a normal Espeon; I'm different, powerful. I kind of felt like my normal size was a bit inadequate, like I was fit to burst out of my skin or something. I feel a lot more comfortable like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon laughed for a second. \"Besides, the face you made when I first showed you this was worth it. This is really fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I bet you like all the attention, too, don't you?\" you chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slightly caught of guard about how aware she was of her 'over-leveling' situation but how she explained it put you a bit more at ease. Using her powers to turn herself into a giant was just a way of her expressing herself, as strange as it sounds. Continuing along the road the both of you arrived back home. As she turned around you noticed the road was fixed to perfection and waited for the police to catch up. Officer Jenny arrived in a brisk jog and was hardly phased by the run Espeon made them do. Without breaking a sweat she pointed a finger up at Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fixed everything as promised. I'm thankful for your cooperation but what you did still inconvenienced a lot of people and while I don't fully trust you let, I will let you off with only a single warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief, glad that you dodged a hefty fine but it was clear the two of you weren't completely off the hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we're going to leave you alone but I've let every department in the region know about you two and we're at the ready if you try anything, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the both of you solemnly said. With that she turned around and started walking back to the city, the leftover police forces following close behind. The both of you waited until she was a fair distance away until you spoke to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that was a thing,\" Espeon said. \"Hey, do you think they would care if I crush a few houses if I repair them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you blurted out at the random question. \"Of course. I'm definitely sure they would a hundred percent <i>not </i>like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are demolition jobs, but I'm not sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can ask if they want help!\" she interrupted. \"Come on, it's a change from doing tournaments and sitting around all day, huh, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earlier you wanted to go challenge all the other gym leaders,\" you pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Well, we can do either! I don't mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of a giant Espeon shoulder-tackling a huge building and wrecking it was oddly amusing as you pictured it in your head and if you got the right permissions it would be totally legal, to boot. You also recalled her offer from before about touring the region to challenge the gym leaders and considered talking to her about that again, especially since you cleared that whole altercation with the police. It was plain to see that Espeon had many activities she wanted to do now that she was letting loose with her powers. The demolition thing just might have been one of her attempts at trying to shoot suggestions at you to see what sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking at you expectantly just like on the beach. Even though she had most of the power in the relationship she still wanted to make sure you were enjoying yourself, too. It was a nice feeling. What do you decide to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well considering she did such a good job repairing the city you saw no harm in letting her have some fun, especially if it could help the city. Hopefully she would actually be careful this time. She did seem to be trying to consider your feelings. Though you still wonder if she'd go off and do it anyway if you said. All the more reason to agree so you can watch her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure but-\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon rolls her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful. I know. I'm still experimenting but I'm not going to demolish the entire city\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it bared repeating\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon turned around slowly, facing officer Jenny again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good police officer I am sorry for the trouble we have caused but I had an idea how to help your fair city.\". You try with all your might to avoid rolling your eyes. Espeon was really trying to turn on the charm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What do you have in mind?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it occurs to me a city like this must have some buildings due for demolition and at my current size I'm sure I can do much to help your fair city.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny narrowed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking my permission to knock down buildings?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not any old buildings, I'm not some rampaging beast.\" You're relieved she didn't want to act out a b movie. Or if she did, she wasn't silly enough to be open about that. \"Just ones that needed to be knocked down.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny thought about it and looked carefully at Espeon, who was doing her best angel face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. I guess it would save a lot of time and money. BUt are you sure you can do this safely? \"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.. I think I should give test you before letting you to town. There\u2019s a rundown apartment store on 3rd street due for demolition. The areas has  been cleared so it should be safe to It down.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly, good officer.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny lead the way and your espeon followed behind. Although Espeon was playing it cool, you could feel some of her fur sticking up and the buzz in her softened steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking forward to this aren\u2019t you?\u201d You said quietly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhhhh\u201d  She said in private thought speech. \"If they catch on they might get the wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stopped at a dilapidated, dirty looking building.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the place.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon regarded it with amusement. She took a second to figure out the best approach, then brought her paw down on the right side, like she did with Surge\u2019s gym, only applying much more force, taking off a good part of the building, while shaking the rest. She smirked but you\u2019re not even sure that was her full strength. She did the same with her other paw, causing more to crumble off, then you could see the light of her gem shine. The building glowed, including the pieces she had taken off, it lifted off the ground then crumpled and compressed as though she was crushing something much smaller in her palm. She lowered it back down, leaving only the ruins of the building in a surprisingly neat pile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Jenny stared blankly. Then she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that was very impressive. Ok you got the job.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon did her best low key smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you good officier.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll get you in touch with someone and draw you up a list. They can show you which ones to knock down. But we're stil keeping an eye on you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon lowered herself and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Thank you very much.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to long after, Jenny came back with a list of addresses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go. Only stick to these buildings. We still have our eyes on you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i know. I'll do this city proud.\" Espeon said. You felt like rolling your eyes again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou skimmed the list forr the nearest buildings around you, then she took it off you with telekenesis. She waked through the city again, but for a second took her eyes off the road, glancing att he list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh this one is near by.\", almost forgetting to watch her steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly walks to the first address. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon!\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry was just looking forward to this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the first building, another delipidated apartment like the first. Espeon looked around, seeing if anyone was watching her and seemed relived when no was around. She smiled and looked at the building like a cat holding a mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lashed the building with her tail, tearing off some of the roofing, then she slammed the bottom part with her hip, enjoying the building giving way to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did that hurt at all?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange, her body still seemed as soft as ever. Was this because of her size, her level or her other abilities? Either she was still at work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon lightly jabbed the     building, a few times, knocking out some windows, purring all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels so freeing! Like living one of those cheesy b movies\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around gave the building a kick with her back legs. A part of the building snapped off and the entire thing fell, Espeon laughed and dusted herself off with her paws, then used her psychic powers to move more dust off her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice technique.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you What's next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one was a house. She seemed disappointed for a moment that it was so much smaller than her last two, but she sat down next to it, delighting that she towered over it. Sitting down it barely came to her lower legs. No it was smaller than that.. wait was she making herself bigger again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you noticed?\" She teased <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe  swung her tail, delighting it as it smashed through the glass, and took a side of the building off. Even at her size, you were surprised this didn't hurt her. She then swung her paws again, started with slow strikes chipping off a bit of time, then brought the full force of her paws down, smashing the house to bits. She smiled at her work, then began cleaning it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your really getting into this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it feels good I have a chance to finally cut loose.. within reason of course. Mmm in fact....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at you and began growing again, this time not even trying to be subtle about it. You could see a gleam in her eyes as everything got smaller compared to her and as you became smaller than one of her eyes you couldn't help feel a certain sense of awe, only further her delight. She grew until she was higher than most of the buildings in the city, and fit  tightly between them <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>\"Now this feels good.\" </b></font> Her mental voice boomed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ss the booming effect really necessary?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed <br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n\"No but I like it. Do you think I'm stronger than a legendary now?\" </font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless they can grow or are monster movie size probably. How are you going to get around the city now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"I'll manage, I'm getting the hang of this. Why don't you take a front row seat?\" </font></b>She mentally lifted you off her back and onto her head. Looking down you were surprised at how much of the city you could see. The skyline was certainly clearer from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked, no strutted through the city with surprising grace, but she still didn't crush anything when she walked, and did place her paws away from cars. This didn't stop people stopping to look at her and some from panicking. She tried to reassure them with her thought speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"It's ok, I mean you no harm, I'm just doing some work for your fair city.\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to her ears, trying to keep your balance, though you have a lot of room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're trying to be careful and having fun, but don't you think you're going overboard? Even if you're trying not to hurt anyone or break anything they won't know that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"But I feel so free!\" </b>She looked down, noticing it was more of a struggle to move through the city and almost stepping on a car. <b>\"Hmm maybe I'll see after i do a few more items on the list.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach another item on a list. A house. At this point she positively towards over it and brings her paw down, which almost match's it in size. You have no doubt if she had aimed true she would have smashed it in one strike, but either by accident or on purpose, she was just a little to the left, still managing to take a good chunk off. She brings her other paw down and flattens it, grinning as it shatters into pieces. She waits a second, still looking at the destruction, then finally cleans up her mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I can feel your unease but we'll be finished soon. Unfortunately.\" </b></span></div></div>",

Despite her increasing size, she was getting better at weaving between buildings and roads, though of course any car would veer out of the way of your towering Pokemon.

Ok you're free to go, just be more careful, you can do a lot damage at the size even without meaning to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny drove off and Espeon turned to you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"So where to now?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHe was actually asking you? It felt strange but good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I guess we can tackle the other gyms in any order. Cerulean City would be the closest, but it would be hard to get anywhere from Viridian City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should do that one last then? I could go from Cinnabar island to Virdian city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she plan to do that? Return to her pokeball or shrink down so you could travel by boat? Use her physic powers to walk on water? Or possibly even grow large enough to wade through the ocean? Could she be thinking about that right now? Hmm you'd cross that bridge when you came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaffron City was closer than Celadon City and Sabrina was a psychic gym leader. And a powerful pyschic herself. There had been rumors of her doing terrible things to trainers who angered her. Then again you were sure if it came to it your espeon could overpower her. Espeon had already been very powerful, but you wondered if her powers were growing with her stature... As well as her ego. And you hoped the stories you heard about Sabrina were just rumors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeladon city was a little further away. It's the biggest city in Kanto, so espeon would definitely have fun there.. Maybe too much. As fair as you knew Erika was a nice enough gym leader, though there were stories of her turning nasty if someone rubbed her the wrong way. And you could see Espeon saying the wrong thing if she felt offended. There was also the possibility of Espeon causing damage in Celadon if she made herself too big or was too careless, though she was trying to do better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were going to fight all 8 gym leaders you'd have to go both of them eventually, and Celadon City is a longer distance from here than Saffron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell might as well get this over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Saffron city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" She winks at you. SHe pulled your phone out of your pocket. \"Let me make a few posts first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO espeon, why are you still making yourself bigger?\"<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"it's fun! I feel myself being just. More and more!  I bet my power is growing by the second!\" </b>SHe sounded downright giddy. <b>\"Say could you check my level again?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realized it had been a while since you last did so. You were quite curious if it had gone up at all and pointed the dex at her<br>\r\n. <br>\r\n\"255.\" It said, loudly enough for both of you to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n255?! She had grown more than 20 levels in this short space of time? You were momentarily lost for words.<br>\r\n\"Ohhh lovely!\" She clapped her front paws together, which made a tremendous sound at her size<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could it have increased so much? SHe had only gained 2 levels in 2 weeks but had gained this many in a few hours? And although she battling now,  Surge's team were not a challenge for her and likely would not have been even at her normal stature. Was her size affecting her  level? No that couldn't be right. Had it somehow caused her level to go up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.. That's really quite incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Isn't it?\" </b>She was quivering now, inadvertently shaking you about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to get strong so much anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly turned her head away. You couldn't see the expression on her face, but she was clearly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Do I have to say it?\"</b> She sounded uncharacteristically meek. It had been a while since you saw her appear vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were curious and maybe she'd tell you if you really asked, but you didn't want to force it out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you with a conflicted look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Mmm... But I can tell you want to know.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I am curious, but if it makes you uncomfortable you don't have to tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment. Then she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"It's not a time I wish to recall but ... If you really want to know.\" </b>She winced<b> \"I was a small, sickly, weak eevee, and I hated it.I was the runt of my litter and my siblings and other Pokemon never let me forget it.</b>\" She shivered. <b>\"I was glad when you  found and helped me grow stronger, and when I went from such a weak little run to  marvelous specimen I am now! Thank you, I do owe you a lot.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, though I don't think I could have done this all myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon winked at you.<b> \"True. Though clearly you helped awaken some hidden talent inside of me.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think your power has capped out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. <b>\"Not even close!\"</b><br>\r\nIt occurs to you. Your dex likely only measure up to 255. No known record of a Pokemon exceeding that level was known. It was rare for most to even exceed 99. But what if your espeon was different? What if it was actually far higher or if there was no cap at all?! Just how powerful was she and just how powerful could she become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think your level is increasing so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Mmmm... could be ay number of things. Maybe its the support you showed me? Maybe its the battle? maybe the support of my fans?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again. Was she hiding something from you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Well I can't be certain. But I think it's something along those lines... maybe. Anyway....\"</b> She says before you can reply. You noticed she had left Vermillion city behind. She took a few steps and purred, wearing that same wry smile<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"You know what would make this journey shorter\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You growing really big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winked.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"My it's almost as though you read my mind. I thought I was the psychic one here.\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"So shall I?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if she'd do it even if you said not to, but you  wanted to see this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel your \"seat\" rumble and shake and her fur rise up around you as Esepon grows yet bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself getting lost amiss an increasing wall of purple, when her aura surrounds you and you feel yourself being slowly lifted up by her. She turns to you and purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's enormous! It's hard to judge just how big she is, though you have trouble taking all of her in. The gem on her head is larger than your entire body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>What do you think? Impressed? </b>\" Her psychic voice boomed around you, sounding more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you are lost for words. Can she get any bigger than this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"And before you say it, don't worry, I don't plan to enter Saffron city like this, i'd rather avoid flattening an entire district under my paws. This just to make the journey that much shorter... and more enjoyable.\"</b><br>\r\nShe placed you onto her head, which felt very soft. You couldn't help notice how much of the country side you could see from her. Then you wondered how many houses you could fit on your Espeon's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a long, slow step, dropping the purple aura around her paws, leaving a great impact on the ground. She lift her paw up, proudly inspecting the crater she left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Wonderful! And don't worry I don't plan to leave too many of those I just wanted to see how strong I was now. Hmm maybe one more.\"</b> She took another slow step and did the same thing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She made a few more paw print craters and admired her work, also letting you feel the weight of each step, before putting her aura back on.<br>\r\nTrainers yelled and gasped as the sight of her, some stopping to gawk and admire her, others running for the hills.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Espeon kept her pace as she neared Saffron City. \"<b>I think I'll stay like this, for now,</b>\" she said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSkirting on the outside of the city it still looked incredibly small in comparison to your Espeon and scores of people could be seen in a panic running between the buildings. Espeon circled the city and found a spot that was relatively devoid of buildings where she could sit down. After settling down on her belly, even the largest building in the town, the Silph Co. Headquarters, was dwarfed by the pink psychic Pokemon. Since she was just sitting there and not changing her size, you assumed she had a plan in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I was thinking you could go down there and bring out the gym leader for me.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"<b>I'll be sitting right here, you can have a look around town if you want. I can take in the sights from up here, anyway!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist,\" you answered. With that, you felt her psychic energy wrapping around your body and plucking you from her fur. As you floated from her side you were greeted with the faraway ground below, though thankfully she handled you carefully so you didn't panic at the sheer drop. Soon enough you were deposited on solid ground. From below, Espeon seemed even more imposing, looking more like a grand piece of the landscape rather than an actual Pokemon. Standing at the base of her body, her smiling face up above looked so close yet so far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a paw she motioned towards the city, accidentally kicking up a huge gust of wind. \"<b>Go on, then!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her a small wave you entered Saffron city. The atmosphere of the city was soaked in anxiety. People were looking up at Espeon, worriedly talking to each other and on their phones. Her social media fans stood out, though, who all seemed ecstatic at her arrival. Meanwhile, the local police department was deployed in full force and were organizing their units as they tried to calm the crowd, an officer with a megaphone assuring them that the Espeon wouldn't hurt them. It was clear they got word from the Officer Jenny you talked to but it was obvious they still didn't trust such a giant Pokemon would play nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, since you were in town you decided you might as well get some things squared away. The first thing you did was stop by a food vendor and get something to eat, though it took some insistence on your part to get them to serve you since they were transfixed on the Pokemon looming above the city. Next, you stopped by the post office and sent your Pokedex and a letter to the professor you work with regarding your Espeon. You briefly wrote about the events that transpired and requested a new Pokedex that read a higher level since you were sure the one you had now was capped out. For the delivery of the Pokedex, you just put down a town you were likely going to be visiting in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you had to find the city's gym leader, the apparent master of psychic Pokemon, Sabrina. Searching through the city, most of the denizens were engrossed with your Espeon that was absentmindedly looking over the city. She seemed to be enjoying herself just watching all the small people run around the model city before her and she was holding an endearing grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>So cute,</b>\" she beamed down at everyone. \"<b>I won't hurt any of you, don't worry!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of exploring you found Sabrina outside of her gym pointing up to the Espeon and barking orders to some trainers standing around her. From the cast of psychic Pokemon sitting next to her, she was apparently already prepared for a fight. Getting closer, she scared you when she suddenly spun around to your location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing a finger, she addressed you. \"You're that Pokemon's trainer, aren't you? I could sense a challenge with trainer using a powerful Pokemon in the future but I'm still not sure what you two want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your hands up in front of you at the accusation, you quickly explained yourself. \"We just want to challenge you to a battle, that's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina stared daggers for a moment longer. \"You're telling the truth. But I ask you to please leave the city after the battle, she's distressing the populace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't be a typical Pokemon battle,\" she continued. \"If I'm expected to face off against something as large as that, I'm going to use my whole team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that was fair enough. With how effortlessly Espeon took out Lt. Surge's team, you wouldn't blame Sabrina if she enlisted all the other trainers to help fight alongside her, too. Still, you wanted to see what Espeon thought and yelled up to her. \"Do you want to shrink yourself and come down here, or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon tilted her head, looking amused. It was apparent she could hear the conversation you were having with Sabrina. \"<b>I could,</b>\" she hummed. \"<b>Let me think about it.</b>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokeballs around Sabrina's waist glowed and all six of tem came up out. An Alakazam, Mr Mine, Jynx, Wobbuffet, Gallade and to your Espeon's amusement, an Espeon. All six were wide eyed at the sight of your behemoth, especially Sabrina's own espeon, who stared blankly into your own.<br>\r\nYour espeon laughter filled the air as she bent down and looked at Sabrina's Espeon in the eye, who nervously backed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>\"Ahhh she's so small and cute, she's like a mini me!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven you had to laugh. Sabrina did not seem amused, but he face had been in a permanent scowl since you arrived. Her pokemon shook in terror, while your Espeon playfully stretched in front of them and let out a yawn. Only Sabrina remained stoic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that pokemon is entirely too large, but I'm asking you to do this battle as gym leader pokeon. I will not let get seriously hurt and will call you back if things get too rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pokemon still looked shook. Sabrina just seemed to stare straight ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we doing this or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sabrina's Pokemon looked ready to battle. They took in a fightnig stance, Wobbuffet in front of them, clearly ready to take an attack, with the other five looking ready to fire psychic blasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina might have been out matched and reluctant to battle, but she was clearly very disciplined and had some kind of plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon waited, with the usual amused smirk on her face.  Four of Sabrina's pokemon attacked in sync, sending a green sphere, a black sphere, a yellwo blast or elltricy and even a small blizzard at Espeon. Sabinra wasn't just using psychic attacks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe projectiles struck Espeon, leaving only  a comparatively tiny mark on her fur. She gave a mocking yawn. However, Espeon didn't notice the almost insect sized Gallade running at her. You weren't sure it mattered but you felt you should warn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esepeon look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gallade dashed through, conjuring a purple blade to stab into espeon's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"OW!\"</b> Espeon flinched. <b>\"Hey that stang a bit. like being stung by an insect\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are immense but you are not invincible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGallade was already speeding away from her, when she slammed her paws down. The paws missed Gallade but the impact of them shook the entire area, and the tremor knocked Gallade down\tand made Sabrina's other Pokemon lose there balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're still out matched! First i'm going to deal with the sharp one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon playfully chased the Gallade, who was now running for his life, Esepon let it stay just a bit of her, enjoying its increasing fear as she got closer and closer to it and her every step caused a tremor. Sabrina's own Espeon and Alakazam seemed to be concentrating, while her Mr mine was making a wall. Her Jynx called another blizzard, the chill spreading through the air, making you wish you had wrapped up, though Espeon paid it no heed. She had almost caught the gallade and was bringing her building sized paw down when Wobuffet got in the way, spreading its stubby arms out and glowing. Gallade used the opportunity to get away Espeon disdainfully lowered her paw, but was suddenly forced back and yelped in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't enough to seriusly hurt her, but you were both shocked, it was rare for an attack to hurt espeon even at her regular size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>\"You little pest! What was that?\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Counter it reflects physical attacks.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>\"Oh using my own strength against me huh? Well let's see how you handle thi-\"</b></font><br>\r\nYou suddenly heard loud, ominous singing. Following the sound you noticed it was Jynx, and black clouds of energy were coming off her.You also notice Sabrina had recalled her Espeon.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon quick! That Jynx is using Perish Song! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>\"it's just bad music, what's it going to do to me?\" </b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black waves were building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it doesn't matter how big or strong you are you, it kos ANY pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Fine if only because I hate bad singing.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent her knees, preparing to jump over, but something was holding her. What could bind her at this size? Every other Pokemon seemed to also be weighed down, and you also felt suddenly heavier as though the ground was pulling you down. You looked around. The Alakazam! He had his spoons raised and was deep in concentration, but he wasn't attacking, he must have been doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe song grew louder. You had seen this before, if it reached the next verse, she'd faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>\"I wasn't planing to get serious but you asked for it!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon's gem glowed and you felt an overwhelming surge of pyschic energy that lit the entire field. Every other Pokemon felt it to and even Sabrina blinked, something you hadn't seen her do all battle.<br>\r\nSabrina's pokemon were gripped in surging purple fields, her light so bright that anyone around could see it it. Jynx dropped onto the ground, spirals around its eyes, then Gallade, then Alakazam and finally Mr mine, leaving only Wobuffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while since I've even broken a sweat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWobbuffet glowed again and shot a small blast back. Apparently Espeon had been holding him/her/it? YOu couldn't tell . Espeon looked mildly annoyed rather than hurt by the blast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"I've had enough of you.\" </font></b>She telekentically lifted it towards herself and looked ready to bury it under her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Sabrina tries to keep a game face, you catch an instant of a smile as Eespeon does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait I think she's trying to trick you! Wobuffet going to use Destiny Bond!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH i remember a trainer we fought did that. Though he didn't call it out fast enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sabrina won't have that issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm you right. So what do we do with this one here?\" She bent her head so she could look it in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held the Wobuffet under her paw, softly enough that it couldn't' counter the grip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Oh I have an idea. You can counter my paws but can you counter this?\"</font></b> She tried to jump, but the gravity seemed too heavy. She waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds you suddenly felt a lot lighter, whatever Sabrina's Alakazam had done had worn off. And given the smile on you're Espeon's face, you could tell she had noticed it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped up and down, shaking the whole area. She jumped again, landing with even more force, and leaving an increasingly large crater. <br>\r\nAnother jump. That one would have knocked you off your feet if you weren't aware of it. If she kept going like this she might even cause an earthquake! Espeon always possessed and incredible power, but at this size she would be capable of doing some serious damage! Espeon didn't even seem to notice, only looking  with amusement at the fear in wobbufet's eyes. She jumped again, the impact forcing you a few feet back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't think even the Elite 4 would have a Pokemon that could keep up with her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No. But I'll keep thinking. I suppose i'l have some fun with my fans on social media... if this saffron thing doesn't cause me problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going to be this big when get to Celadon city are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Obviously not. Besides even if it feels liberating I hardly need to be that big to beat any of these gym leaders pokemon!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true. Even without her size ability you doubt many would have posed a challenge. Though if Sabrina was any indication, they wouldn't just rely on brute strength. And as powerful as she was one of them might even find a way to use Espeon's recklessness against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon went quiet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time you could see tall buildings in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell they were tall, but most of them wouldn't even reach Espeon's knees. You had forgotten how short Route 7 was. If you could see Celadon city it was a given Celadon city could see your immense Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to ask her to shrink down, when you could feel your seat shake. You instinctively clutched onto the fur in front of you and felt yourself getting lower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazing, Espeon was actually shrinking herself down without you prompting! It felt strange seeing the sky move away from you and the ground rush closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stopped shrinking she was a lot smaller than before but still big. It was hard to tell how big she was, all you could really be sure of was there still a wall of pink around you and you were still smaller than one of her ears, but judging from the scenary around you, you estimate she was about the size she was in Vermillian City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh I didn't think you'd-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"Yeah I know.

And also kept her paws levitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was trying her best, she was having trouble maneuvering through the busy streets, Celadon was much more densely packed than any other city you had gone to, with more people and more cars than anywhere either of you had been to. Whether or not this was Kanto's capital, it sure felt like it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough many of the roads and streets were wider, there were also more cars and people, many not appreciating a giant Pok\u00e9mon roaming through their streets, if not screaming with terror. She even, grudgingly, shrank down a little further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>\"Ugh I'm not used to moving through Celadon like this.

I am not some savage movie creature, I am a noble Espeon!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed away from the road, used her telekinesis to lift some parked cars out of her way and slowly sat down, presumably being aware what would happen if she just slammed her rump down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gem stone, and from your perspective the already tall buildings of Celadon began to rise higher. Espeon looked up at them with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you enjoyed being the biggest around, but I'm glad you're doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Thank you.  I suppose.\"</b></font></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuffled closer and could see a somewhat pained look on her shrinking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we leave the city you can make yourself as big as you like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I suppose that\u2019s something to look forward to.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground continued to race towards you and you had to admit you were missing the view your enormous Espeon provided. She was shrinking rapidly, not even half the size of the buildings she had towered over before and dwindling by the second. Was she going back to her normal size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe levitated you off her back. Perhaps she was unsure if she could bear your weight at a smaller size? As she shrank further, she backed away, briefly taking a moment to look around before moving onto the pavement and smiling back at those cars and people who had stopped to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also looked up, watching her shrink down. Riding her at her biggest size you felt like such a speck, though now you were almost eye level with the lowest part of your stomach. It was going to feel strange being bigger than her again, even though you still knew she was much more powerful than you. Then she was around three times you size and then, without warning she jumped on top of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou defiantly weren\u2019t ready for this, she was still easily big enough to bowl you over, and you fell backwards. Just before you hit the ground the hard concrete, you felt Espeon's psychic aura around and the impact you would have felt didn\u2019t happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you still felt a wall of fluff on top of you! Even though she was still getting smaller, she was still larger enough to pin or smother you if she wished. though she wasn\u2019t pressing down hard enough to hurt you. <br>\r\nThis was just like when you were on the couch and she showed off her new ability for the first time. You liked her being affectionate but there a lot of people watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon we're in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at them and then back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scratch behind my ears first.\" She pressed harder, still not enough to hurt, but to remind you were trapped. She lowered her head expectantly. It was obvious you were not getting out till you complied and if you tried to argue she would only keep you here longer. You did so, a couple of time still she purred and stepped off you, giving you a chance to get your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dust yourself off and looked at Espeon. She had stopped shrinking, but she was still a lot bigger than her normal size. Even standing on her four legs, she was nearly your height, while being a whole lot longer.<br>\r\nShe smiled, standing up on her hind legs and putting a paw on each of your shoulders. Even at her diminished size you could feel it weighing you down, she could easily knock off balance if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was amused at the surprise on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d shrink down all the way did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did make sense, she wanted to be a more practical size, and judging from the way she looked back and forth between you and the people watching, she also wanted attention. Though maybe there was more to it than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her paws off you and waved to the onlookers, then turned back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh I feel so constrained, like this but there's at least some fun I can have like this.\" She stood on her hind legs, and effortlessly pull you into her chest, with just enough to force to show that you couldn't escape, then let you go. Even for her size, she seemed very strong. You knew she was a gifted psychic but had you underestimated her physical strength?</span></div></div>",

Sorry if my previous size startled you, I was trying something out. Don't worry I don't bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon always loved attention, though you weren\u2019t sure this was the best time to be fishing for it. Still she was a <br>\r\ngood a showperson... showmon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the closest group of people, pausing a very short distance in front of one friendly looking group, coyly half looking at them and half away. You had seen this before, she was clearly fishing for pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople hesitated, but someone extended a hand, stroking her soft fur, then another followed. She purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I don't bite\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played to the crowd, walking around and letting others stroke, posing for photos and doing paw shakes with a couple of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Espeon drew almost all the attention, a couple of people asked how you raised such a Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know how to respond. While you did use her in battle a lot and encouraged her to do her best, you couldn\u2019t take credit for her exponential growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Espeon apparently had her share and was ready to move on. She looked back to you then addresed the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an announcement to make!\u201d She spread her thought speech across the area. \u201cMe and my trainer are on a journey to collect all the badges in this region and we have come to your fair city to battle it\u2019s gym leader. Come with me if you wish to see me in action!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strode forward and nodded with her head for others to follow. A surprising amount did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran ahead of the crowd and caught up to her. It was difficult to keep up with her pace at her size, and she seemed to walk with an extra spring in her step. Seeing you struggle, she slows down slightly, while still maintaining a vigorous pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was fun.\" She said in private thought speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach her and say quiet near her ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really do like attention don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Is that such a bad thing? I feel tingly in my body when I meet some new fans. i suppose it's like humans and social media.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you REALLY enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. maybe there is a little more to it. But it does make me feel alive, and that I'm more than just a beast of a battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I'm doing this gym thing in part for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In part? So you have your reasons to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pace quickened slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple. I enjoy the thrill of fighting some of Kanto's most celebrated trainers, and the fame and attention that comes with it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked away after saying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something else isn't there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, perceptive. I do have other reason. BUt i'd like to keep it close to my chest for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all have our secrets. But I promise I will tell you, just not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were silent not sure how to take this. A few seconds later you here her voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think a second. She could be reckless, she could sometimes be selfish, but she was rarely if ever malicious, and realizing she might have come close to hurting innocent people, tried to do better. While she was focused on having fun, she did care about your happiness to and didn\u2019t want to hurt others. What did you have to lose? Besides this was pretty fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Espeon I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm you hesitated but very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he other reason be? Was there some other goal she was aiming for? Could this be related to her blossoming powers? Maybe it has something to do with why her level went up quicker than before. Was she somehow drawing power from people's admiration of her? How would a Pok\u00e9mon even do that? As far as you know Espeons did not feed on emotion. Unless she really was a legendary Pok\u00e9mon in disguise. But you've known her since she was an eevee. Whatever she said about being sickly, she was always quite strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait while she was strong, she did seem to develop rapidly with you as a trainer.

Would you like to see our selection of perfumes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to battle the gym leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way.\" They motioned you to follow. Oddly they didn't seem surprised at the other people Espeon had brought to the gym<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step through the doors. A pleasant smell whaffs through the air, not only from all the plants around you, but <br>\r\nyou can smell perfume to. Espeon makes a show of taking a large sniff of the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm..\" Oh no, was she going to cause trouble? She looked at you with that devlish smie, her eyes full of mischief. \"Smells good.\" She had you going! You relax, the pleasant smell making it easy to do so.<br>\r\nIt took the attendants a second to answer, they were clearly surprised your Espeon talked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, it's our special mixture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not as surprised as you expected. Perhaps they had seen talking pokemon before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are lead to a wide open pokemon arena, surrounded by another garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center is a woman in a kimono sipping tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a quite a large Espeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsepeon smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another sip of tea and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, welcome to my gym. I assume you are here for a battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika also did not seem surprised by the people Espeon had brought in. Did the public regularly watch Erika battle? Erika reached for a pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway shall we get started? I propose a 3 on 3 battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon swaggered towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need I'm more than enough for a team of Pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika's glared at her, shaking a little. Uh oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see your bigger than the average Espeon but that doesn't mean I won't put up a fight! Don't take me lightly! You maybe big but I have empathy for my pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy, it was true Erika did have a temper beneath that calm facade. Still at least she wasn't throwing you out the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon crouched down and spread her paws, the way she normally does when she's prepared to battle, Though her upper half looked as relaxed as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm looking forward to it! You sure you only want to use one at a time against me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika glared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pokemon has quite an attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just how she is, don't take it too personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon got between you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if you were me you would have attitude to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does it! Vileplume go!\" She tossed her pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer signature pokemon already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vileplume!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant pokemon cheers as she comes out her ball. But stops when she catches sight of your Espeon. Espeon flashed at her teeth at her, causing the plant pokemon to run for Erika.<br>\r\nErika sighed and patted her Vileplume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she's big but that just makes her easier to hit! Please do this for me VIleplume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVileplume looked back and fourth between Espeon and Erika, finally jumping out from Erika and looking resolute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Vileplume Use Stun spore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowninsh yellow spores filled the air and drifted towards Espeon. She put a paw on her nose, noticing the stink will before the cloud reached her.  Espeon waited till the cloud had almost reached her, then with speed that surprised, leapt high into the air. a so quickly you brefly lost track of her movement, landing behind the Vileplume. Espeon stuck her tounge out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika scowled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vileplume, Again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon did the same thing, leaping back to where she had been before. Erika dived out of the way of the way as it approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vileplume try a sleep powder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon made a show of waiting for it to reach her, looking at the crowd, then without bothering to look at the oncoming cloud, jumped out of the way again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her tongue out at Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really you're trying nearly the exact same thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon was amused by the clear exasperation on Erika's face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess you didn't think i could be this big and this fast? I could try moving slower if it would help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika gritted her teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vileplume Giga drain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVileplume's plumage glowed and a field of energy shot from it. Again Espeon dodged it with the same ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Espeon made a show of dancing around the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use Petal Dance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVileplume spun around in a circle and as she did a storm of sharp pink blossoms fill the air. There were enough  of them that you didn't Espeon think Espeon could dodge them all. Naturally Espeon wasn't worried. She danced around some of them, then stopped, letting some strike her. Even when they make a direct impact, they dont seem to leave a mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika gasped. When the petals cleared, Espeon was unharmed and Vileplume was tottering around, clearly dizzy from the effort. Not giving the plant Pokemon a chance to recover, Espeon leaped over and slammed Vileplume to the ground with a paw, the plant struggling in vain, even with Espeon only using a fraction of her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would expect Erika to be ready to give up, her arms were shaking as she looked on with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Another stun spore!\" She yelled out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Vileplume responded immediately, Espeon jumped into the air again, landing behind Vileplume, as the Stun Spore drifted in the opposite direction.  Espeon then swung both of her front paws, knocking Vileplume down, the force causing Vileplume to roll several feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon let the plant pokemon stand up,then lifted it into the air with psychic. You could hear gasps from Erika and several members of the audience, as Vilplume almost reached the ceiling. Espeon let go and VIleplume fell from the air, landing with a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDust filled the air, and as it started to clear, Espeon casually walked. As the dust cleared, everyone could see Vileplumes eyes had been replaced with swirls. Espeon rested her front paws on Vileplume and flashed  the crowd winning smile. Though you couldn't help notice a fair few of them didn't look happy. One or two even looked scared. Though some others were clearly impressed with your Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it Erika!\" An older gentlemen called and some others were cheering with him. Hmm did  Erika have a following of her own?<br>\r\nErika returned Vileplume<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit your Espeon is strong, but she has a real attitude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon stuck up her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would to if you were this strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika didn't dignify that with an answer <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victreebell go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictreebell materialized with a scream. Then she caught sight of your Espeon and back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika put her hands  on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she's big but I believe in you!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeoen laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you just goign to try the same thing with a different Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika's eyes narrowed but she addressed her own Pokemon instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victreebell grab onto her paw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith more speed than either of you would expect, the Victreebell took two hops then leaped at your Espeon. Espeon would likely have been able to easily dodge if she was being more careful, as it was Victrebell clamped on to Espeon's left leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon lightly shaked her paw, looking annoyed rather than hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that supposed to hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictrebell strayed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon wasn't impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this supposed to do. I can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika called<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stun spore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictrbeell complied, firing off a haze similar Vileplume. The powder spread over Espeon, her legs, then body twitched. She gritted her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh I feel so stiff...\" She moved her other leg, but it responded slower than she expected.<br>\r\nErika siezed the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giga drain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA field of energy built off the top of Victrebell's head and struck Espeon. Espeon still looking irritating rather than hurt. She tried to shake to her leg to throw Victrebell off but it wouldn't respond. And she could feel those teeth pushing against her skin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gasps filled the air. She grew a lot quicker than usual, perhaps Espeon usually liked to savor and enjoy the process, but now she was rapidly filling the gym, almost immediately doubling, then tripling in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't going to wreck the gym was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espe-\" You start to say<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"I know!\"</b> Her thought speech already sounded louder.<b>\"Be careful! I'm not going to break the gym. Not that I'm not tempted.\"</b> She grew until her head reached the roof and her body filled most of the arena, Erika gasping at the sight, then looked down at the comparatively tiny Victreebell, that looked little more than a very large thorn stuck on her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I just want this off me!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictreebel's eyes widened in clear shck, but it still remained on. Esepon gritted her teeth and violently shook her leg, flinging Victreebell off. Espeon's body was still shaking and her movements were slower, even growing hadn't stopped the effects of the powder, she gritted her teeth, clearly fighting her way through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at Victrebeell, the plant pokemon looking positively terrified at the light purple wall in front of him.<br>\r\nEspeon's gem flashed and her aura surrounded Victreebell, and she unceremoniously flung the plant into a wall. The victrebell dropped to ground, . Espeon forced another smug smile, even as she struggled to make the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected Espeon to continue to toy with Victreebell, but Espeon seemed unusually serious. Getting hit with that powder must have rubbed her the wrong way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika was momentarily lost for words. She reached for her third pokeball but stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concede.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon took a step towards Erika and stuck her nose in the air.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b><br>\r\n\"Afraid?\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the crowd were booing, some at Erika and some at your Espeon with one or two shouting \"Bully!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot them a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"It's a gym battle! I'm supposed to fight to win!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't silence her critics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was clear Erika had her own set of fansYou did wonder if Espeon had been overdoing it. Serge at least had an attitude problem, but Erika wasnt that bad.. other than her temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their size difference Erika stood her ground, craning her head to look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But despite your grating attitude, I acknowledge I can't beat you, and I don't want to put another of my pokemon through that.. Take my Rainbow Badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika tossed the Rainbow Badge at your feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon looked particularly smug, but the saw you and some of the disapproving crowd in the corner of her eyes.<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n\"Well I admit this stun spore did hurt. I didn't expect you to use your Victrebell that way.. I have to admit it was a clever tactic. I couldn't dodge that powder at that range.\"</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika relaxed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it was good of you to say. You are a very strong pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were talking, you searched through your back pack for a parlyz heal. You run over and spray it on her. She purrs, then moves her hind legs around, happy to see they were responsive again.<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n\"Ahh finally my legs are <br>\r\nworking right again! Thank you.\"</font></b> She bent down and rubbed her head against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You raised a very strong pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you let her run wild and you barely commanded her at all! And a trainer is supposed to have empathy with their pokemon, you just let your Espeon run wild!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was true you often didn't understand what Espeon was thinking. And you let her do her own thing because it worked well enough for the both of you. But was this why you couldn't share thoughts with her the way Sabrina could with her Pokemon? Was it also why Espeon sometimes ran wild?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon moved between you.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"Hey! I have my own mind to!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew Espeon wasnt going to do any serious damage or hurt you. I trust her.\" Though were times liek Safforn, but she did seem to be trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon purred in response. Erika was still fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your Espeon has quite an attitude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have quite a temper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm you had to admit she a point. Both oo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon is as confident as she is because she is a very strong opponent. We beat the gym leaders in Johto with similar ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon stood proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n\"See? I can back it up! And that was only a fraction of my power, if I went all out this entire city block would be rubble! Oh and your perfume stinks!\"</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy she went there. Erika's face reddened. For a second you imagined you could see steam off her. You wondered what she was going to go<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>\"Fine!\"<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon stormed off and you followed after her. A fair section of the crowd was booing your espeon, though some seemed in awe of her. Espeon paid them no heed. As she exited the battle arena, She shrank down to be just small enough to move through the corridors and quickly left the gym, with you struggling to follow after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught up with her and found Espeon was now the size she was before you entered the gym. She's silent for a while but then you hear her again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon spoke to you in private thought speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it I wasn't that cruel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she apparently has a fair amount of fans around here and you did anger them. It's one thing to put on a show but they thought you were bullying her and she really didn't do anything to deserve it like Surge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon rolled her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would she prefer I just use Psychic three times and move on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember a few of your gym battles ending with Espeon knocking out each Pokemon with one hit. It was boring for everyone involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it would be better to toy with them a little, but don't mock the trainer unless they  actually deserve it.\"ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon titled her her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. Her fanclub did think I was bully.. though I suppose increasing my size didn't help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the outburst about destroying the city-block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both know it's true. Even at my smallest size I could take that gym apart if I wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search for the right words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it's true, it's not the best thing to say to someone. Think about your image.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm  that is a good point...... So think about how I come across, put on a show but do not tease a gym leader unless they've earnt it and put on a show but keep my cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon was quite for a moment then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. I think I know what to do for our next battle. So where to next? Fuschia city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm thinking we should go to Cerulean city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to circle round and go there after Pewter City but I suppose that makes sense.\" Espeon's smile widened till it stretched from ear to ear. Now do you remember what you promised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" You wanted to see it yourself truth be told. \"But you should get far away from the city before you do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And shrink down before we reach Cerulean city, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew a little larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hop on my back, I can't wait to leave this place behind!\"</span></div></div>",

You were worried that as she run through the city with her increased size she may cause another accident, but she was surprisingly agile, skillfully weaving around the citizens, not stopping as they stared at her, and gracefully leaping over traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you had exited Celadon. Espeon eagerly looked to you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, you're too near the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right. I don't want a repeat of Saffron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon kept running and looking behind herself. You were surprised at her stamina, you have been travelling and fighting for hours and she was still running at full steam?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running a fair distances, Celadon now seemed a small sight just over the horizon. and you were out in the open without anyone around. Espeon kept looking behind her, clearly eager to reach the point where she could let loose with her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm I think this is a good spot, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou  could barely see Celadon behind you. Espeon was probably correct. Though you're surprised she didn't get further away. You suspect she also wanted Celadon to see this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but hit the ground too hard this time or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know. Be careful! I get it!.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gem flashed and her eyes glowed. At first you didn't notice anything, then a few seconds later you felt your seat shift. A few second later you felt it shift again. She was barely any bigger, but you could tell this was a just a warm up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking it slow this time huh?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt another spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMm yes. I love this feeling.\" She purred.  \"I might as well enjoy it. Would you like to observe from the ground to better take me in. I promise not to step on you.\" You nod. She lifted you phone and moved it front of her. \" This is going to make some great photos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered and grew again. And again. Each spurt was adding several feet to her impressive size and each spurt was getting larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou craned your head up, she was more than twice as tall as you and growing every couple of seconds. Another two spurts and she at least three times your height, then other spurt and you only came up to her knee, with her  stretching body already beginning to fill your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed down at you, while spinning your phone around herself and taking shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good human.\" She patted you softly, her paws easily big enough to cover your head and shoulder then gave you a lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did a few more spurts before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to cut loose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gem flashed again and her body glowed and she grew faster than before, almost doubling in size in a instant. She leaned back her head and exhaled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Mmmmmmmm\" </b>Her voice was getting louder as she grew. In no time at all you estimate she was about the size she was in Vermilion, but This time you were on the ground and could appreciate just how large she was.  A single paw could easily flatten a car and look up she was already so big you couldn't entirely take all of her in, her enormous face seemed so far away, and her body stretched across several blocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe applied more slow spurts, her body taking up more and more of the land, until almost everything you could see was your enormous Espeon.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b><br>\r\n\"And now!\"</b></font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from down here you could see the flash of light from her gem. Her body expanded out rapidly, filling the area, the entire land being filled with purple. You stood on her paw, figuring it the safest place to be, she was so huge that looking you struggled to see more than her great pillar like legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done you estimated she was the size she was about the size she was in Saffron city, though with little to compare it to you couldn't tell. But standing on her paw you felt almost microscopic.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Ahh this feels so good!\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted you up to her face.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n\"What do you think?\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was bigger than a street of buildings, you struggled to take it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You do know how to put on a show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smiled widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>\"I do, don't I?\"<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed you on top of her head. Her fur was a thick, each individual strange was taller than and you could feel yourself sinking into it. But it was soft and relaxing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"I feel great!! Perhaps this what humans feel when they change out of tight uncomfortable clothes.\"</b></font><br>\r\nYou walked around her head.You don't remember her fur being quite this thick, or her ears being as long as that... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the gem on her head. It's definitely bigger than you compared to last time. And you know you're sinking deeper into her fur, which itself feels thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon, you've gotten even bigger than before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the ground move as she shifts her head. Her enormous eyes are looking at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"So you noticed,\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wasn't she at her maximum size at Saffron? Wait.

She was shrinking you!  She seemed positively enormous and looked like she was growing by the second. You struggled to take in her two immense eyes focused on you  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook with glee, you struggled to maintain your balance and fell back, but fortunately her fur cushioned your fall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe levitated you, lifting you just a little bit to give you a better view. Her face took up almost your entire view and her body seem to stretch on forever.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>\"awww cute!\"</b></font>\" She beamed at you. \"So what do you think?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were  lost for words.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inspected for a while.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Espeon makes quick progress, each step covering a lot of ground, and she cut through the wilds that a lot of trainers stay away from. She seems so focused on making objects that she seems to have forgot about her earlier bad mood. And her objects were getting better, looking more and more realistic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at the pace you were going at, you were able to take in the incredible views, and all the people starring up at your Espeon. Though for once, Espeon was too deep in concentration to be taking notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNot too long later you could see Cerulean city in the distance. Espeon paused to inspect the view, then starts shrinking, before you ever get near. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell that was fun. We\u2019ve got a badge to win and fans to meet!\u201d You held on as your seat began to shake. When she stopped shrinking you notice she was still bigger than she was in Celadon. You estimate she was nearly as big as she was in Vermillion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to get any smaller?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cMaybe...But I can tell Cerulean City has a lot more open space.\u201d</b></font> It was true, Cerulean was much less densly populated than the other cities you had seen in Kanto.<b><font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"> \u201cWhich is great because I hate being confined! Though I suppose I\u2019ll have to get smaller when we enter the gym itself.\u201d </font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her excitement she approached the city slowly and with surprising caution. Well Espeon could be stubborn and prideful, but she did seem to learn. As she got closer, you could feel her reluctantly shrink a little at a time. By the time you reached Cerulean, Espeon was about the size of the buildings, which weren't as tall as those in Vermilion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of people had gathered at the entrance of the city. Some looked scared and shocked, but plenty looked happy and some were excited. A short distance behind them an officer Jenny watched. For a second you thought it might be the same one, then you remember an unusual quirk of this region. Maybe they were sisters... or clones? Perhaps her sister had told her about your Espeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Espeon flashed her usual winning smile You could guess Espeon had sent the message out while you had been travelling, and perhaps the fact she was slowly shrinking reassured them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAh my adoring crowd! I\u2019m happy to see you to.\u201d </b>She posed for photos, though shifted slowly enough that you wouldn\u2019t be thrown off. <b>\u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019m not here to cause any trouble just to put on a show!\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let fans stroke her and pose with her, and answered most of the questions they had for her. As the energy died down and the novelty of her appearance wore off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re all enjoying my presence. Would you like to watch me take on the gym leader? I\u2019ll do my best to put on a good show!\u201d. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got some cheers and a few people chanted her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThen lead the way!\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed the crowd and you soon found  a tall, round building, though not as large as the others you had come across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHuh I thought it would be bigger.\u201d </b>She said to you privately, not hiding her disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe everything seems smaller when you\u2019ve been the size of a mountain.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNice of you to say but I don\u2019t think I've been quite that big... yet. Well maybe a very small mountain\u201d </b>She stared off whimsically for second,  before quickly heading to the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would be her upper limit when she was done? Mountain size? City size? Or would she stretch across most of Kanto? That would be sight to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your reached the gyms double doors, Espeon shrank down, settling on around your height again. You dismounted and entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym attendants seem momentarily surprised by your Espeon and the crowd she brought, but quickly recovered their composure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome what brings you to our gym?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to battle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh a talking Espeon! And so big.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I don\u2019t bite.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem anyway right this way.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the crowd followed after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Erika\u2019s gym looked like a garden, this looked like an aquarium, with numerous tanks filled with various water pokemon. You came to a wide-open pool with 2 platforms. It took you a second to realize this was an arena <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a red headed teenager wearing suspenders on her shirt, and a pair of shorts who almost seemed to be waiting your arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me we\u2019re here for a gym battle do you know where the gym leader is?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here!\u201d Her voice was lower pitched than you would expect from her appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t surprised your Espeon talked? She didn\u2019t even stare for a split second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally aren\u2019t you a little young?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a little tall for an Espeon?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d She flashed a smile then looked serious. \u201cForgive me, I suppose if trainers leave home young there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t be gym leaders.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t often Espeon apologized to anyone other than you. It was rare for her to apologize to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. We\u2019ll battle 3 on 3.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo speech about how she was going to sweep her team? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo Starmine!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it came out if its pokeball, it spun in the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStar!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon smiled and awaited Misty\u2019s first move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarmie Bubblebeam!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue, bubbly beam  fired from  the top of Starmie. Espeon as usual wait till almost the last moment to dodge out of it, twirling out of the way as though she was dancing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon danced out of the way again, this time settling on a waltz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty clenched her teeth <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah she\u2019s too quick!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon purses her lips. You\u2019re guessing to avoid saying anything too smart alacky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarmie swift!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarmie formed several small white stars and launched them at Espeon. Again Espeon waited, trying to dance out of the way, but to her surprise, the stars followed her and crashed into her head. Espeon didn\u2019t look hurt but did look a little annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled, raising a fist into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! Keep at it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon quickly slid to the left, but the stars still found their mark. Misty ordered another barrage and after trying to dodge well in advance and failings so , Espeon changed tactics. She was actually running at Misty\u2019s Starmie now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty seemed surprised at how fast your Espeon was moving. You\u2019re guessing Starmie was surprised? It was hard to tell with the lack of a face. Misty yelled to her Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarmie use swift and get out of there!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarmie fired another round of swift then jumped through the air. Espeon didn\u2019t even bother to dodge, running straight through them instead. Even though Starmie had tried to get away, Espeon closed the gap and slammed it with her paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Espeon didn\u2019t hit as hard as she could, Starmie was still sent flying. Misty gasped, surprised at the force of the impact <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarmie!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt spun in the air, trying to slow its fall, but still landed awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty ran over to her Pok\u00e9mon. \u201cStarmie are you ok?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt nodded.. Or at least its top limb made a nodding like motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat Espeon is fast... but I have a plan! Starmie use recover!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem on Starmie glowed, and in a flash it looked as good as new. Espeon was mildly annoyed, but started running at it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Starmie jump into the water! There's no way the Espeon will be able to keep up with you in there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStar!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarmie jumped into the water and spun through the water, moving almost as quickly as it did on land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Espeon wasn\u2019t afraid of water, but neither of you had gone swimming to often. Misty could see her annoyance and siezed upon it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon can\u2019t reach you here, keep pelting it with swift!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmph.\u201d Espeon pretty much ignored the swift barrage being shot at her, and dived into the water after Starmie, running through the shallow part with little trouble, but immediately starting to sink in the deeper part in the center. Espeon flailed around her limbs, desperately trying to swim or at least stay afloat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Espeon often liked to make a show of being graceful,  her lack of experience showed, as she awkwardly bobbed around in the water, still flailing in an attempt to stay afloat, let alone having to  chase down Starmie. She  didn\u2019t even seem to notice the continuous barrage of swifts, as she tried to balance herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best efforts, she started to sink, gurgling. Misty glared at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf your pokemon is going to drown get them back to their pokeball! Right now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't worried, but this only infuriated Misty all the ore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it! What kind of trainer are you?! You\u2019re Espeon is drowning! Are you just going to leave to drow-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was cut off as Espeon\u2019s head pushed through the water, larger than before.</span></div></div>",

Then you could see Espeon neck, then her lower back. Espeon shook herself off, though her fur was still soaked. But she looked a lot happier. Given her relaxed movement, you\u2019re guessing she had grown till her feet touched the floor <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWahhhhh?!\u201d Misty blustered. \u201cCan Espeon\u2019s do that?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThis one can.</b>\u201d She shot a smile to the crowd, not caring that she was still being barrages with swifts. She tried to run at Starmie, but her movement through the water still slow, even with her makeshift doggy paddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHmm maybe I\u2019d do better if I was sea monster sized!\u201d </b>Espeon started making herself bigger, in seconds the water came just above her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarmie get closer and use Bubblebeam, Espeon can\u2019t dodge in the water!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarmie spun through the air and fired. She struck Espeon on the face, but Espeon only looked annoyed. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cUgh its like getting hit by a hose. On a low setting.\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bubble beam struck, Though Epseon did little more than turn her head slightly.  THen her gem flashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a purple glow filled the gym, and bound Starmie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarrr\u201d Starmie tried to fight against, but couldn't move at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon lifted it high into the air and twirled it around the gym, first holding it above the pool, then over misty, then over the crowd, then let her grip go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarmie fell through the air, and spun, trying to recover its balance. Before it could spin away again, Espeon clutched in her telekinetic grip. This time she spun it round and round, each rotation faster than the last, before lowering it a little then  finally slamming it into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarmieeee.\u201d It tried to strand, the light on its chest glowing on and off, but soon fell off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarmie!\u201d Misty ran over to it, checking it for injury. She returned it  and looked at you grimly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon jumped out of the water and shook herself off, though her coat was still soaking wet.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty gaped at Espeon, still trying to process what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Espeon is powerful .l....\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI know.\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty glared and Espeon feigned humility <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI mean thank you for noticing.\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re big but you\u2019re not the biggest around!\u201d She reached for her next pokeball. \u201cGo Gyarados!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sea dragon appeared with a roar, towering over Espeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon looked up, still wearing the same smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d Misty said proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyarados roared again but Espeon simply shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the Gyarados seemed annoyed Espeon wasn\u2019t taking it more seriously. Or maybe Gyarados always looked angry, you weren't quite sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was frustrated but not as much as you would have expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Misty hit her armband Gyarados forehead glowed. Wait... was there a gem on Gyarados\u2019s forehead?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight filled Gyarados,  the fins on its head grew much longer, the scales on its back lengthened and thickened, and a2 large dorsal fins grew out of Gyarados back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega evolution?! You weren\u2019t expecting to see that in Kanto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the crowd behind you chattering excitedly but Espeon took it in stride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a little impressive.\u201d Though Espeon didn\u2019t sound that impressed. Truth be told you weren't worried either, but Misty looked a lot more confident <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual  Espeon waited to see what they would do, showing mild curiosity. Misty seized the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGyarados use Rain Dance!\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact you were indoors, it started to rain. Espeon was still as lax as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow use Twister!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surprisingly larger tornado came at Espeon, reaching ot he top of the gym. She leaped at the last second, narrowly avoid it, though some of her fur was blown upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you were sure Espeon would easily win, her Gyarados did seem strong. Stronger than of the gym leaders pokemon you had seen in Kanto and almost  all of the ones you had seen in Johto <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty pumped a fist into the air <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHydro Pump!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon jumped out of the way as a surprisingly large burst of water hit the spot she was standing on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain!\u201d Gyarados shot another that Espeon also dodged with ease, making a show of her foot work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty thought for a second. \u201cGyardos fire another twister than spray your Hydro Pump across the gym\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother twister swept towards Espeon. SHe no trouble dodging it, but the Hydro pump was another matter, she tried to sidestep away while also avoiding the twisters, but it soon caught her dead on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gurgled, clearly sounding irritated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA  psychic aura engulfed Gyardos and it was flung back into a wall. It roared in pain and anger, but got itself up and fired off another Hydro Pump. Espeon dodged to the side. The rain was starting to subside, but Gyarados roared and another showed started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets even things up.\u201d Espeon said, she glowed and grew to the same size as the Gyardos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty gasped <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust how big can she get?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure you want to know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the gyardos seemed bewilded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwister!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Espeon didn\u2019t bother to dodge, she leaned back her head and acted as though she was being buffeted by a hair dryer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm I could use this after that swim\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Misty tensed up. \u201cGyarados use crunch!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyarados flew at her, his teeth barred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon waited veered of the way  ever so slightly and smacked the Gyarados across the face with her paw. He reared back and tried to take another bite only to get smacked again. Gyarados bent down his head and tried to ram Espeon, only for Espeon to duck. As Gyarados flew past Espeon, Espeon grabbed it and started wrestling it. Gyarados tried to bite Espeon, but she kept him back, Gyarados tried to break free of her grasp, but he was held tight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked dismayed but still determined.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGyardos used Hydro Pump!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Espeon seem to be expect a point blank attack and veered her head away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwister!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t entirely dodge the blast of wind, and was blown back but still clinged to Gyardos, dragging her along with her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon gritted her teeth in annoyance as he twister buffeted against her. She stayed on top of gyardos and slowly brought it to the ground, enjoying seeing the Gyarados struggling against her superior pyshical strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyrados thrashed around trying to break , but Espeon held on tight. Then you noticed Espeon slowly getting bigger. SHe had been about Gyarados\u2019s height, but was now a clear head taller, then a head and a half. Her paws were taking up more and more of its body, and though it was wriggling ever more frantically, Gyarados was moving less and less by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHydro Pump! Twister! Crunch!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon didn\u2019t even bother to doge the stream of water, simply raising her head  so it would bounce off her chest.  ANd she hardly reacted when the Twister buffeted her again. Before it could try to bit her again, Espeon leaned, her larger body easily pinning the gyarados. She approaching twice its size and growing by the second, looking in the eyes, as its flailing becae more and more frantic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rested on top of it, enjoying as more and more her body covered it. SHe looked down at the Gyardos and smiled, like a cat toying with their prey <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>\u201c1, 2, 3 pinned!\u201d</b></font> she said, Gyarados looking like it would be flattened if this went on much longer. Her body fast disappearing under Espeon\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty stared open mouthed, then looked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big can she get?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger than this gym. A lot bigger.\u201d Espeon said, still growing. At this point all you could see was Gyarados\u2019s head and finns, the rest of it was buried under Espeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty quickly returned Gyarados to it\u2019s pokeball. She stared at it again, not sure what to do. Espeon quicker her growth, rapidly filling the arena, her head approaching the ceiling. Espeon had deliberately positioned herself so she would be casting a shadow over Misty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty gave one more look at the wall of fluff in front of her and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think I can take on a pokemon that big... you win.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon lowered her head, partly s she wouldn\u2019t hit the ceiling. \u201cThank you. I must admit your pokemon gave me more trouble than most gym leaders.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh thanks?\u201d She looked at you again. \u201cHow did your Espeon do that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how to answer but Espeon was prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cONe part natural talent, one part my wonderful trainer. \u201c She put a paw on you, then looked to her crowd with a wink \u201cOne part my adoring fans!\u201d. A small part of the crowd gave a cheer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty handed you a badge shaped like a tear drop and your Espeon began to slowly shrink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have a towel? I think I need to dry off. When I\u2019m smaller obviously.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I suppose it\u2019s easier to put on a good show if everyone is enjoying it. Thank you, I had forgotten that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step outside you both the sky was reddening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost sunset? How long have we been doing this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t stopped to think about it before, Espeon had walked many miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve traveled to half the gyms in Kanto, are you not tired?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOddly no. I suppose whatever is making me so strong is also keeping me energized? But I imagine you must be.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps everything that happened had distracted you, but you suddenly realize how hungry you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to get a bite to eat? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be nice. I\u2019d love to sample the food around here! Lets go!\u201d She levitated you onto her back. \u201cI hope we can find an all we can eat!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait we don\u2019t know our way around this city. Maybe I should ask one of my fans for recommendations. Though we could try a couple of different places if need be.\u201d She licked her lips at thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rare to see Espeon enthusiastic about food. Although she had a sweet tooth, she almost never indulged it, fearing she might put on some pounds and spoil her \u201cperfect figure\u201d. Perhaps her new abilities made her less worried, or growing so large made her hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to get any smaller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. But I\u2019d prefer to try enlarging my food. Hmm I wonder if I could re-flavour food?\u201d She thought about it for a moment. \u201cAnyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon chased after a fan, running so fast you thought she had forgot you were on her back for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK lets go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still running at full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem hungry today\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr I\u2019m looking forward to the experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to a nice looking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this looks promising.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon took a sniff off the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts smells promising to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dashed through the doors, quickly shrinking so you would duck under the door, the lifted you off her back and shifted back to her previous size. Was she getting quicker at this? It did seem to be coming naturally to her. She took another whiff of the air and walked up tot the server.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll you can eat for two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pay up, while Espeon skips along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached for a plate, though Espeon was already ahead of you, levitating plate around and her and loading up on at least one of everything on offer. Fittingly for the locale most of the available food was seafood but there was other stuff to. Espeon was normally slow and deliberate when it came to picking up food but not today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, her food was stacked high, and the tower was wide enough that If she wasn\u2019t holding it in place with her power, it would fall apart and drop to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted the plate just above her and concentrated. After several seconds the plate and the food multiplied in size! It was big enough that it might not fit on the table A few people stared and gasped but for once Espeon didn\u2019t care, licking her lips as she looked at it. She turned to you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s another trick to add to my *ahem* growing arsenal.\u201d You suppressed a groan. \u201cNow lets see how it tastes.\u201d She lifted a sushi roll and chewed it slowly, spinning it around her mouth to savour it. \u201cMmmm! I mean.. it is good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut her off before she could make the obvious remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrowing Pokemon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns, clearly annoyed you beat her to the punchline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. And I feel like cutting loose today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you do mine? Though not quite as much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe concentrated and yours plate and food doubled in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon ate unusually slowly, take one piece at a time and chewing it far more than needed, sometimes making little noises of pleasure. You tried to eat yours, but her display was distracting.. and somewhat intriguing. She had previously approached meal times with a utilitarian approach but today she was letting down her\u2026 fur? It was amusing watching her enjoy her meal like this, at first she was self conscious, making a show of eating in a very dignified way, but as she went she became less self conscious and more focused on enjoying herself, savouring each bite and letting each piece rest on her tongue before swallowing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm.. I feel like a world I have missed out on has been opened to me. Now I would like to try this thing called \u201calcohol.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull back against your chair and look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d You\u2019ve never seen a Pokemon drunk before, let alone one like your Espeon. Considering how powerful Espeon was that could be down right dangerous. Would she be able to properly control her powers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh relax I\u2019m not going to drink that much. And I\u2019m a big, strong Pokemon, a little liquor isn\u2019t going to send me out of control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you did go out of control I\u2019d have no way of stopping you, aside from sending you back to your pokeball. And I\u2019m not sure it could hold you if you didn\u2019t want it to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think a little alcohol would turn me into a raging beast?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo but it can make people forget themselves. And I don\u2019t know how it would affect a Pokemon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon thought for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph if you\u2019re that worried, I\u2019ll start with a small amount and see what it does. Garcon some of your finest wine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hesitated, unsure if they should serve a pokemon. Espeon looked at you expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,  she can handle it. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey brought over a bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon enlarged the bottle and glass but only in proportion to her size and took a cautious sip. She pulled back her head and stuck out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh such a strange taste, why do humans drink this stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think its takes a while to get used to the taste. Though people don\u2019t just drink it for the taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another sip and recoiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted the glass and chugged it down. She looked around, waiting for something to happen. She scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now? Am I suppose to feel something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to take time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr I\u2019m a lot tougher than a human and need something stronger\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon got a second round of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it I'm still not feeling anything. Garcon your strongest alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait Espeon-\u201d\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, I\u2019m not going to drink enough to go out of control, I\u2019ll drink what\u2019s brought before me, and if that doesn\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll put this idea behind me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest further, the server came back with a small glass.  Espeon scrutinised it and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a tiny glass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon telekentically lifted the glass,  and in a flash of light, the glass enlarged it till it was at least 10 times its size. Before you could say anything she drained it in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh relax I didn't feel anything from last one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd still nothing. As if your puny human drink could affect me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to her food as though nothing happened. A few seconds later she rapidly growing, doubling in size by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a roar and swung your head. You jump out from your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon stop please!\u201d</span></div></div>",

That some wine and a little glass could do that to me?\u201d<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared. You didn\u2019t want to admit but your heart was pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrank back down to her previous size and rested a paw on you, still laughing but trying to stop herself from doing so<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to give you as much of a fright as that. But you should know I\u2019d never hurt you. You should have seen the look on your face!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to drink anymore, it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m immune anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually finished off her her plate, only to get up and get another. You would have expected her to be full after even eating half of that, but she was making and even bigger tower of food then her first set. She enlarged it again and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she had a sudden growth spurt. Not as much as before, but she was at least a foot taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoahhh now I'm feeling it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon you\u2019re not going to jump scare me again are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no- this time I think it\u2019s working!\u201dShe grew another foot or so and laughed,  but it\u2019s not her usual laugh, its higher pitched and off tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted back in your seat, unsure of what she was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDun worry, I told you I wouldn\u2019t be a rampaging beast!\u201d She had another growth spurt and gave that same laugh. \u201cWow this feels good! Now I see why humans do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon why are you growing again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d She looked behind her, apparently surprised she was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow. Maybe it\u2019s just cause I feel happy!\u201d She had another growth spurt, then concentrated, though it seemed to take her more effort, before shrining down to her previous size. You could see a goofy smile and her cheeks had reddened and  not from embarrassment. \u201cI lost track of things for a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou definety shouldn\u2019t drink anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh relax!\u201d<br>\r\nWithout warning she pounced on you, pinning on your back. She hugged you and nuzzled her face against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas I ever told I love having you a trainer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh thanks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t pressing against you very hard, but it was enough to stop you moving. You could feel her fur coat against your body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nuzzled against, not caring who was watching. She was also getting bigger again, her body pushing away your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cuh Espeon. You tried to point behind her at the people watching, though you had trouble moving your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at them quickly but didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm.\u201d She continued nuzzling you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon I think you had enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno I feel gooooddd.\u201d She gave another strange laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell at least she wasn\u2019t an angry drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm since she was drunk she would be less guarded Maybe you could get her to talk.  You weren't sure about some of the answers she gave on your ride to Cerulean, and she would be much less guarded now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cCause it feels good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean collecting fans, collecting power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you like you were stupid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYer like I said it feels good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you plan to do after?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung her head back then shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno? Get big? Get really big?\u201d She stretched out her paws and laughed again, also growing bigger again. \u201cI don't make grand plans I just want to keep doing this because its fun!\u201d\t\t<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you were joking about taking over the world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat again? Course! What would I even do with a world? Not like I know how to govern!\u201d She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath a sigh of relief. You\u2019re pretty sure she\u2019s in no condition to lie to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at you, though had trouble maintaining a focused stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the questions? I thought we were enjoying ourselves!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I just wondered what comes next. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped off you and back to where she was, though she landed in an awkward heap and with a loud thud.<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, lets just worry about next when it comes next!\u201d She further enlarged her food, though it shook awkwardly. You suspect her grip on her powers was loosening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate a more quickly now, though still stopped to enjoy and savour some of it, but was a lot less deliberate now. Though she seemed to be having even more fun now, wearing that relaxed, goofy smile, and casually stretched herself out instead of sitting in a dignified way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fun as this was to watch, you were afraid of what might happen if she stayed this drunk. Although she clearly wasn\u2019t a mean drunk, you wondered what would happen if she decided it would be funny to grow to the size of an office building or larger and staggered around<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ordered several pints of water and encouraged her to drink it, in the hopes it would sober her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon casually drained each glass in between bites, and after she finished her second plate, she got up for a third, though she momentarily struggled to lift herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you full?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bought her plate around and enlarged it even further. It clearly took some effort for her to eat it but she still pressed on. You could see her belly starting to push out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you had enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me when I had enough!\u201d Ironically she was sounding a little more like her hold self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a lot of time and effort, but eventually she emptied her plate and let out a content sigh.<br>\r\nYou had never seen her eat anywhere near that much, even adjusted for her size. She placed some paws on her belly, which brushed again the floor. She let out a belch and quickly covered her mouth and looked sheepish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me!.\u201d She purred, rubbing her stomach. \u201cI never knew how good food could taste. We should do this more often!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ate like a-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her head and glared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say Snorlax!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking giant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm.. I suppose I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you worried people are going to see that when you grow really big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colour drained out her face. She frantically looked around. Fortunately for her, most people had cleared out. It had taken Espeon so long, that it was almost closing time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!I better get rid of this!\" She was sounding more like her old self now, though you could still her some of the sing song quality in her voice she had before. She concentrated and tried to move it around. \u201cGah. I\u2019ll have to figure this out in the morning\t.. maybe I just need some time to digest this.\u201d She jumped up and tried to run but was much slower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh NOW I feel tired. Can we go somewhere to sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you thinking of a hotel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we sleep under the stars? There\u2019s something I want to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it cold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I have an idea to keep you warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we can give a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, lets get out of here.\u201d She lifted you on her back and bolted for the door, though she was a lot slower and wobbled a bit. She levitated you off her back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ride me for a bit, I think I need some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh I really did eat too much.. I wish I could manipulate my digestion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno but I don\u2019t want to try right now, my heads still spinning and what if I mess up something inside of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a teasing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said you were immune to alcohol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine even I have my limits, lets just get out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She tried to run ahead, though right now you had little trouble keeping up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEast of Cereuluen I saw a clearing without too many people, lets go there. Give me a moment first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a moment, then I\u2019ll get us out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes rest, she let you on her back again, riding through the city, though also trying to avoid being seen by too many people. Fortunately for Espeon, Cerulean was quiet at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven slowed as she was, it didn\u2019t take her too long to get you out of the city, and once a safe distance from it she grew about as tall as a house and carried you down route 9, which was deserted at this time of night. At least you couldn't see anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoute 10 was particularly sparse, continuing little more than stone pillars and a lake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks like a good spot, right in the middle of nowhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I an get myself together.\u201d She put a paw against her forehead. You suspected she was rethinking some of her life choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gritted her teeth and concentrated. A purple woolly looking blanket formed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt it. It was rough, but thick, and you figured it would do well against the cold. Not bad for a first attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks good, thank you Espeon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Would you like a pillow?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. She started shrinking down, settling for around twice your height. You wonder why she shrank down instead of just making it? Was it easier for her or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe concentrated and a big pillow formed, resembling the one she liked to use at home, though not as well. She lay across and looked satisfied. You looked confused but this only amused her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm you\u2019re wondering where you pillow is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome closer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did she sprang up and pulled you down, holding you against her chest., she lifted the blanket over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, this should keep you warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I hope I make a good bed.

You look up. Espeon\u2019s eyes are still shut but you could hear her Mumbling, purring? She was getting larger by the second. You first instinct was to shout her awake but you were curious. Maybe you could learn something about what she was thinking, and you wanted to watch. You wiggle free of her grasp and find a spot where you can get a full view of her face, without being smothered by her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purring she makes is a little unclear. You wonder if you\u2019re hearing her say more? But you\u2019ve never heard her use her mouth to talk. She was bristling around, clearly excited. She raised her head then her paws. Her growth was speeding up, she was more than double the size she was when you slept  but it was only gaining momentum, she double again, then again, her body crashed through the stone pillars around her, but some how this didn\u2019t wake her either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if you should stop this before  she was too big too hear you, but you couldn't bring yourself to do so, besides there wasn\u2019t much around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose higher and higher, soon she was the size she was at Saffron, then the size she used to travel from Caledon to Cerulean which you assumed to be her max size but she was still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how big could she get? She had already towered over every building you come across. You ran as her body smashed more of the surroundings. She was rolling around, clearly excited..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrrrr!\u201d Her growth tapered off and stopped, but she had grown this much in hours? Whatever was happening to increase her powers seemed to be happening more and faster. She rolled around a little then finally her eyes opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm.\u201d She looked around, clearly confused. At first she actually looked disappointed. Presumably she was even bigger in her dreams?! Then she smiled. she looked at her paws and let out a shriek. Shifting herself and searching frantically for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran over to her \u201cEspeon it\u2019s ok I\u2019m here!\u201d She didn\u2019t hear you at first so you shouted again, as loudly as you could. She still searched for you. You were smaller than a flea compared to her so it wasn\u2019t that shocking, though so far she had been able to hear you regardless of size.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrainer? Where are you?\u201d You hear her though speech. Despite her size she isn\u2019t bothering to \u201cboom\u201d her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I just feel you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe head swings in your direction. Even bent down her head towers high into the sky. She lowered it slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon I\u2019m right here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you her pupils widening, then she relaxed and breathed a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rested her head against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run over to her and place a hand on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok Espeon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she calms down she suddenly looks embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought-\u201d She breathed another sigh. \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t hear you, I have to concentrate to hear people at this size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts ok I got out of the way when you started growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Her ears twitched and she looked away from you. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear me talking in my sleep did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I don\u2019t speak Espeon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha I suppose not. To you it would just sound like I\u2019m saying my name over and over again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it actually sounded more like purring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm.. I guess that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you dreaming about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-\u201d She paused for a second.\u201cWell.. hmm I suppose you can guess I had dreamed of being bigger. And I admit I wondered what it would be like to be admired by cities, or perhaps regions at a time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she lying? She was definitely keeping something back. You held your gaze and she relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe there was a little more\u2026 but Its embarrassing. I\u2019d like to keep it to myself for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEating more delicious food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked sheepish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.. Maybe.\" I did enjoy myself last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what else she was dreaming of but you didn\u2019t know how much you should push. She  stood up slowly, her head so high up that you struggled to even make out her chin, while her body seemed to stretch forever.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\u201cBut check out these gains!\u201d </b></font> </font>She boomed her voice again, the sudden loudness almost knocking you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step back. You could feel the ground shake as she moved, even very slowly, and her body stretched for what seemed forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b> \u201cI must be at least a mile long, maybe two!\u201d</b></font></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare impressed. She lifts you with her telekenesis, allowing you to take in just how larger she is. A single strand of her would be many times larger than your entire body. You couldn\u2019t even take much of her in at once, all you could see was an endless wall of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you on top of her head, by her building sized ears. You looked down and felt a rush of dizziness at how far away the ground was. When you recovered your bearings you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you think your powers are increasing at a fast rate?\u201d<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n\u201cYes! I bet I\u2019ll be even bigger tomorrow!

Give me a chance to practice\u2026 before I get even larger!\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the feeling of awe wore of, you couldn\u2019t resist a chance to tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about your belly? From up her everyone for miles must see it.\u201d You could imagine her enormous eyes widen, and felt the \u201cground\u201d you were standing on shake as her mouth fell open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted a paw  She felt it and her face reddened. Everything around you shook as Espeon rapidly shrank down, eventually removing you from her back and shrinking down to normal Espeon size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cExcuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bounded off at a speed you rarely saw her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon sometimes disappeared in the morning and at other ties for\u2026 less graceful moments. Even with you she liked to keep a certain mystique<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half  an hour later she came back, looking thinner, though there was still a small bulge around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever you mind.\u201d Her expression softened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you from your sleep and I\u2019m sorry I lost control. I really did drink too much.\u201d She clutched her head. \u201cI think im understanding this thing humans call a hangover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrink lots of water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was already doing that. It\u2019s one reason I- Never mind. Do you think a  full heal works on a hang over? Maybe an antidote?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take out a full heal and spray her. She gives a moderate smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter, but it\u2019s not completely gone. But good enough. I\u2019ll have to watch what I drink next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both look up. The sun had barely, the first rays of morning filling the sky. It was  earlier than you were used to being up and you were fighting the grogginess of sleep.  Espeon however showed no signs of tired, looking as alert she did yesterday afternoon and pacing on the spot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t  you feel tired?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not at all. In fact I feel bursting with energy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I probably need less sleep like this\u2026 but dreaming is such fun. But I suppose you're feeling tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am thinking, we could get some breakfast, then I could walk slowly to Fuchsia city, making my body a good bed for you. Maybe you could gt some sleep along the way? I\u2019ll try and walk slowly so not to wake you.\u201d Her lips spring into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m more than happy to savor the view at my current maximum size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure it would work but you figured it was worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon grew to around twice your height, place you on her back and sprinted for Cerulean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait if my growing woke you up, why didn\u2019t you wake me? I would have stopped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug.  Espeon laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, did you want to watch the show?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might have been it. Or I was curious what you\u2019d do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm how interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, would anywhere in Cerulean be open now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh we\u2019ll find something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to reach Ceruelean. It was quiet, but not completely dead, apparently there were people who went to work at this time. After some searching you find a pancake house that Espeon likes the smell of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted you off her back and just a little taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about putti-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll pace myself better, at least till I get better at shaping my-\u201d She cut herself off, not even wanting to say belly. \u201cI just got carried away yesterday, I\u2019m so used to watching my figure. But if I\u2019m careful I should be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Espeon's gem glowed quite brilliantly, almost causing you to shield your eyes as you looked at her. You squinted as you started to notice that the things in your peripheral vision looked...odd. Your pokedex started to feel heavier too. Just what was going on? As your vision adjusted that's when you took notice around you. The room was expanding out around you...as was the pokedex in your hand, which was now as large as a thick, full on box to you. Startled, you dropped it, it starting to get too heavy to hold onto anyway. As you looked forward at the couch, and Espeon lazing on it with her flowing gem, it started to dawn on you how big SHE was looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon, are you shrinking me!?\" You said startled before her voice chimed in your head. \"Yup I am! Remember, you agreed!\" She seemed quite pleased with herself as you looked around at your stuff as the shrinking started to slow. The table across the way rose as if it were a grand cathedral, your shelves looked to be tall buildings you'd see in the city, and looming above you, in her full glory, your Espeon was a living monument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw almost dropped as you looked at her, and that's when you felt yourself lifting up as she used her psychic to bring you towards her, her form even more impressive and imposing looking as she held you in front of her face. You looked at her, and she at you for a moment or two of silence before she spoke telepathically once again. \"You're so small and adorable!\" She seemed enthusiastic as she nuzzled you with her power against her cheek. You opened your mouth to speak, only to find that all you accomplished was getting thick, lilac covered fur in your mouth. You internally wondered just how this was possible. You knew your Espeon was powerful. Stupidly, absurdly powerful, but this was on another level...she could SHRINK living things. That was absolute insanity! As you thought this, you were pulled back in front of her face, smiling at you as you took the moment to think on your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon...you can shrink things now...\" You said, somewhat in awe as she nodded. \"And grow them too! Though I didn't want to destroy the house, so I opted to do this instead! Cool huh?\" She said and you rubbed your hand to your chin. At least she wasn't keeping you entirely immobilized in her psychic grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's certainly impressive.\" You said, not entirely sure how you felt about the implications of this yet. If what she said was true then there wasn't a shadow of a doubt in your mind, she had to be the most powerful pokemon out there. \"Though i'm on the fence on if I like it or not...\" You said, entirely unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you wouldn't at first though, just give it time!\" It was then that she shifted and adjusted you and placed you down near her belly as she reclined. Seeing her from this angle truly made you feel insignificant...you gulped as she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I wouldn't dream of doing anything to you! You know that!\" She said, as if she sensed how you were feeling. You nodded as you decided to take in more of your surroundings...wow, your TV looked like it was practically a movie screen at the local theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea thrills you could find at this size was tempting too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, why don't we go out and about? Maybe to the park?\" Espeon asked hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\" You asked and she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally! I can only imagine what it would be like! And i'm so tired of being cooped up...\" She asked sadly. The idea was interesting, and Espeon hadn't been out for a while...it might do her some good to get some fresh air, maybe play at the park. As powerful as she was, she tended to be pretty friendly with others outside of battle. Though the hazards for you at this size were something to consider too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ultimately didn't take you long to come to a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, you figure that if anyone could protect you at this size it would be Espeon so perhaps you could risk a trip to the park for her. It was what she wanted and from experience you knew she can get a tad hyperactive if she doesn't get out of the house every now and then. You sighed. \"Okay, okay, we can go to the park if you want but you <i>have</i> to look after me, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon's face lit up at your words. \"Of course I would look after you, let's go!\" You soon found yourself being levitated over her head before the psychic energy around you suddenly dissipated. As gravity pulled you down you let out a yelp that was cut short as your body collided with the top of her head, letting you grab at her pink fur in a desperate panic. Now stabilized near the back of her head you huffed as the brief rush of adrenaline left you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please be more careful?\" You begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" She feigned before crouching up. The shift in view gave you a brief sensation of vertigo as Espeon stood up and jumped her way off the couch. You almost felt like you were about to be flung off when you felt a pressure push you back down onto her. Letting out a sigh of relief you tried to calm your nerves because at least she was well aware of how vulnerable you were right now. The psychic-type was the only one that could possibly protect you if anything happened right now. Making her way through the house you couldn't help but notice how deadly the drop from the top of her body to the floor looked. Ignoring that thought you noticed Espeon had already found her way to the sliding door at the back of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her psychic powers, the door slid open with ease. She left the house and closed the door behind her, even flicking the lock of the door up as she walked away from it. You were somewhat glad Espeon chose to avoid taking the main street to the park since you weren't really looking forward to being discovered at this size. Taking the path through the small undeveloped woodland behind your house would be a quicker route, anyway. As for your back yard, it was small but from your perspective atop Espeon's head it looked impossibly large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to wonder how she was going to get out of the yard, though. A large wooden fence with trees looming over it surrounded the yard and there was no door attached to it. Was there a hole under it somewhere you didn't know about? You were snapped from your pondering as you noticed Espeon was leisurely heading straight for a segment of fence with no obvious pathway she could take. A shiver ran down your spine as you realized she was just going to jump it. \"Espeon?\" You worriedly called out. There was no reply but you could almost sense a mischievous smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling apprehensive about her doing acrobatics while you were this small so you pressed yourself down and grabbed onto her fur. You had a sneaking suspicion that she discreetly made you smaller as she made her way out of the house but you were almost glad she did because it allowed you to wrap her pink fur around your hands. Espeon poised to make the jump and you hid the view of the world from sight as you hunkered down. Gravity pulled you back as she jumped and soon you found your legs dangling free in the air when she cleared the fence, elegantly landing on the other side. Although, that elegance was lost on you as gravity caught up to you. Once again you found yourself recovering after being tossed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Espeon was walking along as if nothing happened. Catching your breath you called out to her. \"Did I do something wrong?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? Going over the fence was the fastest route to the park.\" She said. Her voice had a casual air to it but you could hear an inflection that sounded like she was trying to withhold laughter. \"Besides, if you did fall off I could have easily caught you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what you meant when you said I wouldn't like it at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay... Sorry.\" Espeon apologized, sounding a bit more sincere. \"I'll be more careful with you, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You said after letting out a relieved sigh. She was just having fun but it was clear she didn't really understand things from your perspective. From the looks of things she was starting to approach the park and passing a few more trees you soon found yourself in a large plaza. In the middle was a large fountain surrounded by neatly trimmed hedges and uniform grey bricks that were stretching in a few directions to different locations of the park. There were a few people and Pokemon around the place, either out for a walk or sitting on one of the various benches talking. In the distance you could even see some trainers having a battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon stayed at the border of the park by the trees and turned her head from side to side as if she was looking for something. Then, you found yourself being telekinetically plucked from her head and levitated in front of her face. \"What should we do?\" She excitedly asked. She left you no time to suggest something as she came up with suggestions of her own. \"Hey, want to go challenge one of those trainers to a battle? Sitting up there you could see what a Pokemon battle is like from <i>my</i> perspective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound safe.\" You said. It also sounded like more of being thrown around like when she jumped over the fence, something that definitely won't be comfortable for you. It would definitely be a thrill-ride, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget who you're talking to. Did you just want to go for a walk or something then? We could look around or find a nice sunny spot.\" Espeon suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, that sounds relaxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh, I forgot!\" She suddenly piped up.  \"I promised my friend that I would go and meet him when I got this ability working. He lives here and he helped me learn how to use the ability properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, does he know how to change the size of things as well?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon laughed. \"No, he was sort of my test subject.\" She must have seen the worried look you were giving her and clarified. \"And no, I didn't force him, he actually volunteered to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Letting out a small snicker, she continued. \"Besides, I'm pretty sure he's into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Okay then,\" you said. Moving on you tried to shift the conversation to the matter of what the two of you will be doing with your time about the park. \"Alright, so How about we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cut off as Espeon suddenly started to fidget on the spot, clearly excited. You suddenly regret not spending more time with her and letting her work off some of that pent up energy. \"We're gonna have so much fun! Okay, here's what we're gonna do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a second before she quickly decided the activity for you, swiftly levitating you back to the top of her head as she announces her decision. She decides to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I promise to not let any harm befall you.\" She carefully put you back and waited till you were settled in. \"I suppose I'll try to be a bit less... vigorous. Or i'll carry you the other way if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her caviler attitude, you were sure she was serious about protecting you. She sat back down, still looking for her friend. Instead of running around, she seemed  content to fidget with her front paws instead. You start to relax. Although it wasn't very thick, her fur was soft and surprisingly comfortable. Then you start to wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you meet this friend?\" You don't remember anyone mentioning Espeon shrinking things in your walks with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I detect a note of a jealousy?\" She said playfully. \"He posted on my fanclub and i arranged to meet him on one of my walks.\" Espeon, being very independent would sometimes leave to go for walks on her own. Or other activities you weren't sure about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he isn't a pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon huffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha. I can be friends with humans to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't saying otherwise-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway like a lot of others in my fan club he was fascinated by my powers, and he to is a budding pyschic, though nowhere near my level of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" You weren't sure what to say that. While the last remark might have been a little conceited, it was true you didn't know a human psychic as powerful as your espeon. But then you didn't know too many psychic in the first place. But from what you heard it was rare for them to match the more powerful psychic Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there is he is!\" Espeon reared up, waving her paws at someone. You clutched on tightly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked behind, watching you repostion yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, got lost in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran forward, though tried to make her movements more steady than before. You were not at risk of being knocked off Espeon, but you could feel a bump with each step. Looking up you see someone about your age and even of a similar appearance, smiling at your espeon with expectation and curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon breaks, the sudden stop nearly flinging you forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Careful!\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, still getting used to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure in front of you looks confused, not sure who Espeon is talking to. Espeon smiles and looks at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Eric. You'll be happy to know I made progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Espeon's telekinetic grip around you again as your hoisted you above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my trainer, he's raised snce I was a little eevee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looks at you as though you were a science project, still with that same fascinated smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow you managed to shrink him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon gestured to Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is Eric, a member of my fanclub, and a budding psychic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but I'm nothing on you Espeon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway would you like to see my new power first hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric pumped his fist into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't even a little bit nervous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon put you down her head, presumably to allow you a front row seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help feel nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon are you sure this is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax I know what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gem glowed and a pink light surrounded Eric.

As you thought this, you were pulled back in front of her face, smiling at you as you took the moment to think on your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon...you can shrink things now... and grow them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still shrinking and she was still growing, now longer than your entire couch.<br>\r\n\"How big are you gong to get and how small am I going to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, I think it will stop soon, and I can always try to fix it. Don't worry I won't let you get microscopic, though if you did I'd let you live on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't appreciate the attempt at humor though you didn't feel like arguing. She placed you her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we get outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to the park! Don't worry I'll take good care of you.\" She said, maneuvering through you sitting room, and brushing against some furniture as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaky of her to tack that on but maybe not a bad idea</span></div></div>",

It seemed like the ticking clock had some kind of hypnotic power. Either that, or you were incredibly bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have gladly played with your pokemon to fight off the boredom, but, sadly, she was upstairs, in your bedroom, sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found the lines growing blurry, your whole being begging you to shut your book and take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored the sensation and kept reading, sipping your coffee more often, until the cup was completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed resignedly as you finally decided to listen to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you closed your book and got up, heading to the living room where the couch seemed to be inviting you to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn invitation you gladly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid down, tentatively glancing at the TV. You shook your head, deciding against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, your eyes closed, your heart and breath slowed down as you relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, it didn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sy!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething silky and heavy dropped onto you, giving out happy cries. If it wasn't so noisy, you could've told that you were hit by a heavy, silky blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened a bit, revealing a moving mix of white, pink and blue. You smiled: it looked like <i>she</i> had woken up from her own nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, fully opening your eyes to notice a happy Sylveon standing on top of you, staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah... you wanna play Sylveon?\" you laughed as she stood back, letting you sit upright. You reached out to pet her head and, in response, she nuzzled your hand lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had Sylveon since she was an Eevee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Eevee that loved being around you. She was always full of energy, and liked to play with you several times a day, being pampered, and she liked you in particular. Also, she was a bit mischievous, you could tell by her sometimes sneaking behind you and performing a \u2018playful\u2019 Take Down on you. The results were hilarious... to her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surprise when the little brown fox began glowing one day. When the glow died down, you had a Sylveon staring at you with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe you expected it a bit, but it still was a big surprise: it meant that your pokemon loved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sy!</span>\" Sylveon exclaimed happily, jumping in your arms; four silky ribbons wrapped around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily, you hugged back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did lose some of her old habits when she evolved, though she still liked to play with you or you pampering her. Both things happened quite often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being affectionate today, huh?\" you stated, Sylveon giving a happy cry in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you took notice of something odd: one of her ribbons was pointing to the glass door that led outside, to your backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go outside, Sylveon?\" you asked, well aware of what the answer was going to be. In fact, the white and pink pokemon nodded her head twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, you put her down. She hastily jumped from the couch and ran to the glass door, standing on her hind legs as she pushed against the glass, shooting you an expectant look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming.\" you calmly said, happy to have something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the glass door and open it. Your overexcited Sylveon bolted outside. You briefly wondered why she was acting like this: she stopped being hyperactive when she evolved. Were some of her old instincts coming back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to let it slide with a shrug as you glanced at Sylveon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that she was sitting in the middle of the backyard, looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">On!</span>\" four ribbons rose, two pointed to you, two fell on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... uh... want to show me something?\" you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon nodded repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked towards your pokemon, who craned her neck to look at you. She began snickering, and you wondered if you had to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What do you have to show me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon grinned at you, before she...</span></div></div>",

But what was she trying to show you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever instead of opening her feelers and releasing the Fairy Wind, Sylveon jumped and danced around. You looked on in confusion, though this only seemed to amuse and encourage her, as her dancing got quicker and mover vigorous. You noticed she had kept feelers shut for far longer than normal, and the glow of blue was getting brighter. She kept dancing until the blue light  was almost blinding then leapt into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively  stepped back, expecting her to unleash the fairy wind on you but  when she opened her feelers they were pointing at her, not you. A powerful blast of wind was unleashed, if it had been in your direction, you'd have certainly be knocked off your feet. As it is you are merely pushed back a few steps. Sylveon flies into the air with a giddy cry<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nPink dust fills the air and you can't see where she went. Is she ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around for her, you suddenly noticed a large and pink and white object falling from the sky.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The summer heat combined with the physical exertion of pulling back branches and pushing past dense shrubbery left you sweating as you tried to catch up to your Ninetales. This was the fourth time this week you two had decided to go exploring in the dense forest to the side of town which was both a vast historical site and a nature reserve. A long-gone civilization used to live where the forest grew and the evidence of their once-great city lay strewn about almost everywhere. Large weathered statues, stone foundations and vine-covered pillars were intermingled among the vegetation. One of the common themes among the eroded ruins were depictions of Ninetales, be it faded stone carvings or large stone statues which led Historians to believe that this ancient society worshiped them. Although, some of them argued that they actually revered a single, specific Ninetales as a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally, these ruins also happened to be where you first found Ninetales when she was just a little Vulpix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurely by chance, one day you got lost as you walked off one of the interpretive trails and came across a large stone statue of a Ninetales. It was sitting on its haunches on a blocky pedestal and between its two stone legs was a curled up Vulpix. She was so exhausted, bony and weak that you were able to simply scoop her up in your arms without resistance. After taking her to a Pokemon center and getting her healed up you began bonding with her and suddenly you were taking her home to live with you. Present day - she had evolved and grew into an adventurous and strong Ninetales, a stark contrast to the meek little Vulpix you first met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDucking under a vine-laden branch you emerged into a small clearing where your Ninetales was waiting and you could see why she was so needy in her demands for you to catch up. Rows upon rows of stone pillars jutted up into the canopy as light shafts beamed down through the trees. You had to take a moment to take in the sight before you could move again, moments like these is why you loved exploring the forest with  Ninetales. The ruins covered an extremely large area and she had a knack of finding cool new areas you haven't explored yet. You couldn't stand still and take in the sight forever, though. You could see Ninetales' fluffy tails bobbing to and fro as she left and started walking in between the rows of pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching up to her and walking between the pillars you could see that the that they were forming what looked like a walkway through the forest. Naturally, you two decided to travel along it and see where it leads. Walking besides Ninetales she would often look back up at you with her happy red eyes as she excitedly trotted along. The path was surprisingly long and even started winding to the left and right but eventually the repeating pillars abruptly ended. Looking around all you saw were trees and it didn't seem to actually lead anywhere. Pulling out your phone to check the time you decided it was probably a good idea to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninetales, It's about time we head back.\" You called out. Pulling your eyes up from the phone you noticed the distinct lack of disappointing whining and you couldn't see hide nor hair of her. It was only for the crunch of a stick did you spot her tan fur through the bushes. With a sigh you started the bush-bashing again to catch up to her. Parsing through another set of bushes and branches you emerged into a rather large clearing. A lone statue of a Ninetales stood on a small hill surrounded by nothing but grass, the trees thinning out around it to reveal the blue sky. Taking in the sight, a realization dawned on you. This was where you found Ninetales when she was just a Vulpix!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales was staring at the statue from a distance and it was clear she remembered it. You couldn't help but smile and cross your arms as she slowly approached the statue as you waited for her to finish having her sentimental moment. She drew nearer to the statue before she hesitantly brought her snout up to the weathered stone to sniff at it. You jumped in fright when the statue shined brilliantly for a second before the light appeared to transfer over to your Ninetales, your Pokemon now taking on that same glow as if she was evolving again. She was shining so bright it was difficult to look directly at her but before you knew it the glowing stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed over to her to check if she was okay. Kneeling down you stroked the fur on the side of her face as you tried to get her to look at you. \"Are you okay, girl?\" You asked her. She had a look of being utterly dumbfounded but it seemed nothing about her was changed, her expression flitting between confusion, contemplation and finally understanding. \"Ninetales?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped as if she forget you were there but now she was looking at you with a happy, excited face. You rubbed the soft fur on her neck as she stared at you. The strange glow didn't seem to harm her but you could tell that something was definitely different about her. As you tried to inspect her for what could have possibly changed about her you became aware of the fact that you were having to hold your arm up higher and higher to pet the fur on her neck. Not only that but when you knelt down next to her she was eye level with you and now you found yourself craning your neck to look up at her. Your face scrunched up in confusion as you tried to comprehend what was happening...</span></div></div>",

Mike starred at the slot machine as though hypnotised. Red bags formed under his eyes and his arm had grown heavy after constantly pulling that lever but he couldn\u2019t stop now. He was on a losing streak but he was certain the next pull would change that.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe reels turned. Another miss. He would have to try again. He pulled the leaver again. Nothing. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMike was so absorbed by the slot machine he didn\u2019t notice a pokeball shake loose from his belt. It dropped to the floor. With a flash of white light a Lilligant emerged from it. Several casino goes turned there heads at the sight, but Mike was still focused on the slot machine, not even noticing what had happened. The lilligant stared up at it\u2019s trainer, surprised and somewhat distressed she hadn\u2019t been noticed. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cLilli?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMike took no notice.

The stranger machine clearly held her trainer captive. She tugged at him, but was ignored yet again. She applied more force, grabbing both his legs and pushing with all her might, but Mike easily pulled away. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe called to him once more and was ignored. Something needed to be done, but what? <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t want to do this but saw no other way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilligant looked around. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything that could help her and her trainer wasn\u2019t responding. Something had to be done but what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilligant thought intensely. An idea occurred to her, something she normally wouldn\u2019t do, but this was an emergency,  if she didn\u2019t act now her trainer could remain captive to that machine forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Uggggghhh, this is such a pain! I can\u2019t believe I managed to get lost the second i set foot here!  Now I\u2019m stumbling around in a dark forest like an idiot to find my way back. Just great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy i went into this god forsaken forest in the first place was because my mother wanted me to gather berries for the cake that she was going to make, since she had sprained her ankle a little and had me do it instead. Even though it probably would\u2019ve been easier to let me just go to a store, my mother insisted that the cake would taste better if Mother Nature had a hand in the making of it. Well, since she was stubborn to use berries not coming directly from the forest, i actually never tasted any berries coming from a store, same with all the other fruits growing in this forest, so i\u2019m not sure if Mother Nature\u2019s magic touch did much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, i got to admit: the fruits that grow here do make for some delicious cakes as well as other pastries my mom feels makes. So despite me not knowing the layout of the forest, i agreed to go in anyway because the cake those berries were going to be a part of would\u2019ve definitely been worth it. And yet, here i am...... *sigh*, here i am indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah, no dice after who-knows how many hours of wandering around aimlessly. I guess the silver lining here is that i was able to fully surround myself with Mother Nature, as well as understanding despair a little bit better. While i could say that the fact i found a good berries plucking spot was the silver lining here, it\u2019s not like i get to enjoy those berries in the form i want, at least not today. The only thing i get to enjoy now was the dreadful taste of the despair i understand now oh-so clearly; almost tastes like bitter almonds if you ask me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, i could hear a faint sound coming somewhere at my right. I had no idea what it was. My best guess was that it a pokemon crying, since i find it hard to imagine a kid being here in the woods so late at night, unless they were stupid enough to get lost...... wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-well it doesn\u2019t really matter what let to this moment. If a pokemon is sad or hurt, you have to do everything you can to help them. That\u2019s what i have been taught to do if i ever were to become a pokemon trainer. And while i am at the age to become one, i wasn\u2019t able to since two of the three starter pokemon in Professor Elm\u2019s lab have already been taken, and one of them has even been stolen! Though I admittedly forgot which one when the professor told me about. Following that up, he told me to come back when the replacement starter pokemon have arrived, but he also said that it will take a while since those pokemon aren\u2019t very common, unless i was fine with taking the one remaining pokeball. I agreed to wait for the replacements because I wanted to make a decision when seeing all three at once instead of only ever seeing one and never knowing who the other two were. But come on man, I finally become the age to become a pokemon trainer and now all of this had to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....oh crap. I\u2019m getting sidetracked here. I should go looking for that pokemon instead of complaining about my own misfortune. Hope i can be of help to them. With that, I branched off the path i was taking earlier and headed to the one on my right. Like a game of hot and cold, i felt myself getting warmer when the faint sound grew louder by each step i took. I could hear now that it was the sound of a pokemon trembling heavily; it was most likely having trouble keeping itself warm. And yes, i refer the pokemon as a \u201cit\u201d since I don\u2019t know it\u2019s gender yet. Rather be save then sorry, or wrong i guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, i managed to reached the source of the sound: some rocks piled on top of each other, almost like a makeshift doghouse. When I peeked inside this l \u201cdoghouse\u201d i able to see a small green pokemon. It was in terrible shape and the poor thing kept rolling left and right troubled in it\u2019s sleep. It seems that it was being tormented by a nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the bruises, the most noteworthy thing about the pokemon visually was the large leaf on top of it\u2019s head..... wait.... oh, I remember now! It was Chikorita! The one who got stolen i mean. But what was it doing here? Didn\u2019t the thief take Chikorita with them? If so, why is it here all alone? Did Chikorita escape from the thief or has the thief disposed of Chikorita they lost interest? Either way, that thief is nothing more than a scum! I hope they get what they deserve! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....*sigh*, but more importantly, i need to find a way to help Chikorita out, there\u2019s just no way I\u2019m going to leave it behind as well. I should return it to Professor Elm, at least if i ever get out of this stupid forest. Though it would probably struggle in order to break free if it were to wake while i\u2019m carrying it, so i should make it trust me first before i do anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I probably shouldn\u2019t do this, but I lightly rubbed Chikorita on the head so to wake it up. Of cours I\u2019m aware that nobody likes to be woken up while they sleep, but if they\u2019re woken up from a nightmare then it isn\u2019t be so bad. I kept up the rubbing until consciousness had started to return to Chikorita as it\u2019s eyes slowly opened with a dazed expression on it\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it looked around to see what woke it up, our eyes had met each other. Now that i could properly see it\u2019s face, i was suddenly completely certain that it was a girl. I don\u2019t know why but I immediately believed that it was a female the second our eyes met and even now I\u2019m having a difficult time disagreeing with it. Maybe my brain thought such cuteness was too much for a boy to pull off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, silence wasn\u2019t going to bring us anywhere so I needed to break the ice in order to get her to trust. Not sure how it\u2019ll go but let\u2019s give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hi!\u201d I said with just \u201cabsolute mastery\u201d of my vocabulary. Ugh, is there even a worse way to start a conversation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">......chi....chika..?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke! Well now we\u2019re getting somewhere! Although she spoke still in her dazed state; probably thinking this was part of her dream, so I should be careful with how i phrase things to her. But that shouldn\u2019t be too hard, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-im sorry for bothering you but you didn\u2019t look too well to me, so i came here to see if there is a way i can help you. Don\u2019t be afraid, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d I said while being glad i had put so much time to train how to handle with pokemons. I\u2019m killing it, i tell ya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn\u2019t seem to impress Chikorita much though as she kept staring at me with that dazed expression of hers. Took her a good while to realize what i had said to her or that i was even human until her eyes shot wide open when the realization hit her like a truck. Maybe i sucked at with handling pokemon after all since she looked a lot more tense when she realized i was there. Ouch, felt like i have been stabbed through the heart. Hopefully it\u2019s her newfound suspicion of humans and not skills as a possible pokemon trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sorry to ask you this but i need you come with me for a bit. Some nice people will be able to take care of you if you come and I don\u2019t want to see you so hurt, so please come with me just for a little while.\u201d I said while being aware that she probably wasn\u2019t going to buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, that\u2019s the case as she:</span></div></div>",

You liked to consider yourself a humble person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there were numerous, though casual times were you got the chance to see pokemon from up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, there were plenty of critters usually coming near your place seeking for food or, in case of particularly playful ones, a playmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike your neighbor's Meowth, who apparently never got tired of sneaking inside your house to steal stuff and watch you struggle to retrieve it with its hateful grin on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon simply entertain you for a while before leaving, and it was perfect like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in these occasional walks through the woods, you always saw plenty of pokemon, who would briefly observe you before taking its leave, startled by the sudden appearance of a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday seemed like any other one you decided to take a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could never guess how wrong you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, you never ventured too deep in these woods lest you met some particularly dangerous pokemon; but today, you decided to get rid of that stupid fear of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never met any dangerous pokemon, what could go wrong if you just went a little deeper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you came to a point where vegetation became thicker, where sunlight struggled to penetrate with the result of this part of the woods being darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit spooked but not daunted, you kept walking, curious to see what was on this side of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in town, several stories were told, the most famous being the one that a powerful pokemon resided deep in this forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what'd happen if you ran into such beast and if it was anything but friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered slightly at the sensation, but kept walking... only to come to a halt shortly after - haven't you already gone past that weirdly-shaped tree? You were sure you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you decided you must have been mistaking and resumed walking, though you could not deny you were beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you began feeling a new though familiar sensation - you were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you looked around, spotting nothing. Yet you were sure you heard a noise behind you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now you were officially scared and began looking around frenetically, the same noise you were sure you heard ringing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your gaze landed on a particular tree... on a branch, you spotted a Pidgey chirping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTranquilized, you put a hand to your chest, waiting for your heart to calm down while mentally scolding yourself for being scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing to be scared of here, you mused while taking a step, then another, resuming your walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the sensation you were being watched didn't end, and once again fear began invading your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it, you decided before turning around, this was the end of your stroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to walk away the way you came from, your gaze casually landed on what appeared to be... something flying through the air and behind a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny hand poked out from behind said tree as well a shining blue eye, which briefly landed on you before its owner retreated upon taking notice you were aware of its presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, startled and curious, you made your way to the tree, cautiously peering behind it to see-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned to indescribable levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of you, staring at you with an intimidated gaze, was a small, slim green pokemon, hovering in mid-air thanks to a pair of tiny wings on its back; it had bright blue eyes and two tiny antennae on top of its head, which was shaped like a seed. Dark eyelids surrounded the eyes of the creature, who also has long, slender arms but almost comically short legs with petite, toeless feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance at the pokemon's lower body made you blush furiously as you spotted its-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeren't legendary supposed to be genderless? Because this one was clearly a female, you mused awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you realized the stories they told back in town were true - there WAS a powerful pokemon living deep in this forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what pokemon could be more powerful than the mythical Celebi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped back - you just got to meet Celebi, which could easily be the equivalent of striking gold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little one,\" you began after calming down a little - though she was considered very very powerful, this creature was supposed to be friendly,<br>\r\n\"Did I scare you? I'm sorry.\" you reached out a hand to pet the head of the legendary, who briefly glanced at your hand, then back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you just allow me to-\" your hand slid towards your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou intended to just take out your phone to take a picture of the legendary, but she evidently mistook your intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she thought you wanted to pull out a poke-ball or some sort of weapon to stun her, point is the time-traveler didn't let you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry came from the Celebi as she extended her paw forward, blasting you with a psychic attack which sent you flying; surprised, you didn't even notice when your head hit a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already unconscious before you ungracefully fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the legendary who struck you, she hoverer over your body, her tiny hands over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer move had a side effect she did not know about, she noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary tried to reverse what she had done, not wanting to leave a harmless creature, not even a human, to such fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the fairy couldn't do anything for your current situation despite all of her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she even manage to shrink someone to such pathetically small size, she wondered.</span></div></div>",

You aimlessly walk through the forest, your mind free from any thoughts at all and your nose filled with fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you suddenly come into a small clearing. Just an ordinary clearing, you note... except for a large patch of colorful flowers right in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself as you walk towards the flowers and pick a pink one up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to immediately let it go when the thing actually moves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back as a startled, small creature runs out from the flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at it as it looks back at you terrified. You notice that it's a small white hedgehog with grass instead of quills and pink flowers on the sides of its head and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Shaymin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just found the legendary Shaymin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey little guy,\" you gently say, remembering the nature of such pokemon, shy and easily scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for scaring you...\" you apologize as you kneel down, starting to pet the Shaymin on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tries to back away, but you keep it down with your hand as you keep rubbing its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shaymin closes its eyes and starts shaking, before giving a small cry, the flowers on its body releasing pollen all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you stagger to your feet.<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" you say, before inhaling some of the pollen. Immediately, you feel very dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble around, trying to snap out of it, but you end up falling down to the ground. The silhouette of the Shaymin rushing behind a tree is the last thing you see as you black out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fidget in your sleep as you start to regain consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall walking through the forest, meeting the Shaymin... but then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hazily open your eyes. Initially, all you see is an indistinct mix of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as things begin to take a shape, you notice you're still in the forest, surrounded by green, thin, leafless trees...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shoot open as you abruptly sit upright and start looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down, noticing that the ground is way closer than before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind puts two and two together: those aren't trees. Those are blades of grass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- what happened to me?!\" you cry in alert, before remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shaymin... that pollen must have been the cause... there's really no other explanation, you figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, noticing that you're barely taller than the grass, meaning that you must be an inch or so tall... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... is a nightmare...\" you mumble as you pinch yourself. Nope, you're wide awake.<br>\r\n\"Damn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately look around, hoping that someone would pass by so you could get help... but that's when you spot something peering in your direction from behind a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shaymin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You!\" you cry. Immediately, the legendary hides behind the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, yet again remembering that you shouldn't startle it. If you manage to befriend it, you could convince it to help you... possibly, if it shrunk you, it can also give your size back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you start in a quieter tone.<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm sorry I startled you earlier. But I swear - I meant and mean you no harm! Just come out please!\" you exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the white muzzle of the Shaymin comes out from behind the tree as it looks at you with its green eyes as it tries to decide whether should it trust you or not.</span></div></div>",

Behind you - you accurately avoided to look at it - was a large pit that lead to a certain death; all around you, white teeth that could crush your bones into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rhythmic sound echoed inside the slick cavern: Shaymin's heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour surroundings shook and you fell onto the soft, slick tongue, getting bombarded by drops of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only assume that the hedgehog started walking, hopefully towards somewhere safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was walking slowly, you noted from the weak vibrations that were caused by her steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat inside the mouth for an incalculable amount of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you could do to keep your mind off things was constantly wiping the saliva from your body, saliva that was almost immediately replaced by other drops of the sticky liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choked back a sigh, avoiding to get a disgusting mouthful of spittle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen was Shaymin going to let you out...?</span></div></div>",

A legendary even...but she was very shy, scared of her own shadow, and didn't really seem to know how she even shrunk you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know if you'd ever be big again. She said she'd take care of you, but what did that mean? A diet of water and berries for the rest of your life in a cave while Shaymin hid you from anything she perceived to be a threat...which you were sure was everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, everything WAS a threat to you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were cut off as you saw the wall of teeth in front of you part and her mouth opened. A breeze came into her mouth as the outside temperature caught you, you shivered again, damp from saliva as you climbed out to find yourself in a cold cave, on a harsh stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">See...I was careful...</span>\" Shaymin said gently as you looked up at her towering visage. You started rubbing your arms, trying to get sticky saliva off as she pushed a leaf towards you to dry yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you.\" You said, as you used it to try and absorb the saliva. Shaymin just smiled at you, she could tell you truly were grateful to her efforts at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">This is where I live...where we live for now I suppose...</span>\" She said as you looked around. There was a little bed of soft looking grass in the corner...but other than that, it just seemed to be a cold, quiet and dark cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...kinda dreary, isn't it?\" You said and she frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Oh, not at all...it's perfectly safe...no one to chase me or...c-catch me.</span>\" She said as you looked to the quivering giantess in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost wanted to ask why she was so shy, but that last thing you needed was to get kicked out of this cave...or for her to get mad at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opted for silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">...um...just outside the cave is a little stream...and I get berries from pretty close too.

I-I know, it was my fault and I-I'm sorry about this b-but I'll try to protect you the best I can,</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything and everyone is a threat to me...\" you stated calmly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Then I'll protect you from everything and everyone,</span>\" for the first time, you saw a hint of determination on Shaymin's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about something to answer with, but you ultimately opted to remain silent. You distractedly resumed removing the sticky saliva from your body with the now soaked leaf the giantess gave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour silence was an enough of an answer to Shaymin, who gently leaned forward, her lips parting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you thought that you offended her and that she was going to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all your fears proved to be for naught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin's lips closed around the back of your shirt, her cheeks flaring up as she started walking towards the patch of grass where she probably slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the grass hedgehog stepped on the tickling grass and gently let you down; you estimated that you were as tall as a blade of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">It'll be fine, human,</span>\" she said, and for the first time you detected a cheerful tone in her usually low, squeaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down, sighing resignedly, without replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin laid down beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed her closing her eyes, adopting a focused expression in the meantime. She let out a grunt as she shook a bit... all she accomplished was a cloud of pollen being ejected from the flowers on the sides of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed again, looking at you dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Sorry... I don't know how to grow you back...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n\"Appreciate the effort...\" you said, waving a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin's blush spread throughout her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was inappropriate - she literally just met you - but she knew no other method to make you feel better... and, considering she was the one shrinking you, she had to make things right. Plus, you were still shivering; some warmth wasn't going to hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she even manage to shrink you, she wondered, she never knew she could do that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noted Shaymin's fore-paws suddenly sliding out from under her white body as they reached for you. You couldn't describe your shock when two soft paws grabbed a hold of you, her smooth paw-pads pressing into your sides as Shaymin pulled you towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog giantess raised her head a bit and pushed you into her smooth cheek, which was burning bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin was <b><i>hugging</i></b> you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou too blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white and green giantess kept you restrained in a hug for a while. And you had to admit, you felt slightly better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the cold insides of the cavern, Shaymin's bodily warmth was the same, and she was warming you up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was called the Gratitude Pokemon for this, because she made others feel grateful towards her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Shaymin released you, blushing and smiling at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Feel better?</span>\" she asked softly, causing you to smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... yes. I feel slightly better, thank you...\" you responded with sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin blushed again, not used to others thanking her for a simple hug... not that she had anybody to give hugs to though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Y-You're welcome,</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her again, before giving a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What now, Shaymin? Are we going to be cooped up in here the whole time?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Well... maybe I could bring you out sometime... when nobody is around...</span>\" she replied,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">As for now...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

If you're hungry I can go get some.</span></span>\" Shaymin softly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she mentioned it you did feel really hungry, the thought of food bringing on an involuntary growl from your stomach. You blushed, but thankfully it seemed she didn't notice. \"Food would be good.\" You say up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread on her face. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Okay, I'll be right back!</span>\" She said as she turned around and waddled outside, leaving you alone in the dim cave sitting on the bed of over-sized grass. It certainly wasn't where you thought you would be when you decided to take that morning walk earlier this day. For now, though, all you could do is hope that Shaymin could figure out how to reverse whatever she did to you, but it seemed you were going to have to hunker down with this shy Pokemon for a while until that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention was already brought to the entrance of the cave as you saw Shaymin pop back into view, the grass hedgehog holding a pair of pink berries by the stems in her mouth. Coming back to your position on the grassy bed, she gently lowered the berries before you - and you had to say, they were absolutely massive. The pink heart-shaped berry was nearly twice your height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" You say to your gracious host as you size up your meal. A Pecha berry, if you remembered correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">These ones are my favorites.</span>\" Shaymin quietly declared as she started chewing on her own berry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe berry before you was almost intimidating. Where do you start? Pressing your hand against the berry it felt surprisingly soft and with a bit of effort you were able to dig your hand into the juicy flesh. With a handful of Pecha you start eating the surprisingly sweet berry. Unfortunately it was incredibly difficult not getting saturated in sticky juices as you ate, a fact that Shaymin quickly picked up on as she put down another leaf beside you to clean yourself with. \"Thanks.\" You simply say while suppressing your embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually your feasting ended and you couldn't eat another bite, the Pecha berry still mostly intact after your meal. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Are... Are you full?</span>\" Shaymin asked, her eyes trained on the berry, clearly still hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks. You can have the rest if you want.\" You said. Shaymin took the berry and you waited as she made quick work of it. Your eyes wandered over to the front of the cave where you could see dull orange light beaming in through the entrance. <i>Was it really the late afternoon already?</i> You shuddered a bit as you could feel the cool night air starting to seep into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">We s-should stay inside until tomorrow morning...</span>\" Shaymin muttered as she looked out the cave, too. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I-It's not safe at night, a lot of strong Pokemon come out when its dark, u-usually.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easy enough to understand, although the only activity you could really do in the darkening cave was go to sleep until the sun rose again. Shaymin looked concerned as she saw you looking throughout the cave. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Um... S-Sorry there isn't much to do in here...</span>\" She said. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I usually go to bed when the sun sets.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright\" You sighed as a weak gust of wind made you shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">A-Are you cold? You can come lay against me if you are. I-I don't mind.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked almost visibly upset at the fact you were cold and it was clear she was feeling bad about the situation she put you in. It <i>was</i> a tempting offer though, looking up at Shaymin it reminded you of the hug you shared before and how warm and comforting it was. The current time was a good few hours before your regular bedtime and you weren't at all tired but you felt you could fall asleep laying against something soft and warm. Instead of going to sleep right away, there was also the option of spending some time you talking with her. Besides, it would be helpful to know more about the Pokemon that was going to be acting as your caretaker.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, yeah, I'm comfy.

For several seconds you were utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, memories began seeping back into your mind as you remembered what had happened yesterday: you met Shaymin, she shrunk you down and then promised to keep you safe out of regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground under you began shaking; a loud moan erupted from the giantess resting beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon waking up, Shaymin drowsily blinked several times, before looking around. She adopted a dejected expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">O-Oh... was it a-all a dream?</span>\" she asked herself, and you got that she was talking about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I only wish this all was a dream...\" you chimed out loud, causing Shaymin to jump up in surprise,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Oh!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landing caused as much tremors as the leap itself, but also made you fall down onto the smooth back of the hedgehog giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Y-You're still there?</span>\" she asked, and a sigh of relief followed the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">S-Sorry...</span>\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back on your feet and traveled to the edge of Shaymin's head, where the two large pink flowers were; a nice yet strong scent assaulted your nose, which you had to cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... is it okay if...?\" you asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Oh?... Oh, s-sure. Climb down...</span>\" Shaymin replied, and you stepped forward, sliding past the eyes of the giantess and landing on top of her nose: being able to stand on it only made you feel pathetic in comparison to this hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin smiled and gently lowered her nose so that you could jump down, getting lost in the jungle that was the grass bed where she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Sle-Slept well?</span>\" she asked, blushing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to consider the question and smiled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah. It was nice.\" you admitted, blushing yourself while causing Shaymin's own blush to grow brighter, but also making the giantess smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary's smile then faded as she suddenly began shooting random stares across the cavern, avoiding your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before you could ask what was going on, she looked back at you; she stared at you intently for a second, before reluctantly leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh-\" you discovered how hard it was to talk when a giant is busily nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found Shaymin's reddened cheek brushing against you softly, for a brief time, before she stood on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">...

I'm thirsty.\" you replied. Shaymin didn't need to hear more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two quick moves of her nose, you were back onto what had been your bed throughout the whole night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout talking, Shaymin walked out of the grass bed and headed for the exit of the cavern, stepping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight bathed both you and your host, who stretched while a pleasant feeling spread through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Shaymin resumed walking; true to what she had previously said, after a short trip, you came across a stream of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary you were riding made her way to it and stopped, while you repeated the process of sliding down on her nose, which the hedgehog helpfully lowered for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked her and knelt by the stream so that you could drink; behind you, you heard Shaymin muttering a \u2018You're welcome\u2019, before you felt tremors beneath yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rose from the water to look backwards, noticing that Shaymin was walking away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as she walked towards a few bushes, grabbed a hold of something with her mouth and pulled back, two Pecha Berries held by their stems in her closed lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess walked back to you, placing the food in between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Y-You seemed to like them y-yesterday...</span>\" she recalled with a blush, before hastily beginning to eat her meal. You emulated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin's berry disappeared in a few bites; yours was still far from being half-eaten when you pulled back from it, letting the hedgehog finish it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" you chimed,<br>\r\n\"What do you usually do in the morning?... We aren't going back in the cave, are we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin smiled.</span></div></div>",

Didn't you mention there were dangerous pokemon around here?\" you recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Y-Yes... but it'll be quick, i-if you want...</span>\" she said, shivering at the thought of big bad pokemon chasing her down just to get the human she was housing and protecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it, and decided to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around was way better than being confined in a cave all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough being confined in a cave was way better than being confined in the stomach of some random pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you replied while shaking the thought off by moving your head back and forth,<br>\r\n\"Let's do it Shaymin...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Marvelous!</span>\" she exclaimed in a happy tone, before blushing madly upon realizing that she nearly broke both your eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tell, given how you were holding your ears and glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">S-Sorry,</span>\" she apologized, before adopting a small smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Don't worry, I will protect you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so...\" you said while Shaymin's nose slid in between your legs, before she gently tossed you on top of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Let's go...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Shaymin began walking, each step she took causing you to shake on top of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't mind though, you were comfortable and the flowers up here smelt good. You allowed yourself to relax as you rode the giantess, who walked in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning forest was pretty peaceful, you discovered, and you caught yourself thinking about the possibility of its inhabitants being all nocturnal predators, which would have justified the lack of pokemon around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discarded the idea, though, Shaymin wasn't a nocturnal predator, and quite certainly there were other pokemon too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only hoped you didn't run into them. Not every pokemon was going to be as nice as Shaymin, you figured, and Shaymin was nice only because she was tremendously shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Isn't this n-nice?</span>\" the giantess stuttered from beneath you as she walked aimlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um? Oh, yeah. It is quite peaceful...\" you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you couldn't see it, you were sure that Shaymin was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... aside from walking around, what else do you do?\" you asked, trying to make casual conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Not much... you know, t-there isn't much to do aside from exploring, eating and sleeping.</span>\" Shaymin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... Boring?</span>\" Shaymin finished before you could, and you swore you felt the skin beneath her smooth fur burning hot.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Oh no, it isn't like that! I-I mean, when there are predators or other humans I run... that's kinda-</span>\" she trailed off, and you repressed a laugh. Seeing her acting like that was adorable, despite the fact you couldn't see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Shaymin, why do you run?\" you asked instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">H-Huh?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" you began to explain, feeling like this wasn't the right question to ask,<br>\r\n\"... Why do you run? Don't you ever try to fight back?... I mean, you're a legendary, no?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the giantess stopped, and your feeling became a certainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm sorry.\" you said before she could say anything, hanging your head shamefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was doing so much for you and you were repaying her by asking questions she didn't want to answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">For what?</span>\" came her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her head shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">No... it's just... I d-don't like fighting like certain pokemon do.</span>\" a deep sigh,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... But it's not always like this. There's another side of me... one much braver than I currently am... I know, you think I'm a coward.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaymin,\" you started, your hand beginning to slide across the hedgehog's back as you caressed her,<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're a coward. You're helping me when others would have simply left me on my own. You're not a coward, you're <i>wonderful</i>. I-I'm just trying to get to know you better...\" you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the skin beneath your hands began burning with great intensity as she blushed, while a smile grew wide on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I-If that's the case...</span>\" she said after a few moments of being silent,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... You see, I c-can change. With a special kind o-of flower-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... is it called \u2018Gracidea Flower\u2019?\" you interrupted, sure you read about the same thing Shaymin was talking about somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head up (you noticed the massive blush that never left her cheeks during your conversation) and gave a slight nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... I can change my form,</span>\" she continued,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... B-But my personality changes as well. <b><i>T-That</i></b> Shaymin isn't like <i>I</i> am. That Shaymin is tougher...</span> \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can fly too?\" you asked, now remembering a few things,<br>\r\n\"... Your other form is called \u2018Sky Forme\u2019, right?... I read about thi- I mean you on a book or something...\" you clarified as you noticed her confused expression, which probably came from the fact you seemed to know more about her than she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Yeah...</span>\" she replied while looking away for a second, before looking at you again; this time, she wore a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">N-Now, I told you everything about me...</span>\" her blush covered a good percentage of her face at this,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... Why don't you tell me something about yourself? In the meantime, I'll get back to the cave... i-if that's a-alright...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\"  you replied with a smile while awkwardly thinking that the closest thing to a girl you ever got near to just asked you to talk about yourself,<br>\r\n\"... But there's not much to say, really. I'm just... <i>was</i> a normal guy until yesterday-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Sorry...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Nothing exciting, really. Well... aside from me being a few inches tall...\" you concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin gave an amused \u2018hm\u2019,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">And... what do you humans do f-for... entertainment?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you said, recalling various human activities that would leave her slack-jawed,<br>\r\n\"... A lot of things, Shaymin. Majorly Internet, technology in general and many more activities.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Seems f-fun...</span>\" the hedgehog replied, though you were sure she didn't have a clue of what Internet was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">And... what does the world l-look like when you're s-so small?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer immediately, struggling to find better words than \u2018it sucks, it really does\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you discovered you didn't have to answer: Shaymin arrived to the cave, which began filling your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's been nice...\" you said to change subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Yep, it was-</span>\" Shaymin abruptly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered why, before you felt the familiar feeling of you being watched from somewhere, an imprecise spot behind you and Shaymin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the hedgehog giantess turned around... at least, to you was a giantess. But to whoever was watching you, unless it was a Joltik, she was all but intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin made a 360 degree turn, with the effect of making you turn around as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discovered that, indeed, there was someone staring at you intently: a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a...</span></div></div>",

You weren't sure if because she was utterly shy or because this cave was cold.

Sleeping when the sun set down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaymin.\" you called, deciding to at least try to talk to her, ask her a few questions about herself. Talking was literally the only thing you could do to entertain yourself while in this cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had quite a few other ideas of what you could have done in such precarious situation, but they were... <i>inappropriate</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne green eye opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Hm?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we... talk for a bit?

I mean, why are you so... huh...\" you kept yourself from saying it, but you were certain that the giantess got the gist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin blushed, and for a moment looked away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">There's... nothing special to say, r-really...</span>\" she shyly replied, showing no hard feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, while mentally formulating an explanation: seeing the world from a small perspective like hers was sure intimidating... you could tell, since you were smaller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Shaymin, what do you do aside from eat, drink and sleep?\" you asked again, changing subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">W-Well... I wander around the forest... when no one is around. There's a lot of scary and strong pokemon out there and I d-don't want to fight. Nothing more...</span>\" she explained, her paw gripping you with a bit more strength as she thought about the big, powerful beasts hunting and killing mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all?\" you asked, wondering if this all was real of if you were just living some kind of very lucid nightmare. You sourly realized that Shaymin's life was going to be your life as well now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I know, it's a bit...</span>\" she trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Boring? Monotone?\" you finished bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin didn't reply, but the blush on her face grew wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... How d-do you humans e-entertain yourselves?</span>\" Shaymin asked you, before she lowered her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I-I mean... aside from... making pokemon fight...</span>\" she asked, suddenly looking at you with what had to be dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not even a trainer... I mean, I wasn't...\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"And there's really a lot of ways to keep ourselves entertained among us humans...\" you said, before starting to explain about human entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin listened with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your speech with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why I even ended up like this...\" you said, thinking that you weren't going to enjoy the things you told her about ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog looked at you sorrowfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">...

And, just as you thought that she was going to release you and send you on your own, she spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I-I'm not... always like this...</span>\" she responded quietly, dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw an opportunity to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

You didn't want to be like this when a hungry Ursaring suddenly came out in one of Shaymin's strolls through the forest and found the nice little snack she carried around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin possessed a great power, which earned her the title of legendary, but her behavior didn't assure that she'd protect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed deeply as you leaned back again, deciding to wait for the hedgehog to wake up before you did anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have drifted off again at some point, because you woke up at as something gently shook you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you opened your eyes, only to find Shaymin's large paw poking you, its owner looming above you, having released you from her hug while you slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Oh... you're awake,</span>\" she unnecessarily stated while her paw retreated,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">How are you feeling?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" you simply replied, not in the mood to talk,<br>\r\n\"Or at least I'll be... I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin seemed uncomfortable with your statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Look, if y-you want to talk or anything, I'm here, okay?</span>\" Shaymin kindly spoke, leaning forward to nudge you with her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much care in the hedgehog's voice that you couldn't help but crack a smile. You couldn't end in better paws, you figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" you replied half-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin took a step back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I-I'll go get something to eat, you must be hungry...</span>\" she changed subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah. Food sounds nice about now.\" you agreed, your stomach gurgling softly at the mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin nodded uncomfortably, blushed and quickly walked out of the cave, returning about two minutes later with the usual berries held by the stems in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese ones were round and blue, you noted: Oran Berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin dropped one in front of you, before she began eating her own part of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few bites of the giant berry you were given, the juicy loudly sliding its way into your empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like yesterday, you didn't finish your meal, and allowed Shaymin to finish it up yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we gonna do today?\" you asked in a monotone voice,<br>\r\n\"Are we gonna be cooped up in here the whole day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin blushed, but offered a gentle smile.</span></div></div>",

It felt incredible, although it was grass, it felt soft and warm like it was real fur!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Ready?</span>\" the giant hedgehog asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you said, your thoughts interupted by the voice of the giantess,<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, didn't you say something about dangerous pokemon being out there?\" you recalled nervously. You didn't wish to be uncovered when one of those came out and spotted you riding a small legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin's expression fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Indeed, there are some r-really scary pokemon,</span>\" she admitted, her body shivering at the thought, sending vibrations under your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the shy hedgehog adopted a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">But, don't worry, I will protect you. I-I think I can handle them i-if they try to attack us...</span>\" she assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent, feeling conflicted; on one side, you knew that Shaymin possessed a great power... on the other, you knew she'd be all but willing to use it against some wild pokemon and would probably prefer running away, much like she did when you first met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do...? Express your concerns or play along?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay.\" you said in the end, deciding to trust that Shaymin would be able to protect you if anything happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass hedgehog smiled to herself, while her cheeks grew a slight shade of red. She was getting used to the idea of having someone to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, she thought, this situation wasn't so bad like you both believed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary shook her head - what was she thinking? Of course the situation was bad, she out of all pokemon knew how being so small felt like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was why she had decided to protect you. Not only you weren't a threat like humans usually were, but you were in need of help, and she was doing just that, helping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">L-Let's go,</span>\" she said while you wondered what was going on in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, your giant host began walking and soon found herself out of the cave that has been your shelter throughout the night; warm sunlight showered you as Shaymin began walking through the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was quiet, you thought as you looked around, not a single pokemon could be seen except for the eventual Pidgey that chirped on a branch or the passing Weedle that hastily crawled through the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... oddly nice, you mused while Shaymin took her stroll in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" you said at some point, causing the legendary hedgehog to slow down for a second,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Hey...</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you do, Shaymin?\" you asked,<br>\r\n\"I mean... don't you do anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit you couldn't see it, you were sure Shaymin was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">There's... there's r-really nothing much to do here...</span>\" she hesitated,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">A-All I do it exploring, eating and sleeping...</span>\" by this point she had stopped, and her head lowered.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... I know, it sounds boring.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's not that!\" you quickly said, not wanting to demoralize the hedgehog giantess,<br>\r\n\"It's just... not my kind of amusement, you understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin perked up, a giggle escaping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Right, y-you told me how you h-humans have fun...</span>\" she recalled the (awkward) chat you and her had before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you replied, before remembering something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaymin? May I ask something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Hm?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated, recalling that this had been a delicate branch of the conversation you had last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Remember...\" you began,<br>\r\n\"When I asked you why... why you were so s-shy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin slowed down again, her cheeks flaring up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... Yeah?</span>\" she squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you told me that you could change... can you tell me what you meant by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin didn't reply to this, but kept walking in silence with you on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if you did wrong bringing that up again; a voice in your head told you that it was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about apologizing, but decided to wait for a bit, until Shaymin \u2018calmed down\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you suddenly discovered, the legendary wasn't mad at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... I'm only s-shy this when I-I'm like this,</span>\" she timidly broke the silence, surprising you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... But I can change m-my form with th-the power of a special flower called Gracidea Flower,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left shocked, what did that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">With it, I become a totally di-different Shaymin,</span>\" the hedgehog clarified,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">T-That Shaymin is much tougher than I am...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you said in awe, imagining what form Shaymin could assume once she had absorbed the power of the Gracidea Flower,<br>\r\n\"I wish I could see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">You can.</span>\" Shaymin replied nervously, blushing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Lo-Look.</span>\" the hedgehog said, leading you to look forward to see where she had arrived while you chatted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a relatively small patch of colorful flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were punched in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are... are those...?\" you asked, but Shaymin shook her head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">... O-Only one of them is,</span>\" she stuttered while she walked towards the patch, walking in circles around it until she stopped in front of a pink flower that was easily taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">This is what makes me change my form...</span>\" Shaymin said, before looking up, trying to spot you on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't see you, but you could definitely see the red shade across her cheeks and her reluctant expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Y-You... want t-to see it?</span>\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes!</i>\u2019 your mind exclaimed, thinking that it'd be better: if Shaymin was tougher, she'd be able to protect you better, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second look at the hedgehog's face caused you to shut the voice in your head up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin was clearly reluctant to use the Gracidea Flower, and you quite certainly didn't want her to feel bad because of your wish to see her change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, you were definitely curious enough...</span></div></div>",

On one side, she didn't exactly want to change. But on the other, she wanted to satisfy her little friend's curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the voice that told her to do it ended up prevailing over the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">A-Alright,</span>\" she timidly spoke up,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I'll do it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you asked. The legendary offered a slight nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Could you... climb down first?</span>\" she asked in a shy squeak.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you replied in a eager as you walked to the edge of the hedgehog's body and began climbing down to the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet touched the tickling grass that went up to your waist and you looked up to the towering grass-type legend, who sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Step back, please...</span>\" she instructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obeyed and took a few steps back, before turning to the green and white behemoth, who reluctantly stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head to you one last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Remember... I will return to being myself when the sun goes down...</span>\" she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the need to ask,<br>\r\n\"Wait, what does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Shaymin blushed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">My transformation isn't permanent. The effects of the Gracidea will wear off when the sun sets and I will return to the form you are s-seeing now.</span>\" she offered her explanation, before adopting a look of... remorse?<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">If I do anything bad to you... please forgive me...</span>\" she said, eyed shut and lips trembling as if she was on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what she meant by that, but were left no time to question about it; Shaymin leaned forward  and her nose just barely touched the pink flower that went by the name of Gracidea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Shaymin was enveloped in a blinding light, forcing you to shut your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't see it, but Shaymin's form began changing; her short paws became longer, her body grew in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the light died down, allowing you to finally open your eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes met with the sight of a completely different pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was taller, and no longer a hedgehog, but instead what appeared to be a small deer; she had antlers now, and two red petals on the left side of her neck, while the rest of her body was covered in ruffled, white fur. Her paws were green, like her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected her to change, but not this much! Shaymin was utterly unrecognizable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon in front of you finally opened her eyes and her green gaze traveled down as she looked straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression didn't change for a moment, before it shifted into a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">So? Whaddya think buddy?</span>\" she asked in a tone you didn't recognize; her previous tone was quiet and squeaky. This one was playful, mischievous even, and it carried a lot of confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup, you stuck to your earlier line of thinking: Shaymin was unrecognizable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... you're not yourself anymore...\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaymin snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I AM myself! I just ain't small and afraid anymore! That's why I looove this form of mine!</span>\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't quite match with her earlier behavior, you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted as the giantess in front of you lowered her head towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Now dude, I have a limited time to spend in this amazing form. What do you say if we use that to... have some fun?</span>\" she asked, her nose inches away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively took a step back. The 'old Shaymin' never asked you that in the short amount of time you've known her for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you began, but were cut off as a green paw came down on you, pinning you down to the ground as its owner began toying with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, cut it! You're gonna hurt me!\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above, Shaymin laughed, but regardless took her paw off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Ah, sorry bud, guess I got carried away. You're, like, so small!</span>\" she exclaimed cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I knew that...\" you murmured, though the giantess didn't even hear you. What had gotten into her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Anyway, back to business,</span>\" she said with a grin,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Wanna see something cool?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discovered you were feeling nervous, and didn't know what to think of this Shaymin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

You felt amazed as you noticed what was sparkling: a huge lake, hidden in the middle of the woods, its water shining brightly under the warm sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you muttered to yourself as you began regretting leaving home your camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began walking deeper to the lake-shore and knelt, staring at your reflection into the water. And, for moment, you took notice of something odd: something was behind you, like a shadow or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you turned around, but no one was there aside from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-\" you didn't get to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to spring up in alert, you randomly began feeling drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha...\" you mumbled dizzily as your eyelids grew heavier and heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to pull yourself together and got back on your feet, before trying so stumble away, hoping to find help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after only four steps, you felt the hard ground under you again as you fell down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you noticed before falling into a deep sleep was a shadow appearing in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, everything became dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of sleeping dreamlessly, you woke up, feeling incredibly dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, you opened your eyes, taking notice of a lingering ache assaulting your head. Which was quite weird, given how your brain seemed to have shut down all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What happened...?\" you mumbled to no one in particular as you sat upright, trying to recall how you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered getting to the lake, before you lost consciousness. It must have been this annoying headache, you told yourself, though you were sure your head didn't ache before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it must have been worse than you thought: when you fell asleep, you were in a forest. But now, the ground looked blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have fallen on my head...\" you murmured as you finally stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then you noticed that something was definitely wrong; below you was the more familiar sight of the verdant grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a lump in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what happened to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, you're awake.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill traveled down your spine as a feminine voice spoke behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you turned around, and your heart sank completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was blue, and it was incredibly big, with golden eyes and a red jewel in the middle of its forehead; also, it was hovering in mid-air and had two tails. And it carried an unreadable glare on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait...\" you murmured breathlessly as you stared at the giant pokemon, sure you had seen it somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Greetings, human,</span>\" the creature spoke in a neutral tone, though from it you could tell this titan was a titaness because its voice carried the same feminine hint you noted before,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I am Azelf, guardian of this lake.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Azelf! The legendary pokemon who could manipulate willpower and protected a lake and... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And was supposed to be <i>one foot tall...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What is going o-on...?\" you stammered in confusion as you looked around, noticing that the blue ground you were standing on was nothing more than the palm of the giantess, who was hovering in front of the now ocean-sized lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glare of the legendary hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I shrunk you.</span>\" she said bluntly as your gaze went back to her, allowing you to notice the look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you had been just kicked in the crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But why?\" you asked as a strong fear assaulted you, overwhelming your other senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Because...</span>\" the palm of the giantess shifted, and you suddenly found yourself trapped in her rock-solid fist, which she brought dangerously closer to her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... You humans only come here to fight me, don't you? You only wanted to capture me like they all do, right?</span>\" she asked with fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fiery gaze made you shiver, but you weren't letting her hurting you when you did absolutely nothing wrong to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has nothing to do with me!\" you hastily retorted,<br>\r\n\"I didn't come here to \u2018fight\u2019 you or \u2018capture\u2019 you! I didn't even know this lake or you were here until this morning!... I'm not even a trainer!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Azelf seemed taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... You're not-</span>\" she trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I don't capture pokemon, I was just wandering around when you shrunk me! What's wrong with you!?\" you shouted in response, causing the blue mountain to look even more surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-</span>\" she started, but then stopped as she figured that this could be a trick to save your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Why should I believe you?</span>\" she said instead, causing you to sign in frustration while you fidgeted in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I came here to fight you or capture you or whatever, I would have brought pokemon with me, no? And even if I did, they would have came out to help me while you shrunk me, right?\" you said, causing the Azelf to shut her eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">O-Oh...</span>\" she stuttered, feeling like she messed up big time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Sorry?</span>\" she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf was tired of humans coming to her lake to try and enslave her or simply fight her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe always manged to fight back - being a legendary has its uses, and a nearly unlimited power is one of them - but she had enough of foolish trainers coming to ruin her peace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to do something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she first did something, she messed up. Great. Just great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"Now just grow me back and I'll be on my way, okay? I swear I'll never come back here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess stared at you, feeling conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she had done wrong, so she had to let you go now... but if she did, how many chances there were this human was going to tell others of his kind about this episode?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were going to hunt her down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe logical thing to do seemed to just keep this human, but she knew it was a dumb idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she had to do something, fast...</span></div></div>",

Very well, human,</span>\" she spoke,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You don't represent a threat to me or to this lake, so you may go...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaped in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, Azelf placed you back on the ground and stood at her full height, which was doubled due her floating in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inhaled deeply, before looking at you again, her eyes carrying a cyan glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same glow surrounded your whole body as you began feeling a pleasant sensation spreading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you started growing; your surroundings shrunk down to size around you as you grew past the towering blades of grass, past Azelf's tails and eventually past Azelf herself, until she was no longer a towering giant to you, but it was the other way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth came to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">There. I believe you were more of less that big...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" you stammered, before backing up a bit. Your mind was telling you to run away screaming while you still had your full size, but you decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So... I'll be going now. It was, uh... almost nice to meet you...\" you awkwardly said, before turning around to leave without even waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore disappearing in the woods, you shot one last glance backwards, discovering the Azelf who shrunk you staring in your direction blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opted to ignore her and entered the woods, beginning to walk away from the lunatic legendary and her lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle you did know what the little legend was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she noticed you leaving, Azelf looked back at her lake and floated towards it, feeling awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating, she dove underwater and seam to the bottom of the lake, where she reached an underwater cavern. She hastily floated inside and sat down in the middle of the place, droplets of water falling from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe what she was about to do, but she couldn't be sure the human wasn't going to snitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those thoughts in mind, the blue legendary focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a colorless shadow began floating out of her body; her soul was free to move now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her body behind, she exited the cave and swam up, surfacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, the human wasn't far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way through the woods rather hastily, wishing to put as much distance as you could from yourself and that legendary you just miraculously escaped from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you were back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, you locked the door behind you and stumbled to your kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to make yourself a steaming cup of tea in order to calm your scared mind. You couldn't believe what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, you were basically kidnapped by a legendary who held a grudge against humanity and tried to \u2018punish\u2019 you when you didn't actually do anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was crazy! It was unbelievable! It was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, the Azelf-related memories were enough to make your body shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to stop thinking about her. You were home, you weren't doll-sized, you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply had to stop thinking about that legendary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, you felt like you were being watched, but you just assumed that you were still scared by what has been going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep your mind off things, you discarded your now empty cup on the kitchen table, before getting up to go watch some TV while mentally making a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more walks in the woods for some time... or no more walks in the woods at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour day passed rather fast as you did your best to forget Azelf and what she did to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work as at some point you stopped being afraid of wandering through your own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, daylight faded away, replaced by moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good few hours before your bedtime, but you didn't care. Right now, all you wanted was hit the hay and try to leave behind the spooky situation you had been through in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached your bedroom and undressed, before slowly sliding under the warm blankets of your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, you fell asleep almost immediately, sliding in a sweet, dreamless slumber, which was more than you asked for since you were expecting nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, already in deep sleep, you didn't know what was going on outside of the window of your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you did, you would have probably began screaming out of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, right out of your window, was Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been watching you throughout the day to check if you kept your promise and didn't say anything about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt relieved, you were truthful and didn't say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some regret, she understood that not all humans were bad after all. Not only this guy didn't make pokemon fight or foolishly hunted down legendaries, but he was honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue pixie leaned against your window, watching you sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt bad for shrinking you earlier this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a good human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary was about to turn around and leave, but she felt her heart leaping inside her chest as she did, leading her to fly right back at your window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy didn't she want to leave you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just a human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she realized, you were a good one. For some reason, she felt like she didn't want to leave you, but couldn't realize why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the legendary made a decision and psychically, noiselessly opened the window to hover inside your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold air made you fidget in your sleep, but you remained asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf stared at you sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know why, but if her heart told her to stick with you, she wasn't going to deny her own wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, wasn't that what humans did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFulfill their wishes without caring about the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy should have she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight seeped in your closed eyes, bothering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep yawn, you began waking up by stretching your arms. You felt rather content with your good night's sleep. Only, you felt a lingering ache in your head for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, deciding you were going to take something later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you simply laid down, your vision blurry with drowsiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't tell why, but you felt like something was... off. Like something was not like it was when you went to sleep, but you couldn't tell what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... you were still scared after the experience of yesterday?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked to get the sleep out of your eyes and yawned again, before sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then, with a gasp, you realized what was wrong.</span></div></div>",

It was a green surface, you stood up, and it supported your weight as you looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater surrounded you, and it went on and on for a while. You gulped. This was a lake...and you assumed you were on a lily pad. Which also meant that you were small again. You felt your breathing get erratic as you sat down on the lily pad, feeling stranded out here on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay...I just...need to calm down. Azelf probably did this right, but she seemed nice and I didn't say a word about her. I just need to explain to her that I really won't do anything...yeah...then she should grow me back...\" You said, as you rubbed your arms together to try and both warm yourself, and calm yourself down. It was then that a ripple started to move the water...it was getting rougher and rougher, threatening to throw you off of your lily pad as you desperately clung to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great roaring splash, the giantess you expected to see emerged...Azelf.

You didn't want to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...\" You looked around at the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't swim...\" You said, a meek defense, if true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I can teach you.</span>\" She said, not missing a beat. You looked at this looming legendary. It didn't seem like you had much say in this.

You'll be fine - we'll be fine.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water beneath your lily pad began shaking as the towering giantess hovered out of and above the crystalline water, her body creating a huge shadow that eclipsed your whole view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't see past this titan, and it made you feel powerless to stop her from doing whatever she wanted to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like you had many chances anyway, even if you were your original size. This pokemon could literally control willpower: a flick of her hand, and not only you'd stay with her, but you'd be happy to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer messing with your willpower was definitely something you didn't want to experience. Being shrunken was already enough, you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntimidated by the enormous size of the legendary, you watched as her paw descended towards you and grabbed a hold of your body; oddly, even though she had just gotten out of the water, her body seemed completely dry, like the lake hadn't even laid a single drop of water on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So, human? What do you say?</span>\" she asked, leading you to wonder if your opinion made any difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Everything and everyone would be a danger to me. You're literally dooming me.\" you said, trying to reason with the titaness one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smirked smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">They won't even get close enough to lay their eyes on you, I promise,</span>\" she said, before bringing you closer to her blue body,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You'll be fine.</span>\" she repeated once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething you didn't expect to occur happened: this giant pokemon, who openly declared her disdain for humanity, pulled you forward, closing your minuscule body in an embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but flush red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis experience would have probably been more enjoyable if you weren't so ridiculously tiny and this situation wasn't so awkward and dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, you thought. Azelf wasn't going to let you go, and you couldn't do anything about it, with or without your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight as well not upset the legendary by insisting too much, you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-\" you paused, taking a moment to consider what was going to be your life from now on: nothing but this lake and its guardian, and the occasional trainer whose butt she would kick before shrinking them down like she did to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed deeply - why you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Whatever.\" you replied after a long hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf, who had momentarily lost her smile, grinned down at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Great. I promise nothing's gonna happen to you. I'll take good care of you... you know, I saw you yesterday, you're all alone,</span>\" she declared, making you feel annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivacy must be a foreign concept to pokemon, you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's voice interrupted your train of thought, and your gaze went back to her. You noted that she was talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We can keep each other company, it'll be great!</span>\" she said, obviously still trying to break through your disappoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere WAS some truth in what she was saying, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" was the only reply you could offer once again aside from a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess smiled sympathetically,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Great,</span>\" she cheered,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">As for now...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

All the same, you did need to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Great! in that case let's go and remedy that, i'm a bit peckish myself.</span>\" She said as you felt your stomach rattle when she started to fly with you in her grip. You swallowed hard as the wind whipped at you, and she looked down at you before stopping and frowning. Evidently your face must've explained the whole situation to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">...hmm, let's try this.</span>\" She said before pressing you to her chest again with her paw. This time you felt her other paw join behind the first one, effectively pinning you securely to her chest, you doubted you could move if you wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That should keep you nice and secure!</span>\" You heard her say as she started to fly again, your face pressed into her chest pretty much and you were left to think for a bit as she proceeded to her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more job...no more friends...not that you really had any...just you and this pokemon. What a weird turn of events, but she was certainly nicer to you than you had expected, especially for a pokemon that seemed to be pretty annoyed with humans as a whole, or at least ones that tried to capture her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...You hoped you didn't see any trainer unfortunate enough to cross her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, what exactly would you eat? Berries? Fruit? You had to admit the idea of much less food choices didn't sit the best with you on that front, but you didn't want to say anything to annoy Azelf. You felt a lurch in your stomach as Azelf started to descend, and she landed on top of a tree branch before pulling you from her chest, cupping you in her paws as she smiled down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We're here little guy, just let me grab the food.</span>\" She said as her eyes glowed and an apple bigger than you floated towards you...you looked at it, before you were surprised to see it shrink. It plopped down right next to you, and it looked like an ordinary apple...normal sized to you and everything. You picked it up before you heard a loud *CRUNCH*, only to look up and see Azelf eating an apple too. She seemed to be enjoying it, with a sigh you bit into the apple...certainly tasted normal. And biting it you realized just how hungry you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ate in relative silence for a bit, looking around as much as you could, though it was a lot of tree and a lot of Azelf pretty much from your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your apple a bit after Azelf seemed to finish hers and she sighed, looking down at you and your apple core. It floated away from you as it joined her empty core until...they both vanished?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">See little human, this is all going to work out, you just need to give it a shot.</span>\" She said and you leaned back in her palm, supporting yourself with the bottoms of your palms and let off a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the apple.\" Was really all you could say. Arguing wouldn't really get you anywhere and Azelf seemed intent on keeping you regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded before you felt a shift as she pressed you to her chest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Now, let's go back to the lake.</span>\" She said as she started to float, and take to the skies again.</span></div></div>",

Grow me back, I have to go back to my family and friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Why should I?\"</span> Azelf shot back, a smug look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what. What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"I mean exactly what I mean. Why should I give back the one thing I've grown attached to all these years? Do you know how lonely that is? Hundreds of years with no companionship, only meeting with my sisters in times of crises.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf, I could never understand that loneliness, but it still doesn't change the fact that I have a family and friends that will miss me if I sudden-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, an intense wave of nausea hits you as you are bombarded with an intense presence from the blue giantess in front of you. <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Like I said, why do I care.

Why should I be reluctant to do the same?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, I'm not one of those people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Yes, but the concept still stands. I was hoping to not have to do this, but you forced my hand.\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to step back but quickly found yourself held in place by a psychic power that you could never hope to overcome. You try to sputter out some words but it seems the psychic powers limit you from doing anything other than keeping yourself alive with basic bodily functions like breathing. All you could do was think your questions, not that they would have any way of reaching Azelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just what the heck is she going to do to me' You thought to yourself, unaware that Azelf was indeed fully capable of reading your thoughts, only when she wanted to, of course. She had been so blinded by rage at the thought of a trainer trying to capture her again that she shrunk you without reading your mind but now that she was more at peace than ever with you by her side, she could think things with greater clarity than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Well, It's quite simple, really. I intend to keep you on my island, whether you give me your consent or not. It's rather hard to find someone that we legendaries can bond with you know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Y-you can read my mind?!' You thought, now even more worried at the prospect of not even being able to plan about escaping without her knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Well duh. I am a Psychic-type. Of course, I could forcefully change how you think of me with my powers but I'd rather just savor your slow descent into accepting me and forgetting everyone else.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf then used the psychic powers that were previously holding you still to lift you towards her paws. Upon contact, the psychic powers dissipate and you struggle almost immediately. Azelf, not expecting this fumbles you and you drop towards the water floor. What happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Azelf catches you with her psychic powers and scolds you, but doesn't punish you<br>\r\nB: Azelf catches you with her psychic powers and, as a result of you almost dying she gets even more protective. Say goodbye to any of the freedom you would've had, had you not struggled.<br>\r\nC: Mespirit teleports you away using her powers, having sensed her Sister's love and decided to take a look for herself. Of course, she ends up falling for you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was far too risky to let him go, he could lead so many humans back here, no, she hardened herself when she decided that she would use this power. Any human that came here to capture her would be shrunken down and disposed of, while their pokemon would be released...but for this innocent one, she wouldn\u2019t go that far.

Your heart sank and you almost felt your skin prickle with those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-wha-bu-\u201c You stumbled over your words as Azelf looked at you sadly. But she steeled her gaze again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cpblue\">If I let you go you could tell others what happened here, and where to find the legendary Azelf. It\u2019s far too much of a risk to let you leave freely.</span>\u201d She said.

I won\u2019t say a word! I\u2019ll never come back! Just please let me go!\u201d You cried out. The fist holding you softened and loosened up to reposition you, having you sitting in her palm. After this a shadow was cast over you as she lifted her other paw above you. She was going to crush you, you just knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease no!\u201d You cried and shut your eyes, expecting oblivion at any moment. It never came though as you felt a warm soft feeling rubbing against your head...then down your back as you sat in her palm. You opened your eyes and found that she was petting you. This felt degrading!...But she didn\u2019t kill you. The face of Azelf looked kind for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cpblue\">This is my fault little human, I\u2019ve done something terrible to you, but don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t punish you as I would another member of your kind that would seek my capture.

Even worse, because your words were completely true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the Being of Willpower sat down on the tickling grass. Her other paw joined you as she brought you up to her face. Behind you, her twin tails rose and cupped together, forming a platform; Azelf set you down on top of them, her paws lowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Listen, I'm sorry. I'd really let you go, believe me, but I can't take the risk of others like you coming here.

You just kidnapped me and are keeping me against my-\" you trailed off, remembering what powers this legendary had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sure that, if you spoke the last word, she'd be more than glad to change your will and make you glad to stay with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you certainly didn't want her to mess with you any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue mountain seemed to have understood anyway,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, don't worry, I won't mess with your willpower.

There is no friendship yet. You just need to get used to it. I'll take good care of you, trust me, I'll feed and protect you. You could be a great company, y'know, we'd have each other and stuff like that...</span>\" she said, her smile appearing once more on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perspective seemed improbable to say the least, but it was truly amusing: a pokemon keeping a human. It was like some sort of role reversal, the pokemon being the master and the human like a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, she couldn't keep you like a pet. Her conscience would have never let go of her if she did, and she already felt guilty enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So I'm basically your pet. Wow, that's <i>totally</i> what I wanted when I woke up this morning.\" you sarcastically said, causing the giantess to feel even more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You're not my pet, you're my friend.</span>\" she insisted stubbornly, causing you to sigh deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, listen here. If you were my friend, or if you meant to be my friend, you'd grow me back right now and you'd send me home, believing me when I say that I won't tell about you! That's what friends do, you know!</span>\" you cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary smiled smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, you'll understand if I don't fully trust a human,</span>\" she replied with a calm tone,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Seriously, your kind keeps coming here, thinking they can fight me and capture me.

It was almost kind of frightening, considering that it was 6 PM and there was no sun in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly half an hour, you decided back home while discarding the idea of bringing a camping bag, you were going to stay for just half an hour. Luckily, you still had your phone, if anything went wrong you could call for help. That's all you needed for this little trip to the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quietly as you could, you navigated around the forest, hoping not to scare this mysterious pokemon off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt small, fallen branches and dead leaves crunching beneath your feet as you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have never admitted in front of a crowd, but you were staring to feel kind of nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing alone in the woods at such hour didn't seem like a good idea. Forests were the place where a lot didn't come back from...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly shook your cowardly thoughts off and proceeded, your left hand feeling the phone under your palm. If anything went wrong, you could still call for help, you comforted yourself again as you kept going, gazing around to check if the pokemon jumped out or if you at least caught a glimpse of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the most interesting creature you saw was a Snivy, who gave you a smug look before wandering off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wandered through the forest until you had enough of searching and looked at your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6:45 PM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly upset because of your poor results, you turned back, intending to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began walking the way you came from, hoping to get out of these woods by 7:00. You may have had little success, but you could still watch your favorite show in TV if you were quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked past the thick, green vegetation, a small rain beginning to fall from the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Great.</i>' you sarcastically thought as you began speeding up, cursing your earlier predictions that turned out to be true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you walked around in search of a way out of these woods, it soon became clear that you were lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaven't you already passed that really tall tree? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, guessing you've been just walking in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vague fear beginning to seep in your heart, you tried a different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how hard you tried or which way you took, you couldn't figure how to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" you muttered, cursing your stupidity. You could have stayed home like everyone else but no, you had to come in the middle of a godforsaken forest in the middle of a rainy afternoon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, taking out you phone, deciding to call someone that might've helped you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, your phone appeared... blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your eyes with a hand, before looking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt definitely looked blurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what was happening and rose your head up, discovering that, for some reason, the woods looked darker, like you had spent a very long time in darkness with only a small source of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's how everything appeared to your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if it had been holding back this whole time, the rain came like a thousand cold pins falling from the sky and you quickly began soaking wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed and hastily began dashing into the dark woods, hoping to find a shelter before you caught your death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran and ran, until you reached a rocky wall; there was a large opening in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe not everything had gone wrong, you thought while you ran towards the cavern and stumbled inside, your heart in your throat from the run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned against a wall and rested, watching as droplets of rain slid down your hair and head, falling down to the stone floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rose your head, praying that there wasn't any dangerous pokemon in this cave; luckily, no sound came from deeper within, suggesting that you were alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't guess how wrong you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to check the rain again... but stumbled back and tripped over your own feet, falling down on your rear in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there, in front of the entrance to this cave, was a small, almost humanoid creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a weirdly shaped dark grey head and a small body of the same color, and it had bright orange eyes; it looked like this... <i>thing</i> had no lower body, just its arms sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were proved wrong as the creature suddenly rose up, showing you the rest of its body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just as tall as your knee, yet it looked truly dreadful to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi?\" you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon - you assumed it was one - just stared at you, apparently examining you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wondered where it came from and if this was the pokemon you were looking for earlier; seeing no hostile intentions in its current behavior, you slowly took out your phone and focused on the screen, which didn't look blurry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd, you mused again as you did a quick research, trying to find a match with the pokemon in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just stood unmoving and silent, allowing you to focus on your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several minutes, but soon the image of a pokemon identical to the one you had in front of you caught your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Marshadow' it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily read the description, hoping  this wasn't a dangerous beast. Even the most adorable pokemon such as Jigglypuff were unpredictable after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>This legendary detains the power of hiding in the shadows and is known for observing without making any noise. If enraged, it can be extremely dangerous. Caution is highly recommended.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the description, you looked up at the 'Marshadow' again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA legendary no less! And if it got mad for any reason... you had to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey...\" you stammered, but trailed off rather quickly as you saw the small pokemon in front of you finally doing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it only looked like it had closed its eyes; but then, it opened them again, those two fiery red eyes, and your own eyes widened in surprise as...</span></div></div>",

He reaches it a second time and repeats what he was about to do, only for the water to be distant away again.

However, as soon as Sandshrew was about to rush towards the water, he slams into something that knock him on his back. He looks ahead and see a massive yellow spuishy wall....that seems to be covered with building size scales.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say the house was big would be an understatement. It was a veritable shelter of tons of different pokemon, it's own small village contained within these 4 walls. He nervously looked around as slowly, he felt like many many many eyes fell on him. A great rumbling overtook the air as a voice rang out, gentle but immeasurably powerful. \"<span class=\"cred\">Do not worry, I have brought this little Sandshrew to join us today, he was lost and abandoned in the forest before he found his way to our lake, he is young and frightened, please show him hospitality and treat him gently, he is one of our own now.</span>\" The voice intoned, and slowly, a few of the pokemon approached him before a bigger one made his way to the front. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">Well if big sis says that you're good people then i'll believe it! Good to meet ya! I'm Diggersby!</span>\" A big friendly smile played on the face of a Diggersby as he towered over the little Sandshrew. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">U-um, good to meet you too...</span>\" Sandshrew said, overwhelmed by all of this. Soon two tiny pokemon approached him. \"<span class=\"clred\">Are you</span>\" \"<span class=\"clblue\">From the world of giants?</span>\" The female Plusle and female Minun asked and slowly he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-if that's what you refer to as outside of here...y-yes.</span>\" He stammered and the two danced around him. \"<b>What's it like? What's it like?</b>\" They said in unison. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Girls, girls, don't overwhelm him.</span>\" A female Raichu stepped forward and bowed her head. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Don't mind them, they're just curious. I'm Raichu, are you hungry dear?</span>\" She asked as Sandshrew looked down. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm o-okay ma'am, thank y-you though...</span>\" He said as his stomach growled. She laughed a bit at this. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">It's no trouble, I understand this may seem...alien to you, but if Milotic brought you here that must mean you have a good heart, you'll find that this place is a sanctuary in time...</span>\" She said, smiling as she reached a paw out to lead the little Sandshrew inwards towards a corner of the giant structure. Reluctantly he took her hand and followed, the two younger electric pokemon following as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes followed the little Sandshrew as he walked, some waved, said hi, and he tried to wave back sometimes but mostly kept his head down. Soon he was greeted by a little alcove with an electic symbol above it and he ducked into it with Raichu. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">This is where me and my girls stay here, cozy, right?</span>\" There was a small alcove for food and heating up wood to cook with, two beds, and a table with a few chairs. No modern conveniences in sight however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">It's...n-nice...</span>\" He muttered and she smiled. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Go ahead and sit down, Plusle, Minun, be polite, okay?</span>\" She said and they nodded. \"<b>We will!</b>\" They said in unison as they sat in other chairs smiling at him, he nervously smiled back. \"<span class=\"clred\">So what happened to make you be brought here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Did bad pokemon drag you here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">Did you wander here by mistake?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Did you-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">GIRLS!</span>\" They heard from the corner with Raichu cutting up a bit of a fish sliver with a tiny sharp implement. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">I'm so sorry about them Sandshrew...</span>\" She said and he shook his head. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-it's okay...I th-think...</span>\" He said, sitting there nervously as the girls just smiled at him. He felt awkward. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-but to answer, I-I wandered he-here by mistake...</span>\" He said, recalling the past week, and he shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">Woooow.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well you have GOOD luck then!</span>\" They said, and he wasn't sure if they meant that or were trying to cheer him up. He didn't think it was good luck, the scenery didn't distract his mind from the fact that he was practically a speck now, a precarious speck on an island in the lake, surrounded by who knows what water pokemon...a magikarp would be a sea monster now beyond comprehension! He shivered before a small wood plate with fish on it was placed in front of him. \"Go ahead, you need to build up your strength again...you've probably had a harrowing day...\" The Raichu said gently as she also handed him a wooden fork and small cutting implement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">So did big sis Milotic play with you yet?</span>\" Plusle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I love it when she visits us! She's so nice and tells the best jokes!</span>\" Minun finished. And Raichu just smiled at them, while Sandshrew shivered a bit before taking a bite of the fish, not answering their question. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">T-thank you ma'am...</span>\" He muttered quietly, as he ate and stayed silent for the rest of it. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Just take your time...okay?</span>\" She gently placed a paw on his shoulder as he was eating, to try and reassure him.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't shake the terror he felt. It was the middle of the night when he was sitting outside, looking at the calm, endless stretch of water before him. If we was the size he was born at he was sure he would see the shore...at least if it weren't misty he'd be able to. He sighed before he heard a door opening at the massive structure behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still thinking about it huh?\" A Pancham, around his age came out. This guy had been doing his best to keep tabs on Sandshrew, but...he wasn't sure why, he just asked questions then left Sandshrew alone. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-I know yo-you don't understand but...</span>\" The Pancham sat next to him, chewing on the leaf in his mouth. \"Nah, it's cool. I can't say i've gone through with it, but your life just got upended right? Gotta be something to think on for quite a while.\" The Pancham said, nodding. \"Still though, gotta admit, it's a nice place ain't it?\" Pancham said, putting his paws behind his head and grinning. Sandshrew looked at him. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-how do y-you all do this, w-without being afraid?</span>\" He asked and Pancham looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we be afraid? That's an odd question...\" He said and Sandshrew looked at him. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-we're all so small here...w-what if a water pokemon c-came and-and...</span>\" Sandshrew said as he shivered. \"Ooooh, I get it...you DON'T get it, no pokemon in that lake would dream to mess with this island, they avoid it.\" Pancham said shrugging. \"Yeah, they're big I guess, but no one messes with us here...big sis won't let them.\" Pancham said casually and Sandshrew looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-what is the whole story w-with that?</span>\" Sandshrew asked and Pancham shrugged. \"Ask an older pokemon, I don't know all the details...don't care to know 'em. Something about divine punishment on our ancestors or something and I guess that Milotic took pity on them. She's not normal...been around longer than anyone here, that's for sure. Probably be around a long time after us...yup.\" Pancham said as he got up stretching. \"Dude, it's late. You should go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Pancham...you and Raichu are a-always checking on me...why?</span>\" Sandshrew asked and the other pokemon was walking away, and called back not turning his head. \"It'd be a jerk move to try and let you adjust on your own right? You should look for the Shinx in this place...he's a little older than us, still a kid though, and in something of the same boat as you.\" He said and Sandshrew turned his head. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-what do you mean...?</span>\" He asked and Pancham replied. \"He was big too, until about a year ago...though he's a neurotic mess...to be expected I suppose. He watched Milotic do...well...he saw the nasty side to big sis, his dad was a bad pokemon, dragged Shinx out here with him and...and he fears her. To be honest...I was hoping to talk to you so you could try and talk to him. No one else can get through to him. Big sis has given her best effort too but he refuses to go out on the lake with her. Some of us were thinking...you came from the same world as him right? Maybe...\" The Pancham seemed at a loss for words. \"Think about it, maybe you can help each other, who knows. I'm going to bed, just wanted to talk to you when we were alone. Later dude.\" And with that Pancham left Sandshrew out there alone, to look out on the water.</span></div></div>",

She smiled at him as she lowered her head back down to submerge once again, leaving Sandshrew alone in silence. He shivered slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cred\">Thank you little Pancham, I was hoping...maybe Sandshrew could talk to him.</span>' Milotic thought, relived that maybe someone might be able to get Shinx to open up a little...she did feel bad for him, he didn't ask for what happened to him...nor was it hard for her to blame his fear after she killed his dad in front of him, but still...if he could accept it, he'd at least be able to find happiness, as everyone else had here, right? '<span class=\"cred\">Sins of the father passed to the child.</span>' She thought. That summed up this entire island, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandshrew was making his way through the titanic fortress he now called home, hoping to find his target. If he could talk to Shinx, maybe he'd be able to alleviate some of his own anxiety here too! He hadn't fully explored everywhere there was to see in this place yet, but he was hoping to map it all out. He didn't want to impose on Raichu forever, he needed to strike out and find his own alcove to stay...if only because Plusle and Minun were driving him insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-will you get off p-please...</span>\" Sandshrew asked as Plusle was latched around his neck and Minun was holding onto her tail. \"<b>Only if you tell us what we're doing!</b>\" They said in unison. He wasn't sure how to respond. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm l-looking for someone today, a-and exploring the rest of this b-building hopefully...</span>\" He said and they still were latched on. \"<span class=\"clred\">Oh, we can help!</span>\" \"<span class=\"clblue\">Yeah, let us help!</span>\" They said and Sandshrew sighed. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">Please...girls, I-I need to f-find Shinx...</span>\" Immediately they let go of him and backed away. Sandshrew was surprised by this turn of events. \"<span class=\"clred\">Oh...you're looking for him...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Are you sure you want to talk to him...?</span>\" This was NOT their usual attitude Sandshrew noted, slowly he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">He...kind of just wanders around, not talking to anyone...sometimes he'll have a panic attack, or snap at someone randomly who didn't say anything.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">We've found him passed out half starved on top of a wooden beam on the second floor of here once...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he could be anywhere, Sandshrew gathered. He nodded, welp, time to start his search. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">Y-you girls s-should go play something f-fun, okay?</span>\" He offered and they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Let's go see if Aipom wants to play!</b>\" They said in unison as they hopped off, Sandshrew scratched his head. '<span class=\"cyellow\">They don't have a care in the world...</span>' He thought as he kept walking away from this scene, glad to have the feeling in his tail back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandshrew felt like he must've searched every inch of the place, and it was starting to get dark. He had at the very least met some nice new pokemon he hadn't seen before, but every time he brought up Shinx they either shrugged, gave a sad look, or scowled...nothing. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">M-maybe I s-should make my way b-back...</span>\" He said as he turned around, bumping into someone, he fell back onto his butt and shook his head. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">S-sorry...</span>\" He said only to see a terrified looking Shinx staring back. \"<span class=\"cblue\">You...I haven't seen you...I don't know you...who...what...</span>\" The Shinx was saying as he slowly backed away from Sandshrew. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">Pl-please, I need to t-talk to you...you were b-big like me, r-right?</span>\" Sandshrew said and the Shinx slowed down. \"<span class=\"cblue\">You...came from out there...you came from home...</span>\" He said, almost wistfully, savoring the words. Sandshrew nodded.</span></div></div>",

A novelty Sandshrew, oh look, the giants! And then they'll discard us...they've tried to with me, I just know it! Milotic...she's tried to get me to go out on the water with her alone...I hide and evade when the bell sounds...she'll never get me...i'll get off this island, WE'LL get off this island!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-we won't s-survive!</span>\" Sandshrew cried, he wanted to get the hell away from Shinx right about now. He was starting to realize why he got all those looks when he asked about Shinx. \"<span class=\"cblue\">We won't survive here! At least we have a shot out there!</span>\" Shinx cried as he looked at the Sandshrew. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Unless...you don't understand...you want to stay?</span>\" The Shinx said as he looked over Sandshrew before he...started to whimper and back away from Sandshrew. \"<span class=\"cblue\">No...i'm still alone aren't I...no...stay back!</span>\" His body language changed instantly to hostile. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Stay away from me! You can die if you want! I won't!</span>\" Shinx said as Sandshrew started to back off too. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-I just wanted t-to talk to you...b-but that's okay...I-I understand that y-you don't want to...</span>\" Sandshrew said, clearly nervous around Shinx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I don't!

And not even you then...</span>\" Raichu sighed as Sandshrew sat at her table resting his head on his paw. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Here, I want to thank you for trying at least.</span>\" She set an oddly cut bit of...he assumed it was an orange. '<span class=\"cyellow\">Man, what does an orange look like to me now?</span>' He thought as he picked up the chunk of citrus and took a bite. Still tasted the same. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">T-thank you m-ma'am...to b-be honest I was h-hoping he'd help me c-come to terms with m-my situation too...</span>\" Sandshrew said as her paw gently patted his back. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Well, I think you're coming to terms just fine myself, i'm happy to have you with us Sandshrew.</span>\" Raichu smiled at him. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Now do you know where my girls are?</span>\" And as if on cue two boundlessly energetic electric rodents appeared through the entrance to Raichu's alcove. \"<b>SANDSHREW! YOU'RE HERE!</b>\" They said in unison as they latched to him, knocking him over as he attempted to hold his orange still. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Girls...</span>\" Raichu sighed as they got off of him giggling. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-hey...</span>\" Sandshrew said as he slowly set the orange down on the table and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">So...</span>\" \"<span class=\"clblue\">Did you...?</span>\" They asked a bit quieter and he slowly nodded. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-I understand n-now...</span>\" They nodded back. There was a silence before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*GONG*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*GONG*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Plusle and Minun's faces seemed to light up. \"<b>Big sis! Big sis!</b>\" They said as they went out the entrance and Sandshrew looked out to see a crowd of pokemon gathering into a central area. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-what's t-this?</span>\" Sandshrew asked and Raichu walked over to take his hand. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">It's Milotic's visit. She brings us supplies, food, medicine, sometimes sweets for the kids, or some frivolity she got off of...someone trying to do something with the lake.</span>\" Raichu said as Sandshrew nodded. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">She can shrink all of that stuff down for us, it's...kinda nice.</span>\" Raichu said smiling, almost a bit sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*GONG*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*GONG*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandshrew also noted quite a few big Pokemon standing near a platform. A Zoroark, a Scizor, a Pangoro, an Ursaring...and quite a few more. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">They cut up the Magicarp that she delivers to us...it's a big job...takes them a while...but it's vital that they do it.</span>\" She smiled. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-but it must b-be huge!</span>\" Sandshrew said and she nodded. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">They have a process...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And someday i'll be up there doin' it too!\" They heard a voice call out as Pancham stood next to them. \"That's my old man up there, and someday, it'll be me there with him!\" He grinned. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Ah, Pancham...how are you tonight?</span>\" Raichu asked and he shrugged. \"I'm good...waiting for big sis...hope I get to go out with her tonight!\" He grinned and Raichu giggled. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Transparent, aren't you?</span>\" Right after she said this Sandshrew felt a shaking as he noted the roof of the fortress...was raising. Soon enough he saw it. The...would goddess be wrong? He didn't know, but he did know that she stretched into forever it seemed. She was there, with a mountain sized Magicarp in her mouth, but her eyes reeked of kindness. She gently set it down as it seemed to shrink from what would've been a mountain to a mere house sized Magicarp in what seemed to be a dedicated blocked off area in the fortress and she smiled down. \"<span class=\"cred\">Hello, just the Magicarp tonight friends, he was...dying and so I eased his suffering and delivered him here.</span>\" She looked around. \"<span class=\"cred\">But i'm not opposed to doing the usual trip on the water with some of you~</span>\" She said as she looked around and everyone seemed to be clamoring for the opportunity. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">J-jeez...</span>\" Sandshrew muttered and Raichu smiled. \"Must seem odd to you, right? You'll understand in time.\" And Milotic chuckled, a rumbling to them. \"<span class=\"cred\">Okay, okay, jeez...I already made my choice, okay?</span>\" She said with what seemed to be a light tone as Sandshrew felt the place quiet down.</span></div></div>",

I've seen some of your interactions here.</span>\" She said and he looked around \"<span class=\"cyellow\">Wh-wha...?</span>\" He asked and she smiled. \"<span class=\"cred\">Oh yes, I have, I can see a lot of things out there Sandshrew...many many things that would blow your mind.</span>\" She said in a mystical tone. \"<span class=\"cred\">I know what you want to eat right now!</span>\" She said seriously before finishing. \"<span class=\"cred\">...It's fish, right? Tell me i'm right?</span>\" She said in a light tone and he seemed puzzled by this before smiling a little bit and laughing. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">U-um...actually, t-that does sound kinda good...</span>\" He said, he had acquired a taste for it since he came here he found and she laughed a bit. \"<span class=\"cred\">See, told ya.</span>\" Her voice was still so powerful but...it felt oddly disarming right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Y-you're good...</span>\" He said and she chuckled. \"<span class=\"cred\">I really am...</span>\" It got a bit quiet again before she thought. '<span class=\"cred\">He really is shy, isn't he?</span>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">U-um, I do ha-have a question...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Oh?</span>\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-how can you h-hear me?</span>\" He said. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">Y-you're so b-big...</span>\" He said and she smiled. \"<span class=\"cred\">You don't tell a lady she's big Sandshrew, that's just rude.</span>\" She said playfully. \"<span class=\"cred\">And...I can hear all of you, just fine, as if you were the size I first saw you at.</span>\" She said and his eyes widened. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">R-really?</span>\" He asked. \"<span class=\"cred\">Yup...I have a bond with you, all of you that's tied to this lake, and the power I used to shrink you.</span>\" She said. \"<span class=\"cred\">Anyone else out there...no way you'd ever be able to hope of contacting them, even if you got into their ear somehow...but I can hear you clear as day.</span>\" She smiled a bit at this, and his retort was not what she expected. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-why isn't it a t-two way street and you q-quiet down...</span>\" He was still stuttering, but she could hear the playfulness in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Rude.</span>\" She simply stated, but chuckled all the same. \"<span class=\"cred\">Can't i'm afraid, this is as quiet as it gets for you. Can get louder if you want?</span>\" It was a joke, but Sandshrew snapped to attention. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">N-no ma'am.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got quiet again before Sandshrew muttered something again. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I don't t-think I d-deserve this...</span>\" He said and she seemed confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Taking it hard still?</span>\" She asked and to her surprise he said the opposite of what she expected. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">N-no...I mean...t-this place is n-nice...too n-nice for me...</span>\" He said dejectedly and she wanted to tilt her head before remembering her tiny passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">...Why were you out there all alone Sandshrew? You know this lake is well hidden right? To find this place...to STUMBLE on it...talk about achievement in ignorance...</span>\" She said as he looked down. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-i'm not ignorant...</span>\" And she smiled. \"<span class=\"cred\">It really is well hidden though, finding this place takes deliberation or dumb luck.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...I-I had to r-run...</span>\" Sandshrew said, Milotic got quiet, she felt like he was going to say his piece. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-I never knew m-my parents...I-I was on t-the streets for...a l-long time...I h-had friends though...a-all of us had n-nothing but...e-each other...</span>\" He said. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">T-the new...m-mayor I t-think...the city I-I was in...h-he didn't like t-the homeless problem...c-clean our streets I think he said...n-no more trash...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilotic closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-we all either h-had to leave or...</span>\" He cut himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...so I did...I w-went into the f-forest, h-hoping to find somewhere t-to go...I ha-had a small stockpile of f-fruit and my w-water bottle...I ran out w-within 2 days...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">T-this place...</span>\" He wanted to cry. He was tiny. Hopelessly naked to the elements, not even a speck worthy of attention but. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-i'm so happy...</span>\" He said and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Sandshrew...the world out there abandons what it doesn't want and takes what it desires...it has no business here...and it won't do anything to you ever again...</span>\" She said and he nodded. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-but Shinx, he-he doesn't see it that w-way...</span>\" Sandshrew said sadly. He was hoping he would make a friend with him, someone else who used to be big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">...I have to do sorry business to protect this place Sandshrew, it is necessary and Shinx was present when I needed to do this to his father. I spared Shinx because he was not brought here of his will and I would hope that he wouldn't do something in poor judgement...i'm hoping to not have to do that to him.</span>\" She sounded sad...and serious. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-what do you m-mean?</span>\" Sandshrew asked and she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Sandshrew...this place is a haven and sanctuary...I treasure the pokemon here, in the lake and on the island...I guard this place...but the pokemon here know secrets...and are sadly paying for the mistakes of their ancestors. My duty isn't only to guard this lake from outsiders...it's to keep you all here.</span>\" She said and Sandshrew's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">It is my duty, and I carry it out without hesitation, those that would spurn my protection...I must cast out...and when I cast them out...</span>\" She didn't need to finish her statement. Sandshrew felt the weight of it all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...T-that's scary...</span>\" He said nervously. \"<span class=\"cred\">It's necessary. Please don't be scared Sandshrew, I don't want you to have to think about this, I tell you because I want you to stop Shinx from doing something rash.</span>\" She said gently and he felt even more pressure from that statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...W-would you have...k-killed me?</span>\" He asked and she was silent for a second before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">If I deemed you unworthy or ill intentioned...yes.</span>\" And he gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-how long h-have you guarded t-the lake...Pancham s-says you're r-really old...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Rude rude rude! First you make a statement about my size, then my age! Yeesh...you'll be a real hit with the ladies Sandshrew. I'll talk to that little leaf chewer too...</span>\" She was joking again, trying to lighten the mood...he did smile a bit at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...I-I s-still don't t-think I deserve t-this.</span>\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">You do Sandshrew...you do.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-how m-many pokemon have y-you taken i-in like us...?</span>\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">It doesn't happen often...you and Shinx are the last ones in the past decade or so...before that...it was a little Pichu with her sick mom. She's Raichu now...</span>\" Sandshrew seemed surprised by this. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">S-she was f-from the outside world t-too?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">She was, poor dear was with her mom hoping for a fairy tale miracle from my lake...her mom was too far gone though...I took her in, she...also had a hard time adjusting.</span>\" Milotic said and Sandshrew grew quiet again, he looked out on the water, letting the stillness of it calm him. \"<span class=\"cred\">Here, i'll take you back now, i'm sure you're hungry and tired...and want to berate more women with your debonair charm.</span>\" She said jokingly as she turned around, rocking his world as she did, even if it was a gentle motion for her.</span></div></div>",

You belong here...and i'm trusting you to get through to Shinx...I also want you to let Pancham know that he's going on the water with me next, and that i'm going to teach him the proper way to talk about young ladies~ with manners.</span>\" She finished that with a serious tone that Sandshrew couldn't help but laugh at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'll i-inform him of his f-fate.</span>\" Sandshrew said as she let him down at the shore. It wasn't much of a walk to the doors from there. He looked at Milotic. The impossible titan before him...she wielded immense power, she had every control of his fate but...he was starting to understand why the pokemon here loved her so. He allowed himself to feel a little more at ease as he waved. He didn't know if she could see it, but he had a smile too she nodded to him and sunk into the water, leaving Sandshrew there alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">O-okay...t-time for dinner, t-then bed.</span>\" He said as he nodded to himself and approached the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't call her old! I just said she had been around a while!\" Pancham said, losing his cool for the first time Sandshrew had seen. Raichu for her part was laughing hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-but you said s-she was around w-with your ancestors...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She WAS! I didn't say she was old! Do you know what she's gonna do to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Lecture you for hours on end on pointers with women, while bringing all girl pokemon your age out on the water with you. Then tell your dad.</span>\" Raichu grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably! Sandshrew...why...\" He was holding his paws out, looking comically distressed as Sandshrew looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">S-sorry...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">It's fine, it just means Pancham has something to look forward to now.</span>\" Raichu grinned and he looked down, defeated. \"I'm going home...see you two around...\" He muttered sadly as he waved. His cool image was certainly dinged in Sandshrew's eyes...but he couldn't help but snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Um...let's h-hang out together s-sometime...for r-real!</span>\" Sandshrew said and Pancham looked back and smiled, looking a bit less sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...i'll drag you out there with me when she comes back.\" He said and waved again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Come on Sandshrew, you must be hungry.</span>\" Raichu said as she led him back to her alcove, where a plate of fish waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandshrew had finished his meal, but Raichu wasn't letting him leave the table until he said how the trip went. Sandshrew for his part was struggling because he didn't know how much he wanted to bring up. He eventually started talking though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">She...w-was funny, i-in good spirits a-and tried to s-settle me d-down and comfort me. She also t-told me a little b-bit of her d-duties and...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Don't leave the island?</span>\" Raichu offered and Sandshrew nodded with a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">She's serious about that, don't take it lightly...but you won't try that, right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sandshrew shook his head. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">No w-way! This is...the b-best thing that's ever h-happened to me.</span>\" Sandshrew said, taking Raichu aback a little before she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Really? That committed huh?</span>\" She grinned and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-I never had a h-home...only a few f-friends on the street w-with me...t-they made fun of my s-stutter too...</span>\" Sandshrew was rubbing his paws together and Raichu frowned a bit at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Rough life huh?</span>\" She said as she patted his head. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">So did she tell you about me then?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandshrew was surprised to hear Raichu bring it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">A l-little...</span>\" He said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">You know my dad was against it, my mom and I trying this. Said she should spend her last days in peace, not on a journey like this, chasing a fantasy...a fairy tale. I stubbornly refused to accept it...she just wanted to be with me. I wonder if he's still out there sometimes...in the outside world.</span>\" Raichu said a bit wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">D-do you think of t-trying to l-leave?</span>\" Sandshrew said and Raichu chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">When I first got here...yeah, I thought about it. My mom died the day we got here...it wasn't Milotic though...it was the water. The water heals pokemon...but it specifies itself to the unique needs of the pokemon. My mom...there was no saving her. What she needed...she needed to be eased, she died at peace, Milotic kept saying. I didn't want to accept any of it and I found myself here...the size I am now, crying.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-how'd you g-get by?</span>\" Sandshrew asked and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">The pokemon here were eager to take me in, they tried to comfort me. Milotic too...she took me out like she did for you tonight. Though she didn't tell me what would happen if I tried to escape that night, she only wanted to talk about my mom...I understood a lot about this place that night.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked towards the corner of the room, where Plusle and Minun were curled up on their cots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Their parents...didn't heed her warnings, they were born here but...wanted better than this island for their daughters.</span>\" Raichu said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">They were infants, and Milotic wasn't going to punish them for what their parents tried. I offered to take them...I was a teen at the time.</span>\" She smiled. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">I have a lot Sandshrew, a life. I'm glad that you're counting your blessings too.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...D-do they k-know?</span>\" Sandshrew asked and Raichu looked at him. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">...Yeah. They know.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...I n-need to f-find Shinx t-then...</span>\" Sandshrew said and Raichu gave a small nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I'm glad you don't want to give up on that...for now though, I think you need to go to bed.</span>\" Raichu smiled and pointed to the cot Sandshrew had been using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Y-yeah...I am t-tired...</span>\" He said as he made his way from the table towards it. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Wash up first!</span>\" He heard and he looked to see her smiling. He nodded, getting ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning...he'd decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

He doesn't know too much of the girl other than the fact that most of the students find her a bit weird, and she is supposed to be a very strong pyschic pokemon. Before Zorua could debate wheither it might be a good idea to prank the girl or not, Gothorita stops walking exactly one step before the mark where the prank is supposed to set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, what do we have here?\" Gothorita says in a quiet cheery, yet eery tone. She looks up where the prank is, even though its very well hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shoot, did she found my prank already?</i> Zorua nervously thought to himself as he wonders how she can even sense his prank. <i>No, there's no way she can-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua could finish that thought, Gothorita's eyes glows, and psychically pulls down the bucket with enough force, she also pulls Zorua along with the rope. Zorua screams a bit when he felt himself falling to the ground when he stops in midair. He looks and see Gothorita's smiling face looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whose this little guy?\" Gothorita says as she pinches Zorua's cheek. \"Might it be the famous prankster i heard so much about in class? I thought the other pokemon said you were good at pranking.\" She says with a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi, i was expecting a friend, um... a mimikyu to come by.\" Zorua says, lying as his friend move out of town last week. Gothorita laughs a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a great prankster, you're a really awful lier.\" She says as she taps her head, indicating she read his thought. Zorua gulps a bit as he knew he was caught. \"Still, since you and I are talking, why not be friends?\" She asks her cheery and still eery tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... S-Sure?\" Zorua says as he figures he doesn't have a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tee hee, good.\" Gothorita says with a sweet smile, before opening her eyes. \"Since we are friends, would you like to help me with a new move i have been working on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua got really nervous as he has no idea what this girl is going to do with him. Though, with the fact he is still in her psychic grip, he figures he doesn't have a choice, again. \"What exactly is the new move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGothorita smiles as she says nothing and raise one of her hands below the hovering fox. Her eyes glow once again as she says one simple word. \"Shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one quick section, in a blinding flash, Zorua found himself falling. He flails his arms and leg in fear until finally he landed on a soft yet very dark ground. He was confuse of what just happen before he heard a voice that made him nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what a wonderful 'shrinking' result.\" Gothorita's voice could be heard follow by her giggling, except it was different, her voice is very loud.

He was her friend...or pet...or plaything...maybe all 3!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cplum\">Close to all 3, my little specky Zorua.</span>' Gothita thought, as she made it to her home...and made for her room where she looked in the mirror, not even able to make him out with her eyes, figuring because of how covered in red he was.

She picked up on his thoughts...he felt lost, so so lost, and sticky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was seeing nothing but red, tasted the awful taste of red, and was absolutely covered in the makeup. Her simple little lipstick tube did all of this to him...he was frightened. Gothorita enjoyed having Zorua under her grasp, but she didn't intend to hurt him, and him being frightened wasn't something she necessarily wanted, though she understood it. She'd keep it to herself for now though, as it stood, she'd release him from the simple prison and landscape that was her lipstick coated lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Well Zorua, let's see if I can find you now.</span>\" She whispered as she got up.

An opportunity to experience what no other pokemon has ever experienced before. For now though...</span>\" She levitated a glass forward, of water and lowered Zorua into it. It was like a massive ocean. He looked up at the distant sky, glass rising higher and higher...and looking down he couldn't even see the bottom of the glass.

Gothorita pondered this. She was being as quiet as she could...maybe she should invest in learning to speak psychically. She didn't want to blow his ears out. Smiling she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Don't worry, i'm just going to get a little food for us...you can wade water, right?</span>\" She said as she walked off, leaving the floating speck in the glass of water.</span></div></div>",

The galaxy size pokemon walkimg and moving around was also makimg things extremely difficult for the nano fox as so much gunk of the lips stick were getting on his fur and covering him head to paw. With so much of the gunk on him, Zorua doubts he's going to wash the stuff off for weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, it seems fate is going to test that theory as Gothorita looks at the time, seeing that its almost been several hours since her nice nap, and forgetting Zorua's exsistent, and its starting to get late. \"<span class=\"cviolet\">Hmmm, I think a lovely bath would be nice before going to bed.</span>\" Gothorita tells herself as she make her way to her bathroom. There she stands in front of the tub as she turns some knobs and warm water pours out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zorua traverse the endless red landscape, he hears a extremely loud noise coming from the outside. \"Ugh, what is she doing now?\" Zorua says outloud as he tries to ignore the loud noise. However, shortly after hearing the noise, Zorua takes a few step before his paw sinks into a what's supposed to be a dry spot but now wet section of the makeup. Zorua tries to pull himself out but notices that the whole area is getting wet. Zorua looks around and see that the whole makeup is melting. \"What's going on?!\" He screams in fear as endless mounds of red lipstick is melting and a tsunami is rushing towards Zorua. Zorua closes his eyes as he is engulf by the red sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGothorita looks at the running water, waiting for the tub to be fill. Hot steam can be seen from the tub and making contact against her face. Soon, she felt the makeup on her lip is running. \"<span class=\"cviolet\">Oops, forgot i put on a layer earlier.</span>\" She chuckles to herself as she sees drops of the lipstick falling into the tub. She waits a few seconds before closing the knobs. She then starts ti get inside the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt like he enter the world's most nuassciating ride in as he felt himself dropping for countless miles until finally a loud splash surrounds him. He felt himself still trap in a gulp of the makeup before he slowly started to feel warm. Soon warm water engulfs Zorua, causing him to figure out where is the surface of where ever he is now. After trying to not drown, Zorua manage to make it to the surface, chocking a bit as he see himself lost in a endless ocean of warm water. \"W-where am i now...and...w-where's gothorita?\" Zorua nervously ask himself as he looks around and sees no traces of Gothorita anywhere. He tried looking up, but a extremely thick layer of what looks like fog or cloud block his view. Unfortunately, things were getting worse as a loud rumbling can be heard high above. Zorua looks up in time to see a omni size black horizon coming right down into the ocean thousands of miles away from Zorua, yet close enough to create a tsunami wve that crash into Zorua. Soon another horizon came crashing down on the opposite side of the fox as that wave crash into him, making the poor fox to bounce around in the ocean, more confuse of what is going on. Sadly, the wasn't the end as a loud rumble can be hear high above Zorua, making him wish the crazy ride would just end as he looks up. He gulps as he sees nothing but a black sky falling towards his direction. He swims as fast as he could be the sky just basically lands almost right on top of him, creating a wave below him and dragging him away from the impact. As soon as the wave finally settle, Zorua looks around to see what almost crush him. The fog was cleared out due the landscapes impacting into the ocean, giving the fox a sight that made him wish he was bigger so he could escape, Gothorita's everlooming body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo both sides of the fox is Gothorita's knees, her hip just below Zorua. Gothorita's stomach and chest can be seen \"slightly\" above the ocean surface. And finally, Gothorita's galactic face can be seen countless miles ahead of the fox, looking very please  and relax with herself as she enjoys the warm water against her skin. Zorua realizes he must be in Gothorita's tub, and in some sense, taking a bath with the very forgetful psychic. He wish he could swim away, but knows he need her help some how, provided he can even get her to notice him. \"Hey, Gothorita!\" Zorua shouts, preying the galatic pokemon can hear him, but should've remember that its pointless to try to speak normally at his size, it has to be mentally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua wonders if its even possible, but he thought that, even though the current situation is akward, this might be a good oppurtunity as surely Gothorita can hear his thoughts now that she is relax with nothing to distract her.....ok, he highly doubts that how being a psychic even works, he's a dark type for crying out loud, bit what choice does he have left other than swim to any part of her body for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time to try to broadcast his thoughts to Gothorita....</span></div></div>",

Whether he is far too small or he is simply too far away from her head, Zorua panics a bit as he tries to to figure out what he's going to do. Suddenly the water started to rumble all around him as his omni-size savior and tormentor is slightly adjusting herself. This simple action is far more than enough to create tsunamis and hurrican like storm for the poor nano fox as the psychic sighs in blissful relieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she sees the bar of soap and reaches for it. Her actions were blocked from the dense ammount of steam around Zorua, so he has no idea what she is going to do exactly. It didn't take him long as some of the steam clear up a bit just to make way for a incoming mass of bubbly substance. Zorua was just out of the way from the soap's path to get drench and submerge in the endless bathtub ocean.

With no other option, Zorua tries to swim towards the psychic's knees before she finishes her foot and brings the soap close to Zorua just to clean her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late however as Gothorita's celestial size body moves again as she submerge her foot to wash the soap off, moving the soap out of the water and have it hovering directly above Zorua's position. To make matters far worse than it need to be, the soap start to get slippery and soon Gothorita lost her grip and the soap drops. Zorua gulps as his area grew dark and he looks up to see a system size bar of soap filling his sky as he covers his eyes before it impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGothorita saw the soap slip and only giggles to herself of not paying attention to the little thing as she reaches for it. As for Zorua, the good news for him is that by some dumb amount of miraculous luck, the soap didn't turn him into paste.

Everyone at school knows her very well, even Zorua, as he did once or twice try to prank her only to end with a disaster. While showing no signs of distast or anger towards his shenanigans, Absol has given Zorua reason to be very intimidated of her. She can be either the most caring classmate to talk to, or the most terrifying force on the planet. Even the bullies at school shuts up and listen to her when she enters the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this might be a bad idea....\" Zorua says as he trembles of the thought of pranking Absol again. Last time he tried it with a couple of cookies and a spicy berry, Absol forced him in a maid outfit and force him to clean the whole school for everyone to see.....it was very embaressing. \"Then again, what else she could that's worse than that?\" Zorua say as he waits for Absol to get into posistion and debates on the possible consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsol, wearing her usual attire of glasses, a megastone as a hairpiece and a bow on her main, was walking through the forest for the first time, only for one thing. Word through the vinewhip is that Zorua might be trying to pull a prank again, which she had to get the info through one of Zorua's friends, so she figures she should look into it. Normally she would ignore such thing as she knows that while Zorua's pranks are usually harmless, they are starting to annoyed the teachers and principle enough that they ask her if she can convince him to dial it down by alot. Begrudgingly, she accepts the request and goes out to look for him. So far she sees nothing that can indicate a prank, but once she got into few feet close to a certain spot, her sense for disaster kicks in and she stops a foot before the spot beneath the bucket. She looks up to see the prank and scoffs a bit. \"Not one of his more inventive pranks.\" She says, somewhat sounding a bit disapointed as she uses shadow swipe and destroys the buckter, covering her claws with a bit if honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua trembles at the spot as he watch the class president destroy his prank with ease and now is scanning the area for him. Nervously, Zorua tries to see if he either remains quiet as he could or back away slowly, he might have a chance to avoid the wrath of Absol. Unfortunately, luck was nowhere at his side as Absol scans the area a bit before instantly pouncing towards the direction where Zorua is and knocks him on his back with her planting on his chest and stomach. \"Hello Zorua, fancing seeing you hear.\" She says while adjusting her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi A-Absol.\" He says in fear as he looks up at the terrifying pokemon's face as she looks like she's judging his fate. \"S-so what are you d-doing here in this fine f-forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny you should mention that,\" Absol says in a stern tone as she moves her face close to Zorua's face to where her nose boops his, letting Zorua see the eyes of fear. \"I was about to mind my business and head home to read some books when Principal Gardevoir asks me to talk to you about your last prank you did with Mawile. She really didn't appreciated the poster you drew and plaster in the gym wall for everyone to see.\" She says as she remembers the poster, which had Mawile in a swimsuit as some pokemon storm by and accidentally knocks her clothes half way through, one of Mawile's embaressing memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I t-thought she c-could use some attention, since she always claim boys n-never go to her for s-some reason. Figure a nice look of her w-would be nice...\" Zorua, somewhat trying to justify his prank and doing it poorly. Absol cleary sees through the lie and nudge her face closer, making Zorua more nervous. Though she does know Zorua spoke some truth as Mawile did talk to her the other of the topic, truth was that Mawile is one of those types of tough people whose very hostile towards people who try to see her as easy target to flirt, she just needs to learn some patience is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, well whatever your intentions are, your prank seem to be enough for me JUSTIFY my next punishment for you.\" Absol says as she stand back again to full height, but not letting her paw off Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your going to force me in a maid outfit again and clean the whole town this time?\" Zorua says in nervousness, as he has no idea how to recover from that type of embaressment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting on the thought and might be more humoress for me to see, but not this time. This time you are going to play test dummy for something i just recently came up with. A new pokemon move no one has ever came up with if you would call it that.\" Absol says as she closes her eyes to focus on the very move she talked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What type of move i-is it?\" Zorua says in fear, scared to see what Absol is going to try on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...\" is all she said as her eyes open up with a bright look the created a flash the blinded Zorua. He rubs his eyes as tries to figure out what exactly the move Absol did on him did, besides blinding him. His vision slowly recovers a bit, but he doesn't see Absol in front of him. However, when he is able to see again, he saw a sight that terrify him to his very core.</span></div></div>",

This area is so strange and alien to him, almost like he got transported to a new world. The ground was black, hard as rocks, and there are so many ditches and cayons, Zorua looks inside one of them and gulps as he could not see the bottom of the cayon. Zorua then looks up and was rather disturb by horizon in the distant. Far in the distant looks like a red sun that can fill the sky any second with a black center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the who situation finally settle enough, Zorua got up from his spot and calls out for the class president. \"Absol, where are you!?\" He scream out, thinking this must be some weird trick the pokemon did. His voice echos in the distant as nothing replies to him. He tries to call out again, but soon the air explodes as a powerful force knocks the fox down as he covers his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force was so strong and powerful, Zorua could not figure out where it came from or what causes it. He could only wish that the class president is somewhere close by to save him. Unbeknowst to Zorua, she is far closer than he realizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZooming out, far, far out, the fox hasn't realizes that what he is standing on is just a pad that belongs to the paw of Absol, the smallest pad on her paw. Absol scans her paw as she tries to find Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Absol looks at her paw, not blinking as to not risk making her task more difficult than it is. \"Oh dear, should have restrain myself more than i had when using this new move.\" She says to herself. \"I've only just started using this move, and already i went far more than i wanted to with Zorua.\" She says with a sound of both slight concern and mostly stoicism. She wanted to shrink the fox, but not to a size where she can't even see the little guy. This would only prove more difficult as Absol is not a psychic pokemon, so there is no way she could hear Zorua's thought to even have a clue where he is. Yet, she shows little concern of the matter. \"Hmmm,\" Absol wonders to herself just how much she should even try to find Zorua, for all she knows, she shrunk so much that at this point, he's a lost cost to even find. However, she's class president, and someone that tries to care for anyone. Then again, Zorua has been proving quite the trouble maker as of late. \"The shrinking move is supposed to make the shrunky much more durable the smaller they get. So it could be far too mean to just abandon the little guy, epsecially since i'm still in the foresr.\" She debates with herself. \"Then again, i just made Zorua my testing dummy for this new move, and i still need practice so that way i don't go this far again, so it might prove more beneficial for me to find him.

Not to mention, if all goes well Zorua would make the perfect test subject for her new move. The trouble was finding him, he was apparently so small that his presence seemed to be all but gone. Nonetheless she tried her best to look for the fox somewhere on her paw and started squinting to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zorua's world began to violently shake and the red and black sun in the far distance began to rapidly get closer. As more red took up the sky he was sure it was going to crash down onto him so he hunkered down and cowered, only to risk a peak to see that it stopped advancing. It looked strangely familiar somehow but it was far too large to make out. The dark center surrounded by all the red was constantly moving, turning from side to side and sometimes even pointing right at him. Gathering the courage to stand up and study the thing that was dominating the upper half of this strange world Zorua was on the cusp of realizing what it actually was until suddenly, the landscape started moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsol was currently turning her paw, testing if a new angle would help her spot the small fox but after moving her limb for a bit it was quickly apparent that it didn't. She leaned her head back in momentary defeat and let out a frustrated sigh while she thought of what else she could do. But back on the paw, Zorua was having the worst troubles of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world turned lopsided and he found himself tumbling down the black landscape. Through some luck he was able to grab onto a small bump in the terrain and stabilized himself but the sight just behind scared him stiff, the edge of one of the large canyons he saw just before. Before he could scramble away a large gust of wind ruined his footing and down he plummeted, impacting and tumbling off the cliff-face for what felt like forever. The fall was so long, in fact, that Zorua's panic began to wear off and he realized that all the collisions weren't hurting for some reason. After the light grew dim, he lightly hit the bottom where the floor felt warm and slightly soft. he sat there, not sure what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of Zorua's hectic journey, Absol continued brainstorming. She didn't want to reveal her secret and let other Pokemon know of her new move but if Zorua was to be rescued, it might be required. A Pokemon that was small enough to get a closer look might work, she figured, but a psychic Pokemon might also be able to locate him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on it, she decides.</span></div></div>",

She did thought of maybe some psychic pokemon, but there's no telling if they even can sense Zorua. On top of that, it would be rather difficult to convince them that she capable of shrinking pokemons without demonstrating the move she has yet to fully control. The only other option is small, tiny pokemon and see if maybe they can even help. Though that may prove slightly troubling as she only knows very few pokemon that go to school while are the size that any pokemon could accidentally step on them without knowing, some of which she embarrassingly had a part of stepping on as well. She smiles as she easily could think of one pokemon that would be willing to believe her and help her search for Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zorua, if you can hear me, try to stay on my paw. I'll have someone to look for you.\" Absol spokes at her paw, hoping the shrunken fox understood her. With that, she prepares to move while awkwardly walking with three of her other paws and tries to avoid using the paw Zorua is trap on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sadly was not having the most pleasant experience as he was trapped in \"cayon,\" unaware that he's practically trapped in one of countless cracks and wrinkles that makes up the surface of the rather smooth to the naked eye pad on Absol's paw. At first, the light above was still dim and making everything hard to see, but at the red sky that stares down at the location of where the fox is at. That soon changes as the red sky soon vanishes, and a slightly clearer light could be seen. However, things gets worse as a almighty force booms down and hurt Zorua's ears as he tries to cover his ears. The sound was so loud and intense, he thought for sure that he was going deaf any second now. The loud celestial thunder noise was going on for a while before finally things got quiet. Zorua, still having his ears ache in pain, looks up in hopes that this was the worst things would only get. Sadly, it was not as the world started rumble and soon everything shakes as if someone strapped a galaxy size rocket to the world and everything got shove to one direction from the sheer amount of g-force. Zorua felt himself get slingshot to one side of the walls and his body is practically glue to the warm, rough surface as the world rumbles and moves violently. Thankfully for Zorua, him getting trapped where he is made it to where he wouldn't have to worry about flying off the millisecond the alien world start moving. That being said, Zorua had no choice but to endure the terrifying ride of his life as he has no idea when the world will finally stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither pokemon realizes just how lucky Zorua is in his current situation. had the fox stay on the surface of Absol's paw, Absol would've unknowingly catapulted Zorua off her paw before she even finishes her first step. Thankfully for Absol, she wouldn't have to go far to meet the pokemon she's sure will help her, which will only take her about five to ten minutes of walking, even by walking awkwardly with three of her legs. Unfortunately for Zorua, that is five to ten minutes to the normal size world of having to endure a terrifying ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Absol made it back to school and begin scanning the area for the pokemon she's looking for. \"Come on, she normally loves to stay around at school.\" She says as she's having difficulty find the particular pokemon. A few seconds later, and her eyes spot the pokemon she's looking for. Smiling at herself and adjusting her glasses a bit, Absol makes her way to...</span></div></div>",

While she could be trusted with the knowledge of Absol's size-changing abilities she was also the smallest Pokemon she knew and would hopefully be able to perceive the shrunken fox Pokemon. The tiny bee-fly Pokemon was lazily hovering around and noticed Absol out the corner of her eye, prompting her to happily fly over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibombee flew right up to Absol's face and excitedly waved. \"Hey, Absol!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ribombee. I was wondering if you might be able to help me with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" she asked, perching on one of the claws of her raised paw. \"School stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, It's a bit embarrassing really. Long story short, I was tasked with talking to Zorua about his behavior and I thought cutting him down to size with this new move I learned would make him more agreeable. The trouble is, I don't exactly have the hang of it yet and I made him too small, I'm pretty sure he's on my paw somewhere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibombee looked at Absol with doubt and crossed her arms. \"That's something. So you can change the size of Pokemon and you made him so small that you can't even see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Absol nodded. \"I know it sounds like a joke but I'm serious. I figured that you could get a closer look and find him for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds far fetched, but since your my best friend I'm going to trust you, okay?\" Saying that, Ribombee hopped down onto her paw proper and leaned down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was absolutely knackered. The massive earthquake lasted for nearly ten minutes and after being repeatedly catapulted back and forward his muscles were incredibly sore and he barely had the energy to stand up. The booming noises came back for a while but after the ten minutes of shaking the thunderous rumbling felt like nothing so he just laid there, staring up at sky from the bottom of the valley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw something huge rush by. Struggling to sit up, Zorua tried to follow where the giant blur went and just over the horizon of the cliff-face, he saw something that made his jaw drop. It was a Ribombee, a terrifyingly huge one. Zorua could only see her head and the brown scarf around her neck but he was certain that this massive bug Pokemon in the far distance was the class vice president from school. Zorua had never messed with her that much for the simple fact her ability to fly made her a difficult target but she was always on his case about his attitude. The sight made no sense to him and as Ribombee started to talk he could hear the words she was saying, even if they were extremely loud and distorted. She was talking to Absol!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But wait...</i>, Zorua thought. <i>No, this is obviously an illusion of some type. A dark-type move I don't know about. That would be impossible, that would mean...</i> His train of thought was interrupted when Ribombee jumped closer, sending Zorua flying into the air several feet. Now she was right above him and her face got so close that it took up most of the sky, just like that strange red and black thing from before. Her head slowly moved side to side until her eyes seemingly locked onto him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Zorua, it felt like they had just made eye contact.</span></div></div>",

Soon the world rumbles a bit as she slowly squints her eyes and soon moves her face even closer. Soon, just the tinies part of her eye fills up the whole sky as she looms over where Zorua is stuck at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibombee wonder to herself if she can even help Absol find Zorua considering what she just said about shrinking him so much that she can't find him. If anything, she was beginning to wonder if maybe all the task that of being class president was making her friends slightly imagine the whole thing. But she trust her friend enough that there should be some form of truth of what she said. The bee had to scan the paw thoroughly as she didn't want to risk missing the tiny fox. After maybe a minute, nothing happens. However, she looks down, right between her knees and saw a tiny, even to her, crack or wrinkle, and inside the crack is a miniscule speck, so small and pathetically insignificant, that Ribombee can easily thought it was nothing more then dust that is stuck inside Absol's paw. Scratch that, its even smaller and even more insignificant than a speck of dust that its a miracle that Ribombee notices. Slightly curious, Ribombee had to move her face closer to the paw, enough that tip of her face is almost touching the paw pad. She had to squint really hard before she could see the miniscule speck slightly clearer. As soon as she did, she gasp a bit as she could make some form of details of the speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you weren't kidding Absol, you shrunk the little guy a lot.\" Ribombee spoke as she looks at her friend with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found him?\" Absol ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely, he's so small, i think he's inside one of the cracks on your paw pads.\" Ribombee says as she looks back at Zorua's location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two talk about Zorua, they can't see how terrify the poor fox is as he covers his ears. Ribombee's words slow and distorted, yet so powerful that just a mere whisper could wipe out a city with ease. It only got worse as the familiat thunder that is Absol speaking came up and booms down on Zorua. Zorua was so confuse of what's going on that he doesn't see that not only Ribombee is back at looking at his location, but so is Absol, even though she can't see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>So what should we do next?</b></font>\" Ribombee spoke down, trying to look down on Zorua, not realizing her words hurt the poor fox. Soon the thunderous noise of Absol spoke, which Zorua could not understand at all. \"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Yeah, i think that's a good idea.</b></font>\" Ribombee spoke, as she can understand Absol perfectly. Zorua has no idea what the girls' talking about, as he can barely understand Ribombee. \"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Hey Zorua,</b></font>\" Ribombee spoke down tk the fox, making him nervously look up to the goddess like bee, even if she doesn't notice him looking up. \"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>We're going to help you, but first....</b></font> Ribombee continues to speak, while somewhat giving the fox comfort that they are willing to help, what she says next makes Zorua very nervous.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ribombee's request left Zorua both nervous and confused. Not only did he lack the experience of a mountain climber, the cliff walls to the either side of him stretched so high up that it would probably take days to scale them. Shifting nervously on the spot he was about to try and yell up to the godly bee Pokemon that it was impossible when suddenly, she began lowering a hand toward him. The sight made him yelp in surprise as he watched the giant limb that was many times the size of the canyon descend and impact the ground up above. He was further shocked to see that the cliff-face didn't crumble and break, but rather bend and distort like a soft pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pushed further and further down until it was essentially pressing against the bottom of the valley a short distance away from him. The sheer size of Ribombee's hand intimidated Zorua but he clung onto hope that she was legitimately trying to help him. He ran toward the black bug-like limb as fast as he could and reached it a few minutes later before gathering the courage to try and climb onto it. Saying that, it was incredibly difficult because he essentially had to go under it and climb upward from there. He thought about dropping down and trying to take another route but the hand suddenly began moving, giving Zorua no choice and taking him with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua held on for dear life as it rapidly rose, breathing a sigh of relief when the surface rotated and gave him the luxury of laying down rather than being forced to hold himself up. He could still feel it rising while the gravity of the motion pinning him down but eventually it stopped and he got a moment to re-orientated himself. Before him was the utterly massive face of Ribombee and she had a smile that Zorua couldn't figure out was for relief, endearment or complacency. He was about to try and yell out to her when something from behind sent shock-waves through the air that risked knocking him off his new platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Ribombee spoke. Her mind-boggling loud voice was still as powerful as ever. \"Yeah, he's right on the top of my hand. You don't see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind him, Zorua once again let out a yelp. The huge red and black thing from before was back, though this time he was beginning to piece together what it was, or rather, who it belonged to. That, combined with the paw-like landscape and claws he could just see far down below only confirmed it. \"Absol?!\" he blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they didn't hear him and they continued their conversations and Absol's voice blared over him before Ribombee replied. \"Well, I see him. He's <i>really</i> small. Are you sure you don't need a microscope or something for this?\" Once again there was more booming, followed by Ribombee's thunderous voice. \"Well, if you're sure, he's right here. But have you really got the hang of this, Absol? This is what, the second time you've done something like this to a Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsol said something that was unintelligible to Zorua and her red eyes faded into the far distance, leaving only the concerned face of the god-like Ribombee looking down at him. It was distressing to him that Absol was going to try and fix this when she apparently couldn't even see him but he desperately hoped it would turn out okay. After a brief pause, Zorua could feel something start to happen.</span></div></div>",

Soon, a familiar bright flash blinds him, and Ribombee, as Absol does her size changing move again. Zorua rubs his eyes before he manages to see again. He was expecting to be back to normal size, or at least a size that isn't so miniscule, but looking around him, he was still the same size. However, something, or in this case, someone, definitely got hit by Absol's move. Zorua felt the \"ground\" he is standing on vibrating and shifting below him. He looks around and all around him, Ribombee's body glows a bit as her body is changing. Zorua looks up and can see the goddess like bee's face, wondering at first why the fox hasn't grew at first before her expression turn to shock and concern as she felt her body changing. \"Oh no...\" Is all Zorua could say as he thinks he knows what the class president just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Absol, what going on with me?\" Ribombee stammers as she felt the world around her slowly shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I missed Zorua.\" Absol got nervous, not only for Zorua, who must be, and is most certainly is, terrify as his \"world\" is about to get a lot bigger. Ribombee hears this and got nervous as she looks at her hand, and sees the miniscule speck she struggle to see is shrinking before her eyes as she is growing. The bee got nervous for the fox as she's worry she is going to lose track of Zorua any second now before she immediately thought of something. She grabs her backpack and pulls out a bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stumbles back as he lands on his back, watching the vice president slowly growing before his eyes as she grows and grows before her face starts to get blurry. Soon as she spoke, Ribombee's booming voice got louder and far more distorted before her voice is reaching the level of Absol's. Zorua soon sees Ribombee looking at his direction again, with a face of worry as she has to squint very hard to keep track of where he is. Zorua fears of having the same experience as Absol and that Ribombee will reach a size where she no longer can see him. However, her face changes as she looks like she has a idea. Zorua had to immediately hold on to where he is at as Ribombee shifts her body. Loud metal clangs could be heard in the distant as Zorua struggles to see what the ever growing bee is doing. Soon a loud \"pop\" like sound could also be heard before Ribombee looks back at Zorua's direction. Zorua was worry what the bee is going to do before he got his answer as his world tilts. Zorua felt himself drifting towards the side of the bug hand as Ribombee tilts her hand more and more. Zorua was scare of what the bee is doing that he tries to grab to the hand as much as possible but it was too late as he fell off the hand and is falling down. Zorua flails his paws as he tries to close his eyes and brace himself for a painful drop. After what felt like an hour for the poor fox, Zorua did indeed lands on something, but it was surprising soft....and very gooey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looks around and founds himself in a strange sticky ocean like world where the surface just shifts and jiggles. Wondering where he is, he takes a scoop of the strange substance and likes it. \"....Honey?\" Before Zorua could even wonder where he is, a loud booming voice hurts his ears as he struggle to look up before he saw the eyes of Ribombee gazing down at his location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, Ribombee simply grabs her lunch, which was a very tiny bottle of honey and drops Zorua in it, a bottle of honey that is dwindling in the growing bee's hand. \"S-stay safe in there, Zorua.\" She says as she soon loses track of the shrunken fox before she closes the lid on the bottle. \"Absol, please tell me you know how big you just made me.\" Ribombee pleas to her friend as she starts growing past Absol's shoulder and is about to reach her head, and that's just Ribombee standing on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know, I only try to grow Zorua a little bit that way we could see him better.\" Absol says, while worry for the fox no trapped in the tiny bottle of honey, is worry just how big she just made her friend. All three pokemon watches as Ribombee grows....</span></div></div>",

Ribombee looks at her hand and can thankfully see the miniscule fox still on her hand and still at the same size. \"I don't get it, I should be able to grow Zorua by now.\" She says as she ponders to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever try growing something before?\" Ribombee asks, now both girls ponder why Absol's size changing ability isn't working. This might be dangerous for the fox as the two could be talking for quite a bit while also forgetting that their simple actions are heavily affecting Zorua's world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes actually, I tried on a tiny pebble back home when I first made this move.\" Absol says, remembering the moment. \"Accidentally grew the thing into a boulder. Shrunk it later and like that it was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Ribombee tries to think a bit as she moves her hand to her mouth, the same hand Zorua is on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls' voice were painful for the poor fox as they continue their conversation. Zorua struggles to keep his ears from hurting as he hears the omni-sun exploding voice of Absol and the distorted thunderous voice of Ribombee. As Zorua winces in pain, he felt his world shaking a lot. He grabs hold on to the land immediately as he felt the bug hand landscape moving and tilting a bit as he looks and is terrify to see the sky-filling face of Ribombee growing bigger as she moves her hand to her face. \"R-Ribombee, please stop!\" Zorua tries to shout out to the vice president, but it was no use as his voice can't be heard by anyone. Zorua was scare that the bee is about to scratch her face or something and forgot that Zorua is still on her. Zorua closes his eyes as he could see the bee's lips soon filling up his vision and it looks like he's about to smack right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud thud and rumble could be heard and felt, but Zorua notices that he wasn't getting squished. He looks behind himself, which is easier said than done as he is clinging to the hand while trying to no let go and fall to who knows where, and see the plateaus and mountain region of Ribombee's lips. She simply place her hand above her lips as she and Absol were deep in thought. As much as Zorua is worry of looking down and see that he would fall quite a bit somewhere one the bee's body should he let go, his worries got worse as he sees the lips moving and parting as they-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you are out of energy for the move.\" Ribombee's voice plaster Zorua into her hand as being so close to her mouth was so much worse than being a distant from it. Zorua's ears ring hard as he tries his best to keep his grip on the hand and not fall, or worse, get launch from the sheer force of Ribombee's voice and what's straight in front of her, Absol's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have more than enough energy that if I wanted to, I could shrink this whole school to a quarter and still have enough energy to at least grow it to maybe a large bug.\" Absol boasts, though not 100% sure if she can even go that far of shrinking the whole school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then could it because the little guy is so small?\" The two continue their conversation, not realizing that they, especially Ribombee, are putting the poor fox through a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, it could be possible.\" Absol ponders on the idea and is worry of what Ribombee might be going to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you have to see physically see Zorua and order for the move to actually work.\" The bee proclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, then Zorua is stuck at that size.\" Absol says. \"The only way that I can fix this is to somehow shrink myself to where i can see him enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever tried something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I thought it would be too risky for a move that I only just create.\" Absol says,\" True, I did, more or less, carelessly use the move on Zorua, but I never thought I had the ability to shrink him that far.\" She says with a bit of embarrassment of her screwing up this badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continue to talk, Ribombee's voice pounding on Zorua was getting more and more painful that Zorua could feel his grip on the bee's hand slipping. He has no idea how long he can hold on, which doesn't help that these two omni goddess-like pokemon show no signs of finishing their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do?\" Ribombee asks, wondering how the two can even solve this problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way I see it, here are our possible options.\" Absol states. \"One option is that I try one more time, and see if it works this time. Second option is that I attempt to shrink myself and hope I can grow Zorua. Third option is that I try to practice this move and see if i can thoroughly master this move. Fourth option would be to just leave Zorua like this then as I have no idea where to go from there, but I refuse to take that idea.\" Ribombee couldn't help but smirk a bit, respecting her friend of taking her responsibility seriously that she's ll try to help the little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I think i like the third option far more, though now that i think of it what should we do with the little guy?\" Ribombee asks. \"No one is going to believe that you shrunk him, and he's far too vulnerable at his size to do anything. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, hmm...\"Absol did wonder a bit on what should they do with Zorua. <i>I could just ask Ribombee to stay with me at my house for the night and we could get Zorua to grow hopefully soon. Though it might take a while and it might be better to just have Ribombee to look after him since she can see him.</i> Absol ponders a bit before she looks at Ribombee and notices that she has her hand on her mouth. \"Um, speaking of which, where is Zorua?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ribombee wonder what Asbol means before she gasp a bit and realizes she move her hand to her mouth, not realizing the sheer havoc she put Zorua in. Ribombee moves her hand back to the position she had earlier and looks for the fox. Looking around, Ribombee....</span></div></div>",

In a moment of panic Ribombee scanned over it several times before looking up at Absol with shame. \"I think he fell off. Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsol sighed, forgiving her mistake. \"Don't worry about it, at that size Zorua should be relatively safe, we just need to spend some more time looking for him again. Do you have any idea where he fell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibombee shrugged, feeling bad for losing him. Without a word both of them got to the ground and started searching, parting blades of grass and analyzing the surface of stray leaves. They both searched for nearly half an hour and were no closer to finding him, becoming worried that at his size the small fox would be indistinguishable from all the particles of dirt. Ribombee sat back, defeated. \"We might need to get more help,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibombee stared down at the grass below her and then, out of pure coincidence, her eyes wandered just below her brown scarf to her yellow-furred stomach where she spotted a small speck on the tip of one of her furs. She jolted up when she realized that it might have been Zorua but unfortunately the movement sent it falling deeper into her short fur. \"I think I just saw him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsol's head bolted up from the ground. \"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I just saw him on my stomach somewhere in my fur. I saw it for a second but I'm confident it was him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was right. Thirty minutes earlier Zorua was unable to withstand all the massive movements and bone-shaking rumbling until it all became too much. The fox lost his grip and because of the angle Ribombee was holding her hand at time, he was sent falling towards her body. The fall was agonizingly long but eventually he harmlessly impacted against what felt like a massive tree log. It was brown and stretched an incredibly long distance, interweaving with a whole bunch of other brown fibers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough before he could acclimate to his new surrounding, Ribombee began to move, causing Zorua to slip off the massive strand of fur. He tumbled and tumbled, smacking against countless other furs until they changed from their brown colour to a bright yellow. With some luck, Zorua was able to dig his claws into one massive fur and stop his descent down her body. Looking around him at the horizontal forest of hairs, he guessed he was half-way inside her short fur coat. Starting to get <i>really </i>annoyed about his predicament, he grit his teeth and crawled along the seemingly endless strand of fur toward the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, it began to get thinner and it was getting more difficult to hold on while the end of the fur bobbed more noticably from Ribombee's movements. Thankfully, he was starting to see more than just fur now. Trying his best, he could <i>just</i> see her face far, far above him. \"Hey, down here!\" he yelled, waving a paw. He smiled hopefully when her eyes wandered down to where he was sitting but his joy was short lived when Ribombee suddenly jolted, sending him flying back into her fur...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's around there somewhere?\" Absol asked, pointing a claw at Ribombee's mid-section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certain,\" she nodded, carefully prodding a hand through her fur. It felt strange to her that the school trouble-maker was stuck somewhere on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsol let out a quiet groan, this was all becoming too much of a hassle. If they knew his location Absol probably would have left him with Ribombee while she practiced her new move some more but she thought it was too dangerous to leave him lost like this. It was possible he could fall off to the ground somewhere and then they would never find him! With their options dwindling, she thought that more Pokemon might have to be roped into the situation to help. She also considered just shrinking herself now and taking on the task of finding him herself with the hopes the move works as intended. That way, she could even make Zorua bigger again as soon as she found him. Still, she thought about it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The massive bee's hand was so massive that it easily dwarfs the strands of fur that surrounds the minuscule fox. Zorua then thought of climbing the strands of fur themselves, but looking up to try to see the tip of the strands, that would proof far more difficult than said. When Zorua fell deeper into Ribomber's fur and to her very stomach, the area grew incredibly dark with the faintest amount of light barely visible miles high up. By the time Zorua even makes it to the top of one single strand of fur, Ribombee would graduate pokeschool. And speaking of which, Zorua felt the world tremble and the air shaken as the living world he's stranded on is opening her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Ribombee opens her eyes after some time has passed, practically taking a nap at that point. She yawns a bit as she looks at her hand. \"Zorua, did you manage to make it?\" She asks while scanning her hand. She pouts as she sees no trace of the familiar speck and looks back at her stomach, fearing Zorua is still trapped in there. <i>Should've figure its too much to ask the little guy to climb my hand at his size.</i> She thought to herself. She looks at the time and sees that she still has plenty of time before she needs to start heading home. \"Ok Zorua, I'm going to try to find you myself. Try to not move.\" She says as she adjusts herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox hears this and panics as he tries to run to the hand and grab it before it was too late. It was too late however, as his world violently shakes as the bee herself moves herself into a comfortable position, unaware she knock Zorua around and away from her hand a bit. Thankfully for Zorua, he was still at the same area, but things were not looking great as he looks ahead of him and watch the gigantic platform that is Ribombee's hand lifting up and leaving him behind. He looks up and could barely see the distant planet of Ribombee's face gazing down at his location, unaware of where exactly Zorua is. That soon change as Ribombee's face is immediately replace as a massive black landmass covers the sky and is about to drop right on top of Zorua's location. Zorua panics and runs as fast as he could away from the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibombee looks at her belly and lowers the tip of her hand down on her belly and began moving around as slowly as she can to look for Zorua. She could barely see the bottom of her fur, so finding Zorua is going to prove incredibly difficult, but it doesn't mean she can enjoy it.She hums to herself as she moves her hand around, giggling here and there as she accidentally tickles herself. If only the bee knows just how much trouble she is causing Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua ran in fear as a horizon filling hand nearly lands on him and is bulldozing the area. The ground trembles as the hand creates tremors. The strands of furs groan as they bend under the hand as it runs over them, some of which nearly pinned Zorua down. If Zorua wasn't running for his life, he would hear the thunderous hums Ribombee is making as she searches for Zorua. Zorua could feel the terrifying gigantic bulldozer of Ribombee's hand chasing after Zorua, going significantly faster than the fox is, even though Ribombee is going at a very slow pace. Zorua fears he will get run over any second now and will get dragged around by the titanic plateau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this massive game of Hide and Seek continues for some time...</span></div></div>",

Keeping herself from getting bored, she hums softly as she moves her hand slowly, trying to see the bottom of her fur to find any traces of Zorua. <i>Searching for the little guy is getting harder than I thought, maybe I should have gone with Absol's idea of shrinking herself down.</i> Ribombee thought to herself. <i>Still at least if i find Zorua soon, I can have some fun with him by myself when i get home.</i> She giggles at the thought of her playing with such a shrunken pokemon that she almost distracted herself of what she is focusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zorua wasn't having the best time at all as he struggles to flee from the bee goddess's hand. No matter where he goes, Ribombee's hand would soon immediately brush past and threaten to flatten the nano size fox, making him change direction. For what felt like forever, Zorua nearly got ram four time in just the last thirty seconds, making him wonder if the bee pokemon is even trying to look for him or using this as a excuse to brush her fur. He could look up and can see the smiling face of both his savior and tormentor as he wishes that the sheer size Ribombee has over him would make it easier for her to see him, but that wasn't the case. As Zorua tries to focus on running, his path got block once again as Ribombee moves her hand and unknowingly slams it right in front of him, knocking him back a bit of a distant. Zorua groans to himself as he tries to recover, only to panic as he felt the ground rumble and looks ahead in fear. Moving towards him was none other than Ribombee's hand as she slowly drags it towards Zorua. There was no way Zorua was going to avoid getting ram and could only close his eyes as he waits for the hand to drag him all over the bee goddess's body in a vain attempt to find him. The world shakes violently as the hand draws closer and closer, practically a good mile away. The area soon grew dark as the hand is ready to run over Zorua when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"HHHMMMM?\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful thunder roars over Zorua as he notices that the hand stops just a mere few feet away from. He looks up and gulps a bit as he see Ribombee looking right at his direction, squinting as she thinks she sees something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhmm?\" Ribombee has been searching her stomach for a good minute, not really in a rush to leave the area and head home, when she moves her hand a bit and soon spot a very minuscule speck at the very bottom of her fur. She had to squint her eyes and try to move her face closer before a smile forms on her face. \"Aha, find you.\" She chimes as she can barely see Zorua. \"Hold still for one second, I'll get you out of there.\" She says as she moves her hand again and slowly tries to grab the tiny fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Hold still for one second, I'll get you out of there.\"</b></font> Is what Zorua barely understood as he tries to cover his ears a bit from the bee goddess's words. He was so busy to cover his ears, he didn't had time to react when the ground shakes again and the hand that almost ran over him moves again, this time ramming into the fox. If it wasn't for one of the effect's of Absol's shrinking ability to make the shrunken victim far more durable the smaller they get, Zorua would have been immediately turn to paste, but instead feels the immense weight of something that feels like a hard pillow pressing on him. He was ok, but still was scare as Ribombee continues to press on him. Soon, Zorua felt a strong gust of wind on him as he opens his eyes and saw that he is being lifted up and is leaving the forest of fur that was on Ribombee's stomach. While he was glad to be out of the dense area, he was still terrified for his life as he soon is greeted by the familiar omni-size face of Ribombee as he is stranded on the middle of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Hope you had fun exploring your vice president.\"</b></font> The sheer explosive force that escapes from the bee's mouth blast against Zorua as he covers his ears. He wishes that the gigantic pokemon could see that her voice is so powerful that its literally hurting him, but due to his small size, that will not happen anytime soon.<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"> \"Sorry for dropping you, but at least you're perfectly ok.\"</font></b> She says with a \"small\" giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...ok...\" Zorua could only muster the energy to say that to himself as he endures his classmate's voice. That would soon change as Ribombee's face is soon replace by some gigantic landmass. \"W-wait, she wouldn't!\" Zorua panics as his sky is darken and is dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibombee giggles a bit as she uses her other hand to press down on Zorua, like he was a tiny toy or something to pet. \"I got to say, you are quite adorable at this new size.\" Ribombee says as she lifts her hand up and sees Zorua in the middle of her hand. \"Too bad I can't convince you or Absol to stay at this size, you be the cutest thing to have.\" Once recovering from getting press down and nearly turn into a pancake, Zorua got very nervous of the idea of staying this small for the rest of his life with everything that has happen in the last hour....that and blush a bit of being called adorable and cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, at least you get to hang out with me until Absol can grow you back to normal.\" Ribombee says with a peppy smile, which still didn't instill confidence for the poor fox. \"Don't worry, I'll keep you from getting bored until then.\" She says as she soon closes her hand as she then gets up from her position to finally stand. \"Now then, how about we head to my place finally, then we can figure out on what we can do to pass the time.\" She says with a smile, seemingly to enjoy this moment a lot now that she has Zorua in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm doom...\" Zorua says before his world grew dark. He soon sees Ribombee closing her hand again as she didn't want to lose Zorua in her flight home. Zorua braces himself as he was in for a very bumpy ride as the cheerful bee goddess in preparing to take flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her school bag with her other hand, Ribombee soon takes flight and soon leaves the school ground. She keeps a close eye on the close hand that Zorua is in as she flies home. Thankfully for her, at this time of day, flying home would be a easy breeze that wouldn't take her long, provided she doesn't get distracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time of flying....</span></div></div>",

She made sure to check on him every now and then, careful not to tilt her paw by accident, leading Zorua to fall to his grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it was a nice day. Even a small breeze would have threatened to blow Zorua off her hand without her even noticing, and that was why Ribombee kept a close eye on her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the diminutive fox himself, the perspective ahead of him looked pretty grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only he was impossibly tiny, but he was forced to wait for Absol to learn how to reverse the shrinking, and who knew how long that was going to take. And, as if it wasn't enough, Zorua was stuck with the vice president, who had already mentioned  she was 'keeping him from getting bored' until the moment he was going to grow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe supposed he didn't have a choice though. He was better off with Ribombee, who was supposedly going to take care of him, instead of being lost in her fur. Zorua's only pray was that she wasn't going to 'play rough' with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh, there we are,</span>\" he suddenly heard the booming voice of his fellow classmate, causing him to look past her ship-sized palm, only to notice an impossibly big building in front of the two of them, but he knew that was only the front entrance of Ribombee's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, the fairy-type let go of her bag and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Finally home...</span>\" she moaned, her voice raining over Zorua like the explosion of a bomb... several bombs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, let's get somewhere more... private before thinking about you. </span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the titaness fluttered deeper into the house while Zorua glanced at what was going to be his home for a while. He didn't suppose the bee was going to return him to his forest and, honestly, he didn't really want that right now, despite how badly his fur was tingling as he wondered what this bee goddess was going to do with/to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ribombee reached her room, closing the door behind herself before going to close the window with her free hand immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she was finally free to focus on her tiny passenger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, Zorua,</span>\" she addressed her paw with a smile,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Looks like it's just the two of us now, as it'll be for a while apparently. Just until Absol learns how to grow you back up. Shame though, you look so cute like that~,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua didn't even pay attention to the comment, too busy shielding his ears with his paws to really listen to what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I can barely even see you,</span>\" Ribombee continued, donning a fascinated smile on her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Honestly, I bet you're having lots of fun! I mean, with that size, it's like you're on another planet!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua glared in direction of the bee fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?\" he snarled, irritated by her carefree behavior,<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your damn mind!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insult went unheard, mostly because Ribombee couldn't hear him at all, and partly because she was busily examining him, wondering what she should have done first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, while thinking how to 'pass the time' like she promised, she felt a growl coming from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from afar, Zorua's mind registered the noise and he was suddenly glad he wasn't on her yellow-furred tummy anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Um, let's get something to eat first, then we can talk about what to do.</span>\" the giantess spoke, sounding vaguely eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething Zorua did not like at all, albeit Ribombee being excited meant that she didn't hold any hard feelings for his pranks, meaning she wasn't going to play rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither that, or she was luring him into a sense of false security before tormenting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made the dark-type fox shiver, though he quickly forgot his train of thought as he felt Ribombee moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy-type fluttered over to her desk; a plate of cookies conveniently rested on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibombee picked one in her free hand and broke off a tiny piece, before placing it on top of her other hand, in front of Zorua. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Eat up, you're going to need it,</span>\" she recommended, before eating the rest of the cookie that was on her other paw, quickly picking another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt his stomach growling too and approached the giant piece of cookie that was in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, when Ribombee had her fill of cookies and Zorua had eaten his fill as well, the giantess hovered to her bed and sat down, looking at the tiny fox with a familiar smile on her white face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, let's get down to business, Zorua,</span>\" she said playfully, once more causing her the shrunken prankster that was her classmate to cover his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be a miracle if he got out of this with his hearing still intact... no, it was going to be a miracle if he got out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out...\" he murmured, knowing she couldn't hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Are you saying something down there? I sorta can't hear you. Um... I'm sure we'll find some way to communicate,</span>\" Ribombee spoke,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That can wait though. As for now, let's kill the time.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she began thinking what to do with her little classmate and, for the time being, roomie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her wanted to play a game, but she knew that moving too much would meant losing Zorua again, and she didn't want that, not when it took nearly an hour to find him on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, there were a few activities that didn't involve moving around; sure, they'd be far less exciting, but it was better than risking, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hmm...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the bee giantess thought, Zorua could only look at her and hope for the best.</span></div></div>",

The flight is rather pleasant that if she wanted to, she could make several detours and still make it safely to home without any problems.  Ribombee occasionally looks at her close hand, making sure the tiny fox is still safe inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Zorua, while really wishing he was back to normal right now, is doing ok for the most part. The ride is extremely bumpy for the poor fox, even if the omni size vice class president flying as gently as she could. Zorua could never keep his footing or stay at the same spot for a second. It felt like he was trap in a world made of trampoline as he would bounce in one direction and bounce to the next. If it wasn't for the fact that Ribombee's hand is thankfully not hard as a rock at Zorua's size, the fox might've been bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't Zorua, we're almost at my place.\" Ribombee says. She was about five minutes to her home, with her about to enter the neighborhood. However, as determine the bee pokemon is to return home with her shrunken classmate, she hears something that stops her in her track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ribombee!\" Ribombee hears a voice familiar to her and looks around. In the distant, she sees several classmates from her school, all of which she knows. She spots a Mawile, a Leavanny, a Hatterene, and a Pheromosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey everyone!\" Ribombee says cheerfully as she was about to fly towards the group before she stops herself and remembers one particular fox. She wanted to get home, but she wants to have a quick chat with the girls, with her hands being free. There was no way she would ever convince any of the girls that she has Zorua, especially with Haterene and Pheromosa, each girls are far to big to see and sense the fox. She would have to store Zorua in her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly pulls her backpack and opens it, seeing some stuff like school supplies, a tiny bottle of honey, makeup supplies,a diary, and clothes for something like gym or going out. She's not going to have time to choose where to stuff Zorua, so she did what she simply could think off. \"Hey, Zorua, i need to talk to some friends, but i need you to stay in here. I'll look for you later, until then just try to wait around.....and don't read my diary.\" She says as she lowers her hand and drops the fox inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua panics when he felt hinself sliding off the hands of Ribombee and is left in the dark abyss of her backpack. He could only watch up in nervousness as he could only see Ribombee's cheerful face before the world grows dark as the bee goddess closes the backpack, with only a small glimmer of light that allows the fox to barely see outside. Soon the worse happens and Zorua is bouncing around as Ribombee puts her backpack back on and flies towards her friends.  The fox was at complete disaray as he couldn't tell what's going on as he struggles to grab on to anything to prevent him being catapulted from one side to the next. Thankfully, the flight didn't last long, unfortunately, something familiar comes back to Zorua and in full horrific force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua could try to muster his senses, his ears get blasted but thunderous explosions that could be heard high above, almost as bad when Absol spoke, or sometimes even far worse. It didn't help that he hears four seprate explosion and they vary from loud to extremely painful. Once again, if it wasn't for Absol's shrinking ability to also allow Zorua to be very durable to anything painful at his current size, he probably would've gone deaf already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua, in a attempt to even see what's going on, looks up and is immediatly terrify of what he sees, more pokemons, more pokemon that are far bigger than Ribombee or even Absol. The fox is scare of the sight as each girls are terrifying huge and would be nightmarish to be lost on if Zorua was very unfortunate to ger caught by them. And he recognizes every single one of them, as he has try to prank them in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMawile, while she is one of the smallest of the group, excluding Ribombee at the moment, would be terrifying for Zorua to get lost with. She may be smaller than some of the others, but she is one of the toughest girls Zorua ever seen at school. She would be consider the school star athelete, as she participate with many sport activity like swimming and soccer, but especially martial arts. She also has a very big appetite, one that could rival a snorlax and yet stay so slim. She's practially the main reason why Zorua was shrunk today as she was a bit of a victim of Zorua prank where, in a attempt to have boys wanting to come up to her and try to get a date, he place poster of her in a swimsuit just as some pokemon accidentally knock half of her clothes. Defiantly one moment Mawile isn't going to let go anytime soon. (There's actually a chapter that goes more into this, but i don't remember where exaclty, try looking at the first chapter with Absol involve)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeavanny, a rather fashion pokemon, enjoy making clothes while also being a bit nosey into other people's buisness. She tends to be one of the classmates who enjoys making small gossips around the school, usually harmless. Zorua did try to prank her once, but it fail spectaurally on him. Zorua once try to make Leavanny mess up on one of her clothes she was making, one thing that lead to another, Zorua end up creating a mess and ends up stuck in pink rabbit suit for a whole day. While it wasn't Zorua's best day, it only got worse when Leavanny later spread a gossip that Zorua did it to impress someone at school for their affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHatterene is one of the tallest girls in school and defiantely one of the classmates everyone is scare of. She's a antiscocial to everyone, not liking everyone trying to force their way to be friends with and would use her powers to scare them away. Though, rumor has it that she's one of of the wealthiest students in school, so something like that maybe why she doesn't like it when the other students try to be friends with her. Though, here, she looks very calm and peaceful, almost like she could be one of the nicest pokemon to talk to as she seems to have a lovely confersation with the tiny bee pokemon. Anyways, Zorua once try to prank her, and never tried to ever again as the tsundare-like pokemon threaten his existence, and let's leave it like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the last one, Pheromosa, defiantely the one pokemon Zorua is absolutey terrified to be lost on, as she is easily one of the tallest pokemon, if not, the tallest student at school. Everyone, including teachers, had to look up even when Pheromosa squats down to talk to other pokemons. While her freakish size is one that makes other nervous to talk to her, she's consider one of the most popular girls at school. She tends to be one of the girls everyone would talk about at school, only second behind Absol.  While word has it she's a bit of a clean freak, she is consider to be a rather considerate person and can be quite cute, provide you don't get on her bad side where she pummels you to the ground that is. Zorua try a few times to prank her, but Pheromosa's size, and surprising hidden power, makes her extremely difficult to prank on. The last time he almost succeded on pranking her, she manages to not only avoid getting prank on, but manages to grab Zorua and lifts him up to her face. While she did gave him a warning to never prank her again, he remembers Pheromosa being rather flirty to him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of these girls are now so nightmarishily titanic, and at Zorua's small size, there would be no way they would ever see him. Zorua is scare what the girls would try to do if they ever knew of his shrunken fate. However, his mind is quickly interrupted as he felt his world violently shake.  Confuse, Zorua looks up and sees....</span></div></div>",

Time was slow for the fox, but he could feel the terrifying action of Absol moving as he is paster to the somewhat spongy walls as the class president begins to walk again, this time inside the school itself. Zorua struggles to look up and see the world zooming past at what might as well be the speed of light for the fox. He struggles to see the silhouette Ribombee as she sat on Absol's paw, mainly to enjoy the ride, and blocks most of Zorua's view of the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Absol and Ribombee, the school wasn't going to close down completely for the night for another hour or two, which gives them plenty of time to head to one room in particular. The two make their way past the halls and doors until they see the room they're looking for, the science room. The two enter the room and find no one inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor? Professor?!\" Absol shouts out to the teacher and can't seem to find her. \"Hmm, guess she must've left already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the better for us I guess.\" Ribombee says, \"Now let's hurry up and find a microscope to look for Zorua.\" She says with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Absol says as she closes the door behind her. She sees a microscope that is already set out, which was a bit annoying to the class president as rules states that all lab equipment must be put away, though she'll make a small exception for this one. \"Ribombee, can you find a petri dish so i can set Zorua on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away.\" Ribombee says as she gets up and starts flying around to find a good petri dish. Absol makes her way to the microscope and begins fiddling with it to turn it on and begin changing the setting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was begin to feel both sick of this terrifying movement speed that has him stuck to the wall for quite a bit while also surprisingly use to the feeling enough that he wonders how long this moving planet is going to keep moving. All he could here from the safety of his area to the outside world is Ribombee speaking and the thunderous boom that hurts his ears for a long time now. After while, the movement finally stops, letting the fox to relax a bit and tries to not puke from the nauseating ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found one!\" The familiar booming voice of Ribombee could still be heard before a loud \"clang\" like noise could be heard in the distant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she doing now?\" Zorua spoke to himself, wishing that this insane ride would finally end already. Sadly for the fox, its far from even being remotely ending as his world start shift and tilt. The world rumbles and shakes as the sky shifts in stir, making the fox wish he was looking at Ribombee's face again. Soon, Zorua felt himself sliding from the wall and is heading to the sky. He struggles to grab on to anything as the world is going upside down, literally. He felt the familiar feeling of him falling through the canyon, this going outside. He did everything he could as he didn't want to fall again, but this prove fruitless as he fail to grab anything and is outside the deep canyon. He looks down and sees something in the distant the look very weird and clear. The fox feel for what felt like thousands of mile before he makes contact to the ground. He groans in pain, but is shock to see that he is perfectly ok. He looks around at his new surrounding and see that he is on some kind of glass surface, with a bright sun high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, he's perfectly safe on the petri dish.\" The familiar loud rumble hits Zorua from behind as he looks and see Ribombee's face far away while looking at his direction. He was confuse as to who he was talking to before a loud thunderous click and rumble could be heard high above him. He looks and saw something that he couldn't see too well moving across the sky as something similar takes its place. This happens twice before whatever was above sets in place and soon a loud noise could be heard far above those, a sound of something gasping. A low rumble could be heard towards the direction next to Ribombee as a endless wall of white could be seen lowering itself. Zorua was confuse before he was terrify to see not only the familiar sight of red black sun, this time two of them, was starring at his direction, but he sees a blurry absurdly massive face of Absol, looking right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful boom escapes through the class president's mouth as she otters one word, \"Zorua,\" as she is amaze to see the fox at such a minuscule size, she had to use the strongest setting on the microscope to properly see the fox. Zorua watches Absol moving herself back up to look through the microscope again, leaving Zorua to look up and could barely see her mouth in the distant. Before Zorua could do anything, he covers his ears when he hears Ribombee speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, told you that you shrunk the little guy a lot.\" Ribombee says, not noticing that Zorua is wincing in pain from her voice, but thankfully Absol does now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ribombee!\" Absol tries to stop her friend from speaking before stopping herself when she also realizes her voice must be far more powerful than the flying bug pokemon. \"Zorua, can you understand me?\" Absol whispers her voice as quietly as possible. To Zorua, Absol's voice is still powerful and booming, but thankfully for him, he can somewhat understand the celestial size class president. Absol looks at her friend. \"Our voice are so strong to Zorua because of his size that its hurting him if we speak normally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibombee gasp a bit before feeling a bit embarrass, but mostly sorry, that she didn't thought of how strong her voice must be to Zorua. Absol looks at Zorua again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Zorua, I didn't mean to shrink you this much.\" Absol says, feeling very sorry that she put Zorua through quite a lot in just a short time. \"I'll make this up to you later, but let's try to see if we can at least grow you to normal size, or any size that's better than that.\" Zorua, while still covering his ears, smiles that the class president is willing to help him when she could have easily abandon him at his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you grow him back to normal?\" Ribombee ask, while whispering as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I could, but I've yet to figure out to master the size changing move. If I'm not careful, I could shrink Zorua even more, prabably down to a size we will never find him.\" Absol says, making Zorua scare of the idea. \"S-sorry Zorua, but I'm being honest. Listen, I got my journal that I used to write down the size changing move, though its in my locker. Let me go get it and see if maybe i can thinking of a way to try it out on something here and then I'll try to grow you back.\" Absol says as she carefully move down from the microscope. \"Ribombee, can you find me something that i can try the move on? Something that at least no one will miss if i accidentally shrink it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got something, but its in my locker.\" Ribombee says. \"I'll go get it quickly.\" She says as she bolts from the room to make her way to her locker at the other side of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zorua, just try to stay where you're are and remain calm. We'll be back shortly.\" Absol says as she makes her way out of the room as well, leaving the minuscule fox alone under the microscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Please don't take to long...\" Zorua says, as he sits down to relax for a bit. He smiles as he's glad the girls are going to him. He hopes they can grow back to normal, as he doesn't want to be stuck at this size any longer. After what felt like forever, Zorua lays on the glass surface of the petri dish, wondering how long he got to wait for the girls. He looks around at his surrounding to get a better understand of the area he's in. He can see the walls of the petri dish stretching high into space, further then how deep it was to be in Absol's paw pad. He tries looking outside from the dish, but everything was far too huge and blurry for him to make any details of what they are. He sighs in boredom as he waits for Absol and Ribombee to return. After few minutes, Zorua hears loud noise coming from the direction of one of the doors of the classroom. He sighs a bit, thinking it must be the girls finally back from their lockers. He looks out and struggles to see the blurry silhouette of the door a galaxy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swings open and Zorua sees.... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pokemon that Zorua saw walking along the path where he laid his trap was Braixen, a student that Zorua had pulled tricks on in the past. The biped fox was meandering along, her fluffy tail bobbing behind her. As usual, her yellow and white fur was delicately combed. She was whistling a tune, most likely a song from one of her cheerleading routines, while she playfully twirled her signature stick in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reactions to his mischief were typically low energy for the simple reason that she knows she'll eventually get her revenge. Zorua shuddered as he recalled how his tail had been shaved after he pulled a simple prank on her at school. She definitely was a master of revenge, to be sure. For that reason, he was teetering on the side of <i>not</i> pulling the rope that would dump the payload of honey, berries and feathers onto her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, the thought of getting a rise out of her sounded dreadfully appealing. Besides, chances are no other Pokemon would happen across this path today and Zorua figured he could just use his illusions to slip away. More importantly, he also needed his entertainment for the day. With all that in mind, he decided to spring the trap and in an instant the contents of his trap fell over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen let out a shrill squeal as she was coated in honey and feathers. The sight alone made Zorua quietly cackle in the bush he was hiding in and he had to bring his paws up to his mouth to stifle his laughs. For just a second she looked down at herself with an expression of unbridled annoyance before she took a deep breath and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving her stick to the trees around her, she yelled out with a laugh.\"That was a good one! Real good.\" Braixen took a moment to wipe most of the honey and feathers off herself before she cheerfully continued. \"Wow, you really got me. It's going to take <i>ages</i> to get this stuff out of my fur! Come on, who did it? Come on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow easily she took the humiliating prank in stride made Zorua's stomach sink with regret. Even with her fur matted with sticky substances she was laughing happily and held a toothy smile. If anything, her lack of anger was intimidating. Normally to be one to gloat at his victim's misfortune, Zorua decided that he better stay hidden in the bush and avoid her wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen continued waving her stick around, the movement causing some of the feathers to fly off her. \"Where are you? I know you're here.\" Soon her stick came to point in the general area Zorua was hiding in, and before he could use his illusions so hide himself, Braixen happily beamed at him. \"Zorua! I knew it had to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze triggered a fight or flight response in him, but instead of fleeing or fighting, Zorua froze. His hesitation gave Braixen the time to skip over and by the time he regained his senses she was upon him. After creating an illusionary copy of himself in his place, he started running. He didn't get that far, though, because Braixen saw through it and whacked him with her stick, sending him tumbling onto his back. The stick came back down on him and poked him on the chest, keeping him pinned on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen looked down at Zorua with a smug grin, her red nose held high in the air. \"You always run to the right, you know that? I know you try and avoid playing tricks on me but that doesn't mean I don't witness your antics on the other Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry about that,\" Zorua nervously chuckled. \"It was pretty good though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was,\" she sighed. \"You know what happens now, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gulped and struggled against the stick pinning him down. \"Don't shave my tail again,\" he begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting, but I have something else in mind. You see, I recently gained an ability that I've been itching to try out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An ability, huh?\" Zorua said, trying to keep her talking. \"What's that, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen replied with a short laugh and kept looking down at him. The silence was making Zorua uncomfortable so he tried struggling against the stick again, only to find that it felt heavier than it did before. Wrapping his paws around it to try and wrench it off him, he finally noticed something odd about it. Slowly but surely, the piece of wood appeared to be getting larger. Looking up at Braixen, she too looked like she was bigger than she was a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua quickly caught on to what was happening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to the horror of the dark-type fox, the world around him began growing, but he knew that it wasn't what was happening, no. He knew that, in reality, he was the one getting smaller and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stick on his back, which was more or less as big as a small branch before, now felt like a whole tree, and it kept him from running from the growing vixen-cheerleader in front him, who kept staring at the scene with a smirk on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Zorua came to the point where he couldn't be bigger than one of her paws, in which point he finally stopped shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took notice of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck!?\" he spluttered, his breathing rendered difficult by the now gigantic stick on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen started snickering,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, look at you, Zorua,\" she said,<br>\r\n\"You're almost kind of cute like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua huffed, but then tranquilized himself as the initial scare subsided. The fox began laughing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" he said,<br>\r\n\"You got me good, I would have never seen this coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt anyone would've.\" Braixen agreed with a chuckle of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon, big and small, shared a laugh. Zorua felt relief washing over him - Braixen's revenge may have been odd and somewhat humiliating, but at least there was no one around to watch aside from the vixen herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both were done laughing, Zorua asked with his friendliest grin,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one. Now, will you get this thing away from me and grow me back so I can go back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll take my stick back alright,\" she said, bending to take a hold of her stick, a drop of honey falling from her fur and near Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But only because I have something better in mind, although just watching you like that alone is amusing.\" she cut him off with a scary smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worry came back to the diminutive fox, who jumped back on all fours and stared nervously at the bipedal giantess while she placed her stick in her tail before shooting him a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you going to do?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen's smirk widened - she loved seeing Zorua so helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll see...\" she said, bending to grab a hold of Zorua this time. Needless to say, he tried to run when he saw her paw rapidly approaching, but she was too fast and grabbed him in her fist, before scooping him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Zorua screamed as his world was rocketed sky high in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen snickered, before putting her plan into action: before Zorua could even recover from the dizzying ride, Braixen moved him forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, Zorua?\" she teased with anticipation,<br>\r\n\"You made quite a mess on my fur, so it's only fair you're the one to clean it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua could even wonder what the giant vixen was up to, she pushed him in her honey/berry/feather-covered fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sticky mess transferred to Zorua's own fur and, before he could offer any protest, Braixen began rubbing him up and down across her fur, not bothering to be gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course caused Zorua to scream, but his mouth was soon filled with the feathers of his own prank, which silenced him while Braixen used the victim of her revenge as a rag to clean herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she knew this wouldn't get the mess away from her fur, but the results would be hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully rubbed Zorua against her chest, before moving on, starting to rub him against  her furry shoulders, wiping off the sticky honey and berries with the poor prankster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was her muzzle, before Braixen ultimately began rubbing her head with Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of this, the smaller fox felt sick. She was moving him around so fast that he couldn't even keep track of where he was going or where he was coming from; to make things worse, he was choking on the stuff that entered in his mouth and the friction of his fur with Braixen's own burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, his torment wasn't meant to last for more than ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen eventually pulled back when she felt satisfied enough and laughed when she saw Zorua covered in his own prank and on the verge of throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe! Look Zorua!\" she exclaimed,<br>\r\n\"Now <i>you</i> are the one covered in feathers and honey! Isn't it fun!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now she had to add insult to injury, Zorua thought sourly as he spluttered out the gunk in his mouth; it took him several spits to take everything out, and he still had honey lingering around his tastebuds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared at Braixen, who, still covered in the same mess, was staring right back at him with a smug grin. Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you got me.\" he said, admitting defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Braixen chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I deserve this.\" Zorua continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a dork.\" he finished, before looking at her with a blush, feeling his pride stinging, <br>\r\n\"Now can you grow me back up so we can go clean off and forget any of this happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not so fast,\" Braixen replied,<br>\r\n\"You see, I'll admit I was eager to try my new ability out. In fact, I was kind of hoping you'd pull a stunt like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's eye twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came here just for this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Old habits die hard, huh Zorua?\" she mocked,<br>\r\n\"But, y'know... I feel like I shouldn't let you off the hook so easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you got your payback, we're even!\" the small fox protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. This was just a little fun,\" she teased, empathizing the word 'little',<br>\r\n\"The real deal's another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen smiled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"A deal?\" Zorua muttered. Based on his powerless situation and her tone he assumed that this deal of hers was only going to end up pleasing one party. \"What deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking...\" Braixen looked away for a moment and smiled as if she was entertaining an amusing thought. \"...Hey, what do you do on the weekends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Nothing, really,\" Zorua replied, confused at the random question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because here's my deal,\" she started. \"I'm going to return you to your original size and let you go. Then, in a few days we're going to be starting a new routine together. It will go like this; you meet up with me after school before the weekend, I'll make you all tiny again, I take you over to my place and then finally we'll spend some quality time together before I release you for the week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark fox Pokemon's face contorted in equal parts terror, confusion and disbelief. He didn't like the sound of her plan one bit and scowled at her. \"And if I accept, just how long is this routine going to go on for? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. Until I think you've received enough payback or until I get bored of you, I guess,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua wasn't at all satisfied at the answer. There was a chance it could only last for a few weeks or stretch over for who knows how long. He decided she wouldn't elaborate further on that so Zorua pressed her for the other part of the deal. \"This is a deal, right? What do I get out of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire fox chuckled and held Zorua closer to her face, training her massive red eyes onto him. \"If you refuse... Well, I haven't quite tested just how small I could make something yet. Or I could just leave you this size and pawn you off to one my friends you most-likely terrorized. Perhaps I just might leave you out in the wild like this. Or better yet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off as she raised Zorua above her head. Zorua found himself flailing as her white-furred hand shifted around him until it was only pinching the scruff of his neck, leaving all four of his limbs dangling in the air. \"...I could just eat you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ghastly statement she opened her mouth revealing a set of sharp white teeth and a red tongue before she began lowering him towards them. Zorua began kicking and crying out but thankfully he saw Braixen clamp her jaws shut with a click. \"Just kidding!\" she innocently laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it was a mere joke at his expense, Zorua was still rattled for the fact that she probably could eat him if she wanted. Braixen deposited him on another paw and looked down at him with an expression of forced concern. \"Come on little guy, what's it going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Zorua spat. Just as he figured, it was going to be a very one-sided deal and realistically he knew his only option was to accept it. The consequences of not accepting all felt like death sentences. \"It feels like I'm getting the short end of the stick, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen snorted at the comment and sat him down on the ground. Once again Zorua found himself at paw level with the giant Pokemon and watched as she stood back and retrieved the stick from her tail. With stick in hand, she swung the piece of wood down at Zorua until it gently pushed against the fluffy tuft of fur on his head. In an instant, he found himself at his original height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader fox excitedly bobbed up and down in joy before she stopped to bend down and pat Zorua on his head. \"I'm glad we could come to an agreement! We'll meet up by that huge tree just outside the school. As for now, though, I plan on cleaning up the mess you made,\" she said, motioning to her matted fur. \"So see you then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she practically bounced off, twirling her stick again. After passing a tree and getting out of sight, Zorua could hear her yelling out a reminder to not make her wait. For a moment Zorua just stood alone there in the forest, stunned at what he got himself into. There was only a couple of days until the weekend, too, and Zorua was <i>not</i> looking forward to it. Zorua straight up knew she was just going to try and humiliate him the whole time. In the mean time, he supposed he would clean himself up and get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple of days passed dreadfully slow. The anxiety of eventually having to spend time with Braixen in that shrunken form sapped most of Zorua's energy and he could barely focus on anything else during his classes. Zorua came to the conclusion that it was a part of her plan; to make him come willingly to his punishment and to make him fret about it. Somehow, he had managed to avoid seeing her for the two days but now the time he was supposed to meet her was drawing near. School had just finished for the day and in a few minutes they would be meeting by the tree she specified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zorua was having second thoughts. He only accepted her deal in the forest so she would release him and now that the time drew near all he could think about was how he <i>really</i> did not want to meet her. While he feared the consequences of not turning up, the thought that he might avoid humiliation by laying low for a while until she gave up had entered in his mind. She couldn't get him during class and he knew a few good hiding spots around the place, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua could see her in the distance, she stood out like a sore thumb with the red tufts of fur sticking out her long ears. He grumbled as he thought about his course of action.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was talking to somebody Zorua didn't really focus on, busy as he was staring at the dreaded vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sure she had already seen him with the corner of her eye, judging from the smirk she had on her muzzle. Either that or she was waiting with anticipation the moment when she would shrink him down to a couple inches and do whatever she wanted to him for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought did really tempt Zorua to turn tail and disappear among the crowd of Pokemon leaving school, but he remembered that Braixen was a master of revenge: if he didn't show up, there was no telling what she'd do to him, potentially in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't allow that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the dark-type fox even knew, he decided to go to Braixen, but the thick crowd didn't let him walk freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grumble, he strolled to a nearby tree, deciding to wait for the crowd to disperse. That would be for the best, especially if Braixen was planning to do something when everyone was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he waited, ignoring all the Pokemon that went past him, to head either home or to hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the crowd dispersed, though the voices of the leaving Pokemon were heard for a while more. They gradually got lower and lower, until no more noise could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, reluctantly, Zorua came out from behind the tree to look over Braixen's own tree. It was truly huge, with the vixen waiting just beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shuddered thinking that the size of that tree was gonna be about Braixen's size when he was going to be shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing his fear, Zorua began strolling towards where Braixen was standing, taking notice that she was staring at him with a playful smirk on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't speak or act until Zorua wasn't standing right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta say,\" she said cheerfully, leaning over to place a paw on Zorua's back,<br>\r\n\"Didn't think you'd come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I.\" he replied coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was smiling in a friendly manner, but the circumstances and the outcome Zorua knew he was going to face soon didn't let him relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to me, Braixen?\" he asked, backing up, freeing himself from her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you already know, Zorua,\" she said with a grin,<br>\r\n\"But, that can wait. Let's take a walk, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that, she began to walk, leaving a flabbergasted Zorua behind. She stopped after five feet, noticing the fox wasn't following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she said, turning her head,<br>\r\n\"You coming or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah?\" he hesitated, before hurrying behind the fire-type vixen as she resumed walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth walked in silence, though Braixen was carrying a smile on her face, while Zorua was wondering where she was bringing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expressed that doubt, and her reply was very vague,<br>\r\n\"Someplace I know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua made no more attempt to know where he was going and resigned himself to follow the vixen. Was she teasing him? Delaying her plans to the very last moment? Was she pranking him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose questions were answered when both arrived into town and Braixen led him to a nearby caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a seat, inviting Zorua to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wondering what was going on, he jumped on a chair while Braixen picked up the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick something, Zorua. My treat.\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Zorua off guard and he muttered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen shot a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, pick something! There's nothing up my sleeves, trust me!\" she encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua said nothing for several moments, before blushing and murmuring,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen gave a quick nod and got up, disappearing inside for a few minutes, returning with two steaming cups of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set one in front of Zorua and laughed,<br>\r\n\"Drink up, soon-to-be little guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua growled while she began sipping from the cup. Then, noticing he wasn't drinking, she put it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you gonna drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just what are you up to?\" the dark-type snarled, unable to take it anymore,<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous, why am I here right now? I thought you... you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen began giggling, further irritating her fellow fox,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Zorua,\" she said cheerfully,<br>\r\n\"I'm going to, in time. I wanted you to enjoy your size for a while longer before I take that for the weekend. But don't worry,\" she smirked,<br>\r\n\"We'll have plenty of things to enjoy these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gulped while Braixen resumed sipping her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiffidently, the unevolved fox did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, once they were both finished, Braixen disappeared inside once more to pay for the coffee, before coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now come along Zorua, you know what happens now.\" she said. Zorua looked back, tempted to run, but followed her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led him to an alley, made sure no one was watching and looked at Zorua with glowing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the fox began shrinking down to about the same size he had been a couple days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\" Braixen said cheerfully, reaching down to grab a hold of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\" he parroted back, diffident and startled by the giantess who now held him,<br>\r\n\"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen smirked and replied,</span></div></div>",

She was one of the fellow students in school, though she was no normal Vulpix; her fur was way curlier than a normal one's, and it was also pristine white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was because Vulpix moved to the village from very far away, according to what she said, and where she came from, others like her weren't rare to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her relationship with Zorua, there was none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't prank her, she ignored him, though he was sure that she knew who he was, because each time their gazes met, Vulpix would shoot a solemn look before turning her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the perfect opportunity. If he hadn't pranked her in the past, now it was his chance, and he would not miss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he patiently waited for Vulpix to stroll towards the tree where his bucket stood, held by the rope that was, in time, held in between Zorua's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for Vulpix to be right underneath where the bucket would land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis patience paid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix walked right by the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua pulled the rope with one swift motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bucket fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least it would have been if Vulpix didn't look up at the very last second, shooting a wave of frosty air from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bucket was flung away, encased in solid ice that shattered into pieces when it landed, spilling the contents of Zorua's failed prank onto the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flabbergasted Zorua dropped the rope in his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout losing her composure, though visibly surprised, Vulpix began looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Who is behind this? Come on out!</span>\" she said, looking to the side when she heard a few bushes rustling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to himself, Zorua showed himself, standing a few feet in front of Vulpix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ah.</span>\" she said, her tone indecipherable. It sounded like contempt and pity at the same time,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me.\" Zorua agreed, looking at the spilled honey and feathers that were formerly was his prank,<br>\r\n\"You know, it really took me a lot of time to organize that.\" he said, deadpan,<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds easy, but it was not. Had a really angry Pidove chasing me. And it was really hard to get that thing on that tree. The least you could've done was to play along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sorry, but no way I'm letting any of those things get anywhere near my fur.</span>\" Vulpix sarcastically apologized, before continuing,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We've never officially met, did we? Despite that, I hear that you're a famous, and infamous, prankster around here. I see that you really live up to your title, Zorua. Come to think of it, they told me to expect something like that when I told I was going for a walk in these woods.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blinked at the barrage of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... not to be rude, but do ya ever shut up?\" he asked,<br>\r\n\"You have, like, a button, or a switch or... I dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix looked offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That's very, very rude, Zorua.</span>\" she said, glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the dark-type could feel the air around him growing chilly, though it quickly stopped as Vulpix sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But I'll let it slide, because that's not what I'm here for.</span>\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt a droplet of sweat run down the side of hid head. He didn't know why, but something told him he had just dodged a bullet. Or did he? Something was off about the Pokemon that was speaking so calmly to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-\" Zorua paused, trying to control his voice,<br>\r\n\"What are you here for, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he shouldn't have asked, but curiosity was simply too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix gained a small grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I was looking for someone to try out a new move on,</span>\" she explained,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And I found you. I've asked around town, but they were all... unwilling.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? And why should I agree then?\" Zorua asked, mentally wondering what this move she was talking about was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him was curious to find out, but he told himself that, if others disagreed, this 'move' could be dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix pointed to the bucket and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You owe me, both for that unmotivated prank and for your mean words.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you know, I'm not used to paying for my pr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped, because he felt a sudden cold in his paws; looking down, he found them frozen solid, while Vulpix froze his hind paws as well, effectively gluing him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not going anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Too bad Zorua, you don't have a choice. Not anymore, at least,</span>\" the white vixen giggled, seeing the dark-type trying to break free from the grip of ice,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Just consider this as one of your pranks... only, you're the one being pranked.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... let me go!\" he said after uselessly trying to break the ice keeping him from going anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was simply stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">In a moment,</span>\" Vulpix replied, positioning herself in front of him,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Now, just relax. You won't feel a thing, I promise.</span>\" she reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before Zorua had a chance to reply, something happened before his very, incredulous eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without any kind of warning, Vulpix let loose an icy gust of wind from her mouth and from her curly tails; it hit Zorua without him being possibly able to dodge, and he felt his fur rise up as a cold shiver traveled down his spine, causing his tail to rise up and several strands of his fur to freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack didn't last more than ten seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix stopped, standing before the dark-type, who slowly reopened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it seemed like nothing was different to the poor Zorua, who was growing more and more afraid of the white vixen in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after blinking a couple times, Zorua realized that something was definitely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he didn't notice it, but as Vulpix kept an eye with him, he could see her slowly growing in height, while the smile on her face grew in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening...?\" the predator-turned-prey stuttered, watch as that vixen in front of him became bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Zorua noticed that it wasn't just Vulpix growing; in fact, the world around him seemed to be getting bigger as well. The bucket that nearly fell on Vulpix was now as large as he was, before it became even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was so surprised he couldn't speak a single word, but just watched in pure shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaller and smaller he got, until he barely came up Vulpix's azure toes, which was when the dark-type finally stopped shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now towering Vulpix contemplated her work with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that time, Zorua just stared back at her, afraid. Despite what everyone said back at the village, he was not dumb, or at least he wasn't enough to not understand that Vulpix's wasn't the smile of someone who just wants to have a friendly talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix was now a towering goddess to the shrunken fox, and he certainly didn't want it to be this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vulpix, what's this!?\" he exclaimed, panick taking over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix cocked her head, smiling,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Right,</span>\" she said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sorry, Zorua, guess I got caught up in the excitement. Anyway, that's my new move! I call it 'Shrinking Blizzard'. And it works!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua said nothing, but looked at the giantess in confusion, having never heard of such move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You're probably thinking how I could make up such move,</span>\" Vulpix said, as if reading his mind,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, Zorua, it was not easy. Where I'm from, Pokemon can use particular, the Z-Moves, moves so powerful that they can break through Protect! Can you believe that? Point is, I wanted one of my own, so I began doing some tests to develop one of those moves. And, while not particularly strong as an attack, I soon discovered it had an interesting effect: it shrunk down whatever got hit by it, hence is why I only used it on inanimate objects so far. I needed a living lab rat,</span>\" she explained, donning a bit of a smirk,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I suppose I should thank you, Zorua,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" the diminutive fox snapped back, deciding he didn't care about the explanation. He didn't get much, anyway. <br>\r\n\"Just grow me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Vulpix shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, yeah.</span>\" she said, now looking a bit embarrassed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thing is... I didn't really develop a counter move for that. I don't know how to grow things yet... and I don't think I have a Growth TM. You see, I created Shrinking Blizzard combining Blizzard and Minimize and-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Vulpix went on with her explanation, Zorua took a step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis titaness was utterly crazy, using him as a live test subject. And even worse, she had no idea how to grow him back to his original height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, tiny or not, Zorua decided he had more chances alone than in the paws of this crazy chick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she explained her move, the fox began backing away, shooting nervous glances backwards. If only he could reach that bush over there and make a run for it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA suddenly cold made Zorua stop. But not because he wanted to, but because he simply couldn't move anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he soon discovered, Vulpix had froze him from the neck down, leaving his head sticking out of what basically was an ice ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Nuh-uh, Zorua,</span>\" she playfully scolded, smirking at victim,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You're not going anywhere. I think I deserve some payback, don't you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she rose a paw and placed it on the sphere Zorua's body was encased in and began applying pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the ice, the fox could feel it, and a pain worse than the grip of ice itself began manifesting, causing him to grit his teeth in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I kind of get it why you do this, now,</span>\" Vulpix said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It's kind of fun! I shouldn't really say this, but taking on someone smaller than me feels great!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua couldn't really tell the same about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop!\" he yelled, his voice shaky from both the pain and the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one of those problems was soon fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure became so much that the ice around the fox shattered, and Vulpix's paw pinned him down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">How does it feel like, Zorua...</span>\" the titaness said, savoring the moment,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Being the one to be pranked?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not a prank, Zorua thought, feeling in so much pain; it was torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just prayed for it to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis prayers were answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the weight fading as Vulpix rose her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ahh~,</span>\" she moaned,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That was fun!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for me...\" Zorua groaned, feeling his back aching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ah, don't be like that, Zorua,</span>\" Vulpix cooed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">After all, the fun has really just begun...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The giant Vulpix paused for a second as she continued looking down at Zorua. The little fox saw the much larger fox switch her expression from her empowered self-satisfied look to something more endearing, a change that failed to inspire confidence in him. Zorua ignored her and tried to break off the ice that was encasing his body, the cold making him shiver and feel numb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">If I unfreeze you, will you run away?</span>\" Vulpix sang with a patronizing tone, as if she knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua scoffed, it was more of a fact that he couldn't if he tried. \"I won't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis admission seemed to trigger a reaction around the ice and piece by piece it began to break away until he was standing on his four legs again. Tiptoeing away from the cold bits of frozen water only made his inability to run away from the giant ice-type more apparent, especially now that he could barely stand he was that cold. Chattering his teeth, he looked up Vulpix and was happy to see that she was at the very least looking sorry for freezing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he wasn't happy was how she lowered her body to the ground and started moving her paws toward him. Having her body closer to the ground only made her seem larger and the two paws that were making their way towards him after she got settled down only made him flinch, fearing he was going to get crushed again. Zorua curled up in a ball to protect himself but never felt that painful pressure. Instead, they gently pushed against him, the pads of one paw pushing him against the fur of the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, he pushed against the cold surface but failed against her superior strength. \"Hey!\" Zorua yapped. \"Stop that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Calm down, alright?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua did calm down, though it was more because he was getting too tired of fighting against her than actually wanting to relax. The two paws around him tightened for a moment and dragged him closer to the ice-fox until he was being pressed against the white fur of her chest. It was cold, at first, but as he was held there it gradually got warmer. If Zorua was going to get smothered against another giant Pokemon for warmth he would have preferred it to be a fire-type but somehow the ice-type was managing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Zorua stopped shivering and he returned to a state that wasn't mind-numbingly cold, something that Vulpix quickly took note of. He was pushed away from her but still had those paws surrounding him, one of them rubbing against the back of his head all the way to his tail like she was petting him. The look of her face still held that adoring expression, too, which confused Zorua. It was such a shift in attitude and it only made him even more unsure of the giant fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grumbled up at her. \"So you really can't turn me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">No, not yet at least,</span>\" she said. \"<span class=\"cpblue\">Though I have to say, you look much cuter this way!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" The small fox wasn't sure how to take that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, I think I'll take you home for now. Can't have you stranded in the middle of the forest like this can we? Oh, and don't worry, my room isn't as cold as you would think.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked up at the smiling Vixen with an uncertain glare. He was confused why she was suddenly being so nice to him when a moment ago she was taking a whole lot of pleasure in bringing him discomfort. It made him wary. \"Are you gaslighting me or something? What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What?</span>\" Vulpix blurted out. After a moment in thought, she continued. \"<span class=\"cpblue\">...Well I admit I might have been a bit too harsh, shrinking you while not being able to turn you back. The least I could do is look after you until I can.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Zorua pouted. \"Just don't step on me anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix ignored his comment and spoke up.\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey, why don't you climb up on my back?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peered past her and took in how much taller she was compared to him. Even while sitting, Vulpix was taller than the largest house in the village relative to him. \"Excuse me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Unless you want me to carry you home in my mouth,</span>\" she teased. With Zorua not replying to her joke, she sighed. \"<span class=\"cpblue\">Fine, I'll give you permission this <i>one</i> time to climb up on my tails for an easy lift.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix sat up on her haunches and laid her tails flat against the ground. It was a much more accessible way to get back up on her back but Zorua still didn't want to go, unhappy with the implication that he was going to be living with her like this until she learned to grow him back. Though when he thought about it, he begrudgingly assumed it was a better alternative than being left alone in the wild, by himself and extremely tiny. Maneuvering his way around the giant vixen, the dark-type reached the tails and heaved himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tumbled for a bit and was quickly met with a rush of gravity when Vulpix stood back up. The simple act sent Zorua fumbling upward and he managed to find purchase on the white fur on her rump. Regaining his bearings, he could see the vixen arching her neck back to smile back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Aww,</span>\" she cooed before getting to the point. \"<span class=\"cpblue\">Alright, let's get you home!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was fine and all, but Zorua was a tad worried about how open and exposed he currently was. Even though he was so small, his black and red coat contrasted greatly against her white fur. He dismissed it to just hunker down and hope this ordeal would be over sooner than later. He held on tight as Vulpix started walking.</span></div></div>",

Plus a few had threatened terrible vengeance if he ever messed with them again, and some of them seemed like they could be dangerous if they wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Espeon was new, having transferred only a few days ago and wouldn't be aware of Zoura's schemes. She seemed very sure of herself and some had said was conceited about what she could do, but as far as Zoura could tell she was relatively chilled and laidback. Hopefully she'd take a harmless prank in good fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura spotted her walking along the path, her nose in the air. Perfect! He sped ahead of her, set up his trap and dived into some nearby bushes, his body shivering with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon strolled along as though nothing was out of the ordinary. Zoura shivered with anticipation as she approached the trap. Any second... any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Espeon's paw hit the marker, a net burst open, dropping honey, berries and feathers all over the pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon usually looked very dignified, serious and graceful, but right now she looked comical. Parts of her fur stuck up, not only from the mixture Zoura had prepared, but from sheer shock. Her normally narrow, focused expression, was replaced with wide eyes shock, and her usually immaculate, polished had some feathers stuck to it..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura had wanted to remain hidden, but couldn't resist rolling around and howling with laughter, tumbling out of his hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of him Espeon hissed, more of her fur sticking up. She tried to wipe some of the muck off with her paws and psychic powers, though the honey soaked fur fought against her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"I suppose you think that's funny, don't you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">\"Hahahahaha no!

Consider it as a 'little' payback for your prank.</span>\" she continued, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What d'you... huh?\" Zorua couldn't finish as he began feeling a little dazed, his body feeling lighter for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like he was floating in mid-air, and maybe he really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esp...\" he tried to speak, but couldn't put a word after another to form a sentence; however, as he soon discovered, something was happening around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees, the plants, what used to be his pranks, even Espeon herself, all of it was... growing? Why was everything larger all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and startled, Zorua could only watch as the world around him slowly grew to an immensely big size compared to him, who didn't take long to figure out what was happening: this must have been Espeon's doing! She was somehow shrinking him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua even knew, he was brought down to the size of a tiny doll!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Wha...\" he stuttered, unable to believe what was happening around him. Speechless, he just stared at Espeon, who held the now small fox in mid-air thanks to a psychic grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Say, how's this for a prank?</span>\" she asked sarcastically,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">I don't believe we've introduced ourselves before, but I think I know who you are. Zorua, right? Pokemon told me about you. You're a prankster, though I've already experienced that on my own fur. Speaking of which-</span>\" Espeon suddenly interrupted herself to adopt a murderous glare. To anyone else, seeing an angry Espeon covered in feathers and honey would have probably seemed adorable; to Zorua, it was frightening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Do you still think this is funny?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua abruptly regained the use of word, albeit an improper one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" he stammered fearfully, causing Espeon to smirk once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Well, good... because now you get to make it up to me for what you've done. </span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a sec!\" Zorua interrupted, adopting a more nervous tone; he had to buy himself some time and craft an illusion.<br>\r\n\"I'll have ya know I'm not used to paying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon's smirk became wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">There's a first time for anything, don't you think?</span>\" she said, getting no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was almost ready but, sadly, his focus was broken when the giant Eeveelution thrusted his body forward with Psychic; unable to stop himself, Zorua crashed right into... a silky smooth, sticky surface: his new 'friend's' fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox groaned as the psychic grip on him began dragging him along the fine, pink fur, getting honey stuck to Zorua's own fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" he exclaimed after a couple of seconds, feeling a sense of nausea settling in as Espeon sped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, she didn't listen and kept rubbing him against her fur like a rag to wipe herself from the gunk that was all over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo spice things up, she even began rubbing all around herself, dragging Zorua around her stomach area, around her tail and even her back. The dark-type felt like he could catch fire at any moment, and the nausea certainly wasn't getting any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a couple minutes of extenuating payback, Zorua was finally brought back to his original position in front of Espeon's face, though he couldn't clearly see it. In fact, he couldn't see very well at all, everything was a blur and he was fighting not to throw up. If he added barf to the stuff in Espeon's fur, there was going to be hell to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Say Zorua, wasn't that funny?</span>\" the giantess mocked, though sounding more mischievous than malicious, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Don't bother answering, I already know your response. I don't think it was funny either, I think it was hilarious.</span>\" she said, mocking him even further by repeating one of his previous lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Zorua managed to get a hold of himself and finally regained sight of things when they finally stopped spinning around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then he got to look at his captor and noticed that she was staring at him... </span></div></div>",

But the look on her face terrified Zourra because the smile on her face reminded him of the smile he wore when he thought of a particularly devious prank.. Still he might as well try and talk his way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Espeon I'm sorry I pranked you. I shouldn't dumped that stuff over your fur. If you let me go and fix my size I promise to never ever ever prank you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"I'm afraid it's not that simple. First I don't think you got all the gunk off me, no matter how good a rag you make. Second I don't think you're actually sorry, you're just scared. You MIGHT avoid pranking me again, but only because you're scared of what I'll do to you. I think I will teach you a lesson and make sure you never do this to anyone ever.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura started shaking, which amused Espeon further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><br>\r\n\"Oh nothing as severe as that. At least unless you really invoke my fury. Thirdly, I hardly think using you as a rag makes up for what you did to me and fourthly.. there's still plenty of fun to be had.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura felt a pit in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you have in mind,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well your prank did make me jump, so I suppose I could use a nice relaxing massage.</span>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe levitated him behind her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-\" ZOura had never given anyone a massage before, though a part of him was relieved Espeon could have asked or done much worse to him than this... unless this was only a warm up<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"I've never massaged a pokemon before so if I mess up don't hurt me too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Try your best. It's the least you can do.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started scratching Espeon's ears, a little thrown when she started wiggling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Mm not bad. A little lower\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura gingerly complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"I suppose it will do.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura looked relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Now do the rest of me. Start with the neck.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura suppressed a sigh and got to work, rubbing her neck and trying to avoid the bits of honey left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura's own body was covered in honey after Espeon had cleaned herself with him, and some of it had pushed against a patch of fur. He pull free and Espeon grunted with discomfort. She turned her head slowly to him, making the little fox shiver again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry I didn't mean to do that! I'm still dirty.\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><br>\r\n\"Would you like me to clean you off?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Zourra spoke without thinking. Espeon flashed that prankster smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no wait\"  She levitated him and started walking with with purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Relax, I'm not going to hurt you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do? Are you going to lick me clean?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon looked disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"No, I wouldn't put something as dirty as you in my mouth. I have a different idea.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZourra looked around. What did she have in mind? Was she going to take him home and wash him herself? That wouldn't be so bad, though he had a feeling Espeon wouldn't be too gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead Espeon seemed to be searching for something. Zourra looked around to see if he could guess what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Here we are..\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura looked left and right. He still couldn't see what Espeon was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt the ground race towards him. He yelled out and braced for impact, though Espeon's telekinetic grip pulled against him. He could finally see what it was a... a lake?! No it was only a pond, but at his size there wasn't much difference. Was she going to drown him?!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit the water with a splash, and flailed his paws, trying to stay afloat, only to notice he wasn't drowning, Espeon was still keeping his head of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Now lets get you clean.\"</span> She grinned. He could actually see her teeth this time. His stomach clenched, he had an idea what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun him around, dragging him in and out of the water, and rubbed him against the water, his yells filling the air. She even made him skid along the water, before bringing him back on land, making him tumble at her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused to catch his breath and clenched his churning stomach. Espeon waited for a second. Maybe it was an act of mercy, maybe she just didn't want him to throw up on her. He dared to look up, his entire view being fiiled with a wall of light purple fur.  She was still grinning down at him and Zorua couldn't help but step back.<br>\r\nThe glow surrounded him again and he was lifted into the air. He cried out in pain as Espeon appeared to be squeezing him, but as he spun around again he realised she was wringing him out. She did this a few more times, though it didn't hurt as much, then put him down on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused to get his bearings, but noticed while she did take some sadistic glee in his discomfort, he was a lot cleaner and not as soaking wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now back to work!\"<span class=\"cppink\"></span></span></div></div>",

Was she just luring him into a sense of false security? Was she actually going to let him go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive Pokemon before Zorua was smiling down at him as she too sat on the ground, her behind making enough of an impact to make the ground tremble beneath the fox - and it was a soft landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple moments, the diminutive fox finally gathered the courage to speak,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does... Does this mean you'll grow me back?\" he asked, retrieving a bit of a smile; he could say Espeon was cool, after all. Sure, he had gotten what was coming to him, but unlike most other Pokemon, Espeon didn't seem to be holding a grudge right now.<br>\r\n\"Am I free to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Of course... not.</span>\" she replied with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's heart, which had been fluttering for a moment, sank hard as he realized that the titaness was toying with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! You told me I was off the hook!\" he protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">In fact, you got off easy with getting used as a rag. Your size however, I'm afraid that's another story.</span>\" the fork-tailed Pokemon said, wiggling her toes, making it clear that she intended to keep him that size, at least for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Zorua realized how big the grudge Espeon had against him was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type quickly glanced backwards. If only he could put some distance between himself and the psychic-type so that he could craft an illusion and run... yeah, that was a good strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the moment Zorua attempted to back up, he discovered he couldn't move. In fact, his paws weren't touching the ground at all as, he discovered, he was being held in mid-air by a pinkish glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Seriously? You're so predictable, Zorua.</span>\" Espeon, whose eyes were glowing, scoffed, sounding disappointed. Then, with a smile, she flopped belly-down onto the ground, her face near where Zorua's body was floating, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Though I'm gonna admit, you look much cuter like this!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's eyes shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he really just heard what he just heard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were brutally interrupted as the psychic force around him was released and he hit the ground with a small thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Don't run. I'm not in the mood to give chase.</span>\" Espeon warned, though keeping the smile on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it mattered since she could catch him anyway, Zorua mused, although deciding that trying to run was pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to talk his way out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Espeon, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Oh, please. What's with the formalities all of a sudden?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Espeon, then. Seriously, if you could give me my size back, I'll be on my way. It's, uh, pretty la-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Why would I now?</span>\" Espeon interrupted,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">I told you, you look waaay cuter like this. Plus, I'm sure you and me can think of plenty of ways for us to have some more fun.</span>\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shuddered, wondering her idea of 'fun'. Who knew though, perhaps she wasn't as bad as he believed. She was being pretty friendly after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shook his head - of course she was bad! She shrunk him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... what is that supposed to mean...?\" he asked, concerned about his near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon laughed, caused the more sensible ears of the poor fox to be unable to hear anything else for several seconds after she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Aw, look at you, you've retreated in the shell. Adorable.</span>\" she said, before giving a second wink,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Don't worry, Zorua. You'll find out very soon what I have in mind for us two... in the meantime-</span>\" she stopped to stand back on all fours, looming over Zorua while also bathing him in her shadow,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">...

Zorua blushed furiously and said nothing as Espeon's tail came down to wrap around his waist before rising once more, dropping him in the middle of her back; before anything, Zorua was enveloped in that familiar purple glow again and was carried all the way up to Espeon's head, where she let go of him in between her humongous ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up with a smile, the psychic-type chirped,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Let's go.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short, silent trip across the woods to get to Espeon's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing special, aside of course from the fact that, to Zorua, it looked like several houses stacked together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Psychic, Espeon pulled the door handle and opened, entering her house and closing the door back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Well, welcome home cutie.</span>\" the giantess said flirtingly, shooting a smile upwards, leaving Zorua anxious for what was coming next, which was absolutely unclear. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Now, let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves in.</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Didnt she know he was a dark type? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of an attack, her body glowed. At first nothing appeared to happen, but Espeon didn't look preturbed. Then Zooura noticed something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Zoura remembered, Espeon  was a head and a bit taller than him, though quite a bit longer. But now it looked like she bigger and that'd he only come up to around her stomach. Was this an optical illusion or was Espeon taller than he initially thought? Was she using an illusion to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon was getting bigger, and it was clear to Zoura this wasn't just his perception, either she was getting bigger or using an illusion of her own, she was twice the fox pokemon's height and growing rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scowl Espeon wore turned into a smirk and she took a step towards him. Her paw sank deeper into the ground and left an imprint, as she continued to grow, now approaching three times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouura watched with a mix of fascination, then fear. This has to be a trick of her own... right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon, now at least five times his size, was still smirking and took a step towards him, deliberately putting her paw down with a slam. If this was an illusion it was a very good one, her honey drenched fur had increased proportionally, but the feather drifting off her looked smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slamed down the other paw, and Zoura swore he felt a shake. This was no illusion! WHat was she going doing?! From the look on her face he was worried he might try to eat him.<br>\r\nWith a yip, Zooura dashed away fast he could. Espeon waited a second and gave chase, still not running as fast she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind, he could see a large, pink shape, rapidly getting closer by the second. Zoura didn't know what to do! Maybe he could try an illusion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dived into a bush and concentrated, hoping to make the towering pokemon believe he was he jumped to the bush to the left, letting him scurry away. He was focused, picturing in his mind and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great paw came down, pinning him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"Still think your little prank was funny?\"</b></font></span> Espeon's voice was much louder and boomed, the little fox couldn't help but shake in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">\"N-n-no.\"</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fear only served to amuse Espeon. She picked him slow, holding her in front of her smiling face, savoring his quivering reaction, and wondered what to do with with him.</div></div>",

She was always one for a good natured laugh he knew, but oh this...he'd be the one laughing. He'd heard through the grapevine she'd be in his forest today and he was gonna finally cement his status as a legendary prankster by pranking a legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew herself was calmly walking down the path, not even floating, and taking in the simple sights of the little forest away from the village.

She was blissfully unaware of what Zorua was planning though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zorua saw her approach he timed it right to release the rope and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bucket stopped mid air and was flung aside by Mew's psychic, she let out a weary sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua, I figured you'd attempt something like this, and I can't say i'm surprised...just a bit disappointed.</span>\" She said with a weary look in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part found himself floating out of the brush, flailing a bit as he looked at the small pink legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I went to a lot of trouble setting that up, you could've had the neighborly decency to let me have my laugh at least.\" Zorua said, trying to play off the situation.

He had no idea what was going on, but the pain was more than he'd ever felt before. He started to scream. His vision was distorted and blurred and he couldn't make anything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew bit her lip as she concentrated, she had never used the technique on a living being before, and now she was worried she may not have entirely mastered it as she looked at the screaming Zorua in a heap before her. She felt a pang of guilt, but then saw it start to take effect...Zorua was getting smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched, enraptured as his body compressed and got smaller and smaller, Zorua still screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was starting to slow Zorua noted...it was getting dull, and the odd feeling he had was fading too, he was left with some bitter aches, and his head was pounding...he still felt dizzy too, his eyes were shut tight, and he felt like he didn't want to get up at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mew...I get the message, i'll back off, alright?\" He got out, feeling like the worst was done, but he had no idea what had truly happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm sorry Zorua...but we're not done.</span>\" Mew's voice felt loud...powerful, something he wasn't used to, it rang out high above him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua opened his eyes, but he wasn't prepared for what he saw...there, towering high into the sky...was Mew. She must've been as big as a skyscraper to him! Zorua slowly got to his feet and took in his surroundings. The grass...it was slightly taller than him, he looked to the trees, that expanded far, far, far into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's breathing started to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mew...you...shrunk me?\" He said, the voice a mere squeak to the legendary. She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I did Zorua, admittedly I didn't expect the process to be as rough on you as that, but the results are what I wanted...you're about as big as the tiniest dolls you can buy.</span>\" Mew said, and a great crash echoed around Zorua as he couldn't keep his footing and stumbled to the ground, the titaness getting down and looming over him with a mighty paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew, please...\" Zorua said, now scared, and Mew shook her head as her paw wrapped around Zorua. He felt a sense of vertigo as he was lifted up and up...until her entire face took up his vision. He gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I've tried to get through to you with diplomacy, and admittedly i'd like to resolve this as peacefully as possible.

This is a punishment and It wouldn't be much of a punishment if I did something to you that you <i>wanted</i>, right?</span>\" Mew said as she brought her other paw up to Zorua's head and carefully pet him. Zorua tried to struggle against her paws but he had barely enough strength in his shrunken state to make a difference. In a futile fit of anger he bit down on the paw holding him, the bite accomplishing nothing more than annoying the gigantic Mew. Seeing her huge, annoyed eyes staring down at him made rethink his attempts at resistance and he slowly withdrew his jaws from her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I've noticed you don't like being in situations where you have no choice. That's kind of what it's like for your victims, isn't it? The Pokemon you bully usually don't have a choice if they're suddenly in your cross-hairs to be picked on or tricked.</span>\" Zorua just scornfully averted his gaze from Mew, an action which was getting increasingly harder to do as she kept turning him around in her paws to look him in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well, if you <i>really</i> want a choice then I guess you can choose to be my pet or I can leave you here right now to fend for yourself.</span>\" The statement definitely caught Zorua's attention. He almost opened his mouth to ask to be let go and not suffer the humiliation of being her pet, but he stopped himself as he thought about it. Even though his part of the forest was well secluded there was still the odd Pokemon that wandered through and an even higher chance of that Pokemon utterly hating him. He knew without a doubt that there were some Pokemon that wouldn't even think twice about crushing or eating him in this state. Then came the topic of finding food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looked down amused at the Zorua having his internal debate, his face growing more frustrated as he weighed the pros and cons of each choice. It was clear by his expressions what choice he should choose, but he stubbornly resisted. Mew decided to speed up the process. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua, if you choose to be my pet I have an obligation to provide you with all your basic needs. Food, water, shelter...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua bitterly looked up to the pink giantess and sighed. He had never aggravated Mew enough to actually set her off like this so he knew without a doubt she was serious about this. The two choices essentially boiled down to potential death or damaging his dignity and he begrudgingly decided on the latter. It might be his ultimate test of patience but it seemed like the best choice. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew grinned. While she regretted having to turn to such drastic measures she had to admit it was fun teasing the small dark type and giving him his comeuppance. \"<span class=\"cppink\">What's fine? Of the two choices which do you want?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zoroua grumbled. She wanted him to say it. \"I... I want to be your pet.\" The statement was more humiliating than he thought when he said it out loud, his face burning fiercely as he blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua barely had time to recover from his mental ordeal before he was pushed against her pink, furry chest in a hug. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Good choice!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't really much of a choice...\" He pouted as he tried to push away from her. Mew only giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Maybe, but it was still a choice.</span>\" She teased before holding him in front of her face again. \"<span class=\"cppink\">So it's settled. You're going to be my little pet until I decide you learned your lesson. I will keep you well-fed and comfortable and in exchange you will let me play and cuddle with you all I want!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Zorua sighed dejectedly. \"My life is literally in your hands.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMew brought a paw up and started stroking his fur. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Don't look so glum. While it does seem a bit harsh and I <i>may</i> be getting some personal enjoyment out of  this my overall aim is to adjust your bad behavior towards other Pokemon. This is for everyone, including you. When all this is over there's a chance you may even see all of this as a humbling experience.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...A humiliating experience.\" Zorua muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew cupped both hands over Zorua and held him against her chest. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay, let's go.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\"</span></div></div>",

And when we get there i'll get you something for the headache.</span>\" Mew was saying it much quieter, but her voice still echoed through Zorua since he was right to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed but took the token kindness Mew was offering him. \"Thanks...\" He muttered and Mew smiled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd get Zorua to come around, this would work out well...and she'd get her fun too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fluttered to her house, being gentle to try to not jostle Zorua too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked around Mew's home as she entered it...it was small, cozy looking. It gave off a welcoming air...not that it mattered much since Zorua was here against his will, Mew started walking again, but tried to be careful with Zorua all the same, she rounded a corner until she came to a small room with a bed, nightstand, TV, book shelf, and in the corner...a wooden box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">This is where you'll be staying.</span>\" Mew said as she walked towards it, She lowered Zorua down, and dropped him on a cushion...he looked up, up at the sky to see Mew smiling down at him. Zorua looked around his prison, this wooden box and saw the cushion he was on...and two tiny dishes, one with water and one with some cut up berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You planned this...\" Zorua spat out, practically a growl, though Mew found it amusing how squeaky and high his voice sounded, and he was trying to be threatening, Mew nodded, her face far up to him, smiling tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I wanted to make accommodations for my pet, now let me go get you some medicine.</span>\" She said and she started walking away, being less careful now that Zorua was in his prison and the thuds shook Zorua as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood was thick to him...hard, he'd probably be unable to break through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if he could scale it, but seeing how high up it went...it was a daunting challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was a simple wooden box, he grunted in frustration as he laid down against his cushion...at least it was comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost drifted off when the thuds came back and a shadow was cast over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Aw, you look adorable like that, getting comfortable already?</span>\" Mew cooed and Zorua glared up. She lowered her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Here, I shrunk them for you.</span>\" It was two tablets...probably for his headache. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I got you this too, in case it gets cold.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered a pink piece of fabric...basically a large, thick blanket to the tiny dark type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...thanks.\" Zorua muttered again as he took the tablets in his mouth and chewed, the chalky bitter taste making him wince. The piece of fabric was set down on his cushion as Mew rose up to her intimidating full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Now then, I have things to do in the world of big pokemon, you can stay here and rest like the cute little pet you are.</span>\" She said, tauntingly, talking down to him. Zorua glared and flushed red with frustration but didn't say anything. He hated this, but he also had to admit he was tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...fine then.\" He said, the bitterness creeping in his voice as Mew giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Be back later~</span>\" She said, she blew him a kiss as she waled away, the shaking almost seeming intentional now, as she left Zorua in his prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Mew...stupid box...stupid shrinking ability.\" Zorua bitterly muttered as he approached the water bowl, wanting to get the medicine taste out of his mouth. He started thinking as he looked at his reflection in the bowl...did Mew even HAVE a way to grow him back? Was she going to? And if she did, would it hurt like the shrinking. He shuddered to think of going through that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...guess i'll go to sleep, not much else to do.\" Zorua said to himself, as he got on the cushion, and wrapped himself in the pink fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she made it pink...\" He muttered, drowsily as he tried to slip away from his frustrating situation, if only briefly with the peace that comes with sleep.</span></div></div>",

With a groan he got up, his limbs feeling stiff and sore, probably residual effects of the shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thumping was getting closer, and stronger, and with a great whoosh a door opened, allowing more light to filter into the room, Zorua looked up, seeing as how he couldn't see beyond the wooden walls that were enclosed around him, and soon a smiling face entered his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there little guy, i'm back~\" She said, her voice loud on Zorua's ears. He said nothing, and glowered at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">My my, you're gonna need to be more friendly than that if you ever want to stop being my pet. Though if you don't want to grow back ever then that's fine too.</span>\" Mew said casually, the threat clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's blood was boiling at this point, but he took a deep breath, closed his eyes, then looked up at the towering giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mew.\" He said, trying to remain calm. She smiled before reaching in, picking him up with her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dizzy as he soared high into the air, in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That's better...now then, you and I are gonna spend some time together.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding Zorua still infront of her face she went to her bed, making Zorua dizzy still as she got on it. She laid back and set Zorua on her belly, her face far in the distance to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA paw came down and pinned him to her stomach, and he struggled against it, getting no purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, what gives!?\" Zorua yelled as he kept struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew just giggled at this, it reverberating through Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Just messing with you a little.</span>\" Mew said as he paw lifted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua took a deep breath of air, and then considered biting down on her stomach...but doing so would probably only end badly for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay Zorua, here's what we're gonna do...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"A game...?\" Zorua said as Mew nodded, her face still in the distance. An immense digit from her paw came down and gently rubbed Zorua's head. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Yes, a game my little Zorua~</span>\" She said and he winced, not liking the way she said that. There was no way he'd enjoy this. Her smile grew as she saw his obvious look of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she enjoyed drawing this out and making Zorua feel uncomfortable, it really wouldn't be all that bad. Mew was curious how resourceful how Zorua could be, even at such a tiny size. And there would be certain motivations for him too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">All you need to do is find something that i'm gonna hide in this house. You don't even need to reach it, though I don't think you could.\"</span> Mew said coyly, enjoying the dark type's annoyance and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">So what, it's hide and seek then?</span>\" He said with a bit of hesitance. And Mew giggled, rocking Zorua a bit, still on her stomach as she rubbed his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Something like that, see, simple enough that you can do, right?</span>\" She said and he sighed. \"I guess...\" He said, but he knew there HAD to be a trick to this, no way there wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh...what exactly am I looking for?\" He asked and she wrinkled her nose before answering, almost hesitating as she did. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Something I got from your forest...under the stump I believe?</span>\" Mew said and Zorua's voice paled immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you went into my-you...you!\" Zorua said, flitting between rage, stupor, confusion, and amazement all in one sentence. The reaction Mew expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Though I must say, there are some things I didn't expect to find out about you when I went to search your forest just now...I really do think this'll benefit you in the end Zorua, just let me help you.</span>\" Mew said, a hint of sympathy entering her tone for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPictures, that's what she'd found. They wouldn't get out she'd make sure...so long as Zorua cooperated?...No, they wouldn't get out at all she'd decided, it'd be too cruel, even to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pictures also seemed to go a long way into explaining why Zorua might be the way he was, and they had a Zoroark in them sometimes...probably the one that took all the pictures. To Mew's surprise though, Zorua was dashing across her stomach and had his teeth bared as he leapt for her face. She caught him with psychic as he flailed and she glared at him, what surprised her more was that this didn't intimidate Zorua into stopping his flailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch! Too far! You've gone too fucking far!\" Zorua screamed, his voice cracking. Mew shook her head before a look of sympathy appeared. This really did have an effect on Zorua beyond embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Zorua, listen....listen!</span>\" She yelled as he kept protesting and flailing. She sighed before she dropped him onto the sheets, then pinned him with her paw before he could do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately he was winded and dazed as the bulky and powerful force stopped him from moving. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Zorua, i'd like you to know that I truly want to help you, but you ARE my pet right now and you WILL behave! Now, i'm going to give you the pictures back when we're all done, but if you find them, IF, within the hour, then i'll do something nice for you!</span>\" She said and he started struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it be grow me back so I can get out of this nightmare!\" He yelled and she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No, but how does a nice steak dinner sound, all you can eat?</span>\" She said, hoping that would catch his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua did struggle a bit more, but he was slowing down on it. His stomach grumbled. He hadn't eaten any of those cut up berries she had for him, and truth be told they didn't look appetizing. He gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and if you win...\" Zorua spat out, still barely containing his rage, but trying to contain it at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...I don't know yet...</span>\" Mew said. She'd considered pushing him to talk about the stuff she'd found, but his reaction was far more emotional than even she'd bargained for. She'd probably figure out some light humiliation later, but right now she was starting to second guess starting with this with Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently lifted her paw and Zorua slowly stood up. He closed his eyes and sighed before turning and looking up to Mew, her eyes hiding her emotions well. He bit his lip and his ears pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew, please don't push things.\" And her eyes hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't forget why you're here Zorua. You've been pushing things for years.</span>\" She said harshly making him wince, and he was lifted with psychic force. \"<span class=\"cpink\">But I won't take things further for now. I'm going to set you down on the floor, you have half an hour...and I won't interfere. Use your noggin~</span>\" Mew said, trying to lighten the mood with that last bit of her statement and Zorua nodded as he was set down. When she did that he immediately bolted out of her room, and she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">He's probably going to try to find an exit before even looking for the pictures...</span>\" She muttered to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part was running for any open door that might've led to outside, a long shot he realized but he hoped. His hopes were dashed though as he wasted a good few minutes running around, seeing closed wooden monuments that he had no hope of opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came upon the last one he lifted up a hind leg and kicked it in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus damn it!\" He exclaimed, frustrated before settling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay Zorua...think...you need to find those pictures...why the hell didn't I destroy them...why the hell did I even take them, he wouldn't have done shit with them...\" Zorua was muttering shakily as he settled his breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...okay...look around...\" He said as he took in his environment. This room he was in...it looked to be a living room. He had no idea if Mew lived on her own or not, but either way it was a nice looking place...huge to him, but nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said I could see it, but maybe not reach it...\" He muttered. \"That might mean up, but...she might be trying to trip me up with that. It's possible it means gated...hmm...\" He was using his brain to try and piece things together. Mew was annoyingly smart and regardless of finding the pictures or not, she was gonna press him on the issue he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Just focus on the damn steak, I could at least use that after a crappy day like today...\" He was drooling as he thought this. Steak was a definite rarity to him. He started to explore more slowly and methodically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew for her part just lay in the bed. She stashed the pictures in her grandfather clock, though at an angle that might be hard for Zorua to catch with his low to the ground perspective if he didn't stand from a distance. Still, it was possible and Zorua was probably smart enough to figure it out eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want him to know that she was kinda rooting for him. She looked at her own digital clock in her room...20 more minutes...</span></div></div>",

Mew please don't do that!\" He said as Mew giggled. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Why not, you'll get lots of pets i'm sure. They won't hurt you, I promise that.</span>\" Zorua started to struggle more as Mew said that, though she held him tight to her chest with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I changed my mind, i'd like to fend for myself!\" Zorua said as Mew giggled. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh hush, you don't mean that and you know it. This is part of your punishment you know, and it'll help you in the long run too. Imagine when I grow you back, you're reformed, but no one in the village will want to accept you. That won't do! They need to see this side of you too.</span>\" Mew said as Zorua gulped. Mew was taking him into the village...for all to see. Forget about being a legendary prankster, his reputation was about to be torn to shreds. Hell, there was a chance HE'D be torn to shreds if certain pokemon got a hold of him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua got an idea though as he used his illusions to make himself invisible. Mew looked down at him on occasion and gave a bit of a giggle at this. \"<span class=\"cppink\">You can't keep that up forever, we both know that.</span>\" Mew said as she maneuvered one of her paws to be around Zorua's stomach. She then started to stroke and prod at it, trying to agitate and tickle him out of his concentration. Zorua's eye twitched at what she was doing as his concentration broke. He was soon visible again, with Mew still prodding at him. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Coochie coochie coo~</span>\" She said mockingly as Zorua bared his teeth, only to quickly retract it. He didn't want to annoy her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Hey Mew, what are you doing?</span>\" A feminine voice called out and Zorua gulped. \"Mew, i'm begging you. Don't do this...\" Zorua pleaded. She just smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Not much girls, let me come join you, I want to introduce you to my pet, I think you might already know him, but not like this!</span>\" Mew said as she approached a group of pokemon. Mew held out her paws, him being out in the open he acted as quick as he could think, Zorua curled up, trying to make himself as small as possible, but it was useless. Soon he heard murmurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Is that...Zorua?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Wow, he's so tiny!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">What happened?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed as he opened his eyes, and looked at the giants before him. He sighed and hung his head in shame. Yup, it was one of Mew's circle of friends. Before him stood the towering forms of Sylveon, Salazzle, and Delcatty...Mew then moved her free paw that he wasn't on up and started to pet him. He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well, I made him small. I figured that since he likes to be a pain in the butt around the village, i'd try to do what I could to solve the issue, and my solution was to make him my cute little pet~</span>\" Mew said. Soon his senses were overloaded as the 3 giant pokemon leaned in close. He tried to take a step back, though doing that made him bump into Mew's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Huh...</span>\" Salazzle muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I didn't know you could shrink things!</span>\" Sylveon commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Are you gonna keep him that way?</span>\" Delcatty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiled at this. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Not forever, just until I think he's learnt his lesson.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked down, feeling overwhelmed right now. He wanted to look at anything that wasn't a giant, though they surrounded his vision. He shut his eyes tight before he heard a pokemon chime in.</span></div></div>",

This seems like a good way to make him pay for all his bullcrap. Good on you Mew!</span>\" Of course she would feel that way...it wasn't like Salazzle was some innocent pokemon either. She used to be a rabble rouser herself before Mew befriended her...It was then that Zorua felt a harsher touch as Salazzle scratched at him with one of her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Look at the wittle runty Zorua...</span>\" She said in a cooing voice, making him glare at her. She just smirked at him. It didn't help that Salazzle was much bigger than Mew, who already was a titaness to him. \"Bite me Salazzle.\" Zorua snarled as Salazzle's eyes widened. Rather than retort back though, she just grinned as an idea entered her head. She had never seen eye to eye with Zorua, and Zorua knew that. Even when she raised hell the two didn't like each other...and she could definitely make a statement right now. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Say Mew, mind if I hold him for a sec?</span>\" Salazzle asked. Delcatty gulped at this...she had a bad feeling about what Salazzle was up to. Zorua also felt a pit in his stomach open as his eyes widened. \"Mew, don't hand me to her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew didn't really think much of this as she blinked at her friend, trusting her. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Uh...sure, just be careful, he's really fragile.</span>\" Mew said with a smile as Zorua felt himself being transferred over. Soon he was in the much rougher, scaly hand of Salazzle, who took a few steps back from her friends as she looked at the tiny ball of dark fluff she was holding with a smirk. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Now Zorua, you need to learn manners to be a good pet.</span>\" She said mockingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Salazzle...</span>\" Delcatty said wearily, though the poison type wasn't paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">It's an awful big world for you, isn't it, I mean, just look how high up you are just with me lifting you.</span>\" With that Salazzle pinched Zorua with her free hand and lifted him into the air, letting him dangle and look down. Zorua gulped as he did, he almost felt like he was looking down a cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay, that's enough Salazzle.</span>\" Mew said, now starting to worry as Sylveon chimed in. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Y-yeah, just give him back to Mew.</span>\" She said smiling, though Salazzle didn't hear them as she reangled her claws to make it so Zorua was forced to look straight at the ground. For him this was sensory overload as he saw just how far away, and how fatal the drop to the ground looked, in the claws of a pokemon he knew hated him. He wasn't able to quite comprehend the fact that he was whimpering at this point, but the others heard it and Salazzle grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Now what was it you said runt? Bite you?</span>\" She then opened her maw before Mew intervened at this point and roughly used psychic to yank Zorua from her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">SALAZZLE! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!?</span>\" Mew said, shocked, horrified, and angry about the past minute or so. \"<span class=\"cpink\">That was way too far...</span>\" Sylveon said quietly as Salazzle just rolled her eyes. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I wasn't ACTUALLY gonna do it, and besides. This is Zorua we're talking about. ZORUA! Hell, you shrunk and kidnapped him, I figured i'd just help you with punishing him.</span>\" She said as Mew levitated the shaking Zorua over to her. He wasn't really hearing the giants right now though, all he wanted was to get the hell away from them. He was deposited into Mew's paw, when she half cradled, half trapped him against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm trying to humble and rehabilitate him, not scar him for life or make him think i'm gonna kill him!</span>\" Mew said as Salazzle winced. She felt the glares of her friends on her as she once again knew she'd gone over the line. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Sorry...guess I went too far then...still though, you can't tell me he didn't have it coming.</span>\" Salazzle said, though got nothing in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Alright, I won't do something like that again. Sorry. Okay Zorua? Sorry.</span>\" She said, though he was doing anything he could to not look at anything, even the wall of pink before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Um...we won't do anything like that to you Zorua, if you want to do something fun with us tonight.</span>\" Delcatty said, trying to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah! We were gonna talk to you about that before this whole weird Zorua thing Mew! Wanna go grab a bite to eat, maybe catch a movie!?</span>\" Sylveon asked excitedly. Mew looked at the cowering ball of fluff that wasn't trying to keep up and pretenses right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yeah, I won't do anything like that again...</span>\" Salazzle was scratching the back of her head at this point, trying to avert her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Mew took note of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Maybe...if we do this in a more controlled environment you can see him again before this is all over.</span>\" Mew said to them all. \"<span class=\"cppink\">And even without him, I definitely want to hang out with you girls soon, so don't worry! Next time!</span>\" She said excitedly. Zorua for his part was at least thankful he wouldn't be dealing with these titans, and only needed to worry about Mew, though he was still shaken up by the past few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when Mew started to float away and head home that he peaked his head out. Mew looked down and he gulped. \"<span class=\"cppink\">...Sorry about that Zorua. I didn't think that would happen.</span>\" There was no teasing in her voice, only concern. \"Mew this is...really, really fucked up, okay? REALLY messed up! Look, I get it, i'll stop with the pranking crap, but you've gotta grow me! Please!\" He said and she just shook her head. \"<span class=\"cppink\">It's WAY too early for that. Look, this is a punishment for you! You're not going to get out of it THAT easily.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EASILY!? DID YOU SEE WHAT JUST-\" He was cut off as he saw Mew glaring at him and he gulped before shrinking back in her paws as she floated through the village towards her home. She let off a sigh before smiling at him. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua, look at this as an opportunity! You don't just have to be my pet, why not also try to be friends? Come on...</span>\" She said, but Zorua didn't respond. He didn't want that at all, but what was he supposed to say? \"Look, if I go missing, what will my dad say, huh?\" Zorua said. It was a bluff, he doubted his dad would really care, even if he noticed, but Mew didn't know that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No offense to you Zorua, but your dad...um...I don't know how to say this...</span>\" She was struggling with her words, but it made something clear to Zoura. She DID know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. Fine.\" Zorua said in a flat tone, before he sighed. \"Just let me at least have the rest of the day off.\" He muttered before curling into a ball in her paw, making Mew frown slightly. She was arriving close to her home and would decide what to do then. She figured her mom was still at work so that gave Mew plenty of opportunity to get things set up, and keep Zorua hidden for now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered her home she took note that, indeed, no one was home and with that went to her room before she deposited Zorua onto her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her and she tried to give a slight smile, though he just frowned. Not sneered, or growled or bared his teeth. Just a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Um...hey, you know what, i'll be back!</span>\" Mew said in a chipper tone as she exited the room. She went for the fridge, hoping her mom had left SOMETHING she could use as an olive branch and possibly an apology for what Salazzle did. She sighed with relief as she saw her mom had left a leftover burger that she could heat up. She bet that this would at least get Zorua to maybe open up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part was walking around the desk, looking for a possible way down to get the hell away from here. Zorua had no idea what he'd do if he did though...he'd made an enemy of more villagers than he hadn't and it wasn't likely anyone would forcefully try to make Mew grow him back. As he was looking around he noticed his time was up as Mew entered the room...and something smelled really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hey, figured that maybe you were hungry little guy...normally i'd reserve a treat like this for when a pet is being good, but...it's your first day, and things started rough for you, so I figured this would cheer you up a little!</span>\" She said as Zorua noted what she had. A burger. He gulped...and his stomach growled. Damn, he was hungry he had to admit. He forced himself to look up at Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it take to grow me back Mew?\" Was all he asked, she didn't change expression, but set the burger down. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I don't know, it really depends on how you act Zorua. I really do have your best interests at heart here you know...not just everyone else's.</span>\" She said before sitting at her desk and tearing a chunk off of the burger, not too big and not too small she surmised as she set it held it in front of Zorua. He went to chomp at it before Mew pulled it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What do we say little guy?</span>\" She asked before he grumbled. He seemed to be fighting with himself as he sighed before looking at Mew with a deadpan an expression as he could manage. \"Yeah thanks.\" He said and she raised an eyebrow. \"<span class=\"cppink\">You can do better than that.</span>\" She said before he wanted to glare and bare his teeth, but thought better of it. Best case scenario, he lost dinner. Worst case...he didn't want to think of it. He sighed, cleared his throat and tried to look as normal as possible. \"Thank you for the burger Mew.\" He said in a normal tone. He tried not to make it sound forced, though he wanted to choke on the words. Mew smiled though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You're welcome Zorua. Enjoy.</span>\" She said as she set it down in front of him and he started tearing into it. As Mew ate her far larger portion she was debating what she wanted to do with Zorua for the evening...it was true he had been through a bit today, but all the same it would probably be good to try and establish a better relationship, right?</span></div></div>",

The whole point of this was to get him to realize how rotten he was being and try to harshly make him realize that. He HAD been through a rough day, but Mew still needed to establish some common ground with Zorua and that would hopefully make him more receptive to all of this. The last thing she needed was for him to be uncooperative right now, it wouldn't help either of them. She looked down at him chewing through his portion of burger...quite crudely and quickly too. \"<span class=\"cppink\">You're gonna get a stomach ache if you go like that.</span>\" Mew said in a scolding tone, but Zorua seemed to ignore her. She sighed as she kept eating her burger, getting ready to open a bottle of water she had brought with her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she heard coughing as she looked at Zorua to see that he was trying to choke down a bite. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua!</span>\" She said in a panicked tone before she thought quickly and looked at her water. She quickly poured a bit of it into the cap and set it down next to the tiny dark type, who greedily started to drink from it. She sighed as she looked down at the fox, who pulled back from the cap and let out a breath of relief before he started to go back to his chunk of burger. Before he got to it though, Mew picked him up in her paw, bringing him to her face. He looked annoyed by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua, I told you to slow down!</span>\" She said, as if scolding a child. He averted his eyes. \"I'm fine, thanks for the water.\" Was all he said before Mew narrowed her eyes at him. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua...do you want the rest of your burger?</span>\" She threatened, and this made him look at her. He was still hungry, he hadn't gotten to eat THAT much of it. She kept her eyes narrowed while he bit his lip and sighed. \"Alright, fine, i'll slow down and listen to you, that's what you want right?\" He said, Mew didn't change her eyes for a few seconds, but finally she relented. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Yes that's what I want. And after we're done with dinner I also want us to get to know each other better.</span>\" She said smiling, Zorua frowned at this. \"What's to know? You know as much as you need to know about me and I don't care to know more about you.\" Zorua said harshly before Mew smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You're my pet, and if you want to eat fun things like burgers or sweets that means being good and doing what I say Zorua.</span>\" Mew said in a matter of fact tone. Zorua for his part was starting to lose his patience with all of this very fast, but he knew as well as Mew did that he couldn't do anything about it. He started grumbling and muttering to himself before he narrowed his own eyes at Mew. \"...fine.\" Was all he said before he was lowered back to the burger and cap of water that he had now. He still had his appetite at least, and he considered exactly what he was going to talk to Mew about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after Mew had eaten and cleaned up that Zorua had been transferred to a pillow on Mew's bed. Mew's face was in front of him, taking up his vision as she looked intently at the prankster she had shrunken down. It was silent before Mew cleared her throat, as if expecting Zorua to say something. He was quiet though. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua...tell me a bit about yourself aside from what I know. You skip school a lot, prank tons of pokemon, and live in the forest with your dad, but there's more to you than that, right?</span>\" Mew tried to gently nudge Zorua into talking, but he didn't seem to bite. \"That's really all there is to know.\" Zorua said simply. \"I live with my dad and live to prank.\" Zorua shrugged at this before Mew frowned. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Well, there's gotta be more...here, let me tell you a bit about myself.</span>\" Zorua internally rolled his eyes before Mew started. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm 15, live with my mom who took me in when I was young, I moved to this village when I was 8, my favorite subject is...</span>\" Mew kept going, telling Zorua what must've been her life story, he did his best not to yell at her to shut up, but it was getting harder and harder to do that. He zoned out after about a minute, not even realizing when Mew had stopped talking. She looked at him, realizing that he wasn't saying anything before she prodded him with a finger. \"Hey!\" Zorua said as Mew frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You didn't even listen, did you?</span>\" She said sadly before Zorua grunted. \"No, I zoned out.\" He said simply. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua, you need to start taking this seriously, if you ever want to get back to your life that is.</span>\" Mew said in a scolding tone. That threat was the last push for Zorua as far as he was concerned. \"This is stupid Mew! I don't care about whatever the hell your life is and I ain't telling you about my life either!\" Zorua yelled in a harsh tone, his patience worn down, he didn't care that Mew was a legendary that towered over him right now, he'd had enough of today. \"I don't know where the hell your self righteous ass gets off, but I want none of it! You ain't getting shit from me!\" Zorua finally said before Mew glared. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua...</span>\" She said in a harsh tone.</span></div></div>",

She had been trying her best to be diplomatic with him while also making him realize his mistakes. As she glared at him and got ready to take her form of retribution she stopped when she saw something she hadn't expected...or seen from the fox before. In his defiant tiny face, looking in his eyes, she saw that he looked unsteady, emotional...but not with just rage, she saw tears welling up too. She was hitting a nerve with him...but that meant that there probably was more to him than he wanted to say, regardless of if he wanted to let her in or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part was staring down the giant legendary, feeling indignant as his vision started to blur. He wiped at his eyes with his paw to see that he was starting to cry. \"Arceus damn it!\" He yelled, frustrated, his voice cracking as he tried to turn and run from Mew's face, before a warm, furry, and immovable force pinned him to the pillow he was on. Her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That was very...very rude Zorua.</span>\" Mew said icy cold. She wasn't sure how she was going to proceed with Zorua right now, part of her still wanted to just take his little body and throw it against something, but that was far from rationale and would only accomplish sinking to his level, or doing what she had scolded Salazzle for. She could feel Zorua struggling under her paw, but did nothing for right now, instead letting him tire himself out. This would give her time to think and make him ultimately easier to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua thrashed and thrashed, trying to claw and bite his way past her paw, but he was getting nowhere. At this point tears were freely flowing, warm and wet as he kicked and kicked at Mew's paw, his frustration mounting and energy fading. For about 10 minutes he kept at this before he had expended everything, and breathing, panting, and silently crying he stopped, only for Mew to lift her paw and look at the disheveled mess that was Zorua. She wasn't sure what she should say...what she could say. She just blurted out the only thing she felt needed to be answered at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What is wrong with you!?</span>\" Mew said, her voice charged as Zorua looked up at her, not really able to answer as he wasn't even really capable of words right now. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Don't you get it Zorua? I'm trying to help! You're throwing that back at me time and time again but in the position you're in you have no choice! You don't get to leave, you don't get to grow, none of that until you tell me what the hell is wrong with you!</span>\" Mew said, her patience officially spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua still said nothing, still panting as he had stopped crying now. He was breathing heavy, until he finally spoke. \"Fine...fine, i'll spill my guts...just let me rest first please...ain't like I have any dignity left anyway...\" It came out like a slur, but the words surprised Mew. His fur was a mess from thrashing about like he had, and tears stained him too. His eyes were definitely red and puffy and he looked like he could use a drink of water, but Mew also remembered his harsh words, and his attitude, and just how unnecessary it all was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Fine...</span>\" She relented, though wasn't sure if she should let him off right now.</span></div></div>",

Mew looked at him before she sighed and readjusted herself on her bed to look at him closer. He had halfway curled inward and was sleeping pretty soundly. She could see he was breathing slightly heavier too. He looked almost precious like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Why do you have to be such a jerk...</span>\" She muttered to herself. She was frustrated with the little fox and wasn't exactly sure how to get that frustration out. This wasn't out of the norm for her, he pretty much always found ways to get on his nerves with his attitude and pranks, and she thought this would be the way to vent that out. Instead all that happened was they just clashed again, Zorua clearly unable to do anything to her, but she herself didn't want to take advantage of how fragile she'd made him either, this was supposed to be the way to a long term solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter observing the sleeping fox for a minute longer she got up and went to her desk. There wasn't much that could be done right now anyway while he slept. He'd just better have been telling the truth when it came to talking things out. As she opened up her computer, she decided it'd probably help get her mind off of things if she just browsed around on it, getting her mind off of things...but as the seconds ticked to minutes, to eventually a half hour she couldn't focus her mind on anything but what was going on right now. She'd peak glances at the pillow Zorua was on, the little ball of fluff still not having moved any time she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before she herself started to get tired, almost nodding off before she heard the front door of the house open. \"<span class=\"cnavy\">Mew, honey, i'm back!</span>\" She heard. Her Mom walked in and she heard the familiar footsteps, and Mew looked at her pillow. 'Crap!' Mew got up to meet her in the hallway. She didn't need her mom knowing about what was going on right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mew exited her room, she saw the familiar white fur of the pokemon that had taken her in and raised her, standing on her four legs, smiling at her daughter. \"<span class=\"cnavy\">How are you this evening? Did you make sure to eat?</span>\" Absol said as she started walking back into the living room to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, i'm good...yeah, I saw the burger and made sure to eat...</span>\" Mew still thought her mom treated her too much like a kid, but that was what moms did she supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsol went to the couch and made sure to get comfy on it, taking up quite a bit of it being a quadruped. She fumbled a bit with the remote to flicker her TV on and still wore a smile. \"<span class=\"cnavy\">Well why don't you sit with me, we could watch a movie, or maybe just talk for a bit?</span>\" Mew was tempted to do just that but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sorry mom...not tonight, i'm getting pretty tired myself.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"cppink\">And have a headache waiting for me in the next room I have to attend to.</span></i>' She thought, though her mom was more than accommodating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Okay dear, that's alright. I'll see you in the morning, okay?</span>\" Her mom did sound disappointed...Mew knew that she worked a lot of hours. It was hard on her...normally Mew would've loved to spend time with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was her priority right now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew got herself laying down in her bed, trying not to disturb Zorua, before wondering why she even cared if she did. Jerk probably deserved it. When she was laying down though with her lights out though she heard something from her side. \"Mew.\" The voice was distinctly Zorua's, but the tone itself was far from what she had expected from him. There was no edge of mischief or malice in it, and it was eerily calmer than she had expected from the energetic prankster. She flicked the lights on with her psychic and took a look at him. He still looked tired...and pretty calm too, his face didn't seem readable aside from the fatigue etched on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">...You ready to talk?</span>\" Mew asked and his mouth opened, it was working to say something, his muzzle shifting as if unsure of something before he closed his mouth. He shook his head and Mew frowned. Before she said something though he sighed and decided to at least break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...some pokemon know probably, you moved here after it happened, though maybe you've heard...I don't...it's...\" Zorua sighed, struggling to find the words. He looked at the face of the giant legendary, he didn't even like her, he found her annoying and way too snooty with self righteous justice. He wanted to yell at her again, but it wasn't like he'd be able to accomplish much doing it. He figured maybe being straight with her about this would help him talk about it. \"Mew. I really don't like you. I don't like many pokemon I guess, but you get on my nerves a lot. You've got me boxed into a corner and i'm only telling you my past because of that. This doesn't change anything between us so don't think this is a sign of respect. What i'm going to say is a deeply personal matter that would normally be none of your business. Know that.\" He didn't even sound mad when he said it, just frank. Mew felt a bit annoyed by the words but went with it. \"<span class=\"cppink\">You're the one that boxed yourself in Zorua...you've hurt and tormented a lot of pokemon that did nothing to you. I won't let you forget that, this is a punishment of your own making but...if what you're saying is true then I can at least say i'll keep it to myself.</span>\" Mew was curious now. Just what was Zorua going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few deep breaths, before looking into Mew's giant eyes. \"So you know I live with my dad, out in the forest. Not the best home but...it's home. He and I don't necessarily see eye to eye a lot. Always been like that between us, even back when.\" Zorua's voice was soft, the only source of noise in the room. \"We used to live in the village though, I had a mom...a sister too, older. She was really talented, I looked up to her. All I wanted was to impress her really.\" Zorua said, sounding wistful. He sighed before he cut himself off. \"Shit, Mew I don't want to talk about this...\" He groaned, flushing red as his eyes darted about. Mew gave a gentle smile at him, trying to calm him. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua please, just tell me about yourself, okay?</span>\" She said as Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...fine...we lived like that for a while I guess, I was young, the details are fuzzy but I basically only hung out with my sis. My mom and dad, they got into a fight some night...my sister was involved I think but after that...\" Zorua shut his eyes, sighing. \"Well not every pokemon gets a fair end I guess. My mom and sister left, I don't know why, don't know what happened, but their bodies were found the next day. When my dad found out...I don't know what happened to him, he changed around then. Stopped caring about stuff, drank a lot. I don't know how he feels about it, or what happened really that night.\" Zorua hadn't noticed Mew's expression shifting, he was in his own world at this point, thinking about it. He didn't like to think back on this much at all, it never ended well for his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad couldn't keep the house...we moved. A lot happened really fast back then, I dunno, details are fuzzy, like I said...my sister you know...she's not here anymore, wasn't around. Even that was hard for me to fathom. She liked my little tricks, my pranks. That all ended when she was...\" Zorua stopped, seemingly needing to recompose himself before he continued. \"I started doing them, harmless little jokes to others. At first a lot of pokemon found it funny. I liked that.\" Zorua smiled a little. \"I wanted to scale it up, ramp it up, but after a while everyone hated it. I guess they got too mean, but I didn't care, why did it matter? My pranks were the best around, regardless of what anyone thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, he didn't know what else he could say at this point. Mew herself was struggling to say something. That was a lot to process, and it wasn't exactly her right she felt to touch on this subject with her own commentary or advice. Not yet at least. She wasn't sure anyone had asked him in a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Are you okay?</span>\" She said gently and he looked at her, he almost looked ready to cry again, but there was no anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I am. I really don't.\" He swallowed the lump in his throat and took some deep breaths before looking Mew square in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't change anything though. I don't care for you, I only want my size back.\" Zorua said, trying to sound defiant but failing. Mew instead of saying anything, just flicked the lights off with her psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Get some rest, it's going to be another day tomorrow my pet...if you need a friend though, someone to talk to some more, please just let me know.</span>\" There wasn't much else she could say at this point, Zorua was the one that needed to open up to her, and she was sure that he was needing someone to make this happen for a long time. Mew's voice broke through the darkness and Zorua closed his eyes, he got himself comfortable on the pillow, unsure of where things would go from here.</span></div></div>",

No way you're getting me!\" he exclaimed, encouraged by his thoughts... even if her earth-shattering steps were all but encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the green giantess stopped... Zorua wasn't scared anymore? She could do all sorts of things to him, from crushing him with a finger to eating him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was he not sca-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her thoughts, Celebi noted that she had stopped walking. As for Zorua, she could see him... but he was very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could close the distance but... he was too small for her to see properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's grin faded as she understood the fox's line of thinking: if she let him out of her eyesight for a couple seconds, he'd be gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't let it happen, Zorua had to pay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't be so sure!</span>\" she cried, accelerating as she stomped behind him, furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why Zorua was so confident! He was going to trick her again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gritted her teeth, she wasn't going to let him escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time the fox learned a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rage rising, she suddenly knelt and lowered a giant paw right were Zorua was... but the fox made a great leap in the air and dodged the large paw, which made the ground shake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed onto the soft back of Celebi's hand and sprinted forward, leaving behind her wrist, knuckle and fingers as he jumped onto the ground and resumed running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi snarled as she got back up, towering above the comparatively tiny dark-type as she started walking in his direction again, the ground shaking under her feet...</span></div></div>",

The extremely tiny fox sighs: Celebi managed to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fairy manages to find the little prankster on her paw, she can't help but give a mischievous, though very low giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wow, Zorua,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I honestly didn't know that I could shrink you <i>that</i> far! Look at you! You're probably the tiniest living being ever!</span>\" Celebi exclaims, before remembering the reason why she did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy smirks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">A fitting punishment. I'm almost tempted to just let you go on your own and see how you deal with... everything!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's heart skips a beat.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblack\">I'm sorry! I'm sorry for what I did!</span>\" he exclaims, hoping that Celebi would hear his apology.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblack\">Please, change me back! I promise I'll make it up to you!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remark luckily didn't escape Celebi's hearing. True, Zorua is a jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does he really deserve all of this? Maybe, Celebi really went overboard after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice speaks up inside of the fairy's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. Zorua DOES deserve all of this. He's paying the price of being a prankster... he simply should have thought twice about his actions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shakes her head, trying to rid herself of the voices in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, all comes to an end as she decides what to do with Zorua.</span></div></div>",

You, on the other hand, will have to put a <i>lot</i> of effort into trying to make me notice you... understand?</span>\" she said, putting particular emphasis on the word \u2018lot\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor beneath Zorua started to shake as Celebi took a few steps, before she started giggling again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey, we could make some sort of game out of this! Let's see... whenever I find you, I'll give you some of your size back... the longer I take to find you, the longer I'm keeping you like that... the more it takes for me to find you, the less I'm growing you.</span>\" she explained, not really waiting for a confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew, Zorua had to play, whether he wanted or not... and she couldn't hear him anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her foot to take a step and move to her bed... but her foot never descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she stepped on Zorua? He had no chance of escaping her feet... even worse, if she tripped over something, Zorua would be crushed to an invisible paste on her floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hmm...</span>\" she pondered, before flapping her wings and starting to hover in midair.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay Zorua, I'm giving you a little headstart - I won't walk around while in here. That said... game on~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy flew to her bed and grabbed a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be fun, she thought as she started reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went on quite uneventfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nanoscopic Zorua had been trying to get Celebi's attention in all the ways he could think of, and Celebi, truthful, had tried to look for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut neither he did manage to make her find him or her search went on for too long before she just shrugged and laid back in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, night came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Celebi got under the covers of her bed. The whole room went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good night speck~ wherever you are~</span>\" she sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed as he laid down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hmm... nothing. Looks like you don't want your size back, Zorua,</span>\" Celebi stated as she flew to her desk and sat down, starting to write something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside herself, she felt a slight hint of worry - she didn't want to actually harm Zorua, just teach him a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she quickly shook off the sensation - Zorua was fine, it was less than a day she had started this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the nanoscopic fox, he finally realized how he could finally get Celebi's attention. He didn't have to run back and forth to get the fairy, no, he had to reach one of the places where she usually read!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy... relatively easy. Celebi mostly spent time by her desk or bed - did this girl never go out with friends? - he only had to get on top of one of those!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, easier said than done...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wow Zorua, you must like your new size a lot... it's been two days, I still don't see you!</span>\" Celebi said as she flew around, trying to locate the small fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feeling of worry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Zorua alright? He didn't eat or drink for two whole days, and she was quite sure that he hadn't been sleeping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He's fine...</span>\" she murmured, not sounding so convinced like she hoped to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zorua laid exhausted onto the floor, resting, not sleeping... he couldn't dare to sleep, not in these dire circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt life abandoning him, he hadn't been eating or drinking for a while now. And the sting of hunger was one of the worse things someone can feel, now he knew it. The lack of sleep too was starting to get to him, but he had to carry on... he couldn't lose this sick game Celebi was forcing him to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hateful green girl... once he was big again, he never wanted to see her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be long, he hoped... his destination was now ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hm...</span>\" Celebi muttered somewhat dejectedly as she flew on top of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, feelings of guilt were getting quite persistent. It was three days ago since she dropped the nanoscopic Zorua into her room, and she still didn't manage to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she could only hope that he was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to grab a book... but found that she read them all; she already read the others. To facilitate things for the fox, she had spent most of her time confined in her room, reading... and now, she had no more new books to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only gave her the perfect excuse to get out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua wouldn't certainly die if she left for a short bit... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type finally stopped to pant. After two days of non-stop running, he finally reached his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the only obstacle was climbing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sourly realized that he was a quadruped pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed in desperation... was he going to die like this, in the room of a giant green fairy, alone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Well, he wasn't going to die without at least trying to win this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get Celebi's attention in the next days... or he was going to starve to death, he just knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one search had lasted for longer, Celebi thought as she kept looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starting to worry for Zorua more and more each day that passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he still alive? Did he starve to death? Die of dehydration?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Celebi sigh - the worst part was that she couldn't know if he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please... don't be okay, but don't be dead or seriously injured either...</span>\" she muttered, not wanting him to hear her doubts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fangs sank into the hard wood. He was breathing heavily, and it was quite hard to do so with his mouth full of wood and his nose as an only way of respiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt like he was never going to make it to the top. All his energies were abounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Almost there... almost there...</i>\u2019 he thought as he kept climbing, hoping that he wouldn't fall... if he did, it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was officially worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi placed her book on top of her bed and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive days. It was five days ago she left Zorua to fend for himself in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she definitely took things too far, she thought as she got up from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua? I'm going to find you today... this is starting to get ridiculous...</span>\" she said, not wanting to admit that she was worried for him... if he was still alive to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe surely learned his lesson, she decided as she started looking around, hovering instead of walking as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around for a while, having a hard time with finding the nanoscopic fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi huffed loudly - this game had to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy focused and tried to sense the small fox in an attempt to locate him in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly detected a faint presence within the confines of her room and deduced it was Zorua... hopefully not some bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy turned around, finally noticing the spot where Zorua should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hovered forward, only to see...</span></div></div>",

She squinted but couldn\u2019t see much more...what she didn\u2019t know was that he was climbing, as much as he could before he saw the green goddess close in, her eye as large as the sun to him. He wanted to quiver but if he did he\u2019d surely fall...not a very pleasant prospect. He could barely see the ground now with how high up he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a whisper, gentle to her, a roar to him echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">I found you. The game is over.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he was gripped by a psychic force as he shot up at ludicrous speeds before landing on a green landscape. Her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun that was her eye returned as an odd sensation overtook him. The world around him was shrinking as he grew larger and larger, a titan to the size he was just at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped growing at half an inch. Celebi could make him out now, as tiny as he still was and she swallowed a lump on her throat. He looked absolutely miserable. He\u2019d clearly lost weight, she could see that from how thin he was, and his fur was absolutely frayed and haggard. She couldn\u2019t see anything in his eyes beyond exhaustion, she was sure she\u2019d see hate but...he just looked tired. Carefully, as if he was precious glass she set him on her bed and gulped. She had definitely pushed him further than necessary, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">For now, this is as big as you get, you took too long to win the game and I had to seriously try to find you. However...I\u2019m going to go get you some food or water now.</span>\u201d She said, hoping that worry didn\u2019t creep too much into her voice. He looked at her with those exhausted eyes as she left the room to grab him something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had left the room and was panting a bit and had to calm herself down. He really had almost died from exhaustion, hadn\u2019t he? He still could if she didn\u2019t hurry. She went to her kitchen and frantically grabbed a bit of sausage and cheese. Small amounts but it should fill him up. She re-entered the room and he was laying on his side when she approached him, still a monolithic giantess to him. She set the bit of meat and cheese next to him and like a feral animal he tore into them. He made no attempt at dignity as he swallowed, chewed and gulped loudly. She could hear him she noted, barely. When it seemed he had finished she help up a glass of water and levitated him over it. He drank for quite a while before he finished and she gently lowered him to the bed. She looked away for a few seconds, closed her eyes and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">So Zorua...</span>\u201d She turned to look at him to see...</span></div></div>",

But, just like a days-long blizzard, some of those feelings simply didn't melt and Celebi remembered why she was doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clgreen\">But... I shouldn't actually hurt him...</span></i>\u2019 she thought as she watched the tiny fox looking up at her, shaking like a leaf in a windy day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Okay Zorua, that was admittedly excessive. I didn't actually mean to take things this far... still, I hope you learned a lesson from this...</span>\" she said solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Zorua turned around and ran away from her. He reached the left side of the bed and dug his way underneath Celebi's pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he wanted to do was get away from the green giantess, no matter he if was still shrunken. Sure, the pillow didn't offer much protection, but at least he wasn't seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua didn't know how to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to cry, to throw all his frustration right in the face of that green girl... but all he could do was shake in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at the shaking lump beneath her pillow with pity. Surely enough, Zorua would have panic attacks in the near future...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt conflicted - did he deserve all this over a few stupid pranks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe psychically levitated her black log book into her paws and started flipping through the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Pichu, stolen ice cream.</i>\u2019 she flipped another page.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Azurill, destroyed doll.</i>\u2019 she flipped the page again.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Swinub, psychologically traumatized.</i>\u2019 she came to the last written page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Celebi, covered in honey, berries and feathers.</i>\u2019 under this last one was another sentence,<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Punishment: shrinkage.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed and closed the log book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose all seemed childish pranks... except for Swinub, that was truly horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gently put the black book on a nightstand and reached under the pillow, gripping Zorua and pulling him out, holding him mid way between herself and the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, the fox started flailing in an useless attempt to free himself from her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Stop it.</span>\" Celebi said, annoyed. Zorua didn't listen, but kept flailing helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">STOP IT!</span>\" Celebi cried, shaking her paws back and forth, causing Zorua to feel dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head kept spinning for several minutes after she stopped shaking her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally managed to fight off the nausea, he saw Celebi clenching her free paw and inhaling sharply. Then, she looked back at him with a soft look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... I'm sorry for this situation... I definitely took it too far, but it's undeniable that you deserved it... a bit... I mean, I'm not going to let you starve to death or die of dehydration just because of a few childish pranks... although you still have a long way ahead before I give you back your size, understood?</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And... I'm not going to do stuff <i>that</i> lethal with you again, okay?</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua still didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't going to do lethal stuff with him, huh? Still... she wanted to keep him like a pet, torturing him day after day until he either regained his full size and left or his mind shattered like a glass sculpture hit by a heavy hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox's limbs went limp as he laid motionless on top of Celebi's paw. The fairy bit her lip - she was trying to be honest. She didn't want to hurt him, but she also couldn't let him go until he learned his lesson... although she didn't want to let him know that she actually wasn't going to harm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis terror was a big part of this game... because to Celebi, this was all a big game. She only had to make sure Zorua stayed alive and that his brain didn't suffer permanent damage... then, she was letting him earn his food, water and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy spoke again,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...

Zorua internally screamed, but Celebi tried to mean it as both a reassurance and a statement that he wasn't done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua though, eventually let the softness he was on and the warmth over his body take him. He was comfortable...full of food and water finally...and tired. So, so tired. He fell into a dreamless sleep as Celebi carefully got into the bed and opened a new book. She'd make sure Zorua learned his lesson. Messing with pokemon like that...it was wrong, and he needed a taste of his own medicine. He had gotten that taste she supposed, but she was going to drill it into him. No more pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, this might be better in the end for him right? A bit of humble pie and a few manners would serve him well in life, she was doing him a favor...well...the last 5 days weren't doing him any favors, but from now on she'd have focused games and lessons...enough to teach him respect and fear, but nothing to hurt or kill him. Discomfort and humiliation at the most, she mentally gave herself that rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to see that he was sleeping hard. She smiled a bit, he looked cute like that...but he didn't look very peaceful.

Though I doubt it~</span>\" She whispered to herself as she continued reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's eyes slowly opened as he groaned. He didn't know how long he slept, but he did feel much better now. He groggily got up, his body felt stiff...a bit sore too, but his belly was full, which meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta go...\" He groaned, looking around to see that it was dark. Everything was still huge though, so he was definitely tiny...she didn't grow him back at all...she said he had more games to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Damn psycho...overkill to the max for some dumb pranks...yeesh. When I get out of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You'll what, exactly?</span>\" The feminine voice, loud and booming echoed around him as he turned around to see the giant face of Celebi grinning at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-C-Cele-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're still scared, huh?...You said you gotta go, did you mean...</span>\" He turned away, turning red as she sighed. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Here, get on.</span>\" She lowered her paw. He was small enough that he had to clamber onto it, struggling to climb on as she carried him to her bathroom sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was avoiding the gaze of the smiling Celebi towering above him, as she pondered what to do now...it was time for a game she supposed. But what? Something physical? He did look sore...maybe mental? She wasn't sure how smart Zorua was honestly...she wouldn't figure very but he could surprise her she supposed with how outlandish some of his pranks had been in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should simply get to know him and let him get to know her? She wasn't sure how to frame that as a game with incentives but she could figure that out, and it might speed up the whole getting him to learn his lesson thing, which was the point.</span></div></div>",

Psychically she moved the furniture to block any hallways, and shut any doors, essentially making her living room an inescapable pen for Zorua. She set him on the ground, and with a boom sat down in front of him, whimpering Zorua looked up and up at the green giantess.

He bolted, taking a perimeter. He didn't give a crap about her game beyond finding the exit and getting away from this absolute psycho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked all around. She had blocked the bottoms of anywhere for him to get, he grunted, running in what he felt to be circles for 20 minutes...he took note of the room again. A TV, doors he couldn't get through, a cabinet...with a cord dangling down and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you...!\" He said, giving Celebi an angry look as she grinned.

Her lazy, slow steps boomed all around him though, and the quakes were getting closer.

Of course, the brain of the legendary registered this as a secondary thought, because Zorua had collapsed on his side and wasn't moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's heart jumped in her chest like a spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he dea-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type began levitating in mid-air; after a short flight, he reached the green face of his tormentor; Celebi noted with horror that his eyes were closed, like his mouth, while his limbs laid limp in her psychic grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zo-Zorua..?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's scream had the effect of making the fox fidget: after several moments, his eyes opened into two minuscule slits, which he pointed on the indistinct mass of green in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before everything went dark again. Luckily, Celebi had noticed the momentary flash of blue across Zorua's dark face and breathed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut panic soon took the fairy again: Zorua was alive, but he was still in need to eat and drink. As for sleep, he was probably going to sleep forever if she didn't hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue gleam surrounded Zorua as he grew up to the size of a small ball. There was going to be plenty of time later to decide on what to do with him, Celebi thought as the now bigger Zorua floated on top of her bed, while she hurried out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Celebi made her way back with a small slice of cheese and a few pieces taken from a slice of meat. A shrunken cup of water flew behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that after starving for so long, eating too much was going to kill Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the fairy set everything in front of the shrunken fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" she said gently, using a finger to poke him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply from the fox, not even the slightest hint of a movement or a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, you need to wake up... please...</span>\" she intoned, her heart pounding her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still got no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, after a moment or two, Zorua began to move. His legs rose shakily, his eyes opened slowly as he looked around, his gaze immediately falling on the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout paying any mind to the giant fairy that was watching him, the fox made his way to the food like an ant; but it was like a Pyroar that he dug into the cheese and meat, like a Gyarados he gulped down the entire glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once all the food was gone, he looked up at Celebi, who met his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared at each other for an eternity; it seemed like Zorua wanted to say something, she judged by the way his lips moved without producing any actual sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Zorua collapsed again, his eyes closing as he passed out from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed in relief - at least, he wasn't in danger anymore... she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the fairy sat down beside the fox and grabbed a hold of him. It has been five days ago since she had felt his fur on her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi regarded her unfortunate prisoner with pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she thinking? This was supposed to be a punishment! Zorua was a jerk, everyone hated him for his pranks! Why should she have pitied him when he fully deserved all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with those harsh thoughts that Celebi was desperately trying to remember why she had done this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her mind's resistance fell like a house of cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clgreen\">What have I done, Zorua?</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua didn't wake up that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr the nights that followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor another eight, horrible days, Celebi watched over Zorua, though there was no need to: the shrunken fox did absolutely nothing but sleep throughout days and nights. The only thing that made Celebi hope was the fact that he was actually breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy uselessly tried to feed him in his sleep: he was going to be very hungry when he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If</i> he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach day that passed without Zorua giving any signs of wanting to wake up, Celebi felt more and more guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to keep herself from feeling pitiful for the fox, but it was useless. She still didn't know what she was going to do with him whenever - <i>if</i> - he woke up, but one thing was certain: things were even between them right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only dilemma was if she was going to let him go or if she was going to try and heal whatever Zorua had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever she mused about that, her heart usually began beating painfully faster at the second thought, like it was trying to force its owner to actually take care of Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first two nights, the fox had to sleep wrapped up in some cotton in her drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the third night, Celebi decided to let him rest in her bed - with her. She thought that maybe a bit of closeness might have helped as well as making Zorua realize that she was genuinely sorry, despite the fact that she was still trying to deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything was possible at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the days passed quickly, leaving behind books, meek attempts to make Zorua eat in his sleep and the concerned musings of her mother, who noted that something was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have looked horrible, she judged: she hadn't been going out since Zorua first woke up, save for begrudgingly leaving him hidden somewhere in the mornings, when she had to go to school, and she had begun stay awake at nights to check if the fox woke up. She knew he was going to hate her for sure whenever he did, but she didn't care; actually, she didn't care about anything at all, she discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninth night after Zorua's first, brief awakening, Celebi was laying in bed, the sleeping fox beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just eaten dinner, and was now reading a book, occasionally shooting glances at the sleeping pokemon beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, a sound distracted her from her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her attention immediately shifted on the sound, which she immediately registered as...</span></div></div>",

She got a glass of water, keeping it normal sized for now in case he needed multiple drinks, and shut the fridge door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back into the room to see Zorua hadn't moved much, he didn't seem to have the strength to really...he had lost even more weight in his small coma and what spirit he had before this whole ordeal didn't seem to be there in his eyes. His eyes looked hazy...no hint of mischief in them at all. His attention snapped to Celebi, a great behemoth to him as she approached him and gently set the meat and cheese down. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please eat...</span>\" She said, and his stomach grumbled as he looked at it and he lunged for it with a ferocity Celebi didn't expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tore into it, making no attempt at dignity as he did, gulping down all he could. Celebi frowned at him, not mad at him, but at herself for letting this go this far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done she set the tiny bit of cake down too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Dessert...</span>\" She said, trying to say it gently and he swallowed the cake down too in a matter of moments. She wasn't even sure if he tasted it. She lifted him with psychic to the glass of water and he drank thirstily from it, glad to be getting anything into his stomach right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough he stopped and sighed, a good sign that he was done, and he was lowered to the bed, Celebi got on it too and got as close as possible to him, though he seemed to squirm and move back himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" She said, and that's when he opened his mouth to speak for the first time since he woke up.</span></div></div>",

It seemed to be a dull sadness and a hint of confusion...that's all she saw in him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me? I don't remember...anything like this happening to me.\" Zorua frowned. The last thing that had happened was...he had run out on his dad about two days ago...that bastard. Zorua frowned.

What is all of this?\u201d He asked and she sighed, turning Zorua around to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">The prank you pulled on me a few weeks ago...then I shrunk you and...truth is, I can time travel, I suppose you forgot that too.</span>\u201d Celebi smiled wryly as Zorua appeared deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s been 5 years since I ran away...\u201d Zorua murmured and Celebi frowned. A glow enveloped them as they returned to the present, Celebi gently holding Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">The you I know would never talk to anyone about this but...what happened to you?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the body of the Zorua she knew, but the amnesia...she was talking to essentially a 10 year old that hadn\u2019t pulled a stunt on anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I told you, I ran out on my dad. I\u2019d gotten tired of the way he treated me, so even if it led me nowhere, I had to get away.\u201d Zorua said it in a raw voice Celebi had never heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to say something when he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe beat me, berated me, starved me bec-because I was no use to him-always wanting me to evolve when I can\u2019t! I-I just wanted-\u201c Zorua was crying at this point and Celebi\u2019s eyes widened. She held him to her chest as she started walking home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">Don\u2019t worry...we\u2019ll figure something out, okay Zorua.</span>\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to get Zorua to remember, but it\u2019s possible that something happened to him in this state that turned him into the jerk she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could figure THAT out...maybe she could make up what she\u2019d done to him, and make him a better pokemon in one fell swoop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made glances at the tiny fox nestled to her chest, he seemed to be getting drowsy, she was worried he\u2019d sleep for another week if he passed out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey Zorua, when we get back why don\u2019t we put a hold on the amnesia thing? Let\u2019s have some sweets and play a game or something.</span>\u201d She said gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to her smiling, giant face and tried to wipe his eyes with a paw, finding it hard with being pinned. Celebi wiped his eyes very gently with her free paw as she approached her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Celebi...that sounds fun...\u201d Zorua said as they entered the house.</span></div></div>",

She knew it was wrong what she did to him, and she was intent on making him remember, but part of her hoped that when...<i>if</i>...he did, that he'd consider the days where he didn't remember and look over his actions, maybe not go back to his prankster self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi still had to go to school, and when she did she made sure to put Zorua in a drawer with soft sheets and a couple of snacks and a little tiny cup of water that was still big enough to last all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrunk some books for him too and was shocked to find that he tried to read them...though from what she gathered he struggled with it a bit...he wasn't entirely literate as it turned out, partially from his upbringing, but he made do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after about 4 or 5 days of this that Celebi considered something that might make Zorua remember, she looked at the tiny fox on her bed idly munching on a small bit of cookie and he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Celi?\" He asked and she looked at him with a smile. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I think I know how to get your memories back.</span>\" She said and Zorua tilted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that really still matter?\" He asked and she looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What?

He was too happy about having regained his memories that he found it hard to be mad at Celebi right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid fairy smiled at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And the scoundrel was back.

I'm glad you pulled those pranks after all...</span>\" she commented, again kissing the fox on his cheek to express her own happiness, causing him to blush again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a knot untying itself from her heart as the guilt was washed away by the relief and the happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough some of the guilt remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I... I'm sorry Zorua... for sending you in a coma and for causing you the amnesia...</span>\" she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's expression fell asleep he lowered his head, before he sprang up with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi,\" he started,<br>\r\n\"You put me through hell. And when I say hell, I mean it.\" his grin faltered at the mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shot a sorrowful stare while Zorua inhaled deeply to rid his mind of horrible memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grin appeared again.<br>\r\n\"It was horrible, alright, but ya did your best to make up for it. I can't explain this but I... I heard you while I was in coma... I heard your voice when you told me to wake up, I simply couldn't. Then you took care of me during my amnesia, then you solved it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was starting to blush again as the fox praised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe readjusted a bit and hugged him more tightly. He nestled himself in her chest,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, after all, the good you did outweighs the bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one pokemon I'm not going to prank anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sentence alone had the power to shatter the atmosphere like a heavy hammer thrown in a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Y-You... you still want to prank?</span>\" she asked breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course! I mean, that's fun!\" he noted the glare on Celebi's face,<br>\r\n\"... Let me finish. As a token, I'll try to make pranks less... traumatizing.\" he recalled when Swinub was pulled out of the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's glare softened, and an expression of childish curiosity took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... That's fine, I guess. Just don't pick up on weaker pokemon again...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grinned, but didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you would be so kind to grow me back, I'll be on my way to my forest.\" he mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Celebi felt a knot around her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right, he had learned his lesson (and a couple others too), it was time for him to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi bit her lip, contemplating the pokemon that slept in her bed for countless hours, the pokemon she tried to feed in his coma, the pokemon she kissed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that all, did she really have the heart to send him back to a cold, dark forest and let him start pranking again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy didn't register the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought, if she took Zorua under her wing, maybe he would have stopped pranking for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven what she now knew about his backstory, Zorua only pranked because of a dark past. But if she pulled him out of such memories...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you alright? You seemed off...\" Zorua chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded as she sat up, holding the fox close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, I was thinking. Zorua, why don't you... stay?</span>\" she asked, a blush spreading across her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's jaw hung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi closed her eyes, blushing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Y'know... I've really gotten used to you in here and... we're friends now, no?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that.\" Zorua mused, perplexed. Celebi's expression fell asleep Zorua adopted a thoughtful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he fell in a coma, she hated him; now she was even inviting him to live with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there he was, having a normal, friendly chat with someone. Wasn't that what friends did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But, yeah. I think that we can be friends after all.\" he continued, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disappointed Celebi smiled in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well, friends help each other, no? I can pull you out of your forest and your loneliness...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in exchange, I'll...?\" Zorua mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well... I suppose you could come to school with me, help me with stuff when I ask you to...</span>\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School?

Keep that in mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi mentally slapped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Right. The decision is yours of course... but you have nothing to lose and all to gain, Zorua.</span>\" she said in a convincingly happy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\"</span></div></div>",

Celebi leaned down to grab him but he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, let me relax on your nice bed for a bit please?\" He asked and she looked at his eyes, they seemed to be asking for a little privacy and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll be back in a few minutes.</span>\" And with that she walked off, the familiar boom of her mighty steps registering in Zorua's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat back and put a paw to his chin...he had his memories back, though the way he felt the past few days and the way he felt now...that was some serious whiplash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Celebi was curious about it, Zorua knew that for sure now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe supposed he COULD tell her, but it wouldn't solve much, or he could just ride out however long she wanted to put up with him...he wasn't the cuddly little meek and weak Zorua anymore, he wasn't gonna let that Zorua come to the surface ever again. He might be doll sized at the moment, but he had his backbone damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had his wits on top of his pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua did admit though...staying with Celebi was fun. Some of the most fun he'd had since coming to this village.

Unfortantly, he couldn't make head or tails as to where he was for a while. But after a few, he saw he was on a strand of carpet fibers. He then turns and saw the biggest backpack he ever seen in his life. It was Celebi's backpack, on she usually like to wear for pokeschool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could question the exsitance of such a massive objcet. His world shakes violently as the goddess fairy is preparing to have her words for the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ok Zorua.</span>\" Her voice booms down, it was so loud as Celebi was talking in her normal voice. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">The fun for you will be to get my attention somehow. No time limit, just because i'm fair like that. However, i won't be looking for you.</span>\" Hearing those words terrify the fox, it meant he is completely on his own. And sad thing for him, she meant it. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">As i said, I won't look for you, so you need to find a way to get my attention somehow. And if i were you, i best do it fast, for i might end up forgetting i shrunk you soon.</span>\" Celebi says, \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Or for the more likely chance, something might happen to you before you even get close to me.</span>\" She says. Zorua shook in fear, how is he going to get her to notice him at his size? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortantly, that question was interrupted as the fairy start to move. The simple movement of moving her foot was enough to cause the world to rumble. But the second she took a single step, the world just drop for Zorua. Just a single step, and Celebi shook Zorua's entire world, and she didn't even stomp. The fairy was starting to walk, and true to her words, she show no signs that she was going to look or be catious for the nano fox. Zorua was on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well, i guess i better get ready for school.</span>\" Celebi says in her normal tone, as she walks to her desk to start preparing for the school as it turns out that its early morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua watches the living planet is going about her day, not caring for him. Fearing for his safety of being stuck as this size for the rest of his life, Zorua takes Celebi's advice and tries to think of something that would get her to notice him. However, he realizes that at his size, it would be impossible as long he is on the floor. He did however got a idea as he looks at the massive backpack, miles away from him. He figures if he can get on the backpack and climb to the top, the  hoepfully Celebi might notice him. But two major problems, he's miles away from the backpack, and Celebi is grabbing her stuff for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no more hesitation, the fox bolts towards the backpack. Ten minutes has past, and Zorua is only a mile away from the massive object. Unfortantly, a voice can be heard that made him dread in terror. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Celebi, its almost time for school.</span>\" Celebi's mother's voice could be heard, rumbling across the fox's world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ok mother, almost done!</span>\" Celebi's voice, being far louder as she shouted, booms down on the fox, making him stop just to cover his ears. The worst just started as the fairy herself is moving again, and she is heading to the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua struggle to run to the backpack as each step Celebi took would hamper his progress horrifically, and it only got worse the closer she gets. It was only a matter of time before the fairy stood right above the fox. Zorua could see Celebi's body loom over him like astronamical entity. Celebi was busy packing her stuff into the bacpack, which gave the fox tike to stsrt running to the thing. He ran and ran as fast as he could until.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nonetheless, it was still huge to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around the fox shook tremendously as Celebi took another step, reaching for her backpack... she was about to leave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperation seeping in his heart, Zorua sprinted forward. He didn't care that he was rapidly losing his breath, he didn't care about his heart pounding his chest, he didn't care about his tongue sticking out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that mattered was just grab a hold of the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, the second Celebi grabbed it, Zorua mustered all his remaining strength to jump forward. His paws touched something soft, his fangs sank into whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he make it? He didn't know, the crazed run had left him breathless, vision blurred and sweat running down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold air hit his sweating body, making him shiver. He kept his grip on whatever he was holding onto and finally looked forward... he was being lifted far up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt blissful for the shortest moment - he made it! Now, he only had to get Celebi's attention and this torment would be over... he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Celi...</span>\" the voice of her mother echoed inside again, and Celebi put her backpack on her back and readjusted it with a shake as she started walking to her door, happily ignoring the tiny Zorua who was probably crying somewhere in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know was that Zorua suddenly found himself soaring the skies of her room for a split second. He felt horrified - when Celebi shook her backpack, he was launched up in the air at supersonic speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over. He'd land straight back onto the floor... and this height was surely enough to kill someone his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own life flashed before his eyes, which he closed, bracing himself for the impact as he started descending with the same speed he was thrown in the air with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for the imminent impact. But it never came. Instead, the sunlight seemed to fade away. He kept falling for a while, before hitting the ground... which was inexplicably soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he dead...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his heart beating, he was breathing, the world around him was shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua reluctantly opened his eyes... he wasn't dead. But he wasn't quite sure where he was either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround him, darkness. It wasn't a problem - he was a dark type, his vision was quite good in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua got up and started inspecting his surroundings. Something huge and solid was towering above him... it smelt funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike pages...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound drew his attention... humming? It was a familiar voice... a voice he feared right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes shot open, his heart seemed to perk up as he finally realized. He didn't fall onto the ground... he somehow fell inside Celebi's backpack! Not only he was spared, but he had another shot at getting her attention too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, the monolith behind him was nothing more than one of the fairy's books!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt relieved, but nauseous. His world kept shaking, meaning that the green planet that was Celebi was probably walking to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed. While she walked, he had no possibility of getting her attention... even worse, she was humming. The only chance would be throwing himself straight into one of the two blue suns that were Celebi's eyes... but that would mean not only having to climb out of this backpack, but having to climb up to Celebi's head, climb down her face... he would take too long... plus, he doubted that the fairy was going to grow him back after he threw himself in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he had to wait, Zorua decided. He could use this time and rest to regain the energy he lost in that mad dash he made earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whenever Celebi stopped, he would start climbing out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new doubt... if Celebi was at school... she wouldn't be paying attention to him, no? And, if he managed to somehow get her attention, she couldn't grow him back, not in the middle of class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould he risk climbing out during Celebi's class...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted as his world finally stopped shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled brightly, her mind having registered Zorua as a secondary thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had reached her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school.</span></div></div>",

He whimpered, the size of these...these gods still being something he wasn't used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" He whimpered and, though she certainly didn't hear him, she thought she could...see that there was more to this speck than she could tell right now, but she had a test to finish. Looking around, she gently used a finger on her paw to slide the speck up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis simple action hurt Zorua...badly. He didn't die, but the monolithic finger impacted him with overwhelming force as his nose started bleeding from the impact and his legs flayed about. He groaned as the impossible speed with which he was carried at brought him yet closer to Froslass's eye and she put him...down, down he went, into a pouch on her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd look at it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked around, he was in darkness again, in her pack, and his eyes adjusted, he was sore, he was stiff, and he was hopelessly tiny...and possibly wouldn't get out of this alive. He couldn't help it, the situation finally overwhelming him, he started crying in the darkness, the wetness coming down to meet with the blood still dripping from his nose, he laid down, just wanting this nightmare to end, but the only way out was Celebi, a pokemon that actively wasn't looking for him and in fact didn't seem to care if he lived or died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...i'm sorry...\" He cried to no one, but the only response he got was the sounds of the outside world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroslass finished up her classes and went to lunch, picking up her bag. This jolted Zorua, who had drifted off as soon he found himself looking up at light...and the giant Froslass, she flashed a light into the bag and looked in it intently...Zorua figured she was looking for him, though he had NO clue how she'd spot him a second time he waved his paws frantically. \"HERE! I'M HERE!\" He shouted and got no response, but after a minute he felt those planet sized eyes...seem to lock on him. The finger descended and he closed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again!\" He cried as the finger met with him and he found himself being carried up and up...and down, and in various directions before he landed on a white sheet...on a lunch table in the quiet corner of the cafeteria. He staggered to his feet, dazed and then promptly fell down again. He was exhausted at this point...far too exhausted to do anything really. He turned his head to see...Froslass looking at him, but with a magnifying glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was then that, just barely...Froslass saw Zorua, as if seeing him in a distant crowd. He looked beat up though and...wait, Zorua!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tiny speck was Zorua!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe DID look rough though, she tried to get a closer look to see...dried blood on his nose...his eyes were red from crying she could tell, and he looked absolutely terrified. Tired as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infamous prankster Zorua. The one that skipped out on class constantly to harass kids. The one that made an ass of himself in the village at every opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas here, barely even big enough to qualify as being a speck, and absolutely terrified of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence that Zorua was experiencing soon came to an end.</span></div></div>",

The shy ghost then tightens the scarf a bit, securing Zorua more until his upper body is expose a bit. She then looks at a small mirror she has to examine Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looks across and could see Frostlass's reflection. For some reason, he sees her blushing and smiling a bit about this. The ghost then puts her stuff away then prepares to leave. \"Just wait until school is done, then you and i can talk at my house.\" She says, though she tries to sound a bit more confident for Zorua's sake. With that, Zorua felt his world moves as Frostlass proceed to head out to her next class. He hopes thing don't take forever.</span></div></div>",

He had to admit, Froslass discovering him was a boon, and he didn't worry that he'd...well, he still was worried he'd die, but it was much less. He just hoped that he could either get across what happened to him to her, or that Froslass would show him to Celebi on her own since the two were friends. Froslass had been sitting in this class for...Arceus knows how long...ugh. He felt his eyes droop. The scarf was comfy and warm...and he was so bored and tired from all the running he had done, even still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hungry too. And thirsty. Though he'd need to wait on those unfortunately. As the class boomed on around him, he found himself drifting off...more and more before he finally fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroslass had been sneaking peaks at the nano sized dot when she could, trying to make sure he was still there. She had no idea what he was doing...which was sleeping, but she hoped he was okay. She needed to find a way to communicate better with him...try and figure out what happened. Delinquent or not, Zorua didn't deserve THIS, did he? She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he didn't, but if he couldn't be fixed she'd at least take care of him to the best of her ability. She could see him through the magnifying glass, and he could jump to communicate with her. She'd figure something else out, but something about all of this scared her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sad for Zorua, and she truly wanted to help him and cared for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she can't deny...having him like this felt like a rush of power. She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nasty thought, one best left alone. After her classes she'd communicate more with him, try and help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">Zorua.</span>\" It was a boom, a cacophony of sound much like the entire world was to him at this point, but it was pointed and directed at him. Zorua groaned and got up, seeing himself on a sea of red...the scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to see...Froslass. With the magnifying glass in a room he didn't recognize. She was...damn intimidating. A goddess on this scale, one so far above Zorua it wasn't even funny. But she was kind...benevolent, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, she could see he was awake. She gently waved at him with her paw, far in the distance...Zorua could feel the harsh breeze that generated and Froslass noticed this before she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">S-sorry...</span>\" She stammered but Zorua just tried to put on a smile. His stomach growled and that's when he got an idea. He rubbed his belly with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">O-oh...right...I have s-some food here...</span>\" She said as she gently lowered the tiniest crumb of bread she had, near Zorua on the scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still as big as a house to Zorua. He approached it, something that took him a full minute, and went to bite into it. It was soft enough for him to do that luckily as he started devouring it. Froslass watched him. He must've been hungry. Very carefully she grabbed an eyedrop, and splashed the tiniest drop of water she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a lake dropped from the sky as Zorua felt the impact. He looked to see...the oddest thing he had ever seen as the drop somehow towered above him. This drop of water was almost like a monument. With great trepidation he approached it and stuck his tongue out...he was able to drink it like normal water. Relieved, he did as much of that as he could, being damn careful to try and not disturb the drop from swallowing him into it, lest he drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroslass observed all of this, and relieved that Zorua had received nourishment...she couldn't help but find the whole thing adorable. This cute little speck, that had been quite the terror until now...completely reliant on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head again. No, not the time. He needed her help and she was providing it to be kind. She dropped the third thing she had near him. A tiny bit of graphite from her pencil. It landed with a boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">U-um...you can use your claws to dig into it...to write...I think...I hope...</span>\" She boomed and Zorua nodded. This was how to communicate! He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroslass gained any and all immunity to pranks if he got out of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached it, and though he grunted and had to work his claw into it, he scribbled it in as big of letters as he could, as deep into the graphite as he could, and Froslass read his message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Celebi shrunk me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroslass's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">C-C-Celi...?</span>\" She was reeling. Her friend did this? Her friend COULD shrink things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was...nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than that, should she even confront Celebi about this? Surely she wouldn't leave Zorua to die like this...would she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had voiced her frustrations about Zorua more than once...Froslass bit her lip.</span></div></div>",

A simple page on Celebi's log book. He felt another quake as a pillar, far far in the distance that stretched up to eternity set down. Her pen.

She was writing very slowly, dragging it out herself and internally giggling.

But no matter how far he got he had no hope of outrunning the monolith behind him, and the quakes got stronger the closer it got. All he could do was shut his eyes as he ran. Soon though it reached the line on the paper above him and he could no longer keep going between the lack of energy and the quakes being too strong. He collapsed down onto the paper and started whimpering. 'I just want to go home...' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi meanwhile had noticed that she was on the line above him and was glad she had calculated it right. She knew she would finish on the line above where she deposited him, and was feeling rather proud of herself with her little prank on him.

He didn't really want Celebi to come up with new ideas to torture him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, to him was torture. To Celebi, it was all just a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the microscope, Celebi watches the tiny fox ponder his choices. He's been thinking for a bit now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua is distracted by a sudden noise coming from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi just yawned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Thirty more seconds, Zorua,</span>\" the goddess warns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Then, I'll be picking for you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis successfully scared Zorua into making more mental struggles to take a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the dark type concludes that swimming in the glass of water might end with him drowning. Climbing Celebi's paw was a safer alternative - although she mentioned a time limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf such time ran out, Celebi would surely enough punish him further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ten... nine... eight...</span>\" Celebi counts teasingly, her voice growing more mischievous each second she counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could reach \u2018two\u2019, Zorua finally decides.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblack\">Your hand! I'll climb your hand!</span>\" he shouts, walking closer to the fairy's extended paw for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, Celebi seems to understand. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So, it'll be my paw, I guess,</span>\" she says with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good choice Zorua. Now, you have one hour to climb and reach the centre of my palm,</span>\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Who knows, if you make it in time, I might even consider growing you back up... a little...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy's words seem to encourage the tiny fox as a hopeful glint appears in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout adding another word, he starts to run in direction of Celebi's paw, an immense green field that rests on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooner than he had anticipated, Zorua reaches Celebi's finger, which is the size of a small skyscraper. He swiftly runs towards it, ready to climb up... when he bitterly realized that he was a quadruped pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden, the task ahead of him seemed impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighs in desperation as the chance of growing back up, at least a little, seems to wane, disappear into nothingness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that he should at least give it a try, Zorua walks up to the enormous finger of Celebi. The tiny fox stands on his hind legs while pushing his forelegs against the large, green finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he risks moving his mouth, biting Celebi's finger. As expected, the fairy didn't feel that at all as she watches the tiny prankster with an amused look.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I see you've made the first step,</span>\" she says, her head slipping onto her other, free paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's how far do you get.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the comment - an extremely hard task to achieve given how loud Celebi's voice is - Zorua starts scaling the finger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Half an hour,</span>\" Celebi mutters as her gaze travels on a clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she eyes the side of her finger again; Zorua is still climbing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hurry up, Zorua. You've got half the time now,</span>\" Celebi remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was living a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue having to use his mouth to climb, he couldn't breath properly. Plus, he was extremely tired from all the struggles he had to do so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the hope that Celebi might grow him to some less precarious size drove him to keep climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his heart leaps in his chest as he finally manages to stand on all fours onto the endless field that is Celebi's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's eyes fix on his objective: the centre of Celebi's hand, far in distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout caring less about his tired body, the tiny fox sprints towards the middle of Celebi's huge paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Only five minutes left~</span>\" the legendary chirps from above as she watches the tiny fox sprint towards her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could barely see him - a nanoscopic black dot on her green hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Zorua physique couldn't bear the situation anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type collapsed onto Celebi's paw, panting as her tries to regain his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his vision blurry from the lack of energy, he looks forward, noticing a few wrinkles in distance. That was the centre of the incredibly large paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last sprint, he could make it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Are you quitting now?</span>\" Celebi asks from above, before glancing to the clock again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">When you've got only a minute left?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua muttered something incomprehensible in response as he stood onto shaky legs and started running again...</span></div></div>",

The desk didn't look very comfortable, but at least he'd be relatively safe there...short of a breeze carrying him away. That's when she got an idea. Very carefully she grabbed a small clean nose hankie from the corner of her desk and folded it over. she set it down on the desk and then gently as she could, set the nanoscopic pokemon on it. grabbing her microscope she looked at him to see that he was still sound asleep. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Aw...he's adorable when he isn't being a little punk...\"</span> She thought to herself. It also helped that his black, for as minuscule as it was, stood out on the white hankie, at least to where she could find him again. Now for the second part...Celebi crept away, careful not to disturb the scenario she set up and grabbed a small Styrofoam cup, and put a hole at the top of it. she then placed the cup over the hankie and sleeping pokemon, to protect him from outside elements. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Sleep tight Zorua...we'll continue in the morning.\"</span> Celebi whispered, giggling a little before she set off for her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua found himself standing on a dimly lit table, about pebble size. In front of him were many of the pokemon that were victims of his pranks. Marill, who was always the victim of a thumb tack on a chair here, a whoopie cushion there. Sandile, who he'd used stink bombs on in the past. Wynaut, who he had tricked into losing his way many a time. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, well well...look at what we have here...\"</span> Said Marill, grinning evilly at the tiny Zorua. <span class=\"cblue\">\"It's payback time...\"</span> He said as he grabbed a tack and started to stab it down to where Zorua was. Zorua, panicking started running when the tack impacted where he had just been standing. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Oh no you don't!\"</span> He said as he continuously stabbed the tack around where Zorua was running. Zorua shut his eyes as he continued to run, though when he opened them he found himself in a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was alone again, wondering what was going on when he saw...himself standing in the bushes with a rope, snickering. He followed the rope up to see a bucket...with honey, berries, and feathers. He ran to the bushes. \"No, stop this! This won't end well for you!\" Zorua said panicked when the phantom Zorua turned to him, eyes completely glazed over. <b><i>\"Since when do you care about it ever ending well for us? You know why we do this...you know you just want the attention...who cares if it ends well? You certainly don't.\" </i></b>The phantom Zorua started to melt as the rope gave way and Zorua heard a crash behind him. Ears now back in his head in fear he turned around to see a furious Celebi covered in honey, berries and feathers. \"Zorua...you little gnat...i'm going to wipe you out for good...\" Said Celebi as Zorua felt the ground coming closer to him and the world around him expanded. \"No...please...i'm sorry...\" Zorua pleaded, but his cries were cut off as Celebi raised her now cruise ship sized sole over him \"Goodbye pest. You won't be missed.\" Said Celebi as Zorua's world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking in a sweat Zorua looked around. The ground around him felt...soft. He couldn't make out much except a pillar of light far in the distance, unknown to him being sunlight creeping in through the air hole. \"W-wha...?\" He muttered to himself before standing up. He certainly felt stiff and sore from yesterday...yesterday...\"That's right...Celebi is putting me through the ringer.\" He groaned a bit, hoping she'd at least give him SOME of his size back today. \"I'm going to go crazy or die of exhaustion if she keeps going with these 'games' of hers.\" He said to no one in particular, at least glad to hear his own voice. As if on cue the cup around him lifted and he was greeted with the harsh sun. A quake soon followed and he assumed the green behemoth was grabbing her microscope to get a look at him. His suspicions were confirmed a second later. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Well you certainly look groggy, hope you rested because we have some games ahead of us! I'm sure you're hungry though...\"</span> She whispered, rocking him to the core with her voice before a mountain that was the sliver of a berry appeared before him. He certainly was hungry, and opting to go for her offer started digging in. Once he had finished eating, not even leaving a noticeable dent in the sliver, Celebi leaned in a bit <span class=\"clgreen\">\"So about our game...\"</span></span></div></div>",

She smiles as she's now fully able to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hi Zorua,</span>\" the fairy giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua doesn't respond as he looks down. The huge 'walls' of the maze became just a normal drawing below the fox's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prankster sighs. At least, this new size is way better than the nanoscopic one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" he mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's smile grows even wider. She could hear Zorua fine too.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You admittedly deserved it,</span>\" she responds, one of her paws sliding towards the tiny fox as she gently sccops him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nice work, Zorua,</span>\" she compliments, gently petting him with a finger. Zorua blushes a bit from the contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, now that Celebi's paws cannot crush him by accident, he has to admit that they're really soft...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shakes the thought off as he focuses on his primary objective: growing back to his full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So?\" he stutters.<br>\r\n\"What's next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi grins.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So eager to play now, are we?</span>\" she teases.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

We'll do some more games in a bit, consider this your break.\"</span> Celebi said as she continued to stroke his back with her finger. She did have some questions for him, and it'd be much easier to get him to stop his obnoxious pranks if she could use convincing over threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua himself sighed a bit. Happy to have a break, trepidatious about the talk. 'This is gonna be ANOTHER lecture from another Pokemon, isn't it?' He'd heard it all before with the pranks. Though he couldn't give his usual cheeky responses here, he needed to be careful. Celebi for her part had definitely gotten him to think harder on it anyway through this ordeal anyways. Soon the finger stroking stopped, Zorua almost missed it, and she set him back down on the desk, leaning in with her arms folded under her head. Planet size or not she was pretty stinking intimidating at this size too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Zorua...w-\"</span> \"Why do I do what I do? Am I looking for attention? Did they do something to make me mad and I was getting back? Am just a jerk? Heard it all, seen it all Celebi.\" Zorua said. Celebi gave him an annoyed look and he continued. \"I...Celebi, i'm an illusion Pokemon, it's my talent, I pride myself in it but...it isn't good for much...not really anyway except for hiding and trickery. And boy is it fun to pull of a fun trick!...I know that a lot of pokemon don't appreciate what I do...most, and i've been thinking on that in this situation, believe me...you wouldn't believe the soul searching nightmare I just had...I dunno, I think I do it for a laugh, and for people to know what I can do. Show my stuff.\" Zorua sighed, smiling a bit to himself. It was true, and he'd found a way to put it into words. At this he felt a finger touch his back...before it pinned him to the table. Celebi was staring intently at him, intently at his eyes and he couldn't move. He gulped a bit before she shut her eyes and sighed, her finger relented and he nervously, slowly stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Zorua, there's better ways to make friends, and there's plenty you can do with your talents that isn't mean spirited...there's...fun tricks! Fun illusions...when this is all over, why don't you try that to mend some fences with people...i'd like to see a few myself too.\"</span> She gave him a gentle smile, hoping he'd take the advice and the boost. For his part he started blushing. Fun tricks? Like what...he looked at his paws before he slowly, methodically moved them back and a small glittering rainbow arched up from both points, connecting together. He looked away slightly before the warmth on his back returned and Celebi was stroking him. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"See...that's nice Zorua...pokemon would love to see stuff like this.\"</span> Celebi said, he looked at her and she was giving him and the rainbow the biggest smile he'd seen from her yet. \"I-\" Zorua gulped. \"I'll keep it in mind...\" He timidly said, embarrassed by the attention. He felt awkward with this praise, inch high or normal he'd probably feel just as awkward. Celebi noted this and considered it a block she'd help him get over through this. <span class=\"clgreen\">'Though he isn't done yet...'</span> She thought.</span></div></div>",

Second, no leaving this room. Third, you can't hide on me. Oh and before i forget~</span>\" A large grin can be seen on the fairy's face and Zorua can't help but be nervous. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I still have to punish you if you fail in some way, so let's raise the stakes. Your current size, you win the game, I'll grow you another inch.</span>\" Zorua couldn't help but pout that he would only get a inch if he wins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to make me work to earn my size back, aren't you?\" Zorua ask as the look on Celebi's face was to enough to convince him he's right. \"*sigh* And what happens if i lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I shrink you.</span>\" Celebi says bluntly and Zorua couldn't help feel shock and scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to shrink me back that small!\" Zorua say as he terrify of the thought of being a nanoscopic speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Arceus above, no. Listen, i wanted shrink you, but I didn't mean to shrink you that much. And to be honest, i should have been more responsible and grow you that instant, and I'm sorry.</span>\" Celebi says as she does feel a little guilty of shrinking Zorua to such a scale. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">But back to what i wanted to say, i will shrink you, but only to a millimeter, and that shall be the smallest you ever be from now if you keep losing the next games.</span>\" Zorua does felt a little relief to hear that, until he felt a heavy force that was Celebi's finger on his back and pinning him down. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">But most important thing i want to say,</span>\" Celebi says in a tune that scare Zorua a little, \"<span class=\"clgreen\">No cheating. If i catch you cheating, like using your illusion, i will change my mind about not shrinking you to nano size, understand?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a complete buff on Celebi, she didn't want to put Zorua through that experience again, mainly because she was getting tire of using the microscope. If Zorua does cheat, she would just to do something to the little fox that is harmless and embarrassing to him. Fortunately for the fairy, Zorua believes her bluff. \"Yes Celi.\" Zorua say weakly as he felt Celebi lifting her finger off him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good,</span>\" She says in a chipper tune as she stands up to her full height. Seeing Celebi from the ground made Zorua feel even smaller somehow as he watches Celebi close her eyes. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Time to start hiding. One...two...three...</span>\" Celebi started counting and Zorua start to run in search of a good hiding spot. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">98...99....100, ready or not hear i come.</span>\" Celebi say as she start her search for Zorua</span></div></div>",

He WAS proud of his hiding spot though. While she had been counting he made a mad dash for her book shelf. Just barely able to climb onto the bottom shelf of it he found a spot he could wedge in and had wormed his way to the back, hiding in the small cranny space between the back board and the indented pages of a hardcover. 'No way she finds me here, and I did this one legit' He thought, quite proud of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had spent the past 15 minutes turning up cushions, looking through small spaces on her floor, searching everything she could think of before sighing. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Okay, fine Zorua, if you aren't cheating I give u-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GROWL*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...you've GOT to be kidding me!!!' Zorua thought. His stomach growled!? Seriously!? He bent over, tummy full from the berry and cookie bits he'd had. 'Of all the stinking times!?' He thought as light filtered in from Celebi pulling the book from the shelf, seeing the tiny dark pokemon in his hiding spot. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Found~you~\" </span>Celebi said in a sing song voice. \"Okay, this one isn't fair! I had you beat before my stomach decided to betray me...speaking of...can you uh...\" Zorua said before leaning down a bit. Celebi for her part turned red and quickly picked him up before putting him on a napkin and leaving the room. \"...it isn't like I can help it...\" he murmured to no one since she was already gone, feeling quite embarrassed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and they sheepishly moved on from that before Celebi returned to the matter at hand. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"So Zorua...I did think about it while...THAT happened...you hid well, i'll give you that, and I commend you for playing fair...\"</span></span></div></div>",

Thankfully the movement slows as Celebi steadies her hand, giving Zorua a chance to see what the planet-like Pokemon was doing as she reached for a phone with her other hand. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">I think I have a good idea for what your punishment will be,</span>\" She cooed. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">As much as I would love to play with you and punish you myself, I think I've got the perfect test for you</span>.\" Before Zorua could protest a flurry of deafening beeping sounds come from the device as she starts to dial someone. A brief silence follows as she waits for the person on the other end to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua covers his ears with his paws as Celebi begins to talk into her phone at her normal speaking level, a thunderous roar to the shrunken Pokemon. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hey! How are you doing?</span>\" She boomed into the phone. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Are you free? We haven't hung out in a while.</span>\" A few moments passed as she listened to the person on the other end. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hmm, Hmm, yeah. Absolutely, come on over! I'll get the tea ready.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the phone clicked off and Celebi shot a kind smile towards Zorua, or at least the general area he was on her hand. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Alright, Zorua. As I said before I've got a test for you. If you pass it I may consider returning you to your normal size and letting you go.</span>\" As she paused however her smile took on a more mischievous tone which sent a shiver up Zorua's spine. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">As you heard I invited a friend of mine over. One that you might remember, actually. Anyway, I'm going to give you to them and then pick you back up the next time we meet.</span>\" The world started to spin as Celebi began moving to prepare tea for her guest. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">One condition though.  I'm not going to tell them about you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt his chest tighten as he thought about the implications of his punishment. Not only was he being passed over to another mystery Pokemon for an unknown amount of time, they wouldn't even know he was there. Once again the world around him began to move as Celebi started grabbing cups and spoons from a nearby cupboard. With everything laid out she set a kettle to boil before she spoke down to Zorua in a soft voice. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">And I do suggest sticking to them like glue, my little trickster. If you decide to get lost somewhere then you can safely assume that you'll will be that size forever.</span>\" Her so-casually-delivered sentence filled Zorua with a terror that made his body flush hot and his skin prickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked up at Celebi and desperately begged. \"B-but I would be dead meat then! And if they don't know I'm there-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cut off as Celebi let out a sigh, his tiny voice falling upon deaf ears. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Don't worry, I won't leave you with them for <i>too</i> long, I guess. Just until I think you learned your lesson.</span>\" In Zorua's eyes he had already learned his lesson but it seemed Celebi was intent on dishing out her justice. Zorua really hoped she wasn't vengeful enough to put his life in danger for too long but different scenarios began playing over in his head. He might be able to last a day or two but could he survive if it got stretched out over a week? He held onto the green landscape of Celebi's hand as she delicately prepared the tea for her guest and before long a wooden knocking was heard from the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Looks like my friend is here~</span>\" Celebi sang.

'<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua has to be scare or nervous about being there this whole time</span>,' Celbi thought, though in actuality, Zorua is extremely bored from listening the two living planets talking to each other nonstop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Well, anyways, you should come by next week. My town is having a festival, there will be games, food, and some guys you and I can dance with.</span>\" Lopunny says in her cheery tone as she sounds like she can't wait for the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Um, maybe skipping the last one</span>,\" Celebi says as she has no interest in dancind, mainly because she's not great at doing it, \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll be happy to take you on your offer.</span>\" Celebi says with a smile as she also can't help wonder what Zorua will have to put up with in that time frame. Meanwhile, Lopunny bouncing up and down as she cheers in joy. Then she heard a clock chime and looks at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh dear, I have to head home.</span>\" Lopunny says as she gots up and gives Celebi another hug. Celebi returns the hug as she takes this as a opportunity. She quickly opens her fist and pats down Lopunny's back. Zorua felt what Celebi is trying to do and tries desperately to hold on to the fairy's hand. Saddly, his attempt was fruitless as the sheer force of Celebi just moving her hand was enough to dislodge the nano fox off her hand into the back of the massive bunny. Zorua screams in fear, flailing his paws as thousands of brown strands of fur, each are as thick as a skyscraper is tall, passes him until he lands on one strand of fur on the rabbit's back. Zorua looks around, lost as he examines his new world, a walking, cheerful, ditzy rabbit whose also a klutz. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Got to go, bye.</span>\" The cheerful ball of fluff says as she heads out, unaware of her new passenger. Lopunny left rather quickly before Celebi had time to say something else. She watch as her friend is already distant away. She smiles as she looks at her hand, no trace of Zorua at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Have fun in you travel, Zorua.</span>\" Celebi says as she looks at the back of Lopunny. All she does is hope Zorua is capable to last a week as she closes her door.</span></div></div>",

She even did a little twirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement. That's all Zorua knew at the moment and he knew that's all he would know for a while. His environment of brown, the cacophony of sound, all of it assaulted his senses like an unyielding battering ram as he desperately clung with teeth and claws to whatever he could find traction on. As she moved his world also spun a few times, nearly sending him flying. He clung until he thought his mouth would bleed and held tight though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay Celebi, this is your game, oh i'll survive it...I will...' He thought bitterly. His motivation, throw it back in that smug green girl's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">And so she's coming to our festival in 5 days, it's going to be so grand!</span>\" Lopunny was bragging to her friend, Smoochum about Celebi as she did a little twirl with sparkles in her eye before losing her footing and falling on her butt, she giggled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Lopunny, you have got to be the biggest walking accident I know.</span>\" Smoochum said as she helped her friend up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother quake, another fall. Zorua had found ways to adapt to clinging when he needed to, but right now he was scrounging for anything to eat, anything edible at all but there was nothing. He was tired too. She moved in her sleep so he had to be constantly alert, he was getting maybe an hour a night if lucky he thought. His ears had also been ringing constantly from the sound, he only hoped they still worked when this was all said and done...if he made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Still so long to go...i'll make it...i'll make it...' He thought bitterly. He would give up pranking for sure after this, he never wanted this to happen again...except one. One pokemon would have his ire. For eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi...\" he spat out venomously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny was humming in the shower as she scrubbed at her head. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Tomorrow~singing~food~dancing~</span>\" She sung out as she scrubbed at her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua dreaded this the most of any of her activities as his world was utter blackness, movement and chaos, trying to find any purchase on the slick wet surface as he was literally bombarded with oceans of water. He somehow had managed to avoid drowning and he had to attribute it to never staying in one place at one time. He just had to avoid the floor and ending up on her hand, or getting crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Over soon...over soon...over soon...' He thought, almost on the verge of losing it. He was so close, so desperately tantalizingly close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't fail now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Celi! You made it, i'm so glad~</span>\" Lopunny sang as she hopped over to her friend. It was a beautiful day, and many booths were set up for games. Celebi giggled nervously and said. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">U-um yeah, of course...just no dancing, okay?</span>\" She said as Lopunny giggled. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh, we'll see about that~</span>\" She said as she went in for a hug. Celebi quickly felt out with her senses to see...a third presence was with them, very precisely she found his strand and grabbed it before the hug broke. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll be right back Lopunny...business calls.</span>\" Lopunny blushed a bit at this before muttering. \"<span class=\"ctan\">TMI girl...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi found a clearing and set the strand down, secretly relieved that he'd lasted, She was scared he couldn't do a whole week and was trying to find contingencies to at least find him if he didn't. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well Zorua, I must say i'm impressed, I didn't entirely believe you'd last. Still, guess you've earned your life I suppose, so i'll give it to you.</span>\" She stated in a lecturing as she grew him back, expecting a mad Zorua, a bitter Zorua, a scared Zorua and what she got was...a very much not moving Zorua. She gasped. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Are you...are you breathing...?</span>\" She asked slowly as she approached him, slowly he started moving, trying to stagger to his feet before falling again, she went to try and support him but he just growled at her, causing her to back off. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I-i'd watch it if I were you...</span>\" She said, more meekly than she anticipated as he half crawled away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">Hate....you...</span>\" His rough voice coughed out as he crawled away from her. Celebi was sure he couldn't even make 50 feet. He made it 20 before collapsing. She went to him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Listen, let me go get you some water.</span>\" she started moving and Zorua's eyes fell on the distant festival before chuckling. Celebi heard this and turned around to see him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua! Don't you dare think it, have you learned nothing!?</span>\" She said as he chuckled more before coughing. \"<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">No...pranks...</span>\" She sighed before he finished. \"<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">But...retribution...Lopunny...you...</span>\" He spat out before starting his crawl, deliriously chuckling as...</span></div></div>",

She didn't know how she would make things better by doing this, but she couldn't leave him out of her sights. Was she afraid he'd pull something? Was she concerned for him? She wasn't really sure, and she was afraid to talk to him and set him off again, but for now she would tail him at least, if anything he said he did need her to figure out the way home so she needed to know where he was for that...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumbling interrupted both of their thoughts as a Snorlax walked by, looking blissfully towards a food stall as it slowly edged closer towards them. The crowd of pokemon dispersed to make way for it, and Celebi cleared to one side of the road too before she noticed that Zorua...had stopped moving. He just stood there as the Snorlax slowly made its way towards him, saying or doing nothing, he looked like he had tensed up before he started muttering and clinging to the ground, it was hard to make out what he was saying though. The Snorlax, noticing Zorua doing this, merely shrugged as he stepped over Zorua and continued on, at this point a circle started to form around Zorua as he kept muttering something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What is he doing?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">What a weirdo...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi made her way through the crowd to get into the ring formed around him and she slowly inched closer, in case she set him off. Now she could hear what he was saying though. \"She's moving...she's moving again...moving...moving...\" His face looked far more pale than it should, and his eyes were clearly not there as his claws were absolutely dug into the ground. She got a good look, without any of the intentional hate in his eyes, at just how...tired he looked. And she slowly looked at his paws to see that even clinging, they were having trouble staying still or finding purchase, he looked ready to collapse from a slight breeze. \"moving...moving...hold on...make it Zorua...make it home Zorua...\" He was muttering like a madman and suddenly another pokemon came through the crowd. Lopunny went over to Zorua to pick him up and said. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Alright, show's over everyone, continue to enjoy the festival!</span>\" As she made her way through the crowd, carrying the smaller pokemon with her. Celebi slowly followed...unsure of what she would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was stone silent in Lopunny's grasp. They had found a small clearing slightly away from the festival and Celebi floated in front of him. He was practically catatonic, though she couldn't know if it was exhaustion, trauma, or both. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Is he okay?</span>\" Lopunny asked, blissfully unaware that she was the other half of his issue right now. Celebi shook her head. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I don't...I don't know if he is. Right now I think I know what he needs though...</span>\" She said as she floated closer. He looked like he was barely clinging to consciousness as she got a look at him before saying. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You can sleep now Zorua, no more movement.</span>\" Something seemed to register in his head as he looked at Celebi, she didn't know if he saw her or not though, he looked...confused by something before his eyes closed and he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">What happened to him anyway?</span>\" Lopunny asked, curious. Celebi looked down. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">If I told you, you'd just feel bad too.</span>\" Celebi said, confusing her friend. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Want to tell me anyway?</span>\" She sat down, still holding the sleeping dark type. \"<span class=\"ctan\">If you screwed something up, or we screwed something up, maybe together we can make something right, right?</span>\" Lopunny said enthusiastically and Celebi sighed before sitting down. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well Zorua is...maybe now was, a horrible trickster from our village...</span>\" Celebi began, as she went into detail about at least what she knew had happened to him.</span></div></div>",

Moonlight trickled in from a window across the room from the bed he was on, giving the unfamiliar bedroom he was in a faint glow. Needless to say, Zorua was a bit bemused at the fact that he was in some room he didn't recognize, but figured it had something to do with the one who left him feeling enraged. And speak of the devil, that blue-eyed monster had just opened the bedroom door, flanked by the Lopunny who had unconsciously put him through hell. Zorua instantly turned away from them, not even wanting to associate with either, but they responded by both standing on the side of the bed. Knowing he was likely not going to get any alone time until he listened to whatever they were going to start on, he begrudgingly turned back to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Zorua spat, wanting to get it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"I've been talking with Lopunny, and...\"</span> Celebi began. <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"I just wanted to make sure you were feeling alright...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" was a cruel overstatement for Zorua's current state. Sure, his body was a lot better, now that he had eaten and gotten some rest, but his mental state left a lot to be desired. He glowered at the two girls before him, letting silence overtake the room. Upon further inspection, Lopunny seemed to have been bawling earlier, as her fur was stained with tear streaks. 'At least someone here has some semblance of emotion,' Zorua mentally mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"We can head back to the village tomorrow, if you're feeling any better,\"</span> the smaller girl continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lopunny, do you mind giving us a moment?\" Zorua intoned. \"I have some words I'd like to say to her and her alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"O-okay, I guess...\"</span> the bunny girl replied, before stumbling towards the door. She went through and closed it, and Zorua waited for a moment before fixating his eyes directly on Celebi, non-verbally asking for eye contact. She obliged, fearing the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're wondering if I'm 'alright', is that it? You put me through a week of hell, then just want me to kind of shrug it off and solider on, is that it?\" Zorua coldly began. \"You think that after all that, I can just move on with my life, act like none of this ever happened, is that it?!\" His voice began to rise, but he didn't care, he had a lot to get off of his chest, and he didn't even care if Lopunny heard at this point. \"Sure, I may have caused some physical discomfort for a lot of people, and a whole lot of them fear me now, but NONE OF MY PRANKS EVER EVEN CAME <i>CLOSE</i> TO KILLING ANYONE! YOU'RE STILL IN <i>SCHOOL</i> AND YOU DECIDED THAT THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH A PRANKSTER IS <i>MANSLAUGHTER</i>! HOW IS IT SOMEONE SMART LIKE YOU THOUGHT THAT JUST LETTING YOUR FRIEND UNAWARELY KILL SOMEONE, OR FAILING THAT, SCARRING THEM FOR LIFE, WAS A GOOD CHOICE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, despite the fact that Zorua was formerly the small party here, his rant was causing Celebi to shrink back (figuratively). She wasn't expecting another emotional outburst from Zorua so soon after the last one, but this one was much worse. Now that he'd had time to sleep on what Celebi had done and her personality, he had concocted a rant that not only was severely scathing, but also entirely true. She <i>was</i>, in fact, the smartest girl in school, and yet she had done this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho <i>was</i> she anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi opened her mouth, but her rebuttal never came. She didn't have an argument for any of what Zorua had said. Ashamed, she simply turned away and sat down, hiding her crying eyes in her hands. Zorua felt a little sympathetic for her, but only a little, and turned back to face the wall next to the bed. Celebi, however, wanted to fix what she had caused... but how?</span></div></div>",

The time-traveler honestly believed that she deserved this; after all, Zorua had made it abundantly clear that he wanted her to do <i>something</i> to make up for his time in hell, and this was poetic justice at its finest. Seeing even the steely trickster showing sympathy for her, even after what she had done to him, just made Celebi cry even more.

Then, she could finally apologize to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy shook her head as she started to tear up again. Zorua looked at her.<br>\r\n\"Celi-\" she interrupted.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... No Zorua... I'm doing it...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said nothing more. Zorua saw her taking a few deep breaths, before forming that familiar cyan ball in her paws and shooting it in the sky. Then, she placed her paws over her eyes and started crying harder, before the ball fell upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his eyes, Celebi shrunk down to size, until she completely disappeared from his sight, until he couldn't hear her anymore. Narrowing his eyes, he could actually see a green dot on top of Lopunny's bed... but he was distracted when Lopunny herself opened the door once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">... Are you...</span>\" she stopped, noticing that Celebi was no longer there.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Where is Celebi...?</span>\" she asked with closing concern as she walked into the room... before tripping and falling face-down on the hard floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, not sure how to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She left... told she had something important to do - so important that she left through the window... She told me to tell you she said bye.\" he intoned, remembering that Lopunny was a bit airhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the bipedal bunny nodded as she got back on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">... And... you? Are you going to stay... you need rest...</span>\" she offered. Zorua shook his head.<br>\r\n\"No...

I'll be on my way now.\" he told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was big, no more Celebi to deal with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi kept crying harder and harder as she gripped the flesh of the monolithic pokemon with all her strength. There was fur, surrounding her, but she didn't want to hold onto it. Nor she wanted to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to know what she put Zorua through for a whole week before growing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around her shook endlessly, the pokemon was probably walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mustered all her strength to climb up a bit and buried her face into the flesh, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua walked back to his forest. Finally, after a week of hell, he was seeing his beloved forest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he wanted now was get something in his stomach, get some proper sleep and forget Celebi and Lopunny forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for pranks... he had been inactive for a week... should have he resumed? He didn't know... after all, Celebi could shrink him again and keep him as a pet or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Whenever she returned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If</i> she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been clinging for three days already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi felt sore, and the energy was abandoning her. She wanted to sleep, badly, but she knew that if she did, it would be over for her... sure, she always could grow herself back to normal, but she wanted to earn that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled loudly, now it did incessantly, asking to be filled after three days of starvation; her throat was dry and she was quite certain that she didn't have anymore tears in her to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a miracle that she was still able to blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother four days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating food in his underground cave, Zorua wondered how Celebi was doing... certainly not good, but was she still alive at least?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't care that much, but something in him made his mind travel back to the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this pity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never pitied none of his victims... but now, he knew what Celebi was probably going through, he experienced it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head - why was it so hard to rid it of Celebi? She lingered in his thoughts while he wanted her out. He hated her! She was getting what she deserved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... The look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was crying, genuinely sorrowful for what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed - he had attempted to change her mind, but she was stubborn enough to willingly go through what the fox had already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, and resumed eating, hoping to bury his pity under an avalanche of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost the track of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen did this all began? She didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only knew that Zorua was right - this was hell. She was slowly starving to death, and if she didn't die from the lack of food, she'd die of dehydration or from the lack of sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Celebi couldn't dare to sleep, not in these circumstances. She opted instead to close her eyes for at least five minutes a day. This was the closest thing to a rest she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure that, if she closed her eyes for more than five minutes, she would never open them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was only the tip of the iceberg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer world was constantly shaking and booming, and she had to hold on tight not too fall off. Her paws felt sore after so much time of clinging to the hot flesh - the fur around her made things even worse - but she couldn't let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's only hope was that she made it... then, she was going to crawl to Zorua's feet and beg for forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly that thought made her want to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing else mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had been gone for five days now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.<br>\r\n\"If she's still alive, she only has two more days ahead of her...\" he mused. He had desperately tried to rid his head from her, but the harder he tried, the stronger those thoughts came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was distracted as he noted a pokemon walking through his forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNosepass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type snickered from his hiding spot in the bushes - he had a rope somewhere, the rock type could be hung by his giant nose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Celebi re-entered his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed and laid back, deciding to let Nosepass go... for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya saw this Celi? You better not bother me anymore...\" he told, before starting to snicker.<br>\r\n\"If you ever come back from hell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was a week since Celebi shrunk down to that nanoscopic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was somewhat expectant, he wanted to see in what pitiful state she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited and waited for half the day, before deciding to head to the village. Wherever she was, she was coming back today no? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Maybe she even spent the week with a Grimer! Or a Stunky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat'd be hilarious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Celebi didn't come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on uneventfully - save for the glares he received, like he always did when he came to the village - and there was no trace of Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Aw come on! It's been a week! Where's that green-\" he couldn't finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a wave of heat on his side, before a cyan flash erupted... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinded, he closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zorua opened them again, an exhausted Celebi was laying on the ground in front of him, looking barely alive. She was in the pitiful state Zorua had imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clearly lost weight, he judged from how thin she was; her eyes were swollen, suggesting that she didn't do much sleeping. She was breathing slowly, practically gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last amount of energy left, the fairy looked at Zorua, who suddenly realized... Celebi had been with him for the whole week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision growing blurry, she gave a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">W-We're... even...</span>\" she whispered, before falling unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had just fainted.</span></div></div>",

He COULD go through it, but there was no way he'd be able to open the front door to this house if it were shut, even if he could he'd be in an area he doesn't know, tiny and helpless, with no direction on how to even get home. He knew that at this point he couldn't DO anything to even get back to his forest on his own, and his only shot at getting there was Celebi...and he couldn't stand that thought. He started to shake a bit before...\"GrrrraaaAAAAAHHHHH!\" He started to pound on the ground in front of him with his front paws, screaming at the top of his lungs for a good 30 seconds before he stopped and was huffing loudly. Celebi just looked at him, unimpressed by this before he turned around, glaring daggers at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no choice but to deal with you for now, you've just made that clear.\" He said as she sighed. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good, now that we've made that clear, we can hopefully move on from-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ain't moving on from crap, let ME make something clear here Celebi, I have to rely on you right now, you've taken it upon yourself to shrink me AGAIN for whatever reason, and I more or less have no choice BUT to deal with you right now, this changes nothing!\" He said seething before Celebi threw up her hands and huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Do you have any idea the state you were in before you passed out Zorua!? Any at all!? You were half dead, half crazed, and went into a panic attack at the slightest provocation! Do you think I can leave you in that state!? You were a potential danger to yourself and those around you and I couldn't predict what you'd do, when I said you're in a fragile state I wasn't just referring to your size!</span>\" She said, fed up with his attitude at this point, she knew what he was about to say. \"And who-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Whose fault is that? Yes, it's mine Zorua, I screwed up, and you're not the only one who's let me know that, Lopunny even let me have it when I let her know what I did to you, and I stand by what I said, YOU provoked me into doing it Zorua...yes, I went too far, and I know I can't undo it, or take it back, so hate me all you want but Lopunny wants to make it right, I want to make it right, and if you don't want to give me the chance then at least give her a chance, she had no idea what she was putting you through.</span>\" Celebi finally finished, her tone going gentler as she went on. Zorua just sat there, fuming as he listened to her. Finally he sighed and muttered \"You say I provoked you...I had no idea you'd be so cold as to do what you did...you have no idea the hell I experienced Celebi, how could you? How could any pokemon know what it's like to be that insignificant...that powerless, or hopeless...I can't unsee the things i've seen, unthink the thoughts i've had, and you can't take it back, you're right. You will NEVER undo what you did to me...but fine, you're also right about something else, Lopunny didn't know what she was doing, as much as I want to blame her for this too. I'll behave until we get home...after that, please change me back and please never talk to me again. I won't do any pranks anymore in return. I think that's a fair trade. Quite frankly...you frighten me.\" He didn't yell any of that, he stated it, but Celebi definitely felt the rawness in his voice and the words he spoke probably hit her harder than any he'd said up to this point, but she didn't let it show on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence before Lopunny returned with a plate of food and a glass of water. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I'm back~</span>\" She sung, unaware of Zorua underfoot as he dodged out of the way, making Celebi gasp. Lopunny realized her mistake soon after as she looked down. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh my, I am so sorry Zorua! Why are you down there!? I could've hurt you!</span>\" She said, half scolding and half worried for him, as she handed the plate and water to Celebi, he just huffed. \"I was thinking of taking off, but Celebi convinced me to stay, then you came in.\" He said simply. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh...well it's a good thing then, who knows what could happen to someone your size, here let me help you up.</span>\" She bent down to pick him up but started to lose her balance. \"Oh crap!\" Zorua said as he ran away and a quake on the ground knocked him on his side as Lopunny landed on her floor. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Oof...S-sorry...</span>\" She said to the dazed Zorua. \"Yeah...it's fine...\" He said as he shakily got to his feet and she reached her paws out to grab him. He didn't fight it, more because he realized he couldn't and she got to her feet, setting him on her bed. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Here Zorua, let's eat and make up, alright?</span>\" She said kindly down to him as she sat on his side, and Celebi sat on his other side. They rose quite high up and he had to admit, despite them not being planet sized, these giantesses were damn intimidating. 'Just deal for now...when Celebi takes me home that'll be that.' He thought as Lopunny gently handed him a small slice of meat. \"<span class=\"ctan\">If you need water, just let me know, okay?</span>\" She said kindly, he nodded and muttered a thanks before he started to eat the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">So Celebi, how long are you two going to be staying anyway?</span>\" Lopunny asked kindly, making Zorua look hesitantly in her direction, Celebi just sighed.</span></div></div>",

Hey, I was thinking... someone will have to need to watch you Zorua... you could end up like that again overnight... that'd be bad...</span>\" Celebi mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shot her a look of hatred.

Though the wait had been excruciating, he was a pokemon of his word and had been quite well behaved for the past few months, never crossing a line. Finally, this would be his reward. His mom had left him to go use the restrooms briefly for only a moment, when he was hit by Celebi's blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...This was not what he had in mind for a fun time. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">Mom...</span>\" He called out frightened at his now alien surroundings. He was on the side of a stall that rose higher and higher and higher still into the sky, and he couldn't see the top of it at all. Quakes resounded all around him as titans that were fellow pokemon passed by. He whimpered and backed as far into the stall as he could. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">Anyone...</span>\" He mumbled, hoping someone would look down and see him. Suddenly a wind picked up and started to carry him away from his safe spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">No...no no nonononono!</span>\" He cried as he shut his eyes, powerless to stop the gentle breeze that was carrying his speck of a body somewhere into the festival. He cried as his speed picked up, hoping for a gentle landing, that someone would save him when he rolled into the ground in the middle of a path. He groaned, he wasn't seriously injured thankfully, but the possibility was there that he'd definitely have bruises later on. He winced as he staggered to his feet, only to see in front of him a monolithic pokemon, he had to crane his head just to see who it was, up and up his eyes went and he saw...</span></div></div>",

Zorua, still at his original size, had apparently face-planted onto the cold cabin floor during the confusion and was groaning in pain. \"Wh...What happened?\" He whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Um... The Ferris wheel stopped for some reason.</span>\" Celebi said as she tried to regain her bearings. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Are you okay? Lopunny how about... You?</span>\" She trailed off as she looked over to Lopunny's seat. She was gone. In fact, the roof, floor and walls surrounding her seat were missing. Zorua scampered closer to Celebi as he realized his tail was hanging over the edge of the cabin which was dangling right at the top of the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where's Lopunny? She didn't fall did she?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's eyes widened at his words. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Lopunny!</span>\" She yelled as she hopped off the seat to look over the edge. They both jumped as a flurry of cream and brown fur suddenly dominated the view from the cabin. Zorua couldn't believe what he was seeing as the form of a massive Lopunny struggled to sit up, her enlarged body dangerously close to the Ferris wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\"><span class=\"ctan\">I'm okay, I'm okay!</span></span>\" Lopunny thunderously announced as she rubbed her head and opened her eyes. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I'm... Um...</span>\" She was at a loss for words as she found herself sitting just as tall as the Ferris wheel she was just on, her legs splayed out to the either side of it. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I'm big?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Celebi and Zorua jumped again as her giant red eyes focused on the cabin they were in and leaned in closer. While the size difference was nothing compared to what Zorua experienced, it was still intimidating seeing the giantess stare at them. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Wow!</span>\" She exclaimed as a small smile crept on her face. \"<span class=\"ctan\">You can do stuff like this, Celebi?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I didn't mean to! Um, I just need to get down from here and I should be able to reverse it...</span>\" A cacophony of screaming Pokemon distracted her and Lopunny as all the festival-goers finally noticed the giant Lopunny towering over everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh! Sorry!</span>\" Lopunny said as she turned her attention to the Pokemon running about, her expression of amazement changed to worry. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Um, keep... festivalling!</span>\" The massive rabbit Pokemon planted a hand behind her so she could prop herself up. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I'll leave, please d-don't let me ruin your fun! Uh, I'm going to stand up now.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No no no! Stay there!</span>\" Celebi called out to her as she began to stand up. Unfortunately Lopunny was too distracted with the chaos of the fleeing Pokemon to hear her. Planting another hand behind her to scoot herself away from the Ferris wheel she accidentally crushes one of the many stalls littering the festival, only adding to the panic around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Ack, Sorry! I'm gonna leave the festival area, okay?</span>\" Zorua cringed at the thought of Lopunny navigating around the festival, given her penchant for being incredibly clumsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you shrink her back?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">With the way she's moving around I can't!  I'm going to try flying to her.</span>\" Standing up she got ready to take flight but was knocked off her feet as the Ferris wheel rocked violently. The steel structure groaned when Lopunny's leg brushed against it as she brought herself to her full height. She was just about twice as tall compared to it and stood at approximately a hundred foot tall. Celebi and Zorua only had a good view of her thighs as she awkwardly backed away from the wheel, her paws thunderously crashing down on the ground despite how delicate she was trying to be. The two Pokemon stuck in the cabin were like Deerlings in the headlights as they stared at the giantess turn around and start walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Um, coming through!</span>\" She blared as she tiptoed through the festival, trying her best not to demolish any stands or crush any fleeing Pokemon. The keyword being <i>trying</i>. Her paw suddenly got snagged on a stand causing her to stumble forward, sending debris from the small structure flying everywhere. She stomped about a bit as she awkwardly tried to balance herself and thankfully, was able to. Looking down Lopunny saw a shocked Electrabuzz staring at a giant paw that just barely missed him. \"<span class=\"ctan\">S-sorry about that!</span>\" She whined as the electric Pokemon ran away. With the road out clear Lopunny continued her trek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was able to regain her thoughts when Zorua began nudging her side. \"Aren't you going to do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I am!</span>\" She blurted out, embarrassed at how she froze up like she did. Looking back at Lopunny she let out a sigh of relief. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Look, she cleared the festival area already.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I made it!</span>\" She cheered. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Celebi, where are you?</span>\" Her gaze scanned the area until it landed on the malfunctioning Ferris wheel. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh, bummer! Did I leave you two in there?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't worry, I can fly!</span>\" Celebi yelled out as she got to her feet but her voice was too distant to reach the giant Lopunny's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hmm... I'm gonna have to come get you, won't I?</span>\" She pondered as she looked over the festival grounds. Both Celebi and Zorua shivered as they heard her. It was lucky nobody was hurt as she showed herself out but she was tempting fate if she decided to come back over. They watched as Lopunny put a finger up to her lip in thought. Meanwhile Celebi was getting ready to fly, despite what Lopunny decided to do. The giant Pokemon looked like she has come to a decision.</span></div></div>",

I've been like this for a week Celebi - this is hell!\" he cried in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looked at him pitifully, he was in the verge of tears... it was partly her fault if he was like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi got up and moved to the fox, grabbing him by his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What do you think I'm doing?</span>\" Celebi retorted as she started hovering.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We need to get Lopunny's attention.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficially worried about her friends, Lopunny walked away from the spinning tea cup ride and - carefully - made her way in a secluded place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Guys?!</span>\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of her head, Zorua and Celebi cried in pain - Lopunny's voice was too loud for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're dead...\" Zorua said desperately as Celebi flew higher in the air, headed for one of her friend's gigantic ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Quit being pessimistic!</span>\" the fairy yelled as she kept hovering higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a brown pillar of fur came down as a creamy ceiling filled the duo's eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi screamed as she avoided the giant finger by mere inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to understand that Lopunny was trying to locate them. With poor results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe... that finger was a help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua! We need to work together - grab Lopunny's finger!</span>\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua decided to comply and grasped the brown fur when Celebi flew closer to the finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Guys?</span>\" Lopunny's voice came again as the finger fidgeted a bit, before rising up in the sky at supersonic speed. Zorua and Celebi clinged for dear life as the finger was lifted off the bunny's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it reached a decent height, Celebi pulled Zorua back and flapped her wings, hovering at like 5000 ft from the solid ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua paled - a fall from here and it was over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi started to descend slowly, holding the fox tightly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hold on!</span>\" she shouted as she lowered herself to her destination - Lopunny's left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took quite some time, mostly because she had to avoid her friend's finger several other times, but she finally landed on top of the giant ear that traveled down Lopunny's back and stopped nearly at ground level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">LOPUNNY! WE'RE HERE!</span>\" Celebi shouted at top of her lungs, nearly deafening Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, he started shouting too,<br>\r\n\"LOPUNNY!\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the bunny didn't seem able to hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous - her ears are bigger than her head and she can't hear us!\" Zorua cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">LOPUNNY!</span>\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, the worried bunny seemed to hear something... just a faint sound, comparable to a pin falling... but she heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Celebi? Zorua?</span>\" she whispered, her finger moving on top of her left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi flew on top of it as it traveled down to Lopunny's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed in relief and so did his green companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny narrowed her eyes, but finally managed to locate the two nanoscopic pokemon on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">There you are! Aw, you look so cute~</span>\" she chimed, almost done destroying the ears of the unfortunate duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Lopunny, go home! We need a safe place!</span>\" Celebi cried.<br>\r\n\"Please be careful!\" Zorua added, remembering that Lopunny was a bit... airhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to their surprise, the bunny giantess seemed to hear them and quickly nodded her head, moving her free paw close to the other and gently dropping the nanoscopic pokemon on her palm, before holding her hand in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to lose sight of them. Most importantly, she had to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she tripped over her own feet, for the shrunken duo would be  the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked forward, each step Lopunny took causing the palm to tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Zorua, he was staring at the giant palm blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoved by a fit of sympathy, she moved closer to the fox.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't worry Zorua... we're safe...</span>\" she said, before gulping.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I hope...</span>\"</div></div>",

Her head reappeared shortly after she exited as she smiled at the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">See you later~</span>\" she said cheerfully as she exited again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's jaw hung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Lopunny wai-</span>\" the sound of the front door closing assaulted the ears of the two unfortunate, microscopic pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blinked, trying to process what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Your friend just left us alone at this size, didn't she?\" he asked incredulously while looking around the immense landscape that was Lopunny's blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny had managed to locate them - which, given her reputation as an airhead, was quite impressive - she had brought them back home without any accident - which was also very impressive - only to leave them alone in her house and go to the festival again?! That made no sense at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doomed...\" Zorua sourly said as he laid belly-down on top of the giant bed, looking at the green fairy in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sat down, looking deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few hours had been quite eventful for her. She had managed to locate Zorua, grew him back, made sure he ate and drank... and now, he was back to square one, and she along with him. Even worse, Lopunny had left them on top of her bed, whenever she got back she could simply lay down without remembering about the two. And for Zorua and Celebi would be the end - even though she could pick Zorua up and fly away, Celebi would have no chance of escaping the planet that was Lopunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy sighed, instinctively looking at her dark-type companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk to me until you find a way out of this mess.\" he rudely interrupted, turning his back to Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message was clear, he probably still hated her for the week on Lopunny... and for this whole accident of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time-traveler bit her lip, feeling bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Zorua deserved his punishment, she knew that this whole situation was all her fault. She shouldn't have called Lopunny in the first place. She felt desperation growing inside of her - was this what Zorua felt for the whole week? No... even worse, he felt desperation, hunger and thirst at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she felt horrible - was she going to suffer the same fate? If she didn't manage to grow them back up before Lopunny returned, things would get really rough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looked at Zorua. If the two of them wanted to get out of this situation alive, they needed to cooperate... and if they needed to cooperate, all the sour feeling between them had to get lost. At least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" Celebi tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua please...</span>\" she said, fluttering in front of the fox. He didn't even look at her, he was keeping his gaze low looking at an indistinct point behind the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua... talk to me...</span>\" she tried once more, her paws traveling under the fox's chin as she gently raised his head. He didn't fight back, but he didn't respond either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Zorua, I'm sorry for this whole thing... can we make peace...?</span>\" Celebi meekly attempted to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua didn't even blink, and she found that she couldn't blame him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of starvation, dehydration, lack of sleep, \u2018I'm sorry\u2019 couldn't exactly make Zorua flash his usual grin, telling \u2018That's alright, I forgive you\u2019...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type stared at the fairy, seeming bored by the whole thing. But Celebi knew, he was as desperate as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back tears, the time-traveler tried again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua... talk to me please... we need to find a way out of this situation, we need to work together... I did let you eat and drink, no?</span>\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua still didn't respond, seemingly deep in thought. He was totally ignoring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on Zorua... we've got to help each other... we've got...</span>\" she didn't finish, the feeling of guilt now too strong for her to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua suddenly found Celebi clinging to his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox was quite sure she was crying silently, he could tell by his fur feeling damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat told Zorua two things: one, having a girl crying on you isn't exactly the best thing ever; two, Celebi was truly sorry about what she did to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally looked at her, her minuscule body was shaken by sobs, her tears slid down her eyes and splashed onto Zorua's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type's heart seemed to open up a little - if she was truly sorry... could he still hate her in this particular situation...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Yes! Of course he could! That hateful green girl had left him in hell for a week! He wasn't going to let a few sweet words and some salt water sliding out her eyes melt his heart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua kept a neutral look on his face, while Celebi kept crying her hug tightening around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Celebi pulled off... Zorua felt pitiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much time had passed since she started crying? Her eyes went from bright blue to red and swollen, tears kept falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould he really deny her the chance to make peace...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please Zorua...</span>\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose two words were enough to shatter Zorua's feeble resistance. And, while not liking her, he discovered that, all of a sudden, he didn't hate her anymore. She had humiliated herself by crying in front of the fox... he guessed that it was quite enough for now. He'd make sure she was going to make it up to him later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay Celi. Let's make peace.\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Celebi's face brightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" she whispered, reaching forward to hug him again, but he hopped backwards, avoiding her arms which ended up grasping air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No hugs. No more hugs. We're not friends, I simply don't think I hate you. I just want to make it out of this situation alive.\" he bluntly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at him dejectedly, before wiping her tears with a paw and nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe supposed it was all she was getting from him now... she had his cooperation, it was good. She'd come to the subject \u2018friendship\u2019 later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two unfortunate pokemon went quiet for a while as they simply laid on the giant bed of Lopunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny giantess was still probably at the festiv-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">You two tinies~ I'm back~</span>\" the sound of a door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was coming inside the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sprang up in alert.<br>\r\n\"Celi! You need to grow us back, now! If she doesn't find us, we're doomed!\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi, who was laying down, sat upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well... it's been a few hours... let's just hope it works...</span>\" she mumbled hopefully, eyes glowing as she...</span></div></div>",

She had already grown him once, and he had promised to either stop pranking or make pranks less hurtful... but could she risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Zorua looked a lot more cute like that-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blushed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name \u2018Zorua\u2019 and the adjective \u2018cute\u2019 in the same sentence in her thoughts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's weird...</span>\" she shook her head,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Better focusing on growing back now...</span>\" she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, her eyes glowed, her arms spread and her head rose up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi began feeling very light-weight, using her size-changing ability always left her feeling like that; probably, she still hadn't gotten used to it (not that she had shrunken or grown anything in Zorua's week of \u2018inactivity\u2019).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the glow disappeared from her eyes without the fairy having made any progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on...</span>\" she said to herself, annoyed, as she tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to achieve a similar result - she could swear she had seen her surroundings shrinking a teeny tiny bit, but aside from that nothing was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, you gotta be kidding! I've grown Zorua, grown and shrunk Lopunny, and then I shrunk Zorua and me! It wasn't that much!... Was it?</span>\" she mused, wondering if it really was too much power for one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was her ability even malfunctioning? Perhaps... didn't she fully master it? Because it seemed like she was pretty good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed as, again, her eyes glowed of a soothing cyan color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the sensation take her body, whole her mind imagined herself, floating above the bed, growing back to her normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, and was surprised that it was actually working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yes!</span>\" Celebi chimed as she grew up... sadly, as soon as the growing began, it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked around, everything was still massive to her. But the bed was not a planet anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had to compare herself to something, she would tell she was the size of a small doll...  a very small doll. A far cry from her original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Celebi evoked her size-changing ability and focused it on herself, intent on growing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the cyan light didn't even show up this time, suggesting that doll-size was all she was getting for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed, then giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well... at least I'm taller than Zorua now!</span>\" she chimed to no one, before adopting a serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hmm... should I check on those two? Lopunny can be a bit... distracted at times... wouldn't want her to kill Zorua...</span>\" she mused out loud, feeling vaguely guilty for what the nanoscopic fox had gone through before of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who knew what Lopunny was doing to him right now, Celebi wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the bed and looked around, admiring her giant surroundings. She was tall enough to be at least seen and heard now, so she could take a moment to do as Lopunny told and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything to her was massive, but Celebi quickly discovered that she didn't mind... in fact, the way Lopunny's bed looked so gigantic to her was almost kind of amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention the rest of the bunny's room: her closet was an immense castle, her desk an endless, wooden plain, the poke-dolls that were scattered around the room were veritable mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't noticed before, but next to her was a gigantic, Zorua poke-doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smirked - Lopunny DID express her wish to meet the prankster. Was that why this thing was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, her mind went to Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clgreen\">I wonder if he's okay...</span></i>\u2019</span></div></div>",

She figured she owed it to Zorua to at least make sure he didn't get hurt...he'd probably been through enough by now to dissuade him from ever trying to pull a prank again at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did smirk at some of the things he was going through...but then thought back to the state he was in when she first restored him and frowned. Since then he'd also been a lot more serious than she'd known him to be, not a grin or jab in sight. Just stoicism or a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to bail him out, and with that flew through the door and went to search for Lopunny and Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to fly far to hear Lopunny's giggles though, and she made a sharp left towards Lopunny's living room...there she saw Lopunny giggling as she blew into her paw a bit, creating a torrent gale force for the nano sized fox on her enormous paw. He was using claws and teeth, with his eyes shut to hold on, and the giggling rang in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe he was in this hell again...but this time the bunny was aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hang in there Zorua, you're doing great!</span>\" Lopunny said, blissfully unaware of the intensity of the situation he was in right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi saw this and flew in front of Lopunny's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked up to see Celebi...looking as big as a mountain to him, though still nowhere near Lopunny's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi, hey! You grew yourself! Well grow me please!\" Zorua yelled, a twinge of desperation in his voice. Celebi looked to him, then back to Lopunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Look, I get that you're having a great time Loppy, but please...it's been a grueling time for us...him especially. He needs to take it a bit easy, why don't you head back to the festival, we'll wait for you?</span>\" Celebi said, trying to persuade her old friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">It's been forever since you called me Loppy...hmm...</span>\" Lopunny looked to the tiny black dot on her paw, then to the doll sized Celebi before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Sure, go for it~</span>\" Lopunny said with a giggle. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Just play nice you two little 'friends'~</span>\" She said in a tone that made Celebi think Lopunny was getting entirely the wrong idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's not-...sure, yeah, we'll go with that.</span>\" Celebi sighed, smiling as Lopunny shifted, completely rocking Zorua to the core as a psychic force took him into the smaller, but still quite large paws of Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...are you gonna grow me back?\" Zorua asked and Celebi smiled before shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sorry, it took all I had just to do this for myself...I think I need rest, then i'll try it again.</span>\" She said and Zorua groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny at this point was at the door, about to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Don't do anything to wild, i'll be back in a few hours. Have fun!</span>\" Lopunny cried before her door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank Arceus...\" Zorua said, glad she was gone before he turned his attention once again to the giant Celebi. \"So you can't grow me right now?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sorry, it's really a no go...truth be told i'm worried about being able to use that ability again at all right now...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gulped, the idea of spending the rest of his life like this...it wasn't something he wanted to confront at all. Then there was Celebi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea how to process the many emotions related to this pokemon that were swirling in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a question though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why rescue me?\" He said, a little bitter and Celebi looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I thought...you could use a break...now come on...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

You're practically struggling to not laugh at my face.\" Zorua stated, before sighing,<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm clueless how I feel about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi finally dropped her solemn expression to giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Feeling's mutual, buddy,</span>\" she said cheerfully as she sat down on Lopunny's couch.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good detective skills.</span>\" she praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad that won't pull me outta this...\" Zorua stated resignedly as he sat down as well, on top of Celebi's smooth palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celebi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I was... honest Zorua...</span>\" she said dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? About?\" the nanoscopic dark-type asked, feeling oddly calm now, despite the fact that Celebi, the dangerous and unpredictable Celebi, was a giant again to him. But... she had mentioned that she was kidding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sigh escaped Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Us.</span>\" she said, leaning back a bit, still holding the tiny fox to her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I... don't know if I'll ever be able to grow us to our normal sizes again...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gulped. She had said it once, and the scenario was already horrible; if she said it twice, it meant that she was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So? What do we do? Do we stay like this forever? How can we, Celebi?\" he asked,<br>\r\n\"I'm practically nothing! You're a doll!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded with a grave look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right; they couldn't even get out of this house like this: Zorua would be blown away by the slightest breeze, other pokemon would see Celebi herself and try all sorts of things with a living doll such as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... There's Lopunny</span>\" she offered. Zorua snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An air-head 'n a walking accident. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Watch your mouth...</span>\" Celebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And I... really don't know...</span>\" she admitted slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell between the two shrunken pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Promise me something.</span>\" Celebi suddenly said, drawing Zorua's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked down, avoiding his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">If I ever manage to grow us back... promise that you'll quit with pranks. I've had enough of this \u2018shrinking\u2019 you know...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you don't don't grow us back?\" Zorua questioned, causing Celebi to bite her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We'll... we'll see, okay? Now promise.</span>\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I repeat what I already said: either I'll quit or make them less hurtful... let's say, not to the traumatizing level, okay?\" he said, recalling a few pokemon running from his woods, scared to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Fair enough.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unexpected happened: Zorua was moved forward, right into Celebi's chest; her other paw joined the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blinked, then blushed. This was still the girl that sent him to hell twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go.\" he said calmly, starting to squirm to break free, guessing where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No...</span>\" the fairy responded,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You were right, you suffered enough. I want us to move on Zorua... to be friends,</span>\" she stated, a hint of guilt in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny dark-type opened his mouth to reply, but Celebi continued uninterrupted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And if not friends, let's be what we are: two unfortunate companions who gotta figure a way out of this mess.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua didn't reply to that. But neither he struggled anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Tinies~ I'm home~</span>\" a cheerful voice sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Zorua looked up as the monolithic Lopunny came into view, seeing her green friend hugging the nanoscopic Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">D'aww...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth shrunken pokemon blushed, and Celebi was quick to let go of Zorua, holding him in one paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">S-So? How was the festival?</span>\" Celebi asked, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny (as gently as she could) picked the doll-sized Celebi up in her fist and took her place on the couch, rocking Zorua's world with the mere movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go, letting the green fairy sit on her palm while Zorua breathed free air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Amazing!</span>\" Lopunny commented as she regarded her minuscule friend and her way-more-minuscule passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">And you? Did you two anything fun?</span>\" she hinted with a smirk, causing the two to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're a real-\" Celebi's paw rushed to Zorua's mouth. Muffled cries came from beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Lopunny, we're not like that! We're not even friends, remember? Punishment...?</span>\" she recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Yeah, but you're incredibly cute anyway.</span>\" she said, causing the flow of muffled insults to resume under Celebi's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So... what now?</span>\" the fairy asked to deviate Lopunny's mind from such line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit giantess grinned.</span></div></div>",

If she had to guess, dawn was a bit away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the events of the previous day to come back to her as she looked to the tiny dark fox sleeping in her grasp. He seemed to be at peace right now, she cracked a smile. He was kinda adorable when he wasn't being a jerk...and he said if he got back to normal he'd put a lid on his shenanigans...at least make them less of a mean thing when he got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned. If she could grow him...or herself for that matter. She struggled to get out of Lopunny's grasp but found that she was held fast. She sighed at this, but relented. Closing her eyes she reached into herself...to find that she felt like she had a bit of juice in her! Enough to grow at least one of them...but she still felt far weaker than she had yesterday before her power failed her...she frowned again. Rest was probably what she needed...she closed her eyes again, but had a hard time falling asleep.

Finally! She felt a shift as Lopunny got up...and that shift turned catastrophic as she was launched with Lopunny raising her arms fast to stretch, completely forgetting about Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Whoa!</span>\" Celebi shouted as the room spun, but she got her bearings in the air, sighing as she did. She looked down at the charge in her paws to see...he was still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wow...</span>\" She was impressed, but she did remember how exhausted he had been the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh, sorry Celi...guess I forgot.</span>\" Lopunny said, rubbing the back of her head. Celebi shook her head but smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No harm no foul...</span>\" She said as she fluttered back towards her giant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I'll go make breakfast!</span>\" Lopunny said as she got up, the ground pounding below her as she went out of the room, and Celebi winced, hearing a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I'm fine!</span>\" She heard her friend say, giggling and Celebi groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" She whispered to the fox in her paws. He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua.</span>\" She said more firmly and his eyes cracked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Myeah...?\" He said drowsily and Celebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey...i've got some good news...I think rest is all I need to recharge my ability...I think I can grow one of us a bit.</span>\" Zorua's eyes shot open at this as he stood in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...?\" He said, still tired, but very much at attention now. It was then that Celebi bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah...I think I have enough to grow you to my size...or me to normal.</span>\" Celebi said. Zorua looked down at her paws, dejectedly, both winced as they heard a crash from Lopunny. Zorua looked to the door, then to Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi, you swear I can trust you...no more hell games, no more...of that stuff?\" Zorua said. Celebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I promise Zorua...i'm done punishing you, I just want to make this right.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If...you were to grow yourself, could you keep me safe?\" He asked and Celebi's mouth opened wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Um...yes.</span>\" She said, surprised Zorua was going down this line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you grow yourself, we can get away from the...from your friend and her...ditzy tendencies.\" Zorua was trying to be nice about it. \"And I don't think I can handle much more of her carefree attitude towards this whole situation...so...\" Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow yourself and let's get out of here.\" He said and Celebi was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But if I grow and you stay this size...it might be harder for me to keep track of you...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said you could manage it.\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I mean...I should be able to protect you, but it's still such a size difference...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lopunny managed, I trust you.\" Zorua said, this surprised Celebi...Zorua seemed willing to trust her right now at least. Celebi made her decision.</span></div></div>",

Oh, Zorua, you're awake,</span>\" Lopunny's head peered from the doorway as she entered the room, holding a plate with two cups of juice, a few cookies and some berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large rabbit giggled awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hehehe, I think I broke a cup at some point but... hey, Zorua is bigger!</span>\" Lopunny exclaimed upon noticing Zorua's new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">D'aww, you were so cute when you were so tiny... but you're both so adorable~!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe declaration caused both the shrunken fairy and the shrunken fox to blush while Lopunny set the plate on top of her nightstand and sat down on the bed, making the duo to bounce from the shockwaves her rear caused upon impacting with the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Careful...</span>\" Celebi dizzily said,<br>\r\n\"We're dead...\" Zorua sighed in resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large Lopunny giggled again and took a single cookie, placing it in front of the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hey, I bet all the food in the world looks so big and tasty from your tiny sizes~</span>\" the bunny chimed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hm, yeah!

There was nothing to say, he thought, not after a week in Lopunny Hell. That was something that scarred him for life, he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi seemed to notice the uneasiness emanated by her companion and hurried to change subject,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So, Lopunny, any plans for today?

Frightened faces.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wh-Wha...</span>\" she mutters breathlessly as she looks at something in distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloud of dust. As it nears the festival, Celebi notices that it's actually a herd of Tauros. Heading straight for the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was stumbling away to find somewhere safe to hide.<br>\r\nIn confusion, Celebi feels something tugging on her arm. She looks around to see... an oddly calm Lopunny.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Celebi, we need to get away!</span>\" she says, dragging Celebi away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny stops on top of a small hill.

Zorua snickers even more.<br>\r\n\"Oh~ your friend Celebi told me to tell you she went ahead. She also said you should catch up with her at the festival~\" he laughs maniacally.<br>\r\n\"That idiot even thanked me! Would you believe it?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stares at him breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Celebi!\" he said, pointing to the ruined festival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does as told, noticing the Tauros running through the town... without causing any damage at all. One of them passed right through a building. Zorua's eyes glow, and some windows around the town shatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to make sure~\" he snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the illusion was real enough for the running pokemon, as they kept going, trying to find safe sports from the illusionary herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stares at them without moving or talking, mouth and eyes wide open. She spots Lopunny among the crowd. She looks scared as she runs, occasionally tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, they say \u2018Revenge is sweet\u2019. Man, are they right!\" Zorua snickers as he observes the scene, remembering how he was tortured during his stay with Lopunny... although she was unaware of him. Nonetheless, payback is sweet for the dark type fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny is scared to death, and Celebi is suffering from watching the startled town. Zorua grins madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the best prank he ever pulled! And he got his revenge, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as much as he enjoyed the 'show', he quickly recalls that Celebi would be furious when she recovers from the shock... and she would surely shrink him to a nanoscopic dot again if he didn't get away soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickers again before turning around.<br>\r\n\"Now, if you'll excuse, I'll be on my way! Oh, and don't bother to show your face to me ever again!\" he states, starting to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stands still, before slowly turning around to look at the leaving fox.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua.</span>\" she quietly calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Zorua asks, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscovering Celebi with a glare and glowing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua tensed up.<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" he seethed as he stood on his hind legs, before slamming his forelegs on the ground, a wave of pure darkness forming as Zorua performed Night Daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was knocked back as the darkness blinded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was able to see again, she noticed Zorua running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh no, <i>you</i> don't!</span>\" she snarled as she gave chase.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't let it slide, neither she could consider it even between her and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew what she was going to do. He would be shrunk down again, she would make him her pet for Arceus knew how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Celebi got away from the village as she moved towards the forest Zorua resides in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clgreen\">Coming to get you Zorua...</span></i>\u2019 she thought to herself as she finally got to the edge of the forest. She gave a deep sigh, before venturing into the dark forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi floats around, not able to see much in darkness - the forest was so thick that moonlight barely seeped through the vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stopped to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua.</span>\" she called out firmly, masking the great fear derivating from the fact that she was all alone in a dark forest... alone with the scoundrel she was searching for, and he was nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated around, looking in all directions to try and spot the dark type in darkness... something that could be compared to trying to spot a specific blade of grass in a grassy field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Z-Zorua... Come on out!

If that's you, y-you're only making things worse... come out!</span>\" the fairy repeated as she floated back... letting out a cry of fear as her back bumped into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hastily floated back to check behind her, and sighed in relief when she saw that it was just a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd paled as she saw a dark face staring at her with a maniacal smirk from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Celebi let out a cry as she hastily backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she suddenly found the ground beneath her feet missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scream of terror, Celebi sank into the fake grassy floor and fell into a quite deep pit, hitting her head on the ground. The fairy dizzily looked up...weird...from this angulation, she noted, the leaves on the trees didn't seem like leaves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi urgently realizes that it was some kind of green sheet hanging from the tree branches. And it looked like it was going to break...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Celebi predicted, the sheet falls from the branches, releasing countless colorful balloons that fall straight into the pit, hitting the poor fairy, splashing her with mysterious liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried her best to get away from the barrage, but she couldn't get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last balloon hit her. Celebi meekly opened her eyes, noticing that she was covered in paint... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she looked up again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to see a bucket falling straight on her, showering her in cold water while also hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, she heard it. That devilish laughter that would hunt her in her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the predictable prank, I didn't have much time to prepare it... but it worked nonetheless!\" she heard him saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew all along you were coming...

And she had definitely enough of Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's eyes glowed as she focused on her target... only to find there were two Zorua... four... eight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared confused - which one was the real Zorua?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrink me now.\" he told, before shooting another Shadow Ball at his opponent... several Shadow Balls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Celebi flew in the air and dodged the multiple attacks, the real one causing another explosion.

The fairy screamed, enraged, as she threw him into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua hit the trunk, hard, but landed on all fours as he glared at the fairy, who was rapidly approaching him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi attempted to slap her opponent, but he stepped aside and quickly moved behind her, pushing his forelegs on her back and shoving her into the tree and starting to stomp on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi cried in pain and rage, as she used psychic again and pushed Zorua away, before hastily getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't about punishing him anymore, she briefly thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither she won, or he won. And the winner was going to decide the fate of the loser...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua watched as his opponent flew close to him, her green paw slapping him across the face. He growled and bit the paw that slapped him, his fangs sinking deep into the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi cried in pain, her cry echoing around the deserted forest as she tried to remove her paw from the mouth of Zorua. But the fox didn't have any intention of letting go, blood starting to pour from Celebi's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's foot rose up as she kicked Zorua in the chest, causing him to finally let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at her own paw, which was bleeding pretty bad. She snarled, and used psychic on Zorua again. The fox hovered in midair, flailing helplessly as Celebi launched him downwards with all her psychic strength, throwing him back into the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox landed roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before he could get up, Celebi was on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer paws got a hold of his throat as she started choking him. Zorua coughed as he gasped for air. He tried to fight back... but was far too exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to pass out, Celebi let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, his vision blurry, the dark type noticed a familiar glow... he saw her growing to a monolithic height before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he stopped shrinking. And Celebi's paw came down on him, pinning him down, the other paw rising in the air menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua got the gist - he was about to receive the final blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's paw shook in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\" Zorua said. She looked at him - he was bruised, scratched and in a pretty rough shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it!\" Zorua repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at herself - she was still bleeding, she had bruises all over her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this over a stupid prank...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike deprived of energy, Celebi's arm fell. And so did she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped on her knees, before collapsing on the ground. And then, the fairy started crying loudly, tears running down her dark eyelids as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at her in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" he couldn't finish as Celebi pulled him in a hug, her bleeding paw dropping blood on his black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I-I...</span>\" she couldn't speak properly as she kept crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it... she was about to become a murderer, just because of two dumb pranks Zorua pulled on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called herself smart, but was about to make the biggest mistake of her life! She had let Lopunny torture him for a week, she had knocked him out - something that was deserved - and in the end she attempted to kill him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, who was the real jerk between the two?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua watched as the fairy cried, laying down on the bottom of the pit, hugging him to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi cried for a good while more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she slowly sat upright and started sobbing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I-I... I-I'm s-so-sorry! I d-di-didn't want it t-to go like t-this!</span>\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua huffed weakly, sore from all the hits he received and confused from Celebi's weird behavior.<br>\r\n\"Little late for that.\" he said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't going to let the tears of this green girl melt his heart. She had attempted to kill him twice over a stupid prank, and he wasn't going to forgive nor forget that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at him, tears falling on top of the fox's head, mixing with the blood coming from her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">B-But it's not too l-late to make things right...</span>\" she bitterly said, one paw leaving Zorua as she wiped her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddya mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sobbed again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">This... was far too much...</span>\" she said shakily.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And... your pranks... my foolish actions... this nullifies them completely...</span>\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell they're nullified!\" Zorua shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yes they are... Zorua, I didn't mean to do all this...</span>\" she bitterly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, you did.\" the fox coldly said. Celebi hugged with more strength, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know... and this will never be deleted... but we can... we can start over Zorua... be friends...</span>\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? You? Friends?\" he inhaled.<br>\r\n\"NEVER!\" he shouted at top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he pretty much expected Celebi to crush him to paste... but he saw her letting a couple more tears fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" she whispered, exhausted and exasperated.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm honest... I'm sorry about this all... I should have had better judgement... I should have been more responsible...  this is all my fault...</span>\" she bitterly admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox looked at her - she was desperate. Even in darkness, he could see her eyes completely red from tears, sadness in them. Celebi was genuinely sorry for her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua seemed to soften at the declaration. He remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fairy continued.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know... I'll never make it up to you for this... but, let's move on...

Was he being punished? I suppose he saw it that way, which was well enough in her eyes but she was genuine about trying to make peace with him...she wanted to know more about him too. If she could get to the root of him maybe...he'd stop with the pranks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered calling Lopunny, or maybe one of her other friends like Bellossom and getting one of them to help with him too but...she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would deal with him alone, she thought as she looked at her bandaged paw where he bit her. It was deep...not deep enough to need stitches luckily, though she could just heal it a bit if it did come to that. She considered healing herself or him but decided against it. Both of them probably deserved their lumps and bruises right now. She'd at least feed him...he hadn't eaten in at least a week and him being a jerk or not, that part was her fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them had been jerks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started stirring and she turned her attention fully to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned as he sat up, he felt like he'd been hit by a charging Rhyhorn...or 10. He looked around, realizing that he was small before memories came back to him and he looked up at the towering behemoth that was Celebi...with contempt in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Before you say anything about what's been going on, what do you want to eat?</span>\" She asked with a gentle tone. Starting this way might open him up to talking at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, still glaring. \"Meat.\" Was all he said and she nodded before getting up and went to her kitchen. He looked around and winced before trying to take a good look at himself. He had bruises and scratches in various places...some of the nastier ones were crudely bandaged too. He supposed Celebi did that. Trying to make peace huh? Yeah right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back with a small slice of pepperoni that looked to be about as big as Zorua...maybe bigger. Just a topping for a pizza he supposed...she set it down in front of him and he took a bite before digging into it ravenously. He was finally filling his belly. Celebi watched him, he certainly had the look of a half starved pokemon and the way he tore into it...she looked at him with full pity in her eyes, not that he noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit, but soon he backed off of the pepperoni...he had eaten probably a fourth of it...maybe even a third. It was an impressive amount considering his size. She held a cup of water at the edge of the desk, low enough for him to lower his head down if he wanted a drink, a silent offer to him. He approached and thirstily drank from it for what must've been a minute as well before backing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Feeling better?</span>\" She asked. He grunted in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah.\" He finally offered as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...about this tiny war we've been having...</span>\" He laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A war? I pranked you a few times, pranked a town and you nearly killed me twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Then you attacked me.</span>\" She said quietly and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won that...could've finished me off.\" He said and she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">If you had won...would you have finished me off?</span>\" He laughed at that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me win? I don't think there's a world where that would've happened...even without that shrinking ability of yours, you're a legendary Celebi...on a different level than me.\" He said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Doesn't answer my question...</span>\" She said and he looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know, I don't think things through well. Doesn't matter anyway, we're here now, so...what are you going to do with me?\" He asked and she bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...I want to make peace, okay? I'm serious. If you hate me...I guess that's fine. I just want to try though...maybe get to know you?

Alone, crying...after leaving his dad. The dad that tormented him. Talked down to him. Insulted him. Beat him on certain nights when things didn't go his way. Starved him when he felt Zorua needed 'motivation'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he came to this place...happy families, smiling kids, and him...alone, ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hated them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to tell you.\" He said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What about...your parents?</span>\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" He yelled, surprising maybe even himself, her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked on the verge of tears.</span></div></div>",

Celebi quickly softened her grip as she headed out of her room and into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was gently placed on top of the sink, which Celebi started to fill with warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Ain't I using the tub?\" Zorua asked, not really caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Please, let's not be stupid. It'd be lethal...</span>\" Celebi said in a voice that made her exasperation clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tired, she wanted to sleep badly. Only Zorua was keeping her from going to sleep. It was still very early... Celebi huffed. This was <i>not</i> how she spent the dark hours... she was going to wake up late tomorrow, she knew it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne who would have seen her and Zorua from outside wouldn't have believed the sight of two blood-soaked teens, one doll-sized and the other covered in scratches apparently because of a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy sighed, noticing the water reaching a decent level for the fox to bathe. She turned it off, before focusing on Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently gripped him and started removing the bandages from his body. The dark type remained still - he knew, a wrong move and it was going to sting like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi successfully removed the bandages and unceremoniously threw them aside.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Get in.</span>\" she instructed, before opening a closet, reaching for some new bandages. She had to change hers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked into veritable lake below. He saw his reflection - he was tired, sore, bruised badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This happens when you challenge a legendary...\" he mumbled bitterly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Though you put up quite the fight... you're strong for an unevolved pokemon.</span>\" Celebi chimed, having heard his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the fairy, she was sitting on a stool, busily removing the bandage around her wrist... but she was smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're just hoping to get on my good side. Nice try.\" Zorua said as he leaped in the water without saying a word more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed, while Zorua surfaced and grunted in pain, feeling the hot water penetrating his wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, it stings!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time the whole day, Celebi giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zorua, he soon got used to the feeling of the hot water and floated motionless in the water, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi wanted to kill him... Over a few, stupid, <i>harmless</i> pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had hurt no one, she had almost killed him mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... she was trying to make things right... she said she wanted to be his friend... she was taking care of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gritted his teeth - it didn't matter! She still tried to kill him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... But she didn't... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua softened and let out a sigh... perhaps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould he give her a chance to make peace...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought was interrupted by the fairy giantess,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Are you done?</span>\" she broke the silence, peering into the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed, and gently grabbed him from the water, before placing him on top of the sink again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...

He needed to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded, gently grabbing the fox and returning to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now? Are you going to try to \u2019punish\u2019 me again?\" he asked. Celebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're stubborn... I want to make peace...</span>\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy sat on the bed, exhausted and exasperated at the same time.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...

She had almost seen a pokemon die before of her actions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type's world shook as Celebi sat uptight, one of her paws leaving him as she wiped her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inhaled and exhaled deeply in a attempt to calm herself.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">C-Come on Zorua... you're alive... nothing else matters...</span>\" she said, using a finger to gently wipe his eyes too. She gently slid her finger under his eyelids, careful not to cause irreversible damage to the eyeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua started sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... I'm fine...\" he said, before inhaling sharply and exhaling heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the giant fairy.<br>\r\n\"... W-What now Celi?\" he asked shakily, mustering all the calm he could.<br>\r\n\"... You ain't got funny ideas, right?\" he then inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at him in silence, not sure if to smile or slap him again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Zorua, you almost died. I'm done with funny idea.</span>\" she spoke very softly, before adding:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And what now? I'll tell you - you're not leaving this house until you're stable again.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's eyes shrunk - she wanted to keep him confined!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Can't y-you can simply let me go...? I'll be fine...\" he told. Celebi got up in response.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Forget it.</span>\" she said firmly, before wiping a few other tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... For now, what about I grab something to eat? Then, I'll need to change your bandages again.</span>\" she spoke very gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed and laid on the bed.<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" he muttered, resigned to the idea that he wasn't going anywhere... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded and stumbled out of her room, still visibly shaken by what just happened. She even tripped at some point, and had to grab the door to not fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to the room a few minutes later, holding a plate of meat - Zorua seemed to like it - cheese and crackers. A glass of water flew behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox noted that she was hardly holding the plate - it probably still hurt her where he bit her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully she sat down, setting the plate between her and Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimidly, he stepped forward and started munching on some of the meat, while Celebi made herself a meat and cheese cracker sandwich, before starting eating too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ate in complete silence. Zorua felt partially better after having filled his stomach for the second time after a week of starvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, nothing was left on the plate, which Celebi put on her nightstand , before grabbing a hold of Zorua and walking into her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully removed his bandages and distractedly looked at hers - they were stained red again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed as she carefully started to remove her own bandage, looking once again at the two deep red lines in her green skin... well, that wound was partly her fault. Sure, Zorua bit her, but when she kicked him to free herself, his fangs slid down her paw, creating two deep wounds that traveled down her wrist, paw and took two of her three fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched it and gritted her teeth - it stung... but she was lucky, she guessed. If back then she had opted to hit Zorua with her knee under the jaw, her paw would have been cut off... that would have been far worse, she thought with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Zorua grinned - he had managed to do something like that to a legendary... he felt slightly proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, be proud of yourself, because this. Hurts. A. Lot.</span>\" Celebi said between playful and lecturing, noticing him smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... sorry about that... I was angry...\" he said, shivering slightly at the sensation of cold air penetrating his body through his own wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... We both were.</span>\" she said, grabbing a bottle of disinfectant and a few clean bandages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua eyed the bottle with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi re-entered her bedroom, delicately holding Zorua in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently set the freshly bandaged fox on top of the bed as grabbed the untouched glass of water from the nightstand, drinking half of it, before offering it to Zorua, who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi grabbed him gently and psychically lowered him into the glass. Zorua took a few sips, the water sliding down his throat and into his full stomach. It was nice to feel stuffed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Celebi lifted him into her paws again, placing the glass back onto the nightstand .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the giant fairy set her tiny companion on her bed, and laid belly-down in front of him, looking exasperated. It was hard to blame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Feeling better?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded. He looked reluctant for a few seconds, before finally giving an actual reply,<br>\r\n\"Thanks Celi... for everything.\" he said, showing his first hint of sympathy towards the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now Zorua... what do you say of we... get to know each other? It could be nice... y'know, trying to be your friend?</span>\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed - he saw this coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You don't want to hear it. My... past is dark. An endless suffering Celi... trust me, you're better off without hearing it.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Celebi didn't relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... I want to know you Zorua. Tell me every last detail.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe meekly looked at her.<br>\r\n\"... Why?\" he asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody ever asked, they all only hated him. And he hated them all right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled, and gently started to caress the fox. This was the most gentle action she did since it all began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Because we're friends.</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Celebi giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I sure do~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, but cheered up to some better mood as he was handed a giant cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this size had its advantages, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie went on for two endless hours... and, even worse, Celebi didn't let him eat more than the single cookie she gave him, telling him that \u2018you'll have tummy-ache if you eat more\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, the movie was over, the credits were rolling on the screen. Celebi yawned, and turned off the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wasn't it beautiful Zorua?</span>\" she asked. The fox looked at her, he was quite sure there were sparkles in her eyes, her mouth wide open and a smile spread across her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"Want a honest answer? I kinda drifted off after I ate the cookie...\" he admitted, stretching on his perch on Celebi's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted, her chest fell and her belly rose as she inhaled deeply, before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bedtime.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green giantess got up from the couch and walked back inside her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed into the bed, placing Zorua on top of her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>His world shook again as she carelessly leaped in her bed, turning off the lamp on her nightstand, trapping Zorua in darkness for yet another night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Why are you so... useless?!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks stung as he slapped him across the face. He cried.<br>\r\n\"I-I'm t-trying!\" he shouted in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">That's not enough! When are you going to just evolve and make me proud? I'll tell ya kid - that ain't happening!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad I-\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox panted as he snapped out of it, once again looking at Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Again, huh?\" he asked, Celebi nodded. He felt a strong pressure, Celebi was hugging him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Zorua, if this doesn't stop in the next days, I'm bringing you to a doctor.</span>\" she said firmly, before getting up, leaving the fox alone in the room as she left, returning after a short bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">For now, eat this.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua bit the piece of cookie she gave him, the sweet flavor of chocolate slightly comforting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed as she climbed onto her bed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But for now, I'm giving you a better way to sleep.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua could reply, he was grabbed by the fairy, who hugged him to her chest and giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sleep tight~</span>\" she said to the blushing fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type sighed loudly, before leaning his head against the warm wall that was Celebi's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, he fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

At least that part of taking care of him was easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped he ultimately decided to stay with her...if he went back out there, who knows what that could mean.

She cut off a tiny bit of egg and tore off a bit of toast and set them down in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Eat up, okay?</span>\" She said before she started eating from the plate. He slowly bit into the food, enjoying getting something in his belly again. He'd never take that for granted at this point. Celebi silently ate as she eyed him on occasion. She wanted to help him, she truly did, but she was worried about his mind. She hoped she hadn't shattered it...especially learning more about who Zorua REALLY was. He didn't need to be punished, from the start someone should've tried to reach out to him...maybe she should've been that someone before it escalated to a fight that nearly ended in her killing him...she shook her head. What was done was done and right now they both needed to move on from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So Zorua...what were you thinking of for us to do today?</span>\" She asked gently and he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...Celebi, if you're worried then...please don't, i'm fine, alright?\" He didn't feel comfortable with Celebi trying to coddle him.

She simply smiled at him as she set the plate on her nightstand and picked up the dark fox in her paws. She looked him over. '<span class=\"clgreen\">He's getting his weight back...he doesn't look nearly as emaciated as he did a few days ago...good.</span>' She thought.

He did a damn number on her paw. Something that on one level he was proud of considering that not only was she waaaaay out of his weight class in terms of power, but he felt pretty vindicated in doing it...but she was still dealing with it and taking care of making things right with Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Celi...for real, sorry about the paw.\" He said and she smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah...it hurts, but I certainly hurt you too...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...I still want to say sorry.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's very sweet Zorua, i'm sorry too.</span>\" She was happy that slowly, he did seem to be coming out of his shell more and more. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now let's get this over with okay?</span>\" She said as she started to undo his bandages. He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for this to sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed in relief when all was said and done and he was rebandaged. Celebi was holding him to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You alright?</span>\" She asked and he nodded. On some level he admitted to himself as coddled as he felt...it was a nice change of pace. Nothing he had ever really experienced. She was being nice and...her cuddling him last night in bed...he felt safe and warm...was he really starting to consider her offer? It was better than the forest ground he supposed...not to mention his 'bed' with his dad...that stupid carpet...His thoughts were interrupted however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So what do you want to do today Zorua?</span>\"</span></div></div>",

People at school love me but...</span>\" She smiled brightly, but it faltered a bit at the end. Zorua looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...?\" He questioned and she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...You told me about your dad so I guess it's only fair.</span>\" She muttered as she fluttered into her living room and sat on the couch. She set Zorua in her lap, facing her stomach and he looked up at her far off face.

Bookworm nice pokemon that happens to be able to time travel? Seems like a primo pokemon to befriend if you have something to gain.\" He said frankly and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">My mom said...don't use your powers to impress and don't be peer pressured into doing something wrong with them...to be honest, a lot of guys have hit on me too that i'm pretty sure were more or less interested in just what I could do. Like...if I were unchanged in terms of personality, interests, all of that, but was say...a rattata...would any of those pokemon still talk to me?</span>\" She said and Zorua looked at her eyes. She seemed genuine in saying this so he was going to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"Yeah I doubt it, I don't know every pokemon in this village, but I could imagine the pokemon you're describing seeing a golden ticket to use time travel for something to help them out or maybe having a powerful friend so no one messed with them.\" Celebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Lopunny...and another few of my friends...they never bring up what I can do, never ask.

I th-\" He blinked for a second and then looked around. Celebi heard rain outside and looked at her window before looking down at Zorua again to see him staring at the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She was showering again. The dreaded part of the day. The water droplets that crashed like bombs and created mini oceans all around. He had almost drowned many a time. He still didn't quite know how he survived this part of the ordeal. He would see a hair strand and snatch at it for all his worth as the rapid oceans descended into the abyss below Lopunny. If he went down there he would surely die. But he needed to survive, he needed to get home to his forest...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared sadly at the dark fox in her lap and considered something she hadn't before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe COULD time travel...she could go back, and prevent herself from doing this to him! Right!? It was so obvious she really couldn't believe it slipped her by before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be ideal, he wouldn't be having these episodes anymore, he'd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd be a jerk again. He'd prank more. He'd still be alone in his forest, bitter at every other pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he'd be healthy...or as healthy as a homeless pokemon can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip and looked at her wounded paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could find a way to befriend him even going back in time, but...knowing what she knew about him now she'd have to be tough on him again probably to get him to open up. Could she bring herself to do that to him again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe...living with what they did was better, and she could find a way to end these episodes of his on her own, or maybe get a doctor to help.</span></div></div>",

She heard snickering and quickly hid, knowing who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering through the leaves of a bush, Celebi spotted Zorua, with a rope in his mouth; said rope was tied to a familiar bucket, the bucket that would give the green light to a chain of events that would lead Celebi to almost kill Zorua twice and Zorua to cause her a deep wound in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" she murmured as he hid behind a tree, ready to pull the rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew this was a signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi turned her head, noticing... herself, head buried in a book as she walked through the forest, coming right the way where the bucket full of feathers, honey and berries waited to make her look like a Pidove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Celebi from the future couldn't let it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hastily but silently moved through the bushes, until the past Celebi walked right in front of her hiding spot, in which point her arm darted out of the bush she was hiding in and got a hold of the oblivious fairy's ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past Celebi looked up from her book, startled, and glanced down at the bush... a pair of blue eyes and a green face greeted her from behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Celebi...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw pulled her into the bush, causing her book to fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Celebi stared at each other in silence for a minute, before the one from the past dared to ask,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So ehm... past or future...?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other fairy giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Future.</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer past counterpart nodded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay... so, what kind of catastrophe am I going to have to prevent?</span>\" she asked jokingly, giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Celebi raised her bandaged paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast Celebi stopped laughing instantly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh... how?</span>\" she asked, suddenly feeling an itch in her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Do you see that snickering fox with the bucket over there?</span>\" she asked as the past fairy peered from the bushes, effectively noticing Zorua behind a tree, with a rope tied to a bucket full of mysterious substances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Zorua? Zorua did that to you?</span>\" she asked, shocked. True, Zorua's pranks could be exaggerated sometimes, but he never actually hurt anyone... too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded, and her past counterpart frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That bucket is for you, it was for me,</span>\" Celebi explained.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I shrunk Zorua down and-</span>\" the eyes of the past Celebi lit up at the revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Shrunk?! Did it work then?!</span>\" she asked excitedly, Celebi pressing her finger against her mouth, silently telling her past self to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... You'll regret it later.</span>\" the fairy sourly revealed to a confused past Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Listen, Zorua isn't who you think he is... he had problems with his dad, okay? He needed compassion, not vengeance... and sadly, I used the size-changing ability to get revenge.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Celebi from the past nodded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What did you do to him?</span>\" she asked, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi meekly looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I almost killed him.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past Celebi put her paws over her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded dejectedly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... I made him so tiny that I couldn't see him and sent him with Lopunny for a week... when I grew him back up, he pranked me again, before it all ended in a fight in which I... almost killed him again... now, poor Zorua suffers panic attacks and almost died before my eyes because of it...</span>\" she revealed shamefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">B-But...</span>\" the Celebi from the past stuttered, unable to believe it. If it was someone else telling that story, she wouldn't have believed it. But, coming from her own lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Listen... avoid that bucket, shrink Zorua, whatever... but don't call Lopunny. And don't shrink him to a nanoscopic size.</span>\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">N-No... I'll ask him if he wants to talk instead...</span>\" past Celebi stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded, before smiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Personally, I offered him to come living with me... us, he's homeless! I suggest you make that offer too... he's so cute at times!</span>\" she said cheerfully, while the past fairy looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Okay, if I manage to get him to open up, I'll make that offer.</span>\" she said, and Celebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well... gotta go now!</span>\" she said, getting up from the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Thanks... bye...</span>\" the Celebi from the past said as the future one glowed green, disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone grass-type sighed, before getting up and grabbing her abandoned book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to confront Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi returned to her own timeline, eager to find out what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself out of her front door... her bandage was gone, her wounded paw was not wounded anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled - so the fight was avoided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy walked inside - she was going to see Zorua later. She wondered if her past self had made him the offer, and if he accep-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was there on her couch, shrunken, staring straight at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, right before he spoke, she wondered what effects the time travel-had on him.</span></div></div>",

This was easily the happiest she had seen him...ever. At least happy without a hint of malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bandages were gone...he also looked healthy. Not too thin, his eyes had a spark from what she could tell. He seemed...normal. Well, aside from being the size of a doll at least. She looked at her own paw. No bite. No bandage. No pain. She felt relieved at that before smiling back at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had worked. She had undone her mistake and somehow managed to befriend Zorua in what she imagined to be a cleaner fashion. The only question was how, but she'd fill in the blanks over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, just had to go out for a bit. Why, you miss me?</span>\" She asked teasingly and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's kinda boring just hanging out on this couch without you.\" He said as he looked down shyly. Not a side to him she had ever pictured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sorry.</span>\" Was all she said as she approached the couch and him. She gently picked him up and sat down. Not missing a beat she set him on her lap and looked down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So...what do you want to do today?</span>\" She smiled and he looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? My choice?\" He said and she nodded. \"I'd ask to go out to the forest but...it's raining I know.\" He said and didn't much care to get wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...TV is fine. Just NOT romance again!\" He said and she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But it's so cute~</span>\" She chimed at him and he just gave her a bit of a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I fell asleep the last two times you did that!\" He said and she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Fine fine, i'll find something else that ISN'T horror either.</span>\" She said and he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that would be fun to watch...\" He pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Not for me it wouldn't be.</span>\" she said before finding some sort of action movie on TV and leaving it on. She wasn't much paying attention to it, mostly to the tiny fox in her lap. She needed to figure out a few things. What did he know about her right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what did she know about him? Did she know about his dad right now? And how did the shrinking and befriending happen? Was he staying with her forever? Or was this temporary? She didn't know these things...but she figured the best thing to do would be to figure out what he was to her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured she'd ask him and hope he didn't think it was too strange. She didn't want to admit to him that she had altered the timeline from one where she nearly killed him twice and left significant trauma on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So Zorua...</span>\" She started and he looked away from the TV for a moment. \"Hmm?\" He inquired quizzically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What...are you to me?</span>\" She asked smiling and he rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really gonna make me say it?\" He said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" He said and she hesitated for a second. She had made him say it before huh? She must've like to reinforce whatever he was right now...which might be a good thing, change from being a homeless vagrant and delinquent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine, i'm your...</span></div></div>",

Was she...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the shocked legendary thought about the fight they had... she hated him in that moment... but all her harsh feelings had evaporated when he almost died, started having panic attacks, opened up to her, started acting in a friendlier way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Arceus...</span>\" the fairy murmured upon discovering that she actually <i>had</i> feelings for the fox!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did those even come from!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi felt sick, how was she going to face the fox again? She wasn't sure of what to do... agree to be Zorua's girlfriend...? Or simply - gently - reject him? Perhaps... should she have explained the whole thing that actually never happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... No. That would have sounded too weird, she decided... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, what could she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled over her mirror, seeking some answer in her reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Celebi decided that she had to talk to Zorua, make up an excuse and discover how it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shocked, she opened the door and walked out from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua perked up as Celebi returned to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" she said, walking to the couch and sitting beside the fox, blushing heavily.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... How did it happen?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at her.<br>\r\n\"What?\" he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi suddenly got an idea and adopted a smirk, which masked her internal storm of emotions.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">How did you become my boyfriend? Say it.</span>\" she told confidently, Zorua huffing heavily - how many times did that question come up? - as he looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Celi, we've been dating for a week, I remember it... there's no need, really...\" he meekly opposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi's look told him that she wasn't going to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But I want to hear it again... actually, tell me, what happened since the day of that prank?</span>\" she asked, he looked at her with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Celi, last time I talked about it, you told me that you didn't want to hear it anymore... it was two days ago...\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... I've changed my mind.</span>\" Celebi hastily responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're acting weird, girl...\" he mused out loud. Celebi internally screamed, feeling like this was going to end with her dropping this charade and telling him why the two of them ended up dating... even though she still wasn't sure about how she felt for the dark-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Zorua shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You avoided my bucket, remember? I was trying to run, but you showed me that shrinking ability of yours... by shrinking <i>me</i>,\" he explained.<br>\r\n\"Then, you asked if I needed to talk, because you felt like I wasn't who I wanted to show I was... I didn't actually talk, but you insisted and I wasn't in the condition of telling \u2018no\u2019 so I... told you about my dad... and you offered me to come living with you, but with your mom around, I had to be this size and pretend to be a doll...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded in understanding - so her past self made him talk, huh? It made sense, shrinking him probably lead him to open up more easily because he couldn't fight back... she practically forced him to talk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a bit brutal, but it lead to him dating her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, was she sure about this...? She didn't know yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Go on Zorua,</span>\" she said, and he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Celi...\" he complained, but she quickly intercepted him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Do it or you're... huh... sleeping on the floor tonight,</span>\" she hesitated, but it worked anyway, she judged as he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... but I don't want to tell it anymore...\" he said in annoyance.<br>\r\n\"... I accepted to come here, you took great care of me and I...\" he blushed.<br>\r\n\"... I told you how I felt because you noticed that I was \u2018acting weird\u2019...\" he sighed deeply, but suddenly approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Celebi's surprise, he started nuzzling her side lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Celi... you said you were giving me a chance...\" he said, happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi opened her mouth to speak, but he sighed, interrupting her before she even talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah yeah, I know what happens now... I know what ya wanna hear... well, Celi, thank you... for becoming my girlfriend,\" he said, embarrassed but evidently happier than she ever saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he suddenly looked up. Celebi was blushing, mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Celi, it's only been a week,\" Zorua repeated,<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep asking such questions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at him, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear, now she either decided to play along and be Zorua's girlfriend - one thing leads to another, who knew, maybe he was really an interesting pokemon - or she explained him how they got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" she said upon having taken her final decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked the dark-type up as she spoke again...</span></div></div>",

Why was this so hard? \u2018I'm sorry Zorua, I don't know...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe <i>his</i> Celebi truly loved him, but now she took her place... she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She</i> was his Celebi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looked at Zorua, he was serious. And she made a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might not have known about the events of the past week and a half, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clgreen\">Aw, what the hell...</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua, who was still being held in front of Celebi's green face, contemplated what Celebi had told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't the Celebi he knew until this very morning... she had left, and another Celebi took her place, a Celebi that had almost killed him twice, a Celebi that he had hurt... that timeline must've been rough for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't care. In his timeline, none of those things happened; he loved Celebi, and he wanted his girlfriend back, no matter if he had to win her over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua's musings were interrupted as he found out that there was no need to win her over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi, blushing furiously, leaned forward, her lips suddenly touching Zorua, whose cheeks flared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was kissing him, flushing bright red as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held the kiss for thirty seconds, before pulling off, leaving Zorua blushing but beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world suddenly felt tight as the fairy hugged him to her chest tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I take it you're still my girlfriend?\" the fox asked, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded, a sweet smile appearing on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... I was until now, no? Why stop?</span>\" she said, embarrassed but evidently happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she suddenly got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on Zorua, let's go,</span>\" she said, Zorua looking confused.<br>\r\n\"Go... where?\" he asked causing Celebi to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Out, silly! We have to make up for lost time... I mean, I have to make up for lost time!</span>\" she explained, Zorua looking vaguely amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... Celi...\" his paw was pointing to the window, she noted. It was raining outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had completely forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">O-Oh...</span>\" was all she said, before looking back at her relatively new boyfriend dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been together for a week, he said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know!</span>\" Celebi chimed happily as she fluttered to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently put down Zorua on it, before leaving the room once again, returning a few minutes later with a bag of chips and a few sandwiches on a plate, which she put on her nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Celebi did something unexpected - she picked up Zorua and slid under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just got back in bed. It was 10 AM...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Who are you, what have you done to my Celebi?\" Zorua asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green giantess smirked, giving Zorua a gentle kiss before hugging him to her chest, under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked rather cute like that, she had to admit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now Zorua... you mentioned that we've been together for a week, huh? Well... I'm clueless about the whole thing so... mind explaining what we did?</span>\" Celebi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua seemed to brighten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was awesome Celi!\" he chimed.<br>\r\n\"We read together...\" Celebi froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua, READING!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Who are you, what have you done to my Zorua?</span>\" she repeated his previous joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua merely smiled.<br>\r\n\"It was you Celi! I admit that I was skeptical, but after discovering the marvelous world of horror books...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay, you're my real Zorua,</span>\" Celebi interrupted, causing the dark-type to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Anyway, we went to Bellossom's...\" he recalled, only for Celebi to interrupt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Bellossom? But-</span>\" <i>that</i> Bellossom? The same pokemon that, like her, was a bookworm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... you introduced me to your friends, remember?\" he said, before remembering himself that this Celebi was from another timeline and thinking that his question was extremely dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Anyway, now you know. Bellossom, Froslass,\" Froslass was one of the most shy pokemon in the village. Celebi wondered how the two of them were friends at times. She knew for sure that Froslass didn't like Zorua... not after the illusionary fire prank...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Lopunny,\" Zorua continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Lopunny?</span>\" Celebi interrupted, sure that she told her past self to NOT call Lopunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... she wanted to see ya... mostly me though - the prankster reputation... it was a bit awkward,\" Zorua mused, wondering if a giant bunny almost crushing him to dust upon tripping could be called \u2018awkward\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And Cinccino.\" the chinchilla that hated getting dirty? Her a friend of Zorua, who made her fall into a puddle of mud some time ago? Celebi swore she was gone for a week, claimed that such time was required to clean herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It was good,\" Zorua said, adopting a grateful smile.<br>\r\n\"You convinced Cinccino and Froslass to forgive me... there's nothing much more to say though. We went on a couple dates, but that's it Celi...\" he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled, handing a bit of a sandwich she was eating, along with a chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... At least you didn't forget I love these,\" Zorua snickered, munching on the chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So...  exciting week, huh?</span>\" she asked, gently caressing her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has to admit, he DID look adorable like that... and he had been a true sweetheart since she came back, so... she supposed she could give him a chance... or better, give him <i>another</i> chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiled, swallowed and nuzzled his girlfriend's chest, glad that she agreed to continue being with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I've told you about what I did... and you've told me about your timeline Celi... so what now?\" the dark-type fox asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi thought about it.</span></div></div>",

The legendary levitated a book from the shelf, the one she knew she had been reading in her timeline. It was still there luckily. Zorua looked at her and blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I read mine too?\" He asked as he looked towards her desk. A book Celebi didn't recognize sat on it. One with a black binding. She smiled and levitated it over and set it in front of her tiny boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the book. It seemed plain, but it was evidently a horror book. Not her speed but Zorua was...READING. She had to admit that was nice, even if Bellossom was helping out in getting him into books. He started to paw the binding open. It looked like he needed to exert himself doing it though so she reached forward and helped open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What page were you on?</span>\" She asked smiling and he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"362.\" He said and her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really was reading.

She wasn't gonna read this book she knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Celi.\" He said as he crawled up onto the book and started to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened up her book and started reading herself. Letting the quiet peace take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was so different than the one she had known. Not pranking anyone, a pokemon that seemed fine with being small, a pokemon that loved her...a pokemon that didn't experience that trauma. No cracked mind. Maybe she did good changing the timeline. Her mom told her to be extremely careful with it but...in this case, she couldn't see how any of this was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached forward to grab a sandwich and broke off a tiny bit of it, setting it in front of Zorua before she took a bite. He gratefully ate a bit of it as he continued to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"clgreen\">A boyfriend huh...and Zorua...</span></i>' She blushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom told her she didn't care for her dating...and that a lot of boy pokemon may just be looking to her for her power, not who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't think that was Zorua though. Funnily enough, the infamous, dreaded Zorua...seemed to be one of the most genuine boys she had met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to read in earnest now, occasionally grabbing a chip or sandwich. She watched Zorua on occasion as he moved off the book to turn a page and continue, but mostly let herself get engrossed in her book about pirates and a bumbling magicarp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't realize the hours melting away either. She was getting engrossed, as was Zorua. But she looked out her window as she finished her book to realize that it wasn't raining anymore...and looked at her clock to see that they had been doing this for 5 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua.</span>\" She said and he looked at her. He still had a bit to go in his book she noted. \"Yeah, what's up Celi?\" He said and she pointed to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Want to go out?</span>\" She smiled and he looked at his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah, sure!\" He grinned as he stepped off, making note of the page he was on before Celebi gently shut it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll let you pick, where do you want to go?</span>\" She said as she picked her boyfriend up.

Suddenly, his area grew extremely dark. Nervously, he looks up and at first he thought he was looking at the sky.

In one quick blur, Zorua finally made contact with \"ground\" while still intact. \"Oww....\"Zorua struggles to say as he was badly hurt.

He didn't know why he was getting closer to his tormentor/savior either other than the fact that he couldn't do much for himself right now. But seeing everything so...so big intimidated him and he was still feeling a dull ache in his paw. He winced at the memory of pain and scooched himself closer into her head, if only for some mental comfort, and warmth. He felt himself starting to choke up too and tried to drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was close to drifting off when he heard Celebi muttering and felt her head moving. She rose, higher and higher into the sky as she stretched up, making Zorua feel smaller than he was. He shrunk back before her eyes hazily focused on him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Zorua.</span>\" She said gently, methodically before she reached a paw for him. Zorua shrunk back even more, not that it would've stopped her if she wanted to grab him, but when she noted this she pulled her paw back and looked down sadly. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I am so, so SO sorry Zorua? Are you in pain still...?</span>\" she asked timidly, looking away from him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...a little sore.\" He replied, almost as timid as her. \"But...not nearly as bad as it was. T-thank you for finding me...and healing me.\" He could've chewed her out for putting him in this situation. A part of him wanted to as well...but a combination of seeing her genuine guilt and his own straight up fear of her right now stopped him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's good, can I...please check yo-</span>\" She started reaching for him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!....no...no.\" He said, almost surprised by his own reaction to it. He couldn't reconcile the fact that every time she had held him something disastrous or excruciating happened to him. He almost felt guilty when he saw Celebi start to tear up before she wiped her eyes and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Let me go get you some water.</span>\" She said gently as she left the room. Zorua knew he had made things more awkward right there...well tough! It was Celebi's fault...right? \"...Why should I feel guilty? Because of some dumb prank?...Still, she is trying to make things right I think...UGH, whatever, it doesn't matter, she almost killed me over a dumb prank!...but it was an accident...I don't know.\" Zorua was talking to himself to fill the awkward silence that she left him in when she went to get the water. Soon she returned and walked around the bed and put the glass of water at the edge of the bed, where Zorua could at least lean his head down to drink. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Here...</span>\" She said. He walked forward timidly and started to take his drink, noting that he was staring eye to eye with Celebi...boy her eyes were red and tired...and sad. He looked down only to see him own reflection and how frayed and stressed he looked...as well as the reflection of Celebi in it too. 'Yeah that about figures' he thought bitterly. After he had his fill he looked up at Celebi as she got up to walk away and out of the room. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll let you rest up in here, I can take the couch</span>\" She said, Zorua shocked by this. He looked around the big room...the big, dark intimidating room, and the intimidating bed he was on with the far too distant fall to the ground... \"Celebi...wait...\" Zorua started and she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I really do appreciate what you're doing here...I just...i'm really scared, okay? It's not...I really thought I was going to die, and you wouldn't find me, and-and-\" At this he started to tear up, his voice cracking. Any idea of keeping a cool face or a dignified smart tone was gone, and he didn't want Celebi to leave him right now. \"I don't want to be alone...\" He cried. Celebi turned to look at the tiny dark pokemon. Of all the things she expected from Zorua, this was not one of them. She walked back over to him, setting the glass down on her nightstand and gently picked him up. He didn't struggle or fight this time, but Celebi hugged him to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's okay Zorua...it's okay...i'll stay here.</span>\" She said gently, and he cried into her chest, letting it out.</span></div></div>",

Not going anywhere... Is that what you want?</span>\" Celebi gently says, keeping him still against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua even knows it, Celebi climbs onto her bed, wrapping a sheet around the small fox and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazes up at the giantess, who gives a gentle smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on... let's sleep on it... we'll see what to do in the morning...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the paws of the fairy leaves him, and one of her giant fingers moves to his reddened eyes as she gently - and very carefully to not damage Zorua's eyes - wipes his tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Zorua's crying comes to an end. He sniffles, before leaning his head against Celebi's chest.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">There we go... come on, let's sleep now...</span>\" she repeats, her paw joining the other as she hugs Zorua again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small fox looks up into her eyes. Those blue eyes, once full of mischief, are now red from drowsiness and wet with tears, but regardless full of kindness and pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffling again, Zorua closes his own eyes, leaning against the smooth, warm wall that is Celebi's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sleep tight Zorua,</span>\" he hears the fairy saying as she snuggles him deeper into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blurted out an incomprehensible answer, before falling unconscious from the lack of energy. However, Celebi managed to understand two words, \u2018Thank you\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy smiles, finally letting her eyes close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a couple minutes, she too falls asleep, joining the small Zorua in dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua... Zorua... wake up...</span>\" a gentle voice disturbed Zorua's slumber. He ignored it, and kept on sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on Zorua, wake up...</span>\" the voice repeated as something started to shake him gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type drowsily opens his eyes.<br>\r\n\"W-Wha...\" he mutters as he looks up, an indistinct mass of green towering above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, his vision returns, and he notices Celebi staring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing him awake, the fairy gives a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good morning, Zorua... Slept well?</span>\" she asks softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blinks a few times to rid his eyes from the sleep. That wasn't a dream; Celebi really broke his leg, then fixed it. And he's been really sleeping with the fairy in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lingering ache in his leg confirmed that it all hasn't been one big, scary nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Zorua replies to Celebi's question, looking away as he blushes faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And... your leg...? How does it feel?</span>\" Celebi asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua doesn't reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy gently moves her paw over him, picking his injured leg in it, before applying a small pressure on it, causing Zorua to grunt in pain. Celebi instantly lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Not fully healed yet...</span>\" she mutters dejectedly as she recalls she was the one breaking it in the first place, even if it was by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Zorua staring up at her, the legendary gives a small smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on... let's go get something to eat...</span>\" she says, gently picking Zorua in both her hands, before getting up from the bed and starting to walk out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy carries the small dark type into her kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no need to worry about her mother. She was gone to work, and she'll be for the whole day. So, for the time being, Celebi could keep Zorua around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary gently lets him down on a table, before grabbing a bag of cookies and filling a glass with Oran Berry juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets everything on the table and sits down in front of Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi...\" Zorua says while munching on a cookie Celebi had provided him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What?</span>\" Celebi asks while eating her own meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What are we going to do now...?\" Zorua asks in an almost hopeful manner as Celebi moves the glass of juice near him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What do you mean?</span>\" she asks, while picking him up and moving him upwards to let him drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua takes a few sips, before eyeing Celebi again.<br>\r\n\"I mean - are you going to restore my size now? Can I... can I go...?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gives him a dejected stare.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, your leg is still injured. I can't exactly let you go like this,</span>\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine...\" Zorua mumbles in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi places a paw to her chin as she ponders what to do.</span></div></div>",

He was laying down lazily, staring across the vast plain that was the checkers board Celebi had been TORTURING and SUBJECTING him to for the last 3 hours! She said this wasn't about punishing him anymore but he was starting to doubt that! \"Come on, don't you have anything else we can do? It's a nice day, right, can't we go outside and play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And risk losing you out there?</span>\" Celebi said, almost in a lecturing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't like I can run or get very far, both size and leg kinda prevent that.

She had at least gotten him off the subject. Giving him a small smile she walked off, putting the game away and leaving Zorua alone for a second. He stared longingly at the door he could see to the outside. He was too big to slip under it, and hopelessly, hopelessly too small to dream of opening it on his own. Soon Celebi returned with her next round of tortu-next game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Alright Zorua, now it's time for 'Who's that Pokemon?'</span>\" Celebi said cheerfully, and he sighed. \"Oh yay....\"</span></div></div>",

The constant failure to stand so far is starting to get to Zorua and Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please Zorua, can we at least wait one more day?</span>\" Celebi asks as sincerly as she could. She knows that waiting around at a shrunken size is driving Zorua nuts, but she doesn't want to risk making things worse Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi, we waited for few days already and I'm not improving.\" Zorua says, soundly like his spirit is breaking. As much Celebi wants to denied or wants to admit it, Zorua's right. They have waited, Celebi even try to heal Zorua as much as she could but with no luck. At this point, shes's fearing the worse. Bitting her lips as she looks outside, she gave in to a option she didn't want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's....let's go see the doctor, Zorua.</span>\" Celebi says sounding defeated of coming to this option. Even Zorua doesn't want to go, for the doctor could convirm what the two pokemon are fearing about Zorua's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully picking Zorua up and heading to the village, Celebi made a beine towards where the doctor of the village would normally be. Once inside, much to Celebi and Zorua's delight, no pokemon where here today, so they don't have to wait long. Celebi rings a bell that was on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Coming~</span>\" A cheery female voice could be heard. A Chansey walks in with a nurses hat. \"Oh Celebi, how delightful to see you, and quite surprisng as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hi doctor Chansey...</span>\" Celebi says in a nervous tune as she hides Zorua a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Are you ok, you don't look ill or hurt.</span>\" Chansey says as she examines the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Actually its not me that wants to see you.</span>\" Celebi says as she reveals Zorua, whose still tiny.

Such injuries would normally end differently.</span>\" The two pokemons couldn't help but feel a cold shiver on their shoulders when they heard Chansey's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid to ask what you mean by that.\" Zorua says, while wincing in pain as Chansey continues to examines the leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let's not talk about it.</span>\" Chansey says as she finishes up her examination. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Well I think I examine the leg enough.</span>\" Chansey says as she delivers the news.</span></div></div>",

Escaping would mean having to climb down the bed and, with a hurt forepaw, such task was nearly impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Celebi's mom was still in the house... and, last but not least, he wouldn't have a chance out there, alone and around unaware - or very very aware - pokemon that could crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, his best shot right now was to just wait until his paw was healed and finally be freed of Celebi... not that he despised her for what she did - she saved his life, he was grateful for that... but he was also very afraid of the green fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed as, letting his legs relax as he lazily laid down, staring at the window longingly... one month confined in that room... no outside world, no pranking, nothing. Just him, Celebi, books...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm back~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua perked up as he watched a certain green fairy walk inside of the room, closing the door behind her and locking it. She was holding a red book beneath her arm, Zorua noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi turned around to give her tiny prisone- guest a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt guilty for causing him to suffer... if she never shrunk him down, she would have never broken his paw, and he would be still free... free to pull pranks... maybe it was better like-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shook her head. She couldn't think that Zorua suffering was good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I did it as fast as I could!</span>\" she said, masking her internal conflict behind a cheerful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I noticed.\" Zorua said, not quite sure if he should feel relieved of having some company or frightened that such company was Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fairy gently set the red book in front of him. He didn't even bother to read the title - the Dusknoir painted on the cover told him enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I don't usually read this stuff, so I kinda grabbed the first one I saw...</span>\" Celebi admits as she grabs her own book, before opening Zorua's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Whenever you need to flip the page, or if you need a better visual, just tell me.</span>\" she says cheerfully... although unable to shake off the feeling that Zorua wasn't exactly feeling better about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shrugged, laid belly down next to Zorua and started to read her book, while Zorua simply pretended to watch the figures, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi... she was trying to make him feel better... she had taken care of him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had also caused him all of this over a dumb prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny fox felt conflicted. He didn't know what to do, one part of him wanted to move on, forgive Celebi... The other told him to stay away from the fairy whenever her got his size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't really decide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You've been reading that page for fifteen minutes.</span>\" the fairy interrupted his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed as she closed her book. Gently, she leaned over Zorua and reached out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox felt the bed beneath him receding as he was brought up in the air... and then, warmth, pressure, green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" the fairy said dejectedly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm... truly sorry about what happened... I didn't mean this all to happen, it was an accident...</span>\" she told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I... I want to make it up to you Zorua... but I don't know how... I'm keeping you this size so I can take care of you, I don't mean you any harm.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua still didn't speak, but gave a sigh as he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world suddenly shook as Celebi laid back on the bed, keeping the fox firmly pinned to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But Zorua... I'm sorry, but you'll have to stay here for a month, two, whenever your paw heals, you're free to go... but... I don't want you and me to go on like this,</span>\" she said slowly, fully obtaining his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled meekly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So... I say, let's just start over, me and you...</span>\" she said, before explaining,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">This... this doesn't undo what you did, and doesn't undo what I did... but I guess your pranks, and my actions, they cancel each other. So...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glowed. Zorua closed his, expecting Celebi to shrink him even more... but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Celebi psychically lifted a black book from her desk and hovered it over a trash can, before dropping her psychic grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer log book unceremoniously fell on the bottom of the trash can, landing with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua opened his eyes again, noticing the kind ones of Celebi staring at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You've paid enough. We can forget each other's actions... and this could be actually nice... we could be...</span>\" she smiled sweetly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Friends.</span>\"</span></div></div>",

After that things had settled into this routine but...she had cared for him, comforted him and reassured him in a moment of emotional weakness right? And she healed him after almost killing him on accident, she was dedicated to making it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...for pranks...sorry for pranking you...I won't again...anymore to anyone...\" He mumbled. \"This might...the friend thing...it might work. I want to be friends...\" He said, kind of embarrassed by the whole thing, he leaned into her chest, trying to hug her with his tiny body. But even in the boredom, beyond the pain in his leg and the fear in the presence of a being...so much larger than him...a friend sounded nice. He hadn't had one before.

He did apologize for the prank but Celebi honestly found it hard to be mad at him at all anymore. If anything, for every one time he apologized she apologized ten times over. All the same he said he'd lay off and so far had kept his word. Things had been more or less quiet in the village. While walking through the forest in the same area she had been moving the days prior, head sunk in a book not paying much attention she heard a snore coming from the brush. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"What the, who's sleeping out-\"</span> She looked to see Zorua curled up in a nap. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Huh...what's he doing out here?\" </span>Come to think of it, Celebi didn't recall seeing Zorua really interact with anyone outside of his pranking nature. Probably why no one had seen him much. Actually...where does he even live?

She was curious about him, and wanted to bury the hatchet a bit more with him anyway, so she'd wait for him to wake up. After about an hour, when dusk started to creep in he started murmuring, Celebi shut her book and waited for him to find his senses. \"W-Celebi...?\" He muttered groggily. \"What are you doing out here?\" <span class=\"clgreen\">\"I could ask you the same thing. Isn't the ground hard to sleep on?\"</span> She asked. He avoided her gaze at this. \"Ah...you know, i'm used to it by now. Rough and tumble, that's me!\" He said, sounding far more chipper than she believed. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Zorua...where do you even live? Thinking on it I don't recall ever seeing your house.\"</span> He said nothing for a moment before returning with a big toothy grin that looked obviously forced. \"Heh, here, there, everywhere! The world is my oyster, no domicile could contain my natural awesome spunk!\" <span class=\"clgreen\">\"That's not an answer.\"</span> She said flatly, now sure that Zorua was homeless. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Why don't you go see Wigglytuff? You know he loves putting up young Pokemon without a home.\"</span> She said before Zorua got defensive. \"What? That guy. No way, like I said, no domicile can contain me!...Besides, he wouldn't have me, pulled one to many stunts on him and young Swinub. He's pretty defensive of him...that's my mistake to live with though.\" He smiled a bit sadly before doing an exaggerated stretch. \"But y'know, gotta keep on keeping on, see you around Cele-\" <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Why don't you come with me?\"</span> She said, not believing that she blurted it out. He stopped in his tracks. \"Yeah, sure, like your mom would TOTALLY go for a male Pokemon around your age crashing at-\" <span class=\"clgreen\">\"It isn't like she'd know, because you'd be...well...y'know.\"</span> She meekly started before putting her book down and putting her hands close together to indicate a small size. \"OH no! No nononono! Are you NUTS!? You think i'd agree to THAT crap again!?\" Zorua lost his composure at that point and Celebi could hardly blame him, but she kept going.<span class=\"clgreen\"> \"I wouldn't do the microscopic thing again...or the pebble size...it'd be...like when you woke up after I healed you, y'know. It'd be a roof, and you wouldn't be lonely...and if you don't like it you can back out at any time and i'll change you back\"</span> She said. She really was starting to get a better picture of what Zorua really was at this point, and she wanted to help him. Zorua for his part though was completely baffled by the offer. The pillow the other night was nice...and Celebi was nice too but...did he really want to give up his size for a home? He couldn't even believe he was considering this offer after the previous disaster, yet here he was. He looked down at his left paw and kicked some dirt before clicking his tongue.</span></div></div>",

From playing with them, dressing them to cuddl..... Celebi couldn't help but laugh at the reason she could guess, \"<span class=\"clgreen\">are you that embarrass that i might treat you as a poke doll that i will snuggle you in your sleep?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....\" Zorua say as he try to think of a excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Fine fine, don't worry. I'll try to not treat you like a doll.</span>\" <span class=\"clgreen\"><i>I'm so going to treat him like a doll</i></span>, Celebi thoughts to herself.

Understandably nervous about being shrunk again, Zorua nods his head. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ok, stay still.</span>\" Celebi says as she close her eyes and a green glow forms around Zorua. He watch as the world grew bigger around him till he stop shrinking at the size Celebi promise. Celebi opens her eyes and smiles as she did the shrinking move without going overboard. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ok, let's head home....but first...</span>\" Zorua was wondering what Celebi was up to and quickly got nervous as he can guess what she is going to do. Celebi nuzzles Zorua, and she actually enjoys the feeling. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wow, never realizes how soft you're fur is.</span>\" Celebi say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you promise.\" Zorua says as he struggle to push Celebi's face of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I said i would try, and i did try.</span>\" Celebi says as she continues to nuzzle Zorua. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ok, now let's go.</span>\" Celebi says as she heads home with Zorua wrap around her arms.

'This is...weirdly nice' Zorua thought. He felt warmth and softness all around him from her paws and her belly...almost lulling him back to sleep before she reached her home. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">We're here...don't move in case my Mom is home.\"</span> Celebi said. Zorua concentrated a bit before Celebi looked down to see that Zorua looked...exactly like a stuffed plush pokedoll. Still a Zorua, but definitely lifeless. <span class=\"clgreen\">'right...his illusions....good thinking Zorua!'</span>She mentally praised him before heading in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi walked over to the table only to see a note and a small plate of meats, celery, cheeses and crackers on the table. \"Had to work early tonight, won't be home until after your bed time. Sorry, I got you your favorite study snack! There's dinner in the fridge if you're still hungry. - Mom\" Celebi smiled a bit. Tonight that worked out pretty well at least for her and Zorua. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"It's fine, my mom won't be home for a bit Zorua.\"</span> With that he instantly changed back and sighed a bit before she gently changed her position that he was balancing himself on her two paws. \"W-whoa, Celi, what are you-\" Her giant head nuzzled his entire body down into her paws. \"Dang it Celebi, I know you think this is funny!\" He groaned before she removed her head, giving him a stupid grin and she gripped him with one paw and started rubbing at his belly with her free hand. This tickled relentlessly \"D-heh-da-hahaha-st-heh-stop ithahaha!\" Zorua couldn't help it and soon Celebi was starting to laugh. She stopped and set him on the table. \"You're not going to stop messing with me, are you?\" He said. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"You know, coming from you Zorua, that statement is comical in and of itself...and no, I won't.\"</span> She smiled before sliding a cracker, meat slice, and cheese slice towards him. \"Here, you must be hungry.\" She said before she herself grabbed a piece of celery and started munching. He was about to answer before his belly groaned and he felt his cheeks flare up, Celebi just gave him a bemused look before he wordlessly tore into the meat slice. He managed to get about 3/4 of the way through it before he started to feel filled up...it'd be easy to eat at this size, that's for sure. he sat back before Celebi set a tiny glass of water down in front of him. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"You need to drink too.\"</span> She said simply as she made herself a meat and cheese cracker sandwich. He had to reach up with his paws to be able to access the water, but he drank hungrily at it too. Man it felt good to have a full belly. Celebi noticed how eager he was and thought to herself <span class=\"clgreen\">'Geez...how hungry and thirsty was he?'</span> She didn't comment though, if only for his pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Celebi.\" He sighed when he was done. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"Yeah, uh...no problem Zorua.\"</span> She said, starting to pack up the plate to put in the fridge. She might eat dinner later, but right now she was focused on the little dark fox pokemon and settling in with him. \"So...what are we gonna do?\" Zorua asked, curious. Before she smiled back at him, and went back to pick him up.</span></div></div>",

The legendary is currently holding her book in front of him, so that she could read while also allowing Zorua to read as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored, Zorua made an effort and tried reading a few lines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, from what he could understand, Celebi was reading some kind of novel about some guy traveling all over the world, searching for hidden treasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, is THIS how you spend time alone?\" Zorua asks the fairy while looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yup,</span>\" Celebi responds, not even looking down at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You should get used to it.

This isn't... Where am I?\" Zorua asks himself, confused upon noticing that he wasn't in the forest anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of earlier penetrate the fox's mind, and he quickly recalls that Celebi was actually letting him stay at her home... he also recalls that she had to shrink him again, and that he'll be staying shrunken for the whole time he spent with Celebi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't a dream...\" he mumbles, not knowing if to be relieved or scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Zorua hears the noise that woke him up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, the tiny fox looked around, only to notice...</span></div></div>",

He was a heavy sleeper too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he looked forward at the wall of green he was being pressed against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surface of Celebi's chest rose and fell as she inhaled and exhaled, the beats of her heart were the only noise that broke the quietness of the night, although only Zorua was able to hear them because of his diminished size and current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the tiny dark type soon grew tired of just laying there and decided to wiggle out of the grasp of the fairy. Carefully to not awaken her, he started wiggling to slide out of Celebi's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he managed to shift his location from her grasp to the top of her bed. The fox gave a sigh upon noting that the green fairy was still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked around the dark room. He could do nothing but explore around for a bit, he figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved to the edge of the bed and looked down - it was quite the fall... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at his own paws and grinned as he grasped the bedsheets, using them to slide down the bed and leap onto the  floor unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Zorua looked around, trying to find something that would catch his interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bookshelf - boring, told his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet - he would have to open the doors, impossible at his current size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desk... he would have to climb... but maybe there was something worth looking for on the top, he figured as he slowly walked up to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the wooden surface, trying to figure how to climb up the big, big desk. Slowly, Zorua approached the wood, standing on his hind legs and leaning against the desk, before gripping the desk with his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the taste of wood assaulted his tongue, the hard surface menacing to shatter his teeth. But Zorua started climbing anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the task ahead harder than he anticipated, he discovered: he couldn't breathe properly due having his mouth full of wood, he was starting to feel tired and he couldn't really shake off the thought that he could fall to his death at some point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua kept ascending, until finally he was standing on top of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type gave a triumphant sigh as he panted, before looking around. Being a dark type, he could see through the darkness quite well, and managed to spot the several objects on top of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant pen, a picture of Celebi and her mom and a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at the book and moved closer.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I almost died on one of these... if it wasn't for Celebi...\" he said lowly, shivering at the thought as he slid a paw over the surprisingly thin, small book... although it was still very large to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the top of the book, curious about what it was about... only to find that this wasn't any book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Diary\u2019 Zorua read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diary? Celebi has a diary?\" he asked himself. The fairy's shown him a log book where she had written all of his pranks... but she never mentioned a diary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Zorua glanced back at the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was still asleep. He could explore her most intimate thoughts freely... it was too tempting to let go, the fox thought with a grin. He could read in darkness too, so there was no problem... it wasn't like Celebi was going to know it after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Zorua tried to lift the boom cover with his paws. Surprisingly enough, he managed to lift it quite easily, flipping to the latest pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, the fox started reading a random page,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">\u2018Dear diary,<br>\r\nI did it!

I waited for him to wake up, asked for an explanation... and it turned out he's homeless! I felt bad, so I offered him the unexpected: to come living with me! He'll have to be tiny though, so that he can avoid mom... thanks to his illusions, he can simply pretend to be a pokedoll! It'll be perfect! I sure hope this works - he's really nice when you know him... and cute when he's at such tiny size... I'd be lying if I said that I didn't grow to like him!<br>\r\n<u>Celi.</u>\u2019</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked up, feeling dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi... Celebi's grown to like him...?

She never had a boyfriend - an overprotective mother with time-traveling abilities and enough power to blow away things with a glance wasn't an advantage from this perspective - and she wasn't letting this opportunity go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua and Celebi ate in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil, she finally broke it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So... about last night...</span>\" she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed: this was the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi...\" he said, pulling away form his meat,<br>\r\n\"...

Zorua, let me make things clear: I DO like you <i>that</i> way, okay?</span>\" she said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny fox sighed... why was she so determined?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay, maybe you have feelings for me,\" he agreed,<br>\r\n\"What I need to know is: why so suddenly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't ask me how love works, I won't answer you. I'm clueless.</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded.<br>\r\n\"But what about me? I don't know about this Celi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat single sentence alone was enough to destroy Celebi's metaphorical castle of dreams and hopes like it was a house of cards, blown away by a gust of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">O-Oh...</span>\" she stuttered... she really thought Zorua too had feelings for her, that he was going to jump in her arms in joy, declaring that he loved her back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't really think past her own feelings... although she should have guessed it: Zorua had been acting like this since last night, but she assumed that he was simply feeling awkward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed, before smiling again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, trust me, I never thought I could feel like that for you... but... it's like a fire is lit inside me... and you, I'm sure you too have some hidden feelings for me, you just gotta search them...</span>\" she spoke, pulling the fox closer with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Believe me Zorua, me and you would make such a cute couple~</span>\" she started nuzzling him, before recalling one of her previous thoughts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Also, you don't have a choice. I'm not giving up on this opportunity.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Zorua's turn to feel offended - this was no way to treat someone on such delicate subject. Celebi wanted to force him to be her boyfriend? No way, he thought, that wasn't going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe roughly pulled himself back, glaring at the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I could ever love you if you force me to do this Celebi?!\" he exclaimed, Celebi taken aback by the sheer passion of the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the fox for a second, shocked, before smiling,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay Zorua, I'm sorry... it's up to you then...</span>\" she started to caress him gently,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But I tell you, give us a chance... it'll work out amazingly~</span>\" she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And if I refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nothing will happen. Promise.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked down, taking a few moments to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he feel the same way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi...\" </span></div></div>",

He had made his trek, got more insight into Celebi...for better or worse, and she wouldn't be the wiser.

Celebi came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was not \u2018his\u2019 Celebi, it was different: it was a shiny one, had a body of two different shades of pink and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Zorua wondered who this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he remembered the note on the table Celebi read earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom silently fluttered closer to the bed.

And she couldn't see it clearly, whatever it was had black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince when Celebi had a pet...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the pink Celebi moved to the door, holding Zorua in a paw.

She was sure Celebi never showed any interest towards that kind of things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she had to admit, this thing was pretty realistic; not only it had soft fur like a real Zorua, it seemed to be breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it was only a common doll, Celebi's mom felt tempted to just bring it back into her daughter's room... but curiosity was too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt a crushing pain in his sides as the pink Celebi's fingers squeezed him, the fairy expecting the \u2018doll\u2019 to make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich he did,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Celebi's mom dropped Zorua, who fell towards the floor. The fox dispelled his illusion, his focus broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he was caught by a psychic grip, which lifted him back up into the paw of Celebi's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe meekly looked up, the Celebi's green eyes were staring at him in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink giantess felt all the air leaving her lungs, like someone had punched her in the stomach. This was no doll, this was the real Zorua, tiny and pretending to be a doll!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

Is that you?</span>\" she asked, flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the initial shock subsided, Celebi's mom frowned as she remembered that, tiny or not, a scoundrel was in her house... sleeping in bed with her daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua, explain me why you are in my house, in bed with my daughter, tiny and pretending to be a doll, and perhaps I won't be angry.</span>\" she said with all the calm she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tempted to kick Zorua out right now, but violence was never a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps things weren't what they seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she started to flutter into the living room and sat on a chair, setting Zorua down on a coffee table in front of her before she folded her arms, looking at the fox intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well?</span>\" she asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked down, inhaling deeply. He glanced past the pink Celebi, desperately hoping that the green one would wake up and come to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing happened aside from the fairy clearing her throat impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss... I know this all seems weird... and it is, but there's an explanation... y'see, your daughter invited me...\" he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom nodded, making a mental note to give her daughter an earful for letting a delinquent in their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And were you already like that when she did?</span>\" she simply had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...

I had to be this size to... well, to avoid you... guess it didn't work out good...\" Zorua awkwardly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother of his new friend tilted her head, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua, no offense, but why Celebi would have let <i>you</i> come in our house?</span>\" she asked, starting to doubt everything Zorua said so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're friends... I believe... you see, something happened between us: I-\" Celebi's mom wasn't going to take this well,<br>\r\n\"... I pranked your daughter a few days ago...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpectedly, the pink Celebi glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">How dare you-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she used her power to shrink me to a pathetic size and she...\" Zorua inhaled deeply, his leg aching all of a sudden,<br>\r\n\"... She hurt me... really bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe facial expression of the pink fairy changed from one of anger to one of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweet daughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But it was an accident!\" Zorua justified.<br>\r\n\"Celebi healed me and sent me to the forest I live in... and I stopped pranking, you noticed? Anyway, earlier Celebi came to my forest and... she discovered my condition and... asked me if I wanted to go with her and... here we are...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celebi's mom was looking confused, and Zorua was looking dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe meekly looked up, meeting the green gaze of Celebi's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

If he spends too much time beneath the pillow, he might end up dying asphyxiated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr glances across the room, noticing Celebi, Gardevoir and Braixen standing in the middle. It looked like Celebi was having a hard time with defending herself from the accuses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr quickly notices that Gardevoir and Braixen are turned around, showing her their backs. The small psychic type smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she moves over the bed and hops on, before very carefully removing the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, light shined as the pillow was lifted from Zorua. But it was soon replaced by the smiling face of Espurr, who slowly got a hold of the small fox, before leaping off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Celi, I need to use the bathroom,</span>\" she says, holding Zorua close to her chest as she rushes out of the room. She smiles at Celebi's last thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clgreen\">Genius.</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr ventures into Celebi's house and into the bathroom, before stepping inside, making sure to lock the door behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, those endless, lilac eyes of hers fix on Zorua.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You've just dodged a bullet.

Braixen is still in the other room! Where am I gonna hide?\" he asks, mostly to himself as he begins pondering where to find a good hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smiles as she begins petting him with one paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Relax... I think I've got a good hiding place for you,</span>\" she reassures, causing Zorua to look up at her in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Espurr's cheeks begin to flare up as she gives a nervous giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same moment, her ears rose up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Try to not speak too loud.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi let out a sigh of relief as Braixen and Gardevoir finally looked at each other and shrugged, now almost convinced that the fairy was hiding nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Espurr came back into the room.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Thanks, Celebi,</span>\" she says, heading straight for her three friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">That was taken care of, by the way,</span>\" Espurr continued, earning two curious looks and a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">What?</span>\" Braixen questions, growing suspicious again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Espurr closed her eyes and smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You see, Celebi asked me to help her with some rather difficult homework a few days ago. I couldn't wait anymore to tell her I managed to do it.</span>\" she stated in a convincingly proud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's heart resumed beating.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">R-Really? How... how did you?</span>\" she played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same time, as the chat begins to draw Braixen and Gardevoir's, Celebi's travels on Espurr's head as she takes notice of a small lump beneath her right ear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua couldn't breath properly. Hiding beneath Espurr's ear was pretty similar to hiding beneath the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference is that this was much more weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surrounded by darkness and heat, while the ground he was laying on was soft and incredibly warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Zorua had been shrunken before, but he never even considered that he would ever end up hiding in someone's ears. He had quite a few ideas of where he could have ended up, but not the ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to regret my decision...\" he mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the giantess' body reacted to the wave of sound as she shivered, making Zorua bounce around underneath her ear. He quickly remembers where he is, and decides to keep as quiet as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until the giantess lets him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">What's going on with you, Espurr?</span>\" Gardevoir asks, her cup of tea stopping in midway between the table and her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr just shook for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small psychic type shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Nothing.</span>\" she responds, wondering if she can really keep Zorua hidden, at least until everyone is gone to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checks Zorua's thoughts, discovering that he's thinking about the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">N-Now girls,</span>\" Celebi suddenly speaks up in a nervous manner.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Why don't we all have some fun?</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Eventually, between the girls laughing and gossiping, Celebi and Espurr let themselves relax, hoping that this was just enough to get through the night and leaving Zorua unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part was feeling bored, hot, and tired. 'This is NOT what I had in mind for a nice place to sleep Celebi' He thought, well aware that Espurr could look in at any time to see his thoughts. He was doing his darnedest not to move too, but it was hard to accomplish whenever the giantess he was resting in so much as fidgeted or moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls at this point were swapping stories and gossip a bit before the subject went to a far more relevant topic than Celebi wanted. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">So what exactly DID you do to make Zorua stop his pranks? It isn't like you're the first that's tried.</span>\" Gardevoir was genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">O-oh, um...he pulled a prank on me a few days ago, he thought it'd be funny to make me look like a pidove with honey, berries and feathers so I uh...'co-erced' him into stopping for good.</span>\" Celebi said. She hadn't lied, but she opted to keep exacts out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hmm, can't say i'm surprised he was stupid enough to try a move like that on you, but what exactly did you do? I haven't seen him for a few days, who knows, maybe you scared him off for good.</span>\" Braixen said, almost seeming a little content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, heh, it's possible...</span>\" Celebi said, wanting desperately to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stupid comment irked Zorua a little, but he wasn't gonna give up his position over it. Suddenly a tickle started to catch in his nose. 'Oh no.' Zorua felt it getting stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr bit her lip, she knew what was coming '<span class=\"cgrape\">This is going to end poorly</span>' Was all she thought before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instantly felt a tickle in her ear that made it hard to sit still or remain comfortable and suddenly all eyes in the room were on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You okay Espurr? That was some sneeze.</span>\" Celebi said nervously before Braixen looked at her with a look that could only convey 'Seriously?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Okay, you two are coming clean right now, just WHAT are you two hiding?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I have to agree with Braixen, this whole thing is starting to irk me as well.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">W-well you see girls, it's-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whoa-\" the tiny dark pokemon came tumbling out of Espurr's ear, landing a bit roughly on Celebi's soft floor.

What the, is that what the secret was?

Cut it...</span>\" she mumbles, before a second psychic attack pulls her backwards.

But, before he can speak up, Celebi does it for him,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No, I didn't!

So, this was entirely her fault. And it was up to her to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi...\" Zorua mutters pleadingly, earning a reassuring smile as the legendary started to pet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's gaze goes back to Braixen.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Alright, Braixen, Zorua has been a jerk for years,</span>\" she starts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But he paid for all of his pranks!</span>\" she continues, recalling the pitiful sight of a nanoscopic Zorua, whimpering on top of a book as blood came out from his broken leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yeah, the broken leg sure wasn't nice, Zorua.</span>\" Espurr bluntly reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Braixen and Gardevoir gasped at the revelation.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">C-Celebi... y-you...</span>\" Braixen started, her rage replaced by stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It was an accident...

And, slowly - very slowly - the three psychic types released Braixen.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">See, Braixen? Didn't he pay the price for what he did already?</span>\" Espurr asked while moving closer to Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen doesn't respond.

Zorua considered that and thought that might at least be harmless. That was a harsher trick on a nicer pokemon he'd pulled, and if it'd get Braixen to make peace with him then yeah, that MIGHT be for the best since the secret of his size was compromised anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...?</span>\" Celebi was giving him a gentle look, seeming to ask if he'd be okay with going to Buneary like this.

It was wrong of me to leave Buneary there like that...to do that to her in the first place, and to have you discover her in that sad state. If I could take it back, I would.\" At this Braixen looked taken a back, shocked to see Zorua actually acting like this. It was night and day from how she'd known him. She contemplated what she had tried to do in the last few minutes, and contemplated what she'd just heard he'd gone through. Her expression softened and she reached for him in Celebi's hand. He flinched and shut his eyes before he felt a gentle warmth running along his back.

Soon Gardevoir approached as well, also surprised by the change and started to pet him too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was feeling incredibly embarrassed and out of place with all of this, but Gardevoir broke the silence. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">So if all that happened, why is he still small like this?</span>\" She was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi thought how to answer that, she didn't know if she wanted to reveal the whole truth of Zorua's situation, especially since he liked to keep it close to his chest from what she could tell, which is why she was surprised when he broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my choice, honestly. I...don't really have anywhere to go at the moment, and Celebi gave me a choice...I chose this.\" He mumbled out, staring down at Celebi's paws. Gardevoir and Braixen looked shocked once again, then started to piece it all together themselves. \"<span class=\"corange\">Alright Zorua...friends?</span>\" Braixen extended a small finger to him, and he reached up a paw to shake it.

Zorua could see Celebi blushing when she hears that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what is Celebi's mom is like?\" Zorua ask. Even during the time he spent with Celebi and her room, he doesn't remember seeing Celebi's mom at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">She's is very...</span>\" Espurr was about to say something, most likely in a deadpan way as usual, when Braixen quickly stops her by stuffing a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh we're going to let you find that out yourself.</span>\" Braixen says with a sly smile. Zorua was rather confuse while Celebi blushes more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Enough of my mom for now, how about we talk about something else.</span>\" Celebi says, trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Ok, well, how about you tell us how you shrunk Zorua, I never heard a move like that. Well, except minimize, but that only works on the pokemon using the move.</span>\" Braixen states, however, Gardevoir seems to figure it out when Braixen mention minimize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Celebi, is that why you ask me about that tm?</span>\" Gardevoir asks as she remembered the other day when Celebi ask her about the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Actually no, I wasn't planning to use it on Zorua. I was planning to use it on a small project.</span>\" Celebi explains. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Though I guess its safe to say it worked a lot when I did try it on Zorua.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWay to much, Zorua thoughts as he remember his experience as a nanoscopic speck while on Celebi's paw. As usual, Espurr read his thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Must has been a interesting experience to see Celebi at such a small size.</span>\" Espurr says, making Zorua fluster a bit when he forgot about Espurr's mind reading ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please stop reading my mind?\" Zorua says while covering his head, thinking that would work. The girls laugh a little, finding the scene adorable. \"Hmmm, so what are you girls going to do now by the way?\" Zorua says, thinking they might continue the sleepover without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You can join us if you want.</span>\" Celebi says as the girls agree in the idea. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">As for what to do next, anyone got any ideas?</span>\" The girls thought a bit.</span></div></div>",

Braixen gave her an annoyed look before doing a complete 180 and putting on a bright smile. \"<span class=\"corange\">Okay, so you know that mean old Mismagius that lives in the village? Right by the park?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">And how she's always taking toys, do dads, and bip bobs from any pokemon that unfortunately has their stuff cross into her yard and never give it back.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">bip bobs?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well, no one has EVER managed to get any of their stuff back.

Think about it. He's tiny enough to sneak by, he's got illusions on his side, he's a dark type and could slip by that ghost type without much notice, and he's got a conniving, sneaky mind! It's perfect!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Espurr, you're wrong. That isn't a bad idea...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen had a look of hope that was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's a TERRIBLE one! Are you serious!?

Zorua would be redeemed! The face turn of the century! He'd be a legend, a hero!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay is this the pitch you're gonna give him, because it might actually work, i'm just going to fall back on this being a terrible idea.</span>\" Celebi said flatly, crossing her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">SERIOUSLY nasty lady...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You're being too protective of him...and underestimating him...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You're misplaced and over inflated sense of justice never ceases to amaze, and it's certainly inspirational that you want to pass that onto the recently changed and incredibly emotionally vulnerable Zorua so you can live vicariously through this mission.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Espurr...</span>\" Braixen was flushing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Love ya Braix...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Look, I thought this out. We tie a string to him that he can mask with his illusions, okay? And then Espurr stays honed in on his thoughts, and if he starts to panic, sends off a signal of being caught, or is in ANY danger we immediately pull the string and get him out of there! And if he does manage to get some stuff he can tie an extra bit of string to it, in case it's too heavy for him to pull out and we can take over from there, pulling both him and the object out! It's totally safe!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was silent for a few moments before Celebi sighed and spoke up.</span></div></div>",

That Mismagius never gave it back, I had to find a new one! Don't tell me she never stole anything from you all!</span>\" she grabs out her stick from her tail and clenches her fist around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I never got anywhere near that house,</span>\" Celebi says, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I will never do!\" Zorua chimes, backing up onto Celebi's paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I agree, Zorua.

Would your rather stay here and play board games all the time?</span>\" Braixen says. Zorua's eyes widen at the perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen smirks. She just hit Zorua's weak spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">He's reconsidering.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, you-</span>\" Celebi doesn't get to finish as the small fox she's holding interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Braixen,\" he tells.<br>\r\n\"Tell me you've got a plan...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Zorua cries as Braixen ties a particularly long string - which Celebi provided - around him. The group had moved outside of the Mismagius' house, and Zorua was getting ready to sneak inside her yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi, who is holding him, wears an apprehensive expression.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, this is your last chance: if you're not sure, we can go home, and nobody will blame you,</span>\" she says as if wanting to convince him to rethink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine...\" Zorua mumbles in response, not really sure about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Be careful,</span>\" Gardevoir says, moving closer to Celebi.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Very careful.</span>\" Espurr adds.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">EXTREMELY careful.</span>\" Celebi finishes, bending to let him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">And if you run into the old jerk, just think about wanting to get out: Espurr will read your thoughts and we'll pull you out.</span>\" Braixen says as Zorua starts walking towards the gate that leads to the Mismagius' yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Good luck!</b>\" all four pokemon say at unison as he disappears into a thick forest of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua wanders around for a moment as he tries to find a way to orient himself through the thick vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wasn't already lost enough, the sky was dark and he was having a hard time seeing where he was going. The rope tied around him, which was left in the hands of the overprotective Celebi, was somewhat a comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe keeps venturing deeper into the tall grass for a while, before it finally came to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's eyes widen as he gasps in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were all sorts of things in the yard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalls, toys, evolutionary stones and much, much more. The fox's eyes fix on one object in particular - a stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's nothing more than a normal wooden stick, but he's sure of what that is. Braixen's first stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I could grab that...\" he wonders, before getting distracted by the door of the mansion opening. A Mismagius comes out, looking rather hostile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua chokes back a gasp as he focuses. His form his replaced by a patch of grass. As expected, the old lady didn't notice him as she starts hovering around the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I'm safe for now. But I can't hold the illusion of I have to move...\" he mutters.<br>\r\n\"I have to distract her... but how...?\" he asks himself, before having an idea. He focuses again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, suddenly, a Murkrow materialized from nowhere and started flying around. Its illusionary wings made noise, which drew the Mismagius' attention. The fake Murkrow landed on a tree branch in front of the ghost type, who glared at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hey! You! Get lost!</span>\" she yelled at him. Murkrow didn't move of an inch.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I'm talking to you! Go away!</span>\" Mismagius repeats in a hostile tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua takes the opportunity and dispels his first illusion, before sneaking his way past Mismagius, who has her back turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Mismagius lost her patience too soon as she attacked the fake Murkrow with a Shadow Ball. The ball flew past it as the illusionary pokemon fades, leaving a confused Mismagius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the scene, Zorua shivers as he hurries to grab the first thing he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old Mismagius turns around in confusion, spotting the tiny fox in the yard.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hey you! Don't move!</span>\" she yells, starting to float menacingly closer to Zorua, who shivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Help!</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Busted.</span>\" Espurr breaks the silence with her monotone voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Pull him out, Celebi.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gasps, before quickly starting to pull the string to get Zorua out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua feels the rope around him being pulled back as Mismagius approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was safe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... could he go back out there without grabbing anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, before leaping towards the first thing he saw with his mouth open in an attempt to grab it...</span></div></div>",

Now, you only have to sing it.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tears coming out from her eyes, Buneary mustered up as much courage as possible.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I-I'm a-a silly lopsy flopsy that s-sp-pills and trips alopsy...</span>\" she said, her attempt rendered poor by her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not singing, but man is that great!\" Zorua howled with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary placed her paws over her eyes as she cried, tears and syrup dripping down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Help...</span>\" she weakly whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, nobody came to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua finally stopped snickering, and looked at the crying Buneary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on again, and I'd be better hear you singing it now!\" he said with a maniacal laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shaky voice, Buneary started over...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny pokemon fidgets in her sleep as the nightmare goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, it all comes to an end as someone knocks at the door of the house, disturbing her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second knock was enough to wake Buneary up. She sits upright, before physically rubbing the sleep out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever was out of the door knocked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Co-Coming...</span>\" she mutters, wondering who could it be at such dark hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bunny reached the door, she opened it, finding Braixen out of it, along with Espurr, Gardevoir and Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">G-Girls...? What are you doing here...?</span>\" she timidly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen smiles at the small bunny.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You see, we were having a sleepover, and we thought we could pay you a visit,</span>\" she says, stepping inside, followed by the three other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">How are you doing, Buneary?</span>\" Celebi asks while gently caressing the bunny on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I'm doing fine, thank you,</span>\" Buneary replies.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes, except for the nightmare about Zorua you just had, which was much more of a painful memory than actually a-</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr is silenced when Braixen slides a paw over her mouth as she notices Buneary's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Yeah...</span>\" she mumbles, cringing at the still fresh memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened almost a year ago, yet she feels like it happened yesterday. And it still psychologically hurt Buneary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bitter thoughts of the bunny don't escape Espurr, who removes Braixen's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Speaking of Zorua,</span>\" Gardevoir chimes, earning Buneary's attention.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">We've brought someone else over...</span>\" Braixen continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And he would really like to say something...</span>\" Celebi chimes in with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary gazes at all three, before her gaze lands upon Espurr, who steps forward, her ears rising up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying there, onto her furry head, a tiny Zorua, looking pretty nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi Buneary... Long time no see...\" he salutes with a movement of his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary remains silent for a couple minutes, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Z-Zorua!</span>\" she then shouts, taking a leap backwards. Even at such minuscule size, he still had the power to scare Buneary. The small fox doesn't know if to feel proud or ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary makes a dash to hide behind Braixen.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Now, Buneary, he's harmless!</span>\" the fox reassures, patting the smaller pokemon on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah Buneary. Zorua really changed!</span>\" Celebi chimes, picking Zorua from Espurr's head and holding him out for the bunny pokemon, who cowers. Zorua sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not working...\" he bitterly says, staring down at Celebi's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Buneary, we know Zorua was a jerk to you... to everyone actually. But he truly changed,</span>\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">True. And, after all, he couldn't harm you at such size, and in between the four of us,</span>\" Gardevoir chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Buneary stops trembling. Braixen moves behind her, and gently pushes her towards Celebi.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Plus, he'd really like to say something,</span>\" she tells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua and Buneary make eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's cheeks flare up with embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"B-Buneary... I-I...\" he starts, not quite sure of how to tell it. He never really apologized for his pranks. This was a first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">He's sorry for-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"I can talk by myself Espurr!\" Zorua shouted in frustration, silencing the psychic type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks back at Buneary.<br>\r\n\"I... I am sorry for the mean prank I pulled on you. That was admittedly... excessive...\" he says, blushing, feeling quite ashamed... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary stared at the tiny fox in silence, a storm of emotions raging within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was apologizing to her, and she's not sure if she should hug him or try to squish him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she made up her mind when the last words left Zorua's mouth, <br>\r\n\"I-I beg you to forgive me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dark type's last remark, time seems to stand still as everyone waits for Buneary's answer.</span></div></div>",

It all seemed...too surreal, far too surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was standing there, shifting his weight nervously on Celebi's paws. \"Buneary...hold out your palms flat please.\" \"<span class=\"ctan\">H-huh!?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just please do it, I want to show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr gave a knowing smirk. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">That's a dumb idea Zorua...</span>\" She muttered, with only Braixen being able to hear it. Buneary eyed Zorua and complied. It was then that he made his move and leapt from Celebi's paws to Buneary's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">EEP!</span>\" She had caught him and nearly flung him from shock and surprise.

I'd say it's bedtime...</span>\" Gardevoir said as she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It was a great match if you ask me.</span>\" Espurr says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It wasn't that boring Zorua...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You're wondering if chess is some kind of torture disguised as a game, made for people to die of boredom,</span>\" Espurr smirks, earning a glare from the small fox and a weird expression from Buneary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Okay, now you're officially the one scaring me, Espurr,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi rolls her eyes as she packs up the chess board, before putting it away in her closet.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And bedtime it is,</span>\" she says, getting up from her desk where she and Zorua have been playing chess while all the others sat around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Me, Espurr and Buneary are going to share the bed,</span>\" Celebi explains to Zorua, who nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense, they were smaller pokemon. Braixen and Gardevoir would never fit in the bed with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi disappears into her closet to grab out a few spare sheets and pillows, before turning to Braixen and Gardevoir.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">As for you, you'll have to sleep on the floor, I'm afraid...</span>\" she says dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">We always do, Celebi,</span>\" she says, taking the stuff from Celebi's paws, emulated by Gardevoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Zorua suddenly says, drawing Celebi's attention.<br>\r\n\"Where do <i>I</i> sleep?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiles at first, then she and Espurr start giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, Zorua - isn't it clear?</span>\" the fairy asks, pulling Buneary and Espurr to both her sides. Buneary blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Zorua flushes red.<br>\r\n\"No. No no no no no no n-\" Espurr walks forward and grabs him, cutting him off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes.</span>\" she says cheerfully while moving over the bed and leaping onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary leaps onto the bed as well, while Celebi hovers above it as she lifts the blankets and slides beneath them, emulated by her two friends, before pulling them back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now Zorua,</span>\" Celebi says, stifling a giggle while snatching the fox from Espurr's grasp.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Time to introduce you to your new bed~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua could complain, he was pushed against Celebi's chest as she cuddled up to him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I told you this was gonna happen~</span>\" she sang, snuggling him further, while mixed giggles resounded within the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Espurr?</span>\" Gardevoir calls out as she adjusts her improvised bed and lays on it, soon emulated by Braixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr's eyes glow as she psychically switches off the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Night everyone!</span>\" Celebi chimes, getting drowsy mutterings as a response.

Everyone but Celebi, who still had one thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I promised~</span>\" she giggles, before leaning down, nuzzling the small Zorua in her arms.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sleep tight, my tiny rommate~</span>\" she whispers cheerfully, before closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Celebi too falls asleep, joining the other pokemon in dreamland.</span></div></div>",

There, in front of him, was a Zoruark...his dad.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You...I got away from you.\" Zoruark started squeezing the little Zorua, hard. <b>\"Hmph...so this is what you're worth huh?

PLAY NICE NOW!\"</b> The world around him shook as he found himself sailing down and down until he hit the rough ground. \"U-ugh...oh no...\" He saw his front left paw, broken and bleeding, he started crying.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"clgreen\">OKAY ZORUA, WE'RE COMING!</span>\" The world shook and shook until a green...monolith appeared before him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">ZORUA...ZORUA!?</span>\" She called, destroying his ears. \"P-please...down here...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"ctan\">LET'S GO LOOK OVER HERE!</span>\" Even Buneary's small voice rocked him to the core.

IT'S WHAT YOU'VE <u>ALWAYS</u> BEEN WORTH!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's eyes shot open. He wanted to feel for his paw but...he couldn't move. He was surrounded by warmth...and green. \"Oh jeez...that's right...ugh, just what I needed...I need some fresh air...\" Zorua mumbled, struggling against Celebi's grip. \"...seriously?\" He muttered, not getting any traction, he kept trying and trying, not even budging her, the most he managed to do was turn, and soon he was staring straight ahead at Espurr's head. Her eyes were wide open. \"Gah!...Oh jeez...does she sleep like that?\" He muttered, feeling like he was going to have a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">...No.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr put one of her paws to her lips and shushed him. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Everyone is trying to sleep.</span>\" She whispered. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Also...I wish you'd stop thinking i'm creepy...</span>\" She whispered more dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sorry, but you kinda nearly gave me a heart attack!\" He harshly whispered back. She said nothing and looked around to make sure everyone was sleeping, then she slowly reached for Zorua. \"W-what are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well I can't sleep, and you want fresh air. That sounds good to me and I want to talk with you anyway without the others around.</span>\" Espurr whispered quite frankly as she gently, not to wake Celebi up, undid her paws and took the little dark Pokemon. She crept out of the room and shut the door as quietly as she could as she navigated to Celebi's front door, opening and closing it just as quietly as she did Celebi's bedroom door. Once outside Espurr sat down and set Zorua on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was flushing red right about now. And then the thought crossed his mind. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes, I do know what you dreamed about.</span>\" Zorua grumbled a bit in response. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">If you don't want to talk about it I won't make you. We can just sit here for a bit.</span>\" Zorua didn't respond to that and just looked out. It was very early morning, before sunrise but it was clearly around the corner. There was a slight breeze going too, it felt...nice, a bit brisk, but nice Zorua noted. He let his mind drift. \"I thought I was over him...then this whole thing gets added to the mix and I get dreams with a fresh remix...what the hell.\" He mumbled. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">You know, I said we don't have to talk about it, but if you want to talk about it we can.</span>\" Espurr said frankly. \"I have a question for you Espurr, you can see inside my thoughts, and tons of other pokemon's too...how long have you known about my old man?\" Zorua asked, not thinking of this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">...A long time before today.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes, i'm going to approach the infamous, hot headed, cruel prankster Zorua with his broken home issues and not expect that to end poorly for me.</span>\" Zorua just smiled bitterly at this. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Also, I didn't like you then.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Shh...I like you now...If I didn't we wouldn't be out here.</span>\" She smiled at him. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I'm serious, I won't push inside your mind for this, do you want to talk about it? If not with me then any of the girls in that room would be more than eager to listen Zorua...believe it or not, i'm not the most popular pokemon around...a lot more pokemon than you think i'm creepy...Braixen, Gardevoir, Celebi, they make friends so easily...with everyone. I always wondered why they included me in everything...Braixen's mind I can at least see, that's just how she is...Celebi and Gardevoir...they could always just block me off so I didn't know for the longest time but...that's just them. They're nice. Even you Zorua, they made friends with you. If you need someone to lend an ear or a shoulder they will, or I will.</span>\" Espurr started to pet him and he felt himself flushing red again. \"Sorry that I keep thinking you're creepy, i'm not...I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I know you don't want to hurt my feelings, and you're trying to get over it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you'd stay out of my head right now.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I didn't need to read your thoughts to figure that out.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, looking out at the dark early morning again.</span></div></div>",

She's proven to be sweet and caring, although quite frank when it comes to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smiles.

And, like she promised, she hurries to get out of the fox's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Espurr...\" Zorua says as he shifts position on her lap.<br>\r\n\"Maybe... Maybe I should tell it. I mean, you already know some of it... Maybe I should just talk about it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You would feel better if you did.

Go right ahead, I'll listen to whatever you've got to say.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiles bitterly in gratitude.<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know from where to begin...\" he admits. The memory of his father still hurt him, much like his memory hurt Buneary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories of <i>that</i> night came to him... he physically shakes thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You can start from where you please. Just pretend I'm clueless,</span>\" Espurr suggests, manipulating Zorua so that he's facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small fox nods.<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" he responds, mentally preparing to tell his tale.<br>\r\n\"There's something I've got to say Espurr. I didn't always live here. I used to live elsewhere, with my dad,\" Zorua explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr remains silent, encouraging him to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My father and I had not a normal relationship... he never truly appreciated me, for no apparent reason,\" he starts.<br>\r\n\"I always felt like I didn't live up to his expectations. Whatever I did wasn't enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Sometimes this kind of things happens in families...</span>\" Espurr interjected.<br>\r\n\"I know. But he made it pretty clear to me. He was always cold to me, telling him that I was weak because I couldn't hunt like he did. \u2018Hurry up and evolve\u2019 was one of his favorite comments...\" Zorua bitterly remembers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Okay, that's just not nice...</span>\" she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I was constantly crying over his harsh words... but...\" Zorua says, closing his eyes and frowning.<br>\r\n\"One night, it all came to an end. My father was just finished scolding me, then he went hunting. That night I felt so frustrated that I made up my mind. I ran away.\" Zorua's eyes open up again as he stares at Espurr dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr returns his stare.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Running from problems won't solve them, Zorua,</span>\" the giantess says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But what else should have I done?\" Zorua replies, before sighing.<br>\r\n\"I simply ran. I didn't where I was going, I didn't care where I was going. The only thing that mattered was to get as far as possible from him. I only remember that, when I stopped, I found this village.\" he smiles bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my life drastically changed - I became Zorua, the infamous, sadistic prankster of this forest.\" he says, grinning, quickly recalling all the pranks he's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua...</span>\" Espurr says, but is cut off as Zorua's grin becomes a smile as he sighs.<br>\r\n\"And that life came to an end too when Celebi broke my leg after shrinking me too much...\" he recalls.<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I don't even know why I did all of that. It felt... great. I guess that was because I had the attention that my father never gave me...\" he admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr stares at him in silence for a while.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua.</span>\" she then says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua suddenly finds himself being lifted as he's pressed into Espurr's chest fur.

Besides, don't you want to say goodbye?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean goodbye? Are you kicking me out already?\" He mumbled half asleep, Celebi just rolled her eyes as Braixen laughed. \"<span class=\"corange\">The sleepover is over Zorua, we're taking off.</span>\" She said to the tiny pokemon. He sat up a bit before stretching \"Oh...right.\" He said, almost a bit sad. \"Yeah, I guess it would end huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You're surprisingly sad Zorua.</span>\" Espurr said, monotone.

Be a good boy Zorua.</span>\" She said, deadpan as ever. He scoffed at this. \"I'm not gonna pull anything.\" He said, looking away.

She rolled her eyes and said. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">After this we'll go to your forest for a bit, alright? You can at least get a bit of exercise and not be cooped up. Does that sound good?</span>\" Zorua perked up at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...deal.\" He whispered as she sighed.

She peaked through some bushes to see a Graveler and Carnivine walking through, looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Heh, don't worry Grav, we'll find him...and then it's payback time!</span>\" Carnivine shoke a bit with excitement. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Damn right it is...punk scaring us off...trying to ruin our rep...he'll get his.</span>\" The Graveler muttered in excitement and Celebi instantly shot off like a bullet to find Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua! we have to go, now!</span>\" She said as she searched in her area and around, avoiding the attention of the other two pokemon. Those two were nasty with a capital N. If Zorua was infamous in his forest then they were infamous in the village itself, constantly stealing from younger or weaker pokemon, defacing property, and generally being public nuisance's and if they found Zorua in his state...she shivered a bit. '<span class=\"clgreen\">No, i'll find him and we'll take off and that'll be-</span>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Hey, I just saw something moving Grav, heh, it looked really tiny though.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">And why should I care?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Because it looked, heh heh, like Zorua.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's heart skipped a beat as she heard that in the distance and she flew as fast as she could towards them only to find...Zorua being dangled by a paw from one of Graveler's hands. \"O-ow...look, if this is about last week i'm sorry for scaring ya off like that. You kinda woke me up an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Shut up! I don't know what happened to you to make ya so tiny, but we're gonna-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Give.Him.To.Me.Now.</span>\" Celebi arrived on the scene and drew their attention to her. She had a fierce look in her eyes. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Celebi...the bookworm? Did you do this to him? HAHAHA! Nice! Well we'll be taking care of him from here, why don't you go find a nice little book to read girlie.</span>\" Graveler said as he started to twirl Zorua around by his paw, causing him to yelp. Celebi's glare only narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I will give you exactly one chance to hand him over before I TAKE him back.</span>\" She said, coldly calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">H-heh, maybe we should listen to her Grav...I don't want to tangle with a mystic.</span>\" Graveler just narrowed his eyes. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Oh please, she won't do anything, it's a bluff! No way i'm giving up this perfect catch, I got plenty to do with little Zorua here.</span>\" He grinned as he squeezed the little dark pokemon's paw a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook a bit as a psychic aura surrounded a tree and it started to life from the ground. Celebi was livid, Graveler gritted his teeth and glared back at her. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Alright, fine ya nerd! Let me confer with my bud here, don't go off the handle!</span>\" Graveler said as the shaking stopped and Celebi silently returned his glare. Zorua was looking like he was hurting and dazed pretty bad and she wanted to get him out of there as soon as possible. Graveler and Carnivine huddled a bit, whispering among themselves before they started giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Alright girlie, you can have him. You got off light Zorua...if I were you i'd stick to your girlfriend...like...glue!</span>\" Graveler said as he tossed him into the air and Carnivine used a vine whip to smack him right into Celebi's direction, causing him to yipe in pain again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">ZORUA!</span>\" Celebi panicked as she flew forward to catch him. The other two were running away now, laughing. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Nice shot Carn!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Heh, thanks!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gritted her teeth, looking at Zorua, he had a large welt on his side where he was hit with the vine, and his paw looked pretty rough too. \"N-nothing's broken Celi, i'll be fine, okay? T-they aren't worth it, remember when you went overboard with me?\" Zorua said, trying to sway Celebi from doing anything. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's different! You don't know how bad those two are Zorua, they're worse than you ever were!</span>\" She said harshly, making Zorua wince. \"Celebi, let's just go home, okay?\" He said.</span></div></div>",

'<span class=\"clgreen\">Tch...those two...another time</span>' She thought. This was not over, but she relented, partially because of Zorua's condition, and his request as well, she gently touched his welt and he winced causing her to back off, she then checked his paw only for him to yelp a little too. Not broken, but possibly a sprain or twisted. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I can heal you Zorua...</span>\" She said before he shook his head. \"Doesn't that take a whole lot out of you? You've already done that for me once recently, this will heal naturally...\" He said and she bit her lip. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">But Zorua..</span>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his own paw. \"It'll be fine, I just need to avoid running for a bit right? Shouldn't be too hard for me to do.\" Celebi silently nodded as she grabbed the bag with the pokedoll clothes in it and looked inside, she had some paper lining in there with the clothes so he could rest up in there. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm putting you in my bag while we head back through the village, okay?</span>\" She said gently as she lowered him in, he said nothing and instead just leaned down against the paper. It felt odd to lay on, but it was at least a relief to rest against something. \"Thanks\" he muttered before she nodded and lifted the bag up, and the gentle sway of it started to lull him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this Zorua thought he'd nod off before he heard a familiar voice. \"<span class=\"corange\">Oh, Celi! What's up? Funny seeing you so soon!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen was enthusiastically waving towards the little green pokemon cradling a book with the small bag slung under her shoulder. Braixen, with a hop in her step got closer. \"<span class=\"corange\">So, what are you doing out and about, where's the squirt?</span>\" She grinned and Celebi looked down before saying. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's go somewhere quiet, okay?</span>\" Braixen noted her serious expression and her face changed to match. \"<span class=\"corange\">Um...sure.</span>\" She said nodding as Celebi led her to a small secluded alley way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">They did WHAT!? THOSE! THOSE-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just what it is Braixen, you'd have done it to me too last night.\" Zorua stated simply from Braixen's paws, still trying to get it off of them being attacked. Braixen flushed red and hung her head before she looked back fiercely. \"<span class=\"corange\">That's different! Those two are always jerks! You must've been on some jerk wavelength with them at one time right? I bet you didn't even do anything to them!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I did....last week.\" Zorua nodded and looked down. Celebi reached over to pet his back and said gently. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So what was it then...? I don't think I have it in my book on you.</span>\" She said and Zorua gulped. \"Yeah, okay, i'll tell you...\" He murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>LAST WEEK</b>-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Heh, nice get Grav, c-can I have one?</span>\" Said Carnivine, as he looked to his larger friend who had a bag of chocolate bon-bons. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Hmph...maybe when we sit down, if there's any left.</span>\" He said as he ate another one and Carnivine grinned. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Somewhere to sit huh? What about over-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stopped as they heard something from the brush. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Huh? What's-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">...check it out Carn.</span>\" Graveller said simply, not wanting to be bothered to look. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Um...heh, sure thing Grav!</span>\" He said as he went to look in the brush, and there, looking back at him...was a startled looking Zorua with a bag of potato chips, mid chew. He tilted his head as he looked at the Carnivine, and the Carnivine eyes his bag of chips. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Heh, hey Grav, we have more food over here! This is that weirdo Zorua's forest right? He's over here lazily munching on some chips!</span>\" Soon the Graveller entered the brush and smirked at the small dark pokemon. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">So...this is your forest huh? Well runt, your forest is in MY village, now I don't know you and you don't know me so i'll go easy on ya and assume you don't know about my toll, hand over the chips and we'll consider things even!</span>\" He said as he loomed over Zorua. Zorua looked unimpressed and uninterested until he saw the bon bon bag and grinned before putting on a look of fake fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh~ I see, SO sorry about that. I'll ABSOLUTELY make this right this moment!\" Zorua said as he stood up and picked the bag up in his mouth, approaching the bigger pokemon slowly. Graveller smirked holding his hand out. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">That's right, hand it over and we'll be on our w-</span>\" At this Zorua made his move as he dashed to Graveller's side and got the bon bon bag in his mouth as well. \"Mater Mhumpsh!\" Zorua managed to get out with his mouth full of both bags he dashed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">GRR! YOU'RE DEAD CHUMP!</span>\" Graveller yelled as he chased after him, Carnivine following close behind, they were running up a hill only to find...a boulder was chasing them down. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">D-did he roll a boulder down towards us!?</span>\" Carnivine squeaked out as he turned around to run in the opposite direction, Graveller screamed as well and turned tail. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Come on, we're out of here!</span>\" Them unaware of the laughing Zorua at the top of the hill sitting with the two bags. \"It's a fake you losers~\" He said smugly as he eyed his prize with glee and he put a bon bon in his mouth. \"MMM, so good!\" He squealed with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>NOW</b>-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So wait, they threatened you an-wait a minute, what day was this?</span>\" Braixen said, as if she realized something. \"I dunno, it was like a week ago...I don't keep time well.\" He shrugged before she thought something. \"<span class=\"corange\">Those two jerks filched a bag of bon bons I gave to Buneary for her birthday last week.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, were those the-!? Braixen, I am so sorry, I gotta-\" Zorua was panicked for a bit before she gently pet him. \"<span class=\"corange\">How were you to know? It's not your fault, and I replaced them later...still, THAT'S all you did to them, and they did that to you, that's-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">They were gonna do worse, they only didn't because I got there in time, Zorua, they were probably going to maim you or...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went silent before Braixen handed Zorua gently back to Celebi and cleared her throat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There, in the darkness of the kitchen, the trio noticed a pair of large blue eyes peering inside. And the only ones with blue eyes in that house were Zorua himself and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that she was discovered, Celebi quietly opens the door and comes inside the kitchen, blushing while looking at Zorua intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... I woke up... you three were missing...</span>\" she mumbles to herself, only Zorua able to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr noticed that she could actually read Celebi's mind - she was far too shocked to even think of blocking her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's mind was racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... You were listening...</span>\" Espurr points out, while Gardevoir's eyes start sparkling with excitement as she eyes Zorua, who blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyes Celebi with embarrassment, noticing her staring back at him with the same blush, waiting for him to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi...\" he mumbles, before hastily formulating an excuse.<br>\r\n\"This... this is a dream Celebi... you're still sleeping.\" he meekly attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stares at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... No. I'm wide awake. D'you know how dumb that sounds?</span>\" she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shrugs.<br>\r\n\"Had to try.\"  he responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi just stares at him. Then, her feet lift off the ground as she flies towards the small dark type, scooping him up before turning around to face Espurr and Gardevoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... One minute.</span>\" she says, making sure to block Espurr off before flying out of the front door, closing it behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the fairy sat down, looking at the small dark type in her paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same dark type who she accidentally hurt days ago. The same dark who said she was her best friend. The same dark type who just confessed his feelings towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stared at the fairy, blushing furiously.<br>\r\n\"Celebi-\" was all he could say, before the fairy hugged him to her chest tightly... too tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua soon found himself running out of breath as the fairy squeezed the air out of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi started fidgeting in excitement as she hugged him. Then, she looked down at him, smirking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Say it.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushes while struggling in her grip, wishing that he could just disappear right there and then. In response, Celebi hugs harder.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Say it!</span>\" she repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighs, resigned to the hard reality. Celebi heard it all.<br>\r\n\"I... I like you.\" he admits, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi laughs gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... You've done so much for me... it was inevitable...\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiles brightly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua.</span>\" she says with a beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small fox looks up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to suddenly find her face over his, her lips touching his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Zorua believed that he could melt at any moment. He felt like he was on fire as Celebi kissed him for good thirty seconds, before pulling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's. So. Cute!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type shrank back on her paws.<br>\r\n\"S-So... Celebi?\" he asked, waiting for any kind of response that would finally put an end to this torment... although he definitely would have preferred if Celebi accepted his feelings for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy blushed furiously, understanding that now she had to respond to Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden, she felt confused. Zorua had feelings for her, but did she have feelings for him? Sure, since he changed she took a liking to him, but could be that even considered a crush... or even love?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if his nature came back? Would she still like him then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, if her mother found out about this situation, she'd be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind flashes with images of herself with the tiny Zorua sleeping on her pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the days he spent under her care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen herself offering him to live with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her cuddling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua admitting his feelings for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last, herself kissing him just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll those things... would she have done them if she didn't like him back...? Perhaps, she could really give the tiny fox a chance... a chance to be with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at the green fairy, his heart beating rather slowly as he waited for her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, having thought long enough, Celebi looked back at him...</span></div></div>",

Yeah! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back at him before nodding. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll give you a chance Zorua!</span>\" She said before he felt his heart skip a beat. \"R-really!?\" He asked, almost ready to do a flip in her paws before she nodded again and held him up to her face. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Really.</span>\" She smiled before pecking him on the forehead again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...\" He was on cloud 9 right now, but suddenly she stood up hugging him again and yawning. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">But right now, we need to get back to bed. So do you two.</span>\" She said to the not as discreet as they'd hoped pair of eyes from the doorway. They peaked out a bit more with Gardevoir giving a thumbs up with sparkles in her eyes. Celebi rolled her eyes. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Alright, let's go.</span>\" She started for the door, with the group heading back to her room to see Buneary sound asleep and hearing Braixen snoring.

He tried to move it but found himself pinned and all he got in response was Celebi smacking her lips and sighing before...nothing. He sighed. \"This can't go on.\" He thought before he nudged as hard as he could muster into her cheek before she hazily opened her eyes and yawned. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh...Zorua...</span>\" She said sleepily as he felt her grip loosen and he landed on her pillow. He stood up, shaking his paw to get blood circulating in it again and sighed.

This was sounding better and better by the minute except...\"Okay Celebi, what happens if YOU win?\" He asked with trepidation and her devious grin returned. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Simple my dear little Zorua~</span>\" She said as she hovered over to her bag and pulled out the tiny blue bow. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You wear this, whenever I want, no whining about it, AND I get to pick another pokedoll item to accessorize you with, also with no whining~</span>\" His eyes widened and his pupils shrunk to pinpricks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well Zorua? Interested?</span>\" She asked and he started to shake his head before she said it. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So the undefeated fearsome Zorua will admit defeat in his own forest then?</span>\" And he stopped shaking his head. He gave her a weary look before he nodded his head. \"Okay Celebi, i'll show you why this is MY forest.\" He said with a grin and her psychic grip on him released. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">If I lose sight of you and give up on finding you, or give up on chasing you, then you win. If I tag you, then I win. Got it?</span>\" He nodded and she nodded back. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll give you a 5 second head start Zorua.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that he took off, her counting down before she pursued him as well.</span></div></div>",

She doesn't let him of her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just as she attempts to shrink him again, she discovers him stopping on his tracks and rising himself on his hind legs, before slamming his forelegs on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, a circle of darkness forms around the fox, before a dark wave spreads across the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Celebi floats back, waiting until the Night Daze fades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she takes notice that Zorua is gone. She huffs, thinking that Zorua just cheated... before remembering that his only restriction was him not using illusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had already won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as a prankster, Zorua had others chasing him down into his forests, and quite a few pokemon didn't give up easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no one ever got him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest was, in fact, full of traps Zorua himself put up. But Celebi... it wasn't the case, he decided. So he simply decided to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snickers again. He has a good advantage on Celebi now, so he jumps into one particular bush in front of a rather large tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden from Celebi's eyesight by the bush, Zorua eyes the small hole in front of him with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Celebi - and to everyone but him - that hole leads to a small, underground cave he found long ago. That place is where he keeps all his treasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his precious 'tools' - whoopie cushions, balloons he'd fill with water or paint to throw at other pokemon, food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickers again. There's no way Celebi would ever find him there. So, without second thinking, the fox jumps into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi kept searching Zorua for a while more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost sight of him when he used Night Daze, and she wasn't able to find him anywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No wonder I'm the only one who ever got him...</span>\" she sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Even though I kinda blew him up back then...</span>\" she adds, now fully believing about Zorua's evading skills and starting to think that she caught him by pure luck the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, it was like he was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed again as she sat in front of a large tree. She looked around dejectedly, before saying,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay Zorua! I give up! You win!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after, a bush next to her started rustling, before a snickering Zorua jumped out of it and looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya, Celi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could give you a rematch y'know...\" Zorua merrily says from Celebi's lap while munching on a few hickory chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looks away from her book to glare down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stops before grabbing another bite to look up at the frowning time traveler.<br>\r\n\"Hey!

I'm leaving!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement made Zorua open his eyes... only to find himself staring at Celebi straight in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, finding himself normal sized and onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Morning sleepyhead, I'm leaving.</span>\" Celebi said with excitement as she hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned.<br>\r\n\"Right...\" he told, returning the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi pulled back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Remember - no pranks and we meet up in the forest tonight.</span>\" she recalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Coming, mom!</span>\" she exclaims, before turning back to Zorua and pecking his forehead. Zorua blushes, but risks returning the kiss by pecking the fairy's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blushes as well as her eyes shrink. She stares at the void for a moment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Thank the fact you aren't tiny. Thank me you aren't tiny.</span>\" she blurts out before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But we'll deal about this later~ see you tonight - and lock the door when you get out.</span>\" she says, before hurrying outside. Soon, Zorua hears an overexcited giggle and the sound of a door closing in distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox yawns again, before looking at the window, noticing sunshine seeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled.<br>\r\n'\"At least it's a nice day...\" he mumbled, before walking to the front door and opening it, before exiting and closing the door like Celebi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around dazedly. Celebi and her mom were already gone, so the pink Celebi didn't notice him coming out from her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he yawns again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. What do I do for the whole day now?\" he asked himself, before pondering his choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could go to his forest, exercise in such a good day... and eat something while he's at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr... he could go find one of the other girls, spend the day with them... well, maybe not Gardevoir. He already knows - she'd keep asking things about him and Celebi for the whole day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua yawns again as he starts walking, having taken a decision.</span></div></div>",

I don't think anyone else would want to hang out with a guy like me.\" He said to himself as he started towards the village. It wasn't often that he came here properly and it almost always ended with people giving him fearful or hateful looks. He figured it wouldn't be any different now but no one actually tried to DO anything to him when he went there, so he figured he'd be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as he walked down the path whistling he got a lot of nasty looks from pokemon. He allowed a small grin to play across his muzzle. He wouldn't do anything, but it was better to be feared right now in his mind, no one would mess with him. As he passed various shops he did let himself look around at things. He normally had a goal in mind or someone he wanted to get when he came here, at this point...he was just kinda wandering, seeing if he'd find one of his other friends around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You've got some nerve!</span>\" He turned to look at the source of the voice, giving a bored look to the Wigglytuff that said that. He was with Swinub who was hiding behind Wigglytuff. \"Oh...yeah, hey. I'm not going to do anything here so relax.\" Zorua turned around to walk away. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't you ignore me! You're not welcome here, so why don't you scram! In case you couldn't tell people don't enjoy your presence!</span>\" Wigglytuff said to the indifferent dark type as he looked at all the villagers looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I noticed you old fart, I just don't care. Like I said, i'm not here to pull a prank or steal anything, just wandering around.\" Zorua said, continuing his walk as Wigglytuff just growled at him. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah, well hurry it up and finish wandering, the sooner you leave the better.</span>\" And Zorua ignored him as he continued on. The older pokemon looked at the Swinub hiding behind him. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't worry, I won't let him do anything to you.</span>\" He said gently, patting Swinub's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua rounded a corner, muttering less than kind things about Wigglytuff when he saw a familiar shiny purple pokemon ahead of him with her back turned to him. \"Braixen! Yo!\" He said as he approached her. She turned around, with a shocked look on her face. \"<span class=\"corange\">Zorua!? What are you doing here? At normal size too...without Celebi?</span>\" He shrugged. \"She's having a day with her mom and I didn't want to be bored cooped up in her house, so she let me loose.\" He grinned and she glared at him. \"<span class=\"corange\">No pranks?</span>\" He put a paw on his chest, doing his best to look serious. \"No pranks.\" He said and she looked at him suspiciously. \"For real, no pranks.\" He said, in a more informal tone. \"<span class=\"corange\">Well...I suppose i'll take you at your word for that, but why are you even here?</span>\" She asked and he blinked at her. \"Just looking around, seeing if i'd find you, Buneary or Espurr.\" Braixen looked at him and he grinned back. \"So you wanna hang out then Braixen? It'll be fun!\" Her look softened a bit at this statement.</span></div></div>",

Did her mother find out about you?!</span>\" Braixen asks, suddenly looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire type sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Good. Because that would be bad - like REALLY bad. Celebi's mom is overprotective with her... and I frankly think that she highly disapproves you.</span>\" she bluntly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shrugs.<br>\r\n\"No no... although she WAS very close to discovering me...\" he recalls himself grasped in three, slender pink fingers while being held in front of the green eyes of Celebi's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head.<br>\r\n\"Overprotective mom aside... things are going swimmingly between me and Celebi... aside from books, chess and her intending to turn me into a real doll...\" he sheepishly admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen puts a paw to her forehead as she laughs. Zorua shoots a frustrated stare.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Lemme guess - pokedoll clothes?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller fox nods meekly and Braixen laughs harder, Zorua lowering his head in humiliation as they keep walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You again?</span>\" a voice interrupted Braixen's laughter and caused Zorua to perk up, noticing Wigglytuff glaring down at him like he usually did whenever he passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still with Swinub, Zorua noted, and the ice type was yet again hiding behind the large bunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why can't you simply get lost? You're not wanted here!</span>\" he exclaims quite rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua remains indifferent.<br>\r\n\"And why can't you simply shut up and stay away from me?\" he snaps back, before looking at Swinub.<br>\r\n\"And dude, quit hiding - I won't do anything to ya!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words only had the effect of causing Swinub to hide completely behind Wigglytuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type finds that he can't really blame him. After all, he did lure him into following an illusionary track of food, before making him fall into a pit he dug, only to forget about him later and luring Munchlax into the same trap with the exact same trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, Swinub found a not-so-lightweight pokemon falling straight on him, almost crushing him. That was totally unintentional... but also the best prank Zorua pulled so far, he figures with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grin only causes Wigglytuff to step towards Zorua menacingly; the fox grinned, his eyes glowing as he gets ready to craft an illusion to scare the pink bunny off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before Braixen stepped in between Zorua and Wigglytuff.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... What's your problem?</span>\" she asks, glaring.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">He did nothing so far, so you have no right to send him away! Don't like his presence? Avoid him and shut up!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff growls.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Didn't you hate him Braixen? Since when you are friends?</span>\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Mind your own business Wigglytuff. And leave us alone.</span>\" she coldly says, before kneeling to scoop Zorua up, one paw traveling to his hind legs while the other wraps around his chest as she walks past the pink bunny, leaving a confused Wigglytuff, Swinub and several other pokemon behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have handled him,\" Zorua says from Braixen's grasp.<br>\r\n\"But... thanks. He was getting pretty damn annoying.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shiny fox snickers as she hugs him closer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Anytime.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So? What now?\" Zorua asked while leaping down onto the ground and looking up at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well... why don't we go to Buneary's place? I mean, before we draw other unwanted attention.</span>\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shrugged. He really had nothing better to do at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I guess. I'll only meet Celebi in the evening, so pretty much anything is fine.\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Follow me then.</span>\" she said, leading the way to Buneary's house, Zorua following her in silence.</span></div></div>",

That bow is itchy, evil, and must be destroyed! She's planning to buy even MORE stuff today!\" Zorua said in a far more passionate voice than necessary as he reached for a cracker and Braixen started laughing. \"<span class=\"corange\">Oh, hey Buneary, don't you have some pokedolls and pokedoll accessories?</span>\" Braixen grinned as Zorua narrowed his eyes at her. \"Braixen, what are you suggesting?\" He said, before taking a bite, and Buneary's eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Zorua! Why don't you come over when you're small again with Celebi! I'd love to play with you!</span>\" She said, either completely missing Zorua's feelings on this or blatantly ignoring them.

No! It's cool ma'am, he's way different now!</span>\" Braixen said as the older pokemon entered the room. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">I still remember what you did to my daughter.</span>\" The Lopunny said, narrowing her eyes and Zorua bowed his head. \"I'm very sorry about that ma'am, I would never dream of doing that now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">It's true mom! Zorua is nice!</span>\" Buneary insisted and the older Lopunny looked at him. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">...I'll trust you're judgement Braixen. If you mess with my girls again though...but fine, fine. Next time, tell me who's over Buneary.</span>\" She concluded as she went to exit the room. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Yes mom.</span>\" And Zorua sighed. \"That went better than I would've expected...wait, mess with her girls? I've only messed with Buneary.\" Zorua said and Braixen shrugged. \"<span class=\"corange\">She was probably talking about me, her and my mom are old friends, she's known me since I was a baby Fennekin.</span>\" Braixen said, finishing her cracker. \"<span class=\"corange\">Still though, i'd take her at her word, she is not someone to trifle with.</span>\" And Zorua nodded. \"I've got it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Besides, when Celebi brings you over for a dress up session, then you need to be doubly careful at your size.</span>\" Braixen said in a mock serious voice making Buneary giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT!\" And both girls burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was starting to get dark as Braixen and Zorua both walked through the forest, Braixen leaning her head against the back of her paws. \"<span class=\"corange\">So ready to go back to the world of giant pokemon?</span>\" She said grinning as he grinned back. \"I'm ready for my chips and soda!\" and she looked unimpressed by this. \"<span class=\"corange\">You're surprisingly easy to tame considering your rep.</span>\" And he shrugged. \"Hey, I like what I like.\" Soon they found Celebi waiting on a log with a few bags. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, Zorua! It was amazing, my mom and I went to this fancy breakfast, and then we went shopping, and saw a movie together, and then we got pedicures, and-oh, Braixen! Hey!</span>\" And the larger purple fox grinned. \"<span class=\"corange\">Get any new accessories for him?</span>\" And Zorua narrowed her eyes as Celebi pulled a tiny top hat out of a bag that wrapped around the head of a doll causing Braixen to start laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH COME ON!\" Celebi just laughed as her eyes started to glow and Zorua soon found the world around him getting bigger, Braixen's and Celebi's laughter getting louder and more powerful to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now come on Zorua, why don't you try it on~</span>\" Celebi said as she got up to gently pick him up. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, Braixen, you want to hang out with us for a bit?</span>\" Celebi asked as Braixen looked.</span></div></div>",

It's itchy!\" he complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hmm~ nope~</span>\" Celebi responded with a giggle, causing Zorua to sigh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on Zorua, let's hear home too.</span>\" she said cheerfully while hugging the fox to her chest and starting to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, each step she took shook his world. Plus, he needed to scratch his head, badly - that cursed top hat itched as hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he kept quiet, and Celebi continued to walk in direction of her house in silence, humming to herself, quite certainly still excited about the day she spent with her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

Celebi seemed to not notice however as he tailed them quietly and the two pokemon were caught up in their own world. Celebi thinking about her day, and Zorua thinking of how to dispose of the hat and the bow. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So what'd you and Braixen do aside from the Wigglytuff thing?</span>\" Celebi asked, getting Zorua's attention again. \"Went to Buneary's where they proceeded to mock me about the thing you're doing to me right now.\" He shrugged and Celebi rolled her eyes. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So dramatic, maybe you don't want the soda.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no, I do.\" He said as he stopped itching at the hat, making Celebi giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Is that the real Zorua?</span>\" Celebi heard the voice and Zorua's eyes immediately widened as he cast an illusion to make himself look like a doll.

I don't know what's going on here, but I will say that position suits you Zorua, a tiny little pokedoll after what you did to mine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua rolled his eyes and Celebi hugged him a bit tighter. \"Yeah, yeah, your doll. Look, sorry about that. Wasn't cool of me. But those days are done and I can assure that you don't need to worry about me anymore.\" He stated and Azurill glared harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">That TOTALLY undoes what you did to me and others, doesn't it?

Why don't I see how smart that mouth of yours is now?</span>\" Celebi intoned, smirking, as she patiently waited to enjoy the show of Azurill pleading for his life like a coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny how things work... even a child can dare to challenge a legendary, but when put in a situation of clear disadvantage, the first thing they do is begging, hoping for mercy and, most times, not receiving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Celebi, she didn't exactly know what she wanted now... she was still quite new at these 'shrinking', 'kidnapping' and 'punishing' things... she actually did it only once, with Zorua... and that didn't work out good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zorua wasn't even close to blackmail her, all he did was pull a prank... and she went overboard with his punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Azurill... Azurill had crossed a line.

I-I'm sorry... c-can't hear you...</span>\" Celebi said, before starting to snicker.

I mean, not here.\" he said, his grin returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What's that supposed to mean?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua started snickering.<br>\r\n\"Celi... we're still in public... this kind of things requires privacy. If someone sees us like this, it'd be over.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill felt his heart stopping - Zorua wasn't saving him at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to do something, anything that might have pulled him out of this situation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Azurill did the only thing he could think off. He jumped on top of his tail and started bouncing away from the gigantic Celebi and the less-gigantic-but-still-quite-big Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, he didn't get too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA psychic force surrounded him and lifted him up. Azurill struggled as Celebi got closer, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nice try Azurill... now Zorua, were we saying? Right, a secluded place - your forest I must assume?</span>\" she asked to her boyfriend, who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Azurill could even think about speaking, he was roughly thrown into one of Celebi's bags, which were still floating behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill landed in an uncomfortable position in between a few of the new books she bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the dark bag started moving, following Celebi as she walked in direction of the forest that was her boyfriend's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill was roughly thrown out of the bag he was in and landed on the grass, which broke the fall along with the mouse's slick, rubbery body. Regardless, he felt a lot of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue mouse stood up, noticing Celebi sitting on a stump, setting Zorua on her lap and her bags on the ground around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy smirked at her blue victim, Zorua snickered seeing him frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill Azurill Azurill... that wasn't very smart of you, was it?</span>\" Celebi teased, starting to caress Zorua on her lap.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now, would you like to start begging, or can we skip that part and start playing with you? Oh, I have so many ideas~ and I bet my wings Zorua has too~</span>\" she chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! I owe you!\" Zorua said, before the couple started laughing, almost deafening the poor Azurill, who sank in an ocean of desperation and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">P-Please... I want to go home...</span>\" he stuttered, Zorua barely able to hear him, Celebi not having heard him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going around, threatening a legendary and her boyfriend and then be wants to go home... ain't that sad?\" Zorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sadder the fact that I'm not sending him home... not until I've heard an apology. Then, we'll see.</span>\" Celebi said, grabbing her head in a paw and looking at Azurill intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue mouse gulped - he had to pick his words wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Celebi... I am truly sorry for trying to blackmail you and Zorua... I should have thought better about it, and I... I-</span>\" Azurill started crying once again, humiliated.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">... I want to go home.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, ain't that cute Celebi? Kid's crying.\" the dark type sitting on Celebi's lap snickered.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So cute that I'm thinking he could be our pet or something~</span>\" Celebi responded teasingly... before thinking that it wasn't a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked at the couple, his heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">What?!</span>\" he shouted, trying to fight off the image of such terrible scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Zorua were utterly crazy! They couldn't keep him as a pet, they couldn't simply kidnap him and get away with it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Shut up, you deserve every last bit of what we're going to do with you Azurill. You should've thought better.</span>\" the green giantess in front of him spoke in a solemn voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Azurill felt his own warm tears rolling down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exhaled heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Guys... I did wrong trying to blackmail you, okay? I-I just wanted a revenge... Zorua was a jerk to me, he destroyed my mom's last gift! But... now I'm truly sorry for what I've done... I... shouldn't have tried to threaten Celebi too, she had nothing to do with that all...</span>\" he told, sniffling, before looking at the couple of giants in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth remained silent. Zorua was smirking, Celebi seemed uninterested. A child's tears usually have to power to melt the hearts of those witnessing them, but in this case they didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Celi... Zorua... Please, grow me back... I promise I won't tell anybody about Zorua! Please!</span>\" the blue mouse continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at him half-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she spoke.</span></div></div>",

He didn't get to have a full belly like now back in the forest... save for when he stole snack from passing pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What's wrong Zorua?! You kept eating and let me do all the talking!</span>\" Celebi responded, before looking at Gardevoir.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And you kept asking inappropriate questions!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir simply giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Relax Celi... we're supposed to have fun~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No, I'm supposed to be home... mom is going to be angry...</span>\" Celebi meekly stated.

Because it seemed so, he could tell from his sore back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick gleam of his eyes, Swinub was visible. The young pokemon was shaking, not able to flail anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi took a deep breath - when was this going to stop? She was sick of kidnapping and possibly shrinking other pokemon. It already happened with Azurill, how many other pokemon had to shrink tonight before she could finally go home and hit the hay? Wigglytuff, perhaps? The bunny was going to find out about this whole thing and she was going to have to shrink him too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in exasperation, Celebi watched as Zorua approached Swinub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid... what you saw before... you didn't see.\" he said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub kept trying to free himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Y'see, Swinub, if you so much <i>think</i> of blabbering - d'you know what this nice lady here is going to do?\" he said, repeating one of Celebi's lines while motioning for Celebi herself, who bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was scaring Swinub into not talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type fox sighed, tired from this hellish day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff menacing him, Buneary and Braixen teasing him, Azurill attempting to blackmail him and now this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what did he do to deserve all this...?... Right, countless pranks that hurt everyone in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Zorua, maybe this is not the right approach.</span>\" Celebi chimed in, before looking at the swine.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Swinub... now me and Gardevoir are going to let you go... but, before you do anything, I just want to tell you this - Zorua here changed, okay? He's not who you think he is anymore...</span>\" she said, and Zorua turned his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew, each time Celebi repeated those words, his reputation received hard hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... he was reformed, no? He shouldn't care... why was this so humiliating? He sure hoped that she didn't bring up the \u2018broken leg\u2019 story...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped back to attention as he noticed Celebi staring at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... And I'm sure he'd like to apologize to you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snorted in disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi glared at him, turned her back to Swinub as she moved to her boyfriend, wrapped an arm around his shoulders and lowered her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...

Yes Zorua, you've got to apologize... otherwise, he'll rat us out. And you don't want that, do you?</span>\" Celebi methodically said.<br>\r\n\"... I don't want my reputation to be destroyed either. Look at this - kids fear me!\" he snickered again, causing Celebi to sigh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So what am I supposed to do? Shrink him because of your egoistical motivation?</span>\" she asked in a lecturing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"No Celi, I don't want to apologize... just scare him into not talking and that's it, just leave me-\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Did I mention that you get to do whatever you want to one of the two accessories I got you if you do apologize?</span>\" Celebi interrupted, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at her, she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe won, and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox let out a long sigh.<br>\r\n\"My hate for you is matched only by my love for you.\" he stated.<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi beamed, and pecked his cheek, which flared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"But I want to do whatever I want with both accessories... that bow must be shredded, that hat burned.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't push it.</span>\" she said, pulling back and turning around... noticing that Swinub, without her own psychic, resumed flailing in midair while Gardevoir nervously tried to calm him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Guys... help...</span>\" she said, not knowing what to do - she never had to deal with a traumatized kid before! Sure, her younger sister Kirlia had her own fair share of fears when they were young, but she never was <i>that</i> desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Kid, I've got something to say. Listen up.\" Zorua said, glancing at Gardevoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flailing swine was let go of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub...</span></div></div>",

The blue mouse looked at himself and Swinub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was first shrunk down, he was doll-sized to a doll-sized Zorua; now, he was doll-sized to a normal Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the giant, he was walking towards them, alongside Celebi and Gardevoir. Seeing the now giant fox approaching, Swinub attempted to run, but he was still held by Celebi's psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Great.

Talk to them and tomorrow they're free to go... on a certain condition.</span>\" the legendary fairy spoke, looking at Azurill, who gave a silent response and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Gardevoir didn't agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">... I can't take them, Celi... My sister and I sleep in the same bedroom... there's no way she won't see these two.</span>\" she said, nervously rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We can't take them either. These two and Zorua under the same roof with my mom inside? No deal.</span>\" Celebi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped by the paws of Gardevoir, Azurill and Swinub could only watch the giants talk about their fate, like it was no big deal! Seriously, they were almost like kids trying to decide who took the best toys... only they were doing the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Swinub...</span>\" Azurill whispered, fighting back tears. Swinub looked at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">A-Azurill, they're gonna kill us, aren't they?</span>\" he asked with terror, causing Azurill to shiver.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">... I don't know Swinub... I don't know...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stared at the two girls in front of him, before he had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why don't you two take one each? That way, the risk of being discovered is lessened, no?\" he reasoned, causing Celebi to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... You're right. But...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Kirlia would notice...</span>\" Gardevoir interrupted. Zorua looked at her.<br>\r\n\"... Can she keep a secret?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir gave a sigh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Yes...</span>\" she said, before gazing up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">... Maybe?</span>\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Whatever. Take one of these two, hide him well and tomorrow they can go back home, telling that they were invited to a sleepover that had absolutely nothing to do with shrinking... right you two?\" Zorua asked. Celebi looked at her boyfriend - his mind never ceased to amaze her. Why use it to prank, she thought, what a waste of intellect. Uxie would be disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub didn't respond to Zorua's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill nodded. He knew what was going to happen if he didn't agree - they were talking about keeping him as a pet earlier... so why couldn't they do the same to Swinub too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, the two kids were reduced to living dolls in the hands of these three giant teens. Either they did like they said, or they became pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir sighed in exasperation.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Alright. Let's just get this over with.</span>\" she said, handing Azurill to Celebi and keeping Swinub in her paws. He flailed weakly, scared.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I'll have a word with him.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"And I'll have fun with him.\" he said, grinning at Azurill, who shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio and the tinies walked out of the dark alley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">See you tomorrow.</span>\" Gardevoir saluted as she walked towards her house.<br>\r\n\"See ya.\" Zorua responded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bye Gard.</span>\" Celebi said as she and Zorua walked towards their own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill glanced at Gardevoir one last time before she and his best friend disappeared behind a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Hi sis~ where have you been~?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir didn't respond and walked towards her room, keeping Swinub pinned against her chest. It was hard to keep him still, and her sister was pirouetting behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older psychic type sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Kirlia... dad is still working?</span>\" she asked. The younger sister nodded cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">... Did you eat already?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Nope~ waiting for you~</span>\" she sang. Gardevoir smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Okay then... let me take care of something and I'll start dinner.</span>\" she said, walking inside the room they shared and closing it behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally pulled Swinub back and looked at him, her crimson eyes piercing his soul.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">... Swinub dear, I'm going to hide you now... I beg you, don't try to run, because then I'll have to tell Celebi...</span>\" she said, moving towards her bed and sliding the swine under her pillow, making sure he could breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">... I'll bring you something to eat later, then we'll have to talk. Be good until then please.</span>\" she said as she walked towards the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she disappeared outside, Swinub let out a cry of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom wasn't angry, but it was only a matter of time, Celebi noted as she stood in front of the pink Celebi, hoping that the invisible Zorua and Azurill were already in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Where have you been, missy? You said that you had to take care of something before coming home... it's been three hours.</span>\" the elder time traveler scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi finally put her bags down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, she was glad that Gardevoir dragged her to that cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I had to meet up with Gardevoir, she wanted to show me a cool place... I lost the track of time mom, sorry,</span>\" she partially lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Fine. Dinner will be ready soon.</span>\" she said, walking into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed too - danger subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into her room exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she only prayed that Zorua wasn't toying with Azurill already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing she wanted was her mother hearing a technically kidnapped shrunken kid crying in her room because of an infamous scoundrel that was actually her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat'd be a lot to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered her room, noticing Zorua snickering down at a cornered Azurill, who was shaking like a leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed - she knew Zorua didn't want to hurt him, but he didn't have to torment him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Celebi focused on her boyfriend, who soon found himself shrinking down, until he was slightly bigger than Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Warn me the next time!\" he complained as Celebi walked over the two tiny pokemon and scooped the dark type up, before climbing on her bed and hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi let out a loud sigh as she started caressing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him with hazy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...

He had rounded a corner and ran into these teenagers, including Zorua who was small...then they made him small, as well as Azurill and took him away...he gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill was with Zorua now...he wanted to cry but he dared not, he didn't want to anger the giantess that was keeping him...he allowed himself a shiver though as he sat there, waiting for her to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir had made something quick for Kirlia, she herself wasn't too hungry since she had eaten earlier and Kirlia was pouting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">You already ate~</span>\" She said and Gardevoir sighed before smiling at her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Sorry, I ran into Celebi and one thing led to another...but i'm making your favorite, okay?</span>\" It was a simple recipe really, mac &amp; cheese with a bit of meat. Kirlia loved it and it was the perfect comfort food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...something she'd try to use to calm Swinub too, if she could just make sure that he understood they meant no harm and needed to keep Zorua a secret while keeping HIM a secret from Kirlia then things would be fine right? Though Swinub seemed scared of his own shadow because of what Zorua had done to him...and Zorua didn't help in trying to calm Swinub down. No they gave him to her. She smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a little sister, right? She could calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir left Kirlia to her dinner as she snuck a few noodles and chunks of meat onto a napkin and went back to her room to see that Swinub was still cowering under her pillow. He looked ready to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hey Swinub...I brought you food...</span>\" She said gently as she put the napkin down outside of the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stayed there cowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I just want to talk, okay? I promise that i'm not going to hurt you. If you cooperate then you and Azurill can go home tomorrow morning...I just need to explain to you what's going on.</span>\" She said, hoping the younger pokemon would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw that slowly, tentatively he came out and sniffed at the food. He slowly started to munch into it as she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hungry huh? That's fine, go ahead and eat and then we'll talk, alright?</span>\" She said gently as he tried to avert his gaze from the giantess. She was huge...too huge. Impossibly huge and he didn't want to be here. But the mac &amp; cheese...was good. He didn't deny that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffled a bit as he ate, he didn't want to cry...she wouldn't like that right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ate though a few silent tears leaked out, something Gardevoir noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor kid was really scared out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Sis, i'm done, can I come in~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hey uh...sis, can you maybe do the dishes for me?</span>\" Gardevoir said and she heard a huff from outside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">...Fine</span>\" She heard, her sister was pouty, but at least she listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub for his part had finished eating too it seemed. He had eaten most of a noodle and some of the meat...Gardevoir quickly deposited the rest of it into her mouth and swallowed before turning her attention to him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">About what's going on Swinub...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I just want to go home...</span>\" Swinub muttered out and Gardevoir's expression softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">You will, we just need to make sure that you don't tell other pokemon about Zorua and Celebi...it could really hurt them.</span>\" Gardevoir said and Swinub looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">What do you mean...? Zorua is...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Look, I know what Zorua did to you...and it was wrong. He knows it was wrong even if that's hard to see right now with him...he's gone through a lot himself lately and I promise you that he means no harm to you or any other pokemon right now. He's staying with Celebi due to...unfortunate circumstances bringing them together but they're both happy. You and Azurill know about him and Celebi's power and if word got out it'd be bad for them...it could even end up hurting them. We don't want that to happen.</span>\" Gardevoir said and Swinub took in this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">You...I know you have reasons to hate Zorua, to fear him, and it's not your fault...but all the same we need to protect him...please understand that. If you do then we'll happily let you go and we promise not to disturb you, Zorua will not harm you anymore, you just need to understand and keep our secret.</span>\" She said gently and he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I-I still have nightmares about him...</span>\" He said. That Munchlax landing on him...the laughter...the pain...the surprise and harshness of being trapped in that pit for hours. He sniffled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now he was tiny with some teenager who was protecting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a gentle force on his back as Gardevoir pet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">It'll be okay Swinub...alright? Tonight, just rest and avoid my sister...i'll leave you somewhere hidden and comfortable away from her and tomorrow you and Azurill can go home.</span>\" She said gently as he seemed to calm down a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">O-okay...I won't say anything about what happened...i-if it meant Zorua won't hurt me anymore...</span>\" Swinub said and Gardevoir sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood, she'd gotten through to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirlia knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sis, i'm done, coming in now~\" She said and Gardevoir slightly panicked as she gently picked Swinub up.</span></div></div>",

She had no idea what to do at this point to keep Swinub hidden from her sister, she felt caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hey uh...Kirlia, can you go get me a glass of water?</span>\" She asked, slightly nervously as Kirlia eyed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Hmm...nope~</span>\" She said, now she was suspicious. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">What's behind your back~</span>\" She asked as she started to do a pirouette in the room and Gardevoir gulped before smiling at Kirlia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I don't know what you mean.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub was getting nervous now...he didn't want another giant to know about him, seeing the giant teenagers was enough to make him terrified as is. He started shaking and Gardevoir felt it and tightened her grip a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was her fatal mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed a bit harder than intended and Swinub let out a loud yelp of pain as Gardevoir's eyes widened and Kirlia looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir quickly pulled Swinub in front of her face to check him over, she hoped she hadn't done anything too bad...Swinub was shivering and sniffling as she checked him, but he seemed okay. She sighed with relief only to look up to see...Kirlia was right there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Wow, is that Swinub~</span>\" She said as she reached a paw forward to poke him. Swinub seemed to shrink a bit in Gardevoir's grasp as he felt a gentle poke from Kirlia. He whimpered and Gardevoir sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Yes, it's Swinub...</span>\" She said defeated and Kirlia looked from him to Gardevoir. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Why is he so small~</span>\" She asked and Gardevoir bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">If I tell you, you need to keep it a secret...from everyone.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I will~</span>\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">...Go get some water first please, i'm thirsty and i'm sure Swinub is too, okay?</span>\" She said gently as Kirlia left the room quickly, wanting to hear what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">...Are you alright dear? I'm sorry about that...truly.</span>\" Gardevoir said in a gentle tone to the shivering pokemon. He was so overwhelmed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I-is she going to be shrunken down too?</span>\" He asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Pardon?</span>\" She was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">It's just...i'm sorry that she found out about me...you said you'd tell Celebi if it happened...I just don't want her to be shrunk down too...</span>\" Gardevoir looked at him with a gentle expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">She's my little sister, I wouldn't let Celebi do that to her...and you getting found...that was my fault, not yours. Celebi won't punish you for it, in fact...i'm sorry about this whole mess honestly...you don't deserve this.</span>\" She said as she stroked him a little and he seemed to settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">When she comes back with water, i'll explain the situation, then put you both to bed. In the morning we'll send you on your way.</span>\" She said and Swinub looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">And Azurill?</span>\" He asked and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">And Azurill.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirlia came back with the water and looked to her sister, then Swinub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">So what happened~</span>\" She asked and Gardevoir sighed before going into it. Celebi's power, Zorua, and Swinub and Azurill finding them. Kirlia listened with intent and smiled as the story went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Celebi has a boyfriend~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I know!</span>\" Gardevoir said enthusiastically as they both giggled. But Gardevoir shook her head. This was not the time for that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Listen, Zorua still has a lot of enemies...unfortunately, Azurill and Swinub both have legitimate cause to hold a grudge and though I know Swinub wouldn't act on it...he was having a meltdown just seeing the whole thing and the tiny Zorua. Celebi shrunk him and...I calmed him down, right Swinub?</span>\" She said and Swinub looked down before nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I just want to go home...if Zorua doesn't bug me then i'm happy...</span>\" He said and Kirlia looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Seems like rotten luck Swinub...you're always so quiet when I see you but...you helped me with that school assignment once Swinub, remember...I never thanked you for that~</span>\" She said as she reached out again. Swinub winced but felt a gentle touch stroke him. He calmed down a bit before Kirlia looked at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Can I hold him for the night~ I'm sure he'd be comfortable in bed with me~</span>\" She said and Gardevoir smiled. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Shouldn't you ask him that?</span>\" She said and Kirlia looked at Swinub...her giant face very close, it intimidated him, despite her gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Swinub...can I hold you for the night? I'll be gentle~</span>\" She asked and slowly, he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">S-sure...just d-don't hurt me...</span>\" He said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Be very VERY careful...he's fragile and you don't want to make him uncomfortable.</span>\" She said and Kirlia nodded. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">I won't hurt him...I won't hurt you Swinub~</span>\" She said as he was exchanged from teen to the pokemon his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled into bed with him as Gardevoir sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Been a while since i've gotten you in bed ON time. Dad'll be shocked.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirlia giggled at this but didn't respond vocally. Swinub felt himself pressed to a warm surface. It soothed him, he had to admit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Have a good night you two...i'll bring you as well Kirlia, when we visit Celebi.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Gardevoir left the two to go to bed.</span></div></div>",

Not only that though; the softness of Kirlia's bed and of Kirlia herself, the beats of her heart, her stomach gurgling softly, her chest rising up and falling down along with her rhythmic breathing... he fell asleep in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he slept peacefully throughout the night, like kids of his age should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, the same Swinub was still asleep on a deserted bed while Kirlia and Gardevoir walked inside the room, the second holding a plate of food for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, most of it was for the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking care of a shrunken kid has its advantages, Gardevoir thought as she watched her younger sister gently shaking Swinub to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small swine woke up because of the gentle rocking and looked at the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Good morning Swinub! Slept well?</span>\" Kirlia said cheerfully, almost deafening the poor kid. Gardevoir sighed - why was her sister always so annoyingly loud? - as she gently set the plate in front of Swinub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing more than two eggs and two sausages. A bite or two of those was a feast to Swinub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir cut a piece of sausage and gave it to Swinub, who hungrily started to eat.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Let's be quick,</span>\" Gardevoir said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Because after this we're going to see Celi and her boyfriend~ and Azurill.</span>\" Kirlia chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir's mind traveled to the blue mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he behaved throughout his stay at Celebi's house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sure hoped so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knocking was getting insistent, but Celebi kept on sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was absolutely unusual of her - she was always up by 7 AM. She had an horrible night, nightmares kept haunting her, forcing her to wake up with her heart pounding her chest several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, she could tell that she envied Zorua, who kept sleeping soundly during the whole night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy rolled over in her sleep, hugging Zorua more tightly. The knocking didn't cease yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mooom... door...</span>\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. Her mother was obviously off to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua... door...</span>\" she tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, no response. Zorua was still asleep and hopelessly too small to get the door anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only left one alternative before she had to go get the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill...</span>\" that name seemed to switch on her brain.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill... Azurill...</span>\" Celebi's eyes shot wide open and looked across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill was still asleep in his jar, wrapped up in cotton wool she gave him. She swore she saw tears beneath his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi quickly got up from bed, letting go of Zorua in the process, and stumbled out of the room to open her front door, hazily eyeing Gardevoir, Kirlia and Swinub who was sitting on top of the younger sister's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Morning Celi~</span>\" Kirlia chimed, getting a drowsy yawn in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Gard... did you talk to him...?</span>\" the fairy asked, before her sleepy mind finally processed the fact that Kirlia was holding Swinub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paled and eyed Gardevoir, who smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Our little secret... right sis?</span>\" she said, Kirlia nodding cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed, her mouth producing a few inarticulate sounds, before finally managing to speak properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Come in.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So ya won't talk, huh?\" Zorua drowsily asked the two small kids on the table in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt sleepy, Celebi had thrown him out of bed five minutes ago. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown him to his size and pushed him onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe for the first time after the \u2018Munchlax accident\u2019, Swinub met his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">No.</span>\" he told. Zorua nodded, his gaze shifted on Azurill.<br>\r\n\"And ya, kid?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">No...</span>\" Azurill replied dejectedly. His awakening was much more rough than Zorua's - he woke up when his head hit the glass of his jar and found that the fox was shaking it with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay you two...</span>\" she said, her eyes glowing with psychic energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids were engulfed in it and grew up to their original sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table trembled menacingly under Swinub's weight and Azurill quickly jumped off the wooden surface that had been his perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub too jumped down. Both best friends looked at the four pokemon in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now you two, you're free to go... but remember, one wrong word and... I think I've made it clear. Go.</span>\" Celebi told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to repeat twice - the two kids ran out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the four pokemon heard the front door slamming close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill and Swinub were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Seriously, what do we do?</span>\" Azurill asked at some point as the two walked in direction of Wigglytuff's house, the house they resided in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">What do you mean?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Dude, this was crazy! We've got to do something...</span>\" Azurill said, shivering at the memory of being tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub stopped and looked at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">... W-We can't talk Azurill... Celebi would shrink us and make us pets...</span>\" he mused.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">... A-And I actually had a great time with Gardevoir and Kirlia... they were nice...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Happy for you...

Don't you think that that Wigglytuff could handle them?</span>\" Azurill pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub looked at him, emitting a low sigh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">They'd shrink him too... seriously Azurill, l-let's just keep quiet... w-we s-saw nothing, w-we heard nothing, w-we were invited to a sleepover, that was why we didn't go back home... it's better if we don't talk... Zorua won't hurt us anymore... they promised...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked at his best friend, partially convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet...</span></div></div>",

They had decided to spend the day out and about and Zorua insisted on being normal to prevent \u2018incidents\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was considering giving this annoying kid a ride to be an \u2018incident\u2019 too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you can take her home anytime Gard, don\u2019t feel like you have to hang around.\u201d Zorua said and Celebi rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">Don\u2019t be rude Zorua, they helped us, right?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cgreen\">It was really no trouble, except for Kirlia\u2019s nosiness and finding him.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirlia giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cgreen\">You should consider apologizing for real Zorua, Swinub is a good kid.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Zorua rolled his eyes. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t talk then I consider us avoiding each other to be a fine apology in a way. He has assurance that I won\u2019t torment him and I doubt he wants to see me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\">I want to see him again~</span>\u201d Kirlia said. \u201c<span class=\"cbgreen\">He was fun to cuddle with~</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgreen\">Aw, that\u2019s adorable~</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t you start!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Zorua snickered. The kid that threatened him was miserable last night but the one he actually felt a BIT bad for it sounds like was fine and comfy. That\u2019s some kinda justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan today anyway? I\u2019m not playing ponyta all day for your sister Gard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cgreen\">Kirlia, go ahead and get off of him.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt lighter as the kid got off and he sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi spoke.</span></div></div>",

But these two... someone was surely gonna search for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to try and talk to Azurill this time... but if he didn't want to listen, she had no other option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">T-Thanks?</span>\" Azurill parroted back, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You shrunk me! You shrunk Swinub!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the same reason we are doing this now kid. Oh, and Celi, you didn't hear the best part!\" Zorua looked at Swinub, who instinctively started shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This blue ball called that good kid Swinub a coward just because he didn't want to talk, just because he was being reasonable!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraising didn't make Swinub stop shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hmm.

I threaten to shrink you, you promise to not talk and I let you go so you'll have another chance to rat us out?</span>\" she lectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, I'm tired of shrinking kids.</span>\" she said, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you prefer the alternative?\" the fox questioned, and Celebi opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for the poor Azurill, those words sealed his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, that familiar glow returned to Celebi's eyes; the same gleam enveloped Azurill while Zorua let go, watching as the kid shrunk to a doll, then to an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the blue mouse was gripped by psychic, before Celebi looked at Swinub, who had been quiet throughout the whole process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What about him?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub took a step back, ready to run. But Zorua wore a friendly grin on his face as he stepped closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised a paw, and the swine immediately stopped in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua did nothing aside from patting his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one is a good kid, I already said it. He's free to go,\" the fox declared, grinning at Swinub,<br>\r\n\"As long as he keeps in mind that he saw none of this, or what we did last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at the brown pokemon for a few, eternal moments, before her eyes finally stopped glowing as she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We'll be taking Azurill for now, Swinub. We'll give him back, don't talk, okay?</span>\" she said, feeling much like Zorua in his days as a prankster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they ask, you come up with an excuse, right?\" Zorua continued, feeling much like himself in his days as a prankster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub nodded timidly. Azurill whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">T-Traitor!</span>\" he shouted furiously, even though he was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering, Zorua turned around and started walking away, Celebi following and Azurill floating behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub watched his best friend floating away from him... and for once, he decided to be brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Wait.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" he looked as Swinub walked towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I want him.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua, Azurill and Celebi reacted after several seconds,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>What?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I'll bring him home, hide him, make s-sure to convince him to not talk... but please, let him come with me...

That mouse tried to blackmail us, he wanted to rat me out! What would happen if someone discovers me like this? I'll tell ya, they'd hunt me down!\" he shouted, before adopting a sad expression.<br>\r\n\"Celi... that also means that we would probably lose each other... do you want that?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blinked, the fox's words sinking in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But... he said he won't talk...</span>\" she meekly opposed. Zorua huffed.<br>\r\n\"And you believe him?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi couldn't argue - the possibility of Azurill talking about them was pretty big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what Zorua said was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf someone knew about Zorua and his relationship with her, word of it would have spread... and it would have eventually reached her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it did, Zorua was going to be thrown out of her house, she would lose him and her mother was probably going to keep her cooped up in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't risk none of those things - she liked Zorua far too much to let him out of her life... and quite frankly, she didn't want to be confined in the house, she had a life to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... Azurill was a child, far younger than Celebi and Zorua... he too had his life to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepriving him of that seemed quite irresponsible... but Celebi couldn't be sure that he wasn't going to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither she gave up Azurill and kept Zorua, or she gave up Zorua and sent Azurill home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill or Zorua? A little kid or her beloved boyfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice seemed pretty obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shook her head and looked at Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill... we debated long enough and we've come to a conclusion... we can't let you go.</span>\" she said, causing the mouse to cry and Zorua to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">B-But I... I-I promise I'm not going to talk! I want to go back home!... You wanted me to beg, right? You won - I beg you!

This was the least she could do to feel less guilty - make sure Azurill remained alive.

Let's leave him here like this?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, Azurill's heart skipped a beat. Luckily, Celebi opposed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That counts as lethal...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua huffed - how could he come up with something fun and at the same time not lethal to do with Azurill now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid attempted to blackmail them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're protecting him.\" he said to Celebi, who nodded in confirm.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Little kid... stays alive... Pick something.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why don't you pick instead?\" Zorua asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at him, a bit surprised that Zorua was letting the chance of picking Azurill's fate so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered about it for a few moments.</span></div></div>",

Apparently, the mother-daughter day they had left her tired. And Celebi could freely sneak inside her room and place Azurill in the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the pink Celebi could wake up if she heard Azurill crying... <br>\r\nsomething Celebi herself had to keep from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the fairy shut her book and got up, walking closer to her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, a doll as a last gift? That's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Awfully nice - Zorua quit it.</span>\" she said, scooping up her tiny boyfriend into her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just asking questions.\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's a delicate subject. And you Azurill...</span>\" Celebi said, pulling back her chair and sitting down, placing Zorua next to the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... I understand this is hard, okay? But for now, you're remaining this size and you'll be stuck with us... this until I'm completely sure you won't talk. If you try anything against us though...</span>\" Celebi gave him a solemn look, which gave Azurill a quite accurate idea of what the consequences would be if he disobeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, he had thought about ratting the couple out... but they had no reason to believe it! And now, he had been promising to keep quiet for a while, why couldn't the two simply believe him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">W-When will I go h-home...?</span>\" he meekly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I've told it Azurill... whenever I'm sure you won't talk.

Get ready for fun!\" Zorua chimed in, snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shook her head - the fox wasn't being of any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So, Azurill... you'll need to cooperate.

Zorua lost his smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever in the... two days of dating Celebi he had seen her so angry, not even when she lost the bet and had to buy him things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the blue mouse inside the jar, he stared in fear, not quite knowing how to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deafening silence fell among the three pokemon as Celebi kept glaring at the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Azurill's point of view, and from Zorua's too, she looked like an angry goddess/giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the moment was spoiled by a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey... dinner!</span>\" her mom called, apparently having woken up from her nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed, and put the jar back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm giving you some time to decide Azurill... and you better make a good choice. Watch him Zorua.</span>\" she told, and Zorua put a paw to his forehead as he made a mock salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled at him, and lowered herself to peck his cheek, before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Azurill and Zorua remained inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox snickered.<br>\r\n\"Well... need something to do until she comes back...\" he said, and turned around.<br>\r\n\"Have you seen her kid? You got her angry... If I were you, I'd choose carefully...\" he said, placing a paw on the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Azurill could actually reply, the jar started spinning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door of the room opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm back.</span>\" Celebi announced, closing the door again and walking to the desk, placing a piece of meat in front of Zorua, who greedily started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi caressed him on the head, before holding a berry in front of Azurill's jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill's stomach growled in hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Before I give you this, Azurill, have you decided? Will you be a good pet?</span>\" Celebi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill started whimpering - he didn't want to be a pet, but he was sure that Celebi wasn't going to feed him if he refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he do?</span></div></div>",

No, Graveler intended to settle his score away from public, so he could wail on the little dark fox to his heart's content. He grinned, today would be the day he found him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part intended to draw this out, he was tailing Azurill pretty handily, he knew this game was his, but he wanted to tease it out.

Graveler seemed confused before he reached for the blue mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part was seeing all of this and his eyes widened. \"Crap!\" He said. If Graveler found out about him...Azurill for his part seemed to regain his senses and he turned around to run from the stone pokemon...only to run right into the invisible Zorua, knocking them both on their butts, and breaking Zorua's concentration on his illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it brat!

Maybe I can make money off of a tiny freak like him, who knows.</span>\" Graveler grinned as Zorua struggled and Azurill cried. Zorua tried to shout but Graveler squeezed him and made the air rush from his lungs, inadvertently silencing him as he felt his world go dim. Graveler chuckled as he looked at the limp pokemon in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to Graveler's hideout was uneventful as he looked at his two prizes with a wicked grin. His simple little wooden shack in the abandoned field...yeah, he'd have his privacy to do with as he pleased there. He looked at the unconscious Zorua and deposited him on a simple table in the shack. He did the same with Azurill before slamming a milk crate down over the both of them, looking with a grin at the two trapped pokemon through the holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">You can stay there and await the show runt, when i'm back and Zorua's awake...you'll have a front row seat to what I do to him...then we'll figure out what to do with you.</span>\" Graveler snickered as he got up. He had a few things he needed to get first, then he'd have his fun with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd finish Zorua off, teaching everyone not to mess with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sat on her log, bored. It had been a while since Zorua and Azurill took off and she leaned back. She should've brought a book...she didn't know how long exactly it had been but it had to be approaching an hour at least...maybe longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I should probably go looking for them...</span>\" She muttered as she got up from her log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe at least hoped nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua woke up with a groan as he looked around. He was on a hard wooden surface...a table, above him...holes through a blue plastic surface, those same holes surrounding him. He was too big to squeeze through him. It was essentially a cage. His gaze fell on the shivering blue pokemon in a corner. Azurill. Suddenly he remembered what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, what happened since I was knocked out?\" Zorua asked and Azurill still shivered as he looked at him. Zorua sighed but Azurill responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">G-graveler took us to his...little hideout place in that field we all avoid in the village...he went to get stuff and...he's going to kill you.</span>\" Azurill whimpered and Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to escape, and get back to Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...looks like I need a plan.\" Zorua muttered. He looked at the tiny blue pokemon. His body might be just small enough to squeeze through if not for his larger tail...but something dawned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azurill...your tail...it squishes in right? It can be narrow...\" Zorua said and Azurill looked at him. \"<span class=\"cblue\">It hurts a bit when that happens...but yeah...</span>\" Zorua grinned. He looked around outside the box. If Azurill got out he could...hmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe milk crate was near the edge of the table...a knife was also there...it could be heavy, but Azurill should be able to move it, and if wedged under the milk crate, they may have just enough strength to lift it enough for Zorua to squeeze under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiled. This could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kid...I have a plan to get us out and it involves you squeezing through this hole and getting that knife to me.\" He gestured to the knife on the table and Azurill looked at it. What happened next shocked Zorua, though it really shouldn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Why should I?</span>\" Azurill said and Zorua looked at him, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What do you mean? You want to stick around, be Graveler's to toy with?\" He said and Azurill looked at him firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">It isn't any different than being your toy Zorua. If I did this i'd be risking my life for you, if Graveler came back in the middle of this...i'd be dead too.</span>\" Azurill said and Zorua growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid...\" He said threateningly and Azurill glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You and Graveler both...you're the same...tormenting smaller pokemon, weaker pokemon...maybe you don't deserve to die, but I won't help you.</span>\" Azurill said and Zorua looked out the milk crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think i'm the same as Graveler!?\" Zorua said and Azurill looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You don't understand, do you Zorua? Do you know what you took from me? Have any idea of the significance...it stung walking home without that doll Zorua...it was all I had from my mom, and you did that...and not once, in all of this, did you ever really apologize for it. Why should you have to, you were in the position of power...but now you want me to help you...no.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at the blue mouse. He needed to change tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me Azurill...and I promise, no more torment, no more games. We'll be nice to you until we're sure you won't talk and let you go. And...okay...i'm sorry about your doll...I shouldn't have done that, it was wrong of me. I've done a lot of wrong, stupid things and believe me if you want to but...I do want to try and be better than I was.\" Zorua said and Azurill still looked unmoved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You told me, an apology or plea means nothing coming from a coward who is trying to do it to save his own skin.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was about to go off before Azurill spoke.</span></div></div>",

He squeezed his body through, tucking his gut in...that was the easy part. He looked at his tail. This had happened a few times and no time was it pleasant but...he started to go forward and his tail caught on the hole, he winced as he squeezed it through...less easy to tuck it in than his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed...he was out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome...now bring me the knife.\" Zorua said as the little pokemon approached it. He gulped...why did Graveler have a...he shook his head. He didn't want to think about it, he just wanted out of this. Even Celebi's warmly lit room was preferable to this. He started to push the knife...it was heavy, and slow going at first, and he was careful to avoid the blade part, but he slowly got it over to the milk crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Azurill...good good...now carefully try to tuck the blade part as much as you can under the crate, in the lower gap. It might be hard, but I know you can do it.\" Zorua encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could get it under and they combined their strength, they should have the leverage to lift the crate just enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill nodded as he started to move it again. At this point he was sweating...but he worked through it. If they both got out of this...even if Zorua wasn't the nicest pokemon, Celebi might at least take pity on him finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so Azurill got the blade a bit under the crate, Zorua able to get to the blade part now. He grinned. <i>'Almost free.'</i> Zorua stepped forward and very careful to avoid the sharp edge, got his two front paws under the blade as he started to push up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, he told Azurill the next step. \"Okay, I need you to tuck your tail under the crate when I get enough leverage up.\" He said and Azurill's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">WHAT!?</span>\" He cried and Zorua, not looking away from his job tried to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for a sec while I crawl out. I'll say when.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill blinked but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Can't believe i'm doing this...</span>\" Azurill muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'You'll be glad you did kid.'</i> Zorua thought. He didn't know if Azurill believed him, but he was at least serious about laying off of him. He had another pokemon that he very much wanted to settle a score with right now. When he felt his legs and front paws going to jelly, he looked to see just enough of a gap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!\" Zorua shouted and Azurill put his tail under the crate and closed his eyes. Zorua let go of the knife and the crate held up for a second, enough for him to book out from under it as Azurill's tail held it up for a sec. When Zorua was through Azurill pulled his tail back to him whimpering as the crate fell with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Ow...</span>\" Azurill said as he looked at his tail, then to the grinning Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kid...all we gotta do is jump from the table and we're home free. Moron doesn't have a door on this shed...\" Zorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, he would be returning in an hour or so though...with his legendary girlfriend too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">It's quite the drop Zorua...</span>\" He muttered and Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that cushion?\" Zorua motioned to a pillow in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hop down and land on your tail, then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">My poor tail...</span>\" Azurill said and Zorua rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time, I promise...if you can push the cushion-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">It looks heavy...</span>\" Azurill whined and Zorua huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on dude, it's the home stretch!\" Zorua said and Azurill slowly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...fine...I want to rest after we get back to Celebi...\" Azurill said and Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sleep on a pillow, with you no smaller than you are right now when we get out of this.\" Zorua promised and Azurill nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he jumped down and landed on his tail, wincing. He looked to the cushion and, trying to dig his feet into the hard ground, started pushing it. He grunted, sweating bullets as he did but it slowly moved towards the table. Zorua laughed as it came close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kid! Ya did good! We're out of here!\" With that Zorua jumped down and landed on the cushion and they both ran out the door, moving through the weeds to see...Graveler coming back...and he was looking right at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">...Oh no you two don't! You're both DEAD!</span>\" Graveler said, confused and mad to see them both out. He was NOT giving up this opportunity to get rid of Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run! Run now!\" And with that Zorua and Azurill both made their way into the weeds, hoping to evade and get away from the stone pokemon...and from here, get back to the forest.</span></div></div>",

Graveler screamed as he was hit by a tidal wave, gasping for air, caught in a whirlpool of illusionary water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way kid!\" he shouted, leading the way out of the shed. He didn't have to tell twice, Azurill followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he exited the shed, the illusionary water started to wane. And Graveler growled, realizing that Zorua had tricked him... again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a last attempt to stop the two tiny pokemon, the stone titan hastily grabbed his knife and threw it in their direction, with such strength that it... barely missed Zorua and hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone pokemon exited the shed and looked around. Zorua and Azurill were gone, probably the tricky fox had masked them both with an illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveler shouted furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of nowhere, a snicker he recognized,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch us now moron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveler snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the safety of his illusion, Zorua snickered as he ran, Azurill following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took at least an hour and a half for Zorua and Azurill to make their way back to the fox's forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I'm home!\" he shouted playfully, awash with relief as he dispelled his illusion, making himself and the still uncomfortable Azurill visible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to repeat it: a few plants started shaking as a green and blue pokemon he didn't recognize came out... Zorua choked back a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend was staring daggers at him, her head covered by a bucket of blue paint, which stained her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Do you think this is funny, Zorua?</span>\" she said with a cold calm, recalling how similar this was to the first prank Zorua pulled on her... and it had been HARD to remove the feathers, berries and honey.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I thought you were done with pranks...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am... that was one of my traps y'know... should've told ya about those...\" he stated meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Is that so?</span>\" Zorua flew in her paw, the other removed the bucket from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Zorua's horror - and Azurill's secret amusement - she held him over the bucket. Her intentions were clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRAVELERTRIEDTOKILLME!\" Zorua shouted, clinging to Celebi's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other, he noted, suddenly let go of the bucket, which ungracefully fell on the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wha...?</span>\" the legendary whispered breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Graveler tried to kill me...\" he repeated,<br>\r\n\"And wanted to use Azurill after my demise... but Azurill helped me, so no more games with his size!\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi didn't pay attention to the last sentence, too focused on what Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thousand questions formed in her mind,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary closed her eyes, sighing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill... you'll be rewarded in due time,</span>\" she said gently, before opening her eyes, adopting a murderous glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">As for that jerk...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveler sat in his shed, fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two runts had managed to escape... he still couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Zorua tricked him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snarled, but decided that stealing some sweets from Pichu could cheer him up, the mouse always had some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as he approached the door-less opening of his shed, Graveler noticed something... or rather someone, coming to \u2018visit\u2019 him...</span></div></div>",

You see the tiny pokemon on my back, the one you threatened with me? He threatened us too...and this is the price he's paying. Still paying even after he reluctantly helped me...but you...oh you're in deeper crap than even him. You've got one way out of here, and that's become my plaything.\" Zorua rumbled with a chuckle and Graveler attempted once again to break the psychic hold on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">No! Let me go! This won't stand!</span>\" Graveler cried as Zorua looked to Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's quite loud and obnoxious...what if he were too small for us to hear him? Or at least too small for you and your mom to hear him. My hearing is a bit sharper than yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That'd...be even smaller than I made Azurill yesterday...as small as we threatened him with this morning.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know~\" Zorua said and Celebi put a paw to her chin in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...fine. I at least feel a lot less guilty about this one.</span>\" Celebi glared down at the rock on the ground who heard all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">S-s-smaller...?</span>\" He whimpered and Zorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be the smallest, weakest pokemon in the whole world...I think that's fitting for you Graveler.\" Zorua said as a familiar feeling enveloped the rock pokemon. He roared as the world got bigger yet...bigger and bigger, bigger still and bigger still until...He looked forward to see a black wall. A black furred wall...Zorua's paw. A deep rumble emanated all around him as the ground quaked, but the paw wasn't moving...it was a simple chuckle from the titan before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can barely still see you...but don't worry, I CAN see you.\" The words pounded against Graveler, a veritable attack on his senses as a psychic energy gripped him and lifted him up and up and up to the eyes of Zorua and Celebi...those eyes full of hate...those eyes that were the size of lakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to this Graveler...you won't be getting any bigger than this.\" Zorua rumbled as Graveler winced at the sheer power of this...this...impossibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Please! I've learned my lesson! I don't want to be this small!</span>\" Graveler said and Celebi looked to Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're right, I heard a tiny amount of squeaks but I can't make it out.</span>\" She said, her feminine voice also a deep rumble on the tiny pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I heard it...and it's nothing new. Pleading for mercy.\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded before she produced the jar she had been using for Azurill. Graveler found himself falling, until he landed on a piece of cotton the size of a sports field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Better rest up while you can Graveler...Zorua'll put you through your paces soon enough.</span>\" She said as she returned her attention to Zorua and the sleeping Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...What'll we do with him?</span>\" Celebi asked and Zorua looked up in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He helped me...but it was with reluctance. He could've abandoned me at multiple points in our escape attempt but didn't, i'll give him credit...he doesn't think highly of me though, and quite frankly i'm still sore at him for the threat and some of the things he said.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So we won't be letting him go anytime soon then.</span>\" She sighed and Zorua looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I am serious about laying off of him now at least...and he's earned his rest that he's taking now...i'd rather just keep him a little while longer, I don't like the idea of being compared to Graveler...and at the very least we need to make sure he won't talk. So...yeah, I don't want to let him go yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...For now, let's go home.

Zorua grinned maliciously at the jar, savoring the anger, despair and terror of the tiny jerk trapped within. Graveler was definitely going to kill him, full malicious intent intact. The kid on his back may have lacked the foresight of what his actions might cause but Graveler? Oh he had full intent, and Zorua planned to make him pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi for her part also felt less sympathy for the rock. For as much of a jerk as Zorua had been in the past, he didn't outright rough up kids or beat up pokemon. His pranks had been bad, and he'd certainly caused his fair share of trouble for people to enter his forest...and there WAS the Swinub incident, though Zorua swore up and down that was an accident at least. No...eventually she'd release Azurill, and she intended to try to smooth things over with him tonight. But Graveler? She never wanted to hear him again, and at the size he was at now, she'd never have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was Zorua's to do with as he pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they had reached Celebi's house as Zorua let out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...i'm beat.\" He said and she looked at him with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You alright?\"</span> She asked and he nodded. \"That dumb pebble put us through the ringer...the trek back to the forest was also long.\" He looked back at the tiny sleeping kid on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You gonna try and befriend him?</span>\" Celebi asked and Zorua shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pets are kinda friends...well, in some cases.\" He glared at the jar. \"Get ready for hell Graveler.\" He said and the tiny rock pokemon gulped at the titan looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked away though to the tiny blue mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...I dunno, like I said, things are still rocky...he said a dumb thing and I think he still doesn't like me...but like I said, he could've ditched me at a few points...but didn't. And I like to think that two pokemon working together like we did, having each other in a harrowing situation...maybe it makes a bond.\" He said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way...we'll see what happens when he wakes up. I at least want to make sure we don't hate each other.\" Zorua said and Celebi sighed with relief. The ordeal they had gone through was lamentable, but at least Zorua was open to making peace now. Azurill just needed to be open to it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well, Zorua I need to shrink you down.</span>\" She smiled as they stood outside her house and a familiar feeling overtook him. He looked at his towering girlfriend before realizing something. He looked at his back to see the...still as tiny to him Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shrunk him again?\" Zorua questioned and Celebi nodded. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's easier to hide him...my mom has noticed you you know, doll act or not...if Azurill is that small it's just less of a hassle...and he is technically your pet right now too.</span>\" She said and Zorua looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda promised he wouldn't be smaller...\" He mumbled and Celebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It'll be fine...i'll deal with Azurill when he wakes up, okay? I still owe him something, like I promised. Not freedom...but a kindness at least.</span>\" She said smiling and Zorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case...leave me with my new toy.\" He said looking to the jar in Celebi's grasp as Celebi levitated Zorua into her paws, still holding the jar with the tiny Graveler.</span></div></div>",

He could hear Graveler even better now that he was smaller, and he intended to break Graveler's spirit entirely. He would regret what he had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked towards her clock and nodded to herself. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom still won't be home for a few hours yet...</span>\" She mumbled as she went towards her room and gently set Zorua down on the bed, who was doing his best to balance Azurill on his back, who had somehow slept through all of the moving around. She then set the jar down next to Zorua before she sat down, rocking both Zorua and the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Zorua, i'm going to talk with Azurill, okay? It may be a bit. Do you want anything?</span>\" Zorua got a wicked grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me with the pebble...i'll entertain myself.\" Zorua said maliciously as he eyed the jar. Even doll sized he was a veritable titan to Graveler...on the scale of a god. The crushing reality was setting in finally as Graveler whimpered. He was helpless in a world far too big and scary for him. Even tiny little Pichu...could crush him without so much as a hint of effort. The world shook again as Celebi got up from the bed, levitating the tiny Azurill and a book with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Azurill noticed was how sore his tail felt. He groaned as he sat up, he was on a soft surface...he looked around to see that he was in a large room and on a green surface...still shrunk. He looked at his tail to see it bruised. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Stupid milk crate...</span>\" He said as he heard a boom and looked up to see a gigantic book shutting, the source of the boom he saw, and that's when it occurred to him...seeing Celebi as big as she was. He was smaller than a doll, he was at the size he was this morning. Celebi took up his vision as she gently smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're up finally...</span>\" She said, a boom on his tiny ears as he looked up. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Zorua said...I thought...I wouldn't be this small again.</span>\" He said and she didn't lose the smile. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua did say that but...it's just easier to hide you at this size, and all the same you are still his pet too right now, it makes sense to have you smaller.</span>\" She said and he looked sad at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">...How much longer?</span>\" He asked and she lifted him to her face, he had been resting on her leg he saw, as she was sitting in a chair in...most likely her living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I don't know yet, it depends on how things go for the next little while. After today? We'll more than likely send you on your way sooner than later. I wanted to talk to you though...just us.</span>\" Celebi said and Azurill shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of her from last night entered his mind...her anger was palpable at the time. Being so close to her eyes Celebi did note his fear. She lowered her voice a bit, making sure to be quiet to not hurt his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill, I don't want you to be afraid of me, or Zorua...I want to clear a few things up, both how I feel, how Zorua feels...and how you feel too.</span>\" She said and he slowly nodded. She smiled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">First off...Zorua and I do agree, we won't toy with you. That harsh game we were going to play today...we won't do that. And I won't stick you back in the jar with the cotton and just feed you berries. We'll...get better accommodations for your stay, though you are still ours right now, so I still need you to listen to both of us.</span>\" She said, a little sternly towards the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Second...I want to air out any tensions that there may be. You threatened us yesterday, that was a bad move Azurill...but you're a kid, and I know kids do...stupid things sometimes. I want you to have more forethought in the future, there are consequences for your actions...but I also realize why you feel the way you feel about Zorua and I want you to know he truly isn't a bad pokemon...he's just done some bad things. Things he does regret, even if he has a hard time voicing that.</span>\" She said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He wants to make peace with you...for real. And I want you to do that as well. I know he took something precious from you, but I promise...he has atoned for his actions, more than atoned after what I did to him...</span>\" Celebi still felt that twinge of guilt from the first night she had him. Azurill just took this all in and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I don't know...today when we worked together...I guess I did find myself enjoying his presence a little...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua said you hesitated to help him at first...but he also said that you could've ditched him and didn't.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill nodded and looked at the veritable green goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">He helped me too...he had the plan and masked us with illusions at the home stretch. The run to the forest was exhausting but...his energy, his enthusiasm at escaping...it kinda caught me too.</span>\" Azurill did smile briefly at this but then frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Zorua though...maybe...he had his reasons, maybe he's not as bad as he appears on the surface, but he has hurt me...a lot of other pokemon too. Not like Graveler I guess, but still...lots of pokemon have good reason to hate him Celebi, you know that, right? We don't feel this way for nothing...</span>\" He said and she bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...I do realize that, yes. And I want to protect him in spite of that Azurill, I need you to understand that too...I WILL protect him. It's why I need to make sure you won't talk before I let you go.</span>\" She said and he sighed. The threat was still clear as day. She just smiled gently at him though. She would reward his efforts today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">For now, just consider these things and...</span>\" He found himself set back in her lap as a chunk of chocolate dropped down in front of him. Not much bigger than a crumb in reality he imagined but it was half of his size. A TV flickered to life in front of him too...on some sort of action cartoon he noted. He looked up to see Celebi smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Go ahead and relax for a bit, i'm going to keep reading.</span>\" She said as Azurill took this all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd need to consider a few things...but he, more than anything, still just wanted to go home. The chocolate helped ease his mind for now at least...peace with Zorua? True peace with him?...maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Hey Celebi, what happened to Graveler?</span>\" He asked as he bit into the chocolate and she looked from her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He's...Zorua's to do with as he pleases.</span>\" She said and Azurill shivered at this. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">He's even smaller than you.</span>\" Azurill found it hard to feel sorry for him...all he knows is that it could've been him instead of Graveler...he was at least thankful that they wanted to take mercy on him now.</span></div></div>",

Celebi, though still letting him know that he wasn't entirely off the hook, did seem to want to extend an olive branch to him and have him make peace...she also made him curious about what she had done to Zorua to make him 'atone'...he didn't know if he should ask about that though. At least not her, maybe he'd talk to Zorua about it. If Zorua was serious about being nicer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of TV and Azurill nibbling at chocolate on occasion Celebi smiled as she turned off the TV and turned her attention to Azurill, closing her book. She gently took the remaining chocolate and popped it into her mouth. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You don't need to eat too much...might give you a stomach ache.</span>\" She said smiling down at him. He didn't say anything, but he did give her a nod. He didn't know if she could see it at how tiny he was though. Soon he found himself in her expansive paw as she went back to her room to see...Zorua rolling Graveler around beneath his paw, snickering. Or she assumed that was what she saw, Graveler was almost impossible for her to see honestly. Azurill looked, at the towering figure of Zorua, and...the tiny form of Graveler beneath his paw. Graveler WAS tinier than him...he must've been to Azurill, what Azurill was to Zorua...and Zorua was to Celebi. The whole thing made his head spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked up, grinning at Celebi as she gently smiled down at him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey there~</span>\" She said in a sing song voice as Azurill found himself set on the bed and Zorua was lifted up as Celebi nuzzled him and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey!\" He said, snickering, as he nuzzled her muzzle as best he could, and Azurill took in the giants...his eyes drifted to the tiny Graveler, dazed on the bed as he looked to Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">You gotta help me kid! We gotta...!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Gotta what Graveler...we're powerless right now...and frankly, I wouldn't help you if I could.</span>\" Azurill quietly said as Zorua turned his attention to the two tiny pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid's picked up on it by now pebble, you need to get with the program. You're NOT leaving.\" He said maliciously as he found himself placed back on the bed. Azurill looked up at the giant...he still feared him he found, even after today...though Zorua did let him rest on his back too, that was nice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua however, went over to Graveler and...simply blew on him, the gale force enough to send Graveler flying across the bed where he landed with a thud on the other end of the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even need to TOUCH you to raise hell! And i'm the size of a doll! That's how pathetic you are Graveler!\" Zorua boomed as Azurill whimpered, the words rang in his ears too, and Zorua didn't tone down his voice at all. Even if he wasn't as small as Graveler, Zorua was still quite the monument of power to him right now...it was then that he turned his attention to the tiny blue pokemon near his paws...the giant blue eyes piercing Azurill's attention. Zorua's malicious smile didn't falter as he took in the quaking blue mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right to be scared Azurill...don't forget why you're here...\" With a boom Zorua laid in front of him, and a paw came down. Azurill shut his eyes, but found that what happened he didn't expect...Zorua put his paw behind Azurill and used it to bring him into his chest...was Zorua...hugging him? Warmth and dark fur surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still our pet...but a promise is a promise, I won't torment you...we need to reach an understanding, and that first means talking this over...you threatened me...threatened my girlfriend...and compared me to Graveler...I destroyed the last gift from your mom...mocked you for it...and tormented you in the past day to the point of reinforcing how you feel about me. The pebble put us through hell, but we came out of that together, with teamwork. No more crap, no more fake apologies on either side...let's talk.\" Zorua's voice reverberated through Azurill's being, him being very close to his voice box, but the words were gentle. He was starting to feel misty eyed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi for her part was smiling at the sight...Zorua was finally opening up...this was HER Zorua, the one she knew was in there, and hopefully Azurill would see that too.</span></div></div>",

I shouldn't have done a lot of things and I do know that now.

And...when you destroyed that doll it felt like you tore that one last bit more of her away from me...it hurt, it hurt really bad but...you didn't know, and I guess...you've paid your price too, according to Celebi, and today you and I helped each other...I said some nasty things, I tried to threaten your life yesterday...i've bad mouthed you at every opportunity and to be frank I still don't know if I regret that...but as you are now, maybe you are trying to be better, maybe I should try to recognize that, and maybe you weren't as bad as I pegged you initially...you aren't as bad as Graveler at least, and I don't think you'll hurt anyone that doesn't deserve it now. I think I can try to stop hating you at least...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill thought he had found a good way to voice how he felt and Zorua nodded at this, that was probably the truth of the matter. Azurill was recognizing that Zorua was trying to change but couldn't disassociate his previous deeds from how he felt about the pokemon entirely. But he'd try, and it was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\" Zorua stated before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's done, now...to business.\" He smirked as he eyed the rock at the edge of the bed, looking at the impossible drop before him, no way he could survive the fall from the bed, even with as sturdy as he was. Booms brought him back to reality, as both Azurill and Zorua loomed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You were going to hurt me Graveler...you were going to keep me and make a profit off of me...</span>\" Azurill muttered and Graveler gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">O-open your eyes kid...Zorua is d-doing the same thing!</span>\" Azurill shook his head at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">He's keeping me for...a few reasons. But profit isn't one of them, and he won't hurt me anymore. You...are rotten to the core though, you've beaten me up, you've beaten my best friend up, and you've beaten up many more pokemon...no more. You can't hurt anyone anymore.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill raised his tail over Graveler who shut his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail never descended though and he opened his eyes to see Azurill glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I won't hurt you...you're Zorua's to decide what to do with.</span>\" Azurill said and the dark fox grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WILL hurt you Graveler...but later, it's time for you to go back to your home~\" Zorua boomed as Zorua went over to the center of the bed to get the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveler was roughly scraped into the jar by Zorua's paw and his world shook as once again the jar was upright and he was looking around his glass prison and up at the impossibly high opening where the sun that was Zorua's eye hung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest while you can, MAYBE i'll feed you.\" The glass shook as Zorua pushed the jar away from him and Celebi nodded and put the jar on her nightstand before turning her attention to her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well done Zorua...you too Azurill.</span>\" She smiled as she lifted Zorua up and nuzzled him. Azurill's world shook as she laid back on her bed with Zorua yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bushed...\" He said and Celebi giggled. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's early.</span>\" She said and he shrugged. \"You go through what we went through and say you aren't beat...hey runt, are you still tired?\" He called out to the tiny blue mouse who stared at the massive couple. He nodded a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I am...today was exhausting...</span>\" He mumbled and Zorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over here pet.\" Zorua commanded and Azurill slowly hopped over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprised, as Celebi cuddled Zorua, Azurill was lifted by a psychic force...towards Zorua's paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua held Azurill to his chest, which itself was pretty warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking a nap, you're welcome to as well.\" Zorua said and Azurill found himself falling asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Zorua...how much longer will I be your pet...</span>\" He asked as he started to doze off, and the last thing he heard before falling asleep was...</span></div></div>",

Celebi's heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Zorua. <i>Her</i> Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Celebi abandoned her book and flew into the depths of her boyfriend's forest, heart pounding her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was no normal scream.

The fairy made a mental note to kiss Zorua for that comment in a second moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Celebi glared murderously as she stared at Graveler, who was laying flat at the foot of a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's whole body shook with anger. A beast was awakened inside her, the desire of revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill had just threatened Zorua without doing anything concrete... but Graveler had actually hurt him. And, knowing the type, Celebi wasn't going to have a boyfriend anymore when he was done with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone pokemon slowly recovered, eyeing the seething legendary with blurry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">...

Azurill stared at the green giantess, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she going to do the same to him now...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnymore thoughts they were going to formulate were interrupted as Graveler started to get back on his feet, dazed, hurt, humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was beaten by a girl... well, a legendary, but a girl anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared at Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">You-</span>\" he couldn't finish, Celebi raised a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Get lost Graveler.

Before her eyes, the stone pokemon began shrinking down, until he was the size of a pebble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... I take it back. You're not going anywhere.</span>\" she said, picking the third shrunken pokemon up with psychic - the mere idea of touching him disgusted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her paws, Zorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevenge was going to be sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAKE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveler felt pain and screamed as he opened his eyes... he was still in the forest, with Celebi, Azurill and Zorua...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things changed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was no longer shrunken, he was a veritable mountain... and Graveler himself was smaller than even Azurill was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't see much more, because Zorua's now huge paw was applying pressure on him, causing him to whimper, his stone body feeling like it was going to shatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">My boyfriend Graveler!

He rolled his eyes, he was going to get Zorua killed himself! But...Zorua supposed he was the reason Azurill hated him. Ugh, no way was he walking away from this though, it was way too dangerous. \"Y'know, he could be YOUR pokedoll instead of me!\" Zorua said, hoping to kill two birds with one stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No deal, the bow and top hat stay on you.</span>\" He glared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe contemplated just having Azurill left there, but that would almost be the same as killing him he supposed. That's when he got an idea. He wasn't sure if it was merciful or cruel, but all he knew...it was damn funny. He started cackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him to Buneary then, that'll sort itself out right quick.\" He said giggling and Azurill looked up and wanted to run, but he was still pinned by the psychic force. His life as a doll? That was humiliating! And for Buneary...? He looked up at Zorua's smirk and found himself growing a bit until he was around Zorua's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fate is sealed Azurill! And that fate is frilly dresses!\" He grinned and Celebi rolled her eyes. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill...we can't let you go, but this isn't as bad as you probably think it is.</span>\" She said as she reached down to grab him. He went to run, but didn't get far and soon he was in her arms next to Zorua. Azurill shot him a glare while Zorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you deserve~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Coming from you, that's rich.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at the two bicker and opted to ignore it. Azurill was one of Zorua's victims she supposed, but he had also just tried to leverage that for blackmail so it was hard to feel too bad for him. This outcome was at the very least accommodating, and maybe a way for the two to sort their differences since they'd probably see each other from time to time. She changed her path to Buneary's house and started walking down that path before she reached her destination. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua.</span>\" She said and he put up an illusion over himself and Azurill to look like real pokedolls. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">And Azurill, a peep out of you for attention from anyone other than Buneary right now and you'll be a speck on your own, got it?</span>\" Celebi threatened and he shut his mouth hard. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I've got it mom!</span>\" They heard after she knocked on the door. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">Remember what we talked about today honey.</span>\" They also heard as the door was answered. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh, Celebi! And is that...Zorua and an Azurill pokedoll?</span>\"  She said, her eyes lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Buneary, want to step out for a sec?</span>\" She said and she turned back. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I'm just going to talk to Celebi for a second mom! I'll be right back!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">Only for a minute Buneary!</span>\" She heard and nodded, shutting the door, Celebi was smiling, Zorua dropped the illusion on only himself and started snickering. \"<span class=\"ctan\">That top hat is so cute Zorua!</span>\" She squealed and he stopped snickering for a moment to shake his head...but then got himself thinking about the other situation and laughed again. \"So Buneary...how do you feel about Azurill?\" He asked and Buneary shrugged. \"<span class=\"ctan\">He's...okay, kinda quiet I guess, I had him in a few classes. Why?</span>\" And Zorua stopped laughing. \"...That's boring, I was hoping you hated him.\" He said and dropped the illusion to reveal a very scared looking Azurill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Is that...the real Azurill?</span>\" She asked and Celebi nodded. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">He found out about Zorua...and he was going to tell other pokemon about it, so we kinda did this. We figured maybe you could keep him for right now? I know you like pokedolls.</span>\" Azurill was looking down at the ground as opposed to the giant bunny pokemon in front of him. '<span class=\"cblue\">Why her?</span>' He thought, fighting a blush and she just shrugged. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Sure, I can take care of him! Leave it to me!</span>\" She said as Celebi went to hand Azurill to Buneary, while Zorua just laughed. \"Enjoy hell, blue ball!\" He said as Celebi looked unimpressed by this and nodded to the younger pokemon. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I need to go, thank you Buneary, and Azurill...try to adjust, because this is your life now.</span>\" She said, both to reinforce this and try to get it in his mind to adjust. Soon enough they went their separate ways.</span></div></div>",

Imagine what would have happened if he told your mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celebi seemed to cheer up a bit a she giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">At that point we might be considered Romeo and Juliet... because we'd both be dead...</span>\" she commented with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Celi, that's creepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy sighed as she finally reached her destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told her mom that she had to meet up with a friend in the forest... and that actually turned out to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she recalls, Zorua was supposed to be a lifeless doll in her room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" she said, and he crafted an illusion that made him disappear from eyesight.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good boy.</span>\" she said, and he felt a pair of lips smooching his invisible head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed as Celebi entered her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">So? Who did you meet up with... in the forest?</span>\" Celebi's mom asks, putting a plate of meat and veggies in front of her daughter on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh...</span>\" Celebi said.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Buneary.</span>\" she spoke the first name that sprang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi looks at her daughter.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yeah, but... why in the forest?</span>\" she asked, before assuming a stern look.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey, you do know who lives there, don't you?</span>\" she asks, clearly referring to the invisible fox currently sitting on Celebi's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah yeah, Zorua... last time I met him, he was quite nice though... he changed a lot.</span>\" she praises, one of her paws traveling down to her lap as she scratches his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older time traveler looks at Celebi with a weird look.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Please, honey, tell me you're not going out with him... If he changed, I appreciate that, but still...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blushes as she almost chokes on her piece of meat.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">MOM! There's no way I could go out with Zorua!</span>\" she cries, mentally apologizing to her tiny boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Just making sure.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed in exasperation as she closed her book and her eyes, letting her arms fall onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm?\" Zorua inquired from beside her, his mouth full of a hickory chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I... I can't stop thinking about Azurill, Zorua...</span>\" she admitted, her paws moving to him as she pulled him in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua swallowed and grinned.<br>\r\n\"Just forget about that lose-\" Celebi glared at him.<br>\r\n\"... freaking blabberm-\" her eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n\"... Azurill.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed as she closed her eyes again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know I should... but what if he actually manages to contact someone? What if he talks to Buneary's mom?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Then, you shrink him to a speck, no?\" Zorua inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I dunno...</span>\" Celebi admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny dark type stared at her flabbergasted - he never heard those words coming from her! She was Celebi, the smartest girl in school, probably in the whole village!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in frustration.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I mean, Buneary's mom knows mine... and if she comes talking to her...</span>\" she shakes her head, trying to rid it of all the possible disastrous scenarios that her choice might bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should've let me eat him...\" Zorua comments with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the situation, Celebi discovers herself giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Your mood is improving already!\" the dark type chimed.<br>\r\n\"Look, Azurill is now probably being dressed up by Buneary - whatever he's wearing, I hope it's pink - we won't have to worry about him! Buneary won't let him talk! And he knows what will happen if he does, right?\" Zorua asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi opened her eyes as she smiled at the tiny fox. She leaned down, gently pecking him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... You're right Zorua.</span>\" she murmurs gratefully as she snuggles him further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she sighed again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Though I really need something to relax right now...</span>\" she remarks, before grunting.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I had the perfect day... and Azurill had to spoil it...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stared at his girlfriend in silence for a bit, before grinning again.<br>\r\n\"Look, is there anyway I can help you relax?\" he asked, eager to help Celebi out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Perhaps there is...</span>\" she commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's tail started wagging.<br>\r\n\"And that is...?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I said \u2018perhaps\u2019, meaning that I don't know.</span>\" she admitted. Zorua face-pawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's just think for a bit... we'll come up with something...</span>\" Celebi said as she went quiet, Zorua emulating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of thinking...</span></div></div>",

Zorua?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as a pokedoll of him appeared on top of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy smiled, before looking out of her bedroom. No trace of the pink Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly moved through her house until she reached the bathroom. She stepped inside, closing the door behind herself and locking it, before turning her attention to the bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets Zorua onto the sink and moves towards the tub, turning on warm water. The fairy leans back against the sink and smiles down at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Do we really need to do this...?\" he asked, blushing. She nodded with glee.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I need to relax, remember?</span>\" she recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" before Zorua could even speak, Celebi interrupted.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You promised to help me, and that's exactly what you're going to do~</span>\" she said, removing the bow and the top hat from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark fox sighed as he watched the tub getting filled with steaming water. He could only imagine how hot it was going to be in that tub...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water filled half of the tub, Celebi turned it off, gently sliding a paw into the water. Only to immediately retreat it.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's hot!</span>\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, gently, she slid her whole body into the steaming water, only her head remaining afloat. Celebi sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Man... that's what I meant by \u2018relax\u2019...</span>\" she sighed softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua simply watched her from the sink, and she looked at him with her eyes half lidded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mh~</span>\" she moaned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Get in this tub~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua backed up slightly on his perch on the sink.<br>\r\n\"I'll pass... I'll just watch you.\" he said, finding the situation pretty awkward. There he was, sitting in a bathroom, watching a girl bathing. He could be easily mistaken for some pervert... he just imagined if he was in that tub with Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he discovered that Celebi wasn't giving him a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA psychic force gripped him, and he found himself getting dragged across the bathroom. He uselessly tried to resist the fairy's mind power with his type advantage, but it was for naught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dropped into the hot water of the tub. He emerged, spluttering water from his mouth as he tried to stay afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo strong hands gripped his body underwater, and he found himself being dragged towards the fairy, who hugged him, his head brushing against her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mh~ better~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, feeling like he was on fire. However, it felt strangely nice to be in that tub with Celebi. She was right after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Isn't this nice?</span>\" the fairy chimed, her lower body coming afloat as she floated on her back, setting Zorua down on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like he was in the middle of the sea, on a small island. On a bouncy soft island of pure, endless green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... it is pretty relaxing... once you get used to it...\" he had to admit with a small smile, causing Celebi to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">See?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although I do think this extremely awkward.\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi splashed him with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Zorua complained playfully, before he formulated a devious plan. His eyes glowed, and the water around Celebi suddenly rose up and fell back, onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gave a startled cry, before she realized that the tidal wave was an illusion. She looked at the snickering Zorua.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Why you little-</span>\" she said with a smirk as she grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, her revenge was interrupted by a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Celebi? Are you in there honey?</span>\" the voice of her mom said from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Yes, mom! I'm bathing!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay honey. Be quick.</span>\" the pink Celebi said from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at the door for a moment, before looking back at Zorua. He looked back at her dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered e smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't worry... we're definitely doing this more often...</span>\" she said, her smile becoming a grin.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">In the meantime...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she firmly pushed him underwater, smirking as she watched himself struggling to surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bath lasted for a while. But, eventually, Celebi started to get up, making Zorua tumble into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy started to stretch, before picking Zorua out of the water and and stepping out of the tub, gently letting the fox on the sink again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater was dripping from her body as she went to pick a towel, wrapping it around her form, while Zorua shook himself dry, splashing water everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Still complaining about bathing together~?</span>\" Celebi sang, wrapping a towel around her head too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stretched.<br>\r\n\"Definitely not.\" he said with a grin as he watched Celebi drying herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was dry, Celebi smirked at the small fox on the sink. And, before he could wonder, what she was up to, he discovered that he couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi got closer, reaching for the bow and top hat she left on the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua glared.<br>\r\n\"I hate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi grinned as she started to dress her boyfriend up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No you don't.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What now?\" Zorua asked as the fairy climbed on top of her bed and laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox snickered.<br>\r\n\"By the way, still thinking about Azurill?\" he inquired. Celebi smiled at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nope~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed.<br>\r\n\"So? What do we do now?\" Zorua repeated his previous question. Celebi shrugged.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bedtime Zorua.</span>\" she simply responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type stared at the fairy dejectedly.<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on Celi, can't we do something? It's still early...\" he complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi opened her mouth to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No books.\" he interjected. She tried again.<br>\r\n\"And no board games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mouth closed and she sighed. She thought for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Well... there's TV in the other room... we could watch something...</span>\" she said. Zorua grinned.<br>\r\n\"Cool! Let's do that!\" he chimed, tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I dunno... mom could be still around...</span>\" she pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just use an illusion, no?\" he reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi thought for a bit more.</span></div></div>",

Oh, an Azurill!</span>\" She said, smiling at her. Azurill thought about signaling her, but remembered Celebi's warning and opted to not, he remained in a motionless smile, silent, doing his best to stay still as Buneary told her mom she was going to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world shook once more as Buneary carried him to her room and shut the door. \"<span class=\"ctan\">So...Azurill...let me set you on the bed, I want to try something with you!</span>\" She said excitedly as she did that and went over to her toy chest. She grabbed her own tiny little top hat that she had and a small set of gloves to go with it. Smiling she turned around to see...Azurill curled up into a ball, hugging his tail on her bed. \"<span class=\"cblue\">All I was doing was going to buy sweets with money Wigglytuff gave me...I just happened to see them...why didn't I keep walking...</span>\" He was muttering to himself, almost on the verge of tears.

I won't tell anyone about stupid Zorua so just let me sit here.</span>\" He said as she moved to the other side of the bed to look at him. \"<span class=\"ctan\">What exactly happened anyway?</span>\" She said sympathetically as she climbed onto her small bed with him, causing a quake for him practically as he held firm to his tail. \"<span class=\"cblue\">That dumb Zorua...I just happened to see him like he is talking to Celebi and I confronted them about it. I was going to tell others about him I guess...it's what he deserves right? But Celebi shrunk me down...</span>\" He said and Buneary nodded. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Well you can't go telling others about him, so many pokemon would want to hurt him...</span>\" She said and he glared at her. \"<span class=\"cblue\">He deserves it! You know what he's done to me! To you! To tons of other pokemon!</span>\" And she looked down at him sympathetically, setting the top hat and gloves in her lap as she went to pick him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held him to her face, him struggling a bit and trying to look away from her. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Zorua has changed Azurill, he really has.</span>\" She said, hoping to calm him down. \"<span class=\"cblue\">He was going to eat me until Celebi intervened and she only stopped him because of a bottle of soda.</span>\" He said and she bit her lip. \"<span class=\"ctan\">He's...still new to being good?</span>\" She offered. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Forget it, it doesn't matter anyway, the jerk is in Celebi's good graces and i'm here. Just leave me alone.</span>\" He said struggling and she set him down, only for him to hop away from her to the corner of the bed and curl up again. She remembered that he used to bring a pokedoll of Azumarill to school with him, and one day he didn't bring it and sat on the playground crying sitting on his ball. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Azurill...that pokedoll of yours that he destroyed...that's why you hate him right?</span>\" She said gently. \"<span class=\"cblue\">It was the last thing...it was...</span>\" He was mumbling and she heard sniffling before he went quiet. He wasn't answering anymore. She got up. \"<span class=\"ctan\">You stay with Wigglytuff right? And he was going to let you get something sweet?...I'll be right back, okay?</span>\" She said and left him in his corner to go grab a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was back within a few minutes to see he hadn't moved. Carefully she tore off a bit of it, trying to make sure a bit with a chocolate chip was on the tiny torn off part and she set it next to Azurill. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Here, maybe this'll cheer you up.</span>\" She said as she bit into hers. He didn't move. \"<span class=\"ctan\">You know...this won't be so bad...you'll see. You and I can have fun together, we can play games, and you'll make friends with Braixen too! Who knows maybe...you and Zorua can...I don't know.</span>\" She mumbled. He still wasn't responding. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Wigglytuff is going to wonder you know...he's gonna look for me.</span>\" He said and Buneary looked down at him. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Maybe...try and have that cookie, okay?

He sighed in relief, before starting to bounce over the toy chest in front of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that big, he noted as he proceeded to make a few leaps, before finally gaining enough height to land on top of the toy chest, finding himself in front of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonlight peered inside from the glass as he bounced over the window, wondering how to open it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, casually looking down, he noticed that it was slightly ajar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumb luck, he guessed as he moved to the tiny opening and trying to open it with his tiny arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, it didn't work as his arms were hopelessly too small to lift the humongous window. He ended up being thrown backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Azurill didn't give up. He moved towards the opening again, before placing his tail in between it and the window, before trying to lift it up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it seemed to work as the window lifted a tiny bit... just enough for him to squeeze himself through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a last fit of reluctance, Azurill looked back at Buneary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like she was sensing his plans in her sleep, the bunny started fidgeting...</span></div></div>",

She looked at the pillow he was supposed to be on, and slowly her eyes drifted to the window where he was, his tail still in the window. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Azurill!</span>\" She said, suddenly alert and awake and he tried to squeeze himself through the window. His body was caught though and he found that the window was slowly sliding down on him. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Gagh!</span>\" The air was immediately expelled from his lungs as he felt a great force lifted off of him as Buneary reached the window and lifted it up like it wasn't a big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Azurill that was a bad choice.</span>\" She stated simply as she picked him up, him now sore from the window. She set him back on the pillow before moving her toy chest and shutting her window, making sure it was shut completely. She then glared at the smaller pokemon on the pillow...he gulped. \"<span class=\"ctan\">So what was your grand plan then? Go out there on your own at your size, get squished? Maybe eaten? On your quest to get back at Zorua or get back to normal?</span>\" She said accusingly, he glared down at the pillow, saying nothing. \"<span class=\"ctan\">On top of that you managed to hurt yourself in this grand plan too. Do you know how precarious your position is right now?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">It doesn't matter...all that matters is getting back to normal and making sure Zorua gets what he deserves.</span>\" He muttered, and she just glared back. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Azurill, you're not going anywhere, and there are two ways we can go forward. We can either be friends, or you can be a prisoner. You seem focused on being the second choice.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Because I already AM the second choice!</span>\" He snapped back. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I'm not here by choice! I'm here because you're all sticking up for one of the most vile pokemon around!</span>\" At this point there were tears in his eyes. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Y-you all think he's going to change? To be better? After what he's done? That's ridiculous!</span>\" He stammered out and Buneary went back over to the bed to pick him up. She was conflicted on what to do with him...he had his reasons, she knew that, but what he did was dumb, reckless, and for the sake of spite against one of her friends. But said friend...had given Azurill ample reason to feel the way he felt. She was conflicted. Did Azurill deserve this? She doubted it, but he was spurning her at every chance she tried to give and it was getting on her nerves. </span></div></div>",

He didn't like his situation, not one bit, and he had no intention of spending the rest of his life like this, but his options to get out of it were limited. It was essentially escape, which would be next to impossible now, or make peace with Zorua and his friends, which made his blood boil. For now though...he'd at least try to make peace with Buneary. He didn't want to make his stay more miserable than it had to be he supposed. He tried to squirm out of her grip to find that he was held tight. He just had to wait for her to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and he heard her stirring from above. She slowly opened her eyes and was about to go to stretch her arms before she remembered the little pokemon she was holding. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Azurill.</span>\" She groggily said before he felt her shifting and he was just standing on her bed as she set him down to stretch up. Man...she was huge...no, he was just small. He mentally cringed. '<span class=\"cblue\">I don't like this...</span>' but he pushed it down. He had to deal with this for now. She gave him her full attention now and gently lowered her head down to him, making him bounce back a bit. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Are you still hurt?</span>\" She asked, and he did feel a bit sore...but nothing too bad he supposed. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I'll be fine.</span>\" He muttered. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Still wanting to escape?</span>\" She asked. He considered his options before he shakily said. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I don't intend to spend the rest of my life like this...but I won't try to escape again...</span>\" He muttered. She considered this before nodding. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Okay.</span>\" She gently reached out a hand to pet his head. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Let's try and make today a good day.</span>\" And she heard a call. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">Buneary, breakfast!</span>\" And she got up off the bed. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Coming mom!</span>\" Before she looked back. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Just stay there and i'll bring you back some food.</span>\" She said and he nodded. He was hungry he had to admit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill was mindlessly bouncing on his ball tail, bored. He couldn't open the window, and he couldn't even get to it now that she moved her toy chest away from it. He heard someone approaching the door before it opened to see Buneary again, smiling at him. \"<span class=\"ctan\">You're still there.</span>\" She said happily and he shrugged. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Where would I go? I can't get out.</span>\" He stated simply and she smiled. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I suppose that's true. Here...I brought you some food.</span>\" She said as she uncupped her paw to show him...scraps of a sausage and egg. He had to admit...it did smell good. He reached out for the sausage bit and took it in his stubby paws and started to munch on it. She gently set the egg down next to him as she went to her toy chest, waiting for him to finish. He hungrily munched on the egg once he finished the sausage, just glad to fill his belly before he finished up and sat back on his tail, sighing. Buneary giggled a bit at the sight. \"<span class=\"ctan\">So Azurill, I was thinking...let's try something.</span>\" She said as she pulled the top hat and gloves out. Azurill looked confused for a second before becoming filled with dread and turning away from her to try and bounce away with his tail. \"<span class=\"cblue\">NO!</span>\" He yelled as he bounced away only for a paw to come down in his path. \"<span class=\"ctan\">It won't be so bad~</span>\" She said and he couldn't stop himself from bouncing into her paw as she gently stopped him and picked him up, to put the top hat on him. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Hmm...</span>\" She looked at his stubby paws. The gloves may not work. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh well, the hat is cute at least.</span>\" She said and he tried to shake it off, but she had secured it around his head. He started to bounce in her paws trying to reach it with her paws, but he couldn't get to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I just want to go home...</span>\" He said as he started to sulk in her paws and she looked at him a bit sadly before taking the hat off. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Okay Azurill, we won't do this for now.</span>\" She said, gently setting him on the bed...she needed to find something to get his mind off of it, before she heard her mom again. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">Hey Buneary, Braixen is here and wondering if she can talk to you.</span>\" Buneary perked up, Braixen might be able to cheer Azurill up, she can cheer anyone up! \"<span class=\"ctan\">Yeah, of course!</span>\" Buneary responded, and soon the door opened to reveal Braixen. \"<span class=\"corange\">Hey, Buneary, how's it going?</span>\" She said cheerfully and Buneary nodded. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Great!

I bet he DOES look adorable with the hat... and Celebi mentioned a bow~</span>\" Braixen told cheerfully, snickering at the thought of being able to tease Zorua all day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary smiled. Zorua was definitely nice now, she enjoyed his company... and he was the reason of Azurill's shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary quickly recalls that Azurill intended to blackmail him... so, she should tell Celebi about Azurill's failed escape and how it was going between her and him... in private of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen didn't know about Azurill, and she had to remain in the dark. Buneary wasn't sure she'd like the news...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the duo reached their destination. Braixen grinned a she knocked at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen knocked again, receiving the same response: silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Maybe they're not inside...</span>\" Buneary said.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I don't think so. Celebi didn't mention she had something to do...</span>\" Braixen suddenly grinned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">But maybe she went out to buy pokedoll clothes~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Braixen and Buneary know that Celebi was in reality still asleep, Zorua cuddled to her as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was unusual of her - she always was an early bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the knocks at the door caused her to murmur in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Mooom... go get the door...</span>\" she said, rolling over her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever was at the door kept knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Zorua... go get the door...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knocking still didn't quit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an annoyed sigh, Celebi let go of Zorua as she got up, hazily moving through her house to reach the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy rubbed her eyes, before yawning and opening the door, finding Braixen and Buneary waiting outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Oh... Braixen, Buneary...</span>\" she told, yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen looked surprised.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You just woke up?!</span>\" she asked, recalling that at such hour Celebi was usually up and perhaps reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded, yawning again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua and I went to sleep quite late... he got obsessed with TV...</span>\" she smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I guess that sleeping with a sleepyhead is contagious...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary giggled, Braixen rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... Yeah. Anyway, you two wanna hang out?</span>\" she asked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sure... let me wake roomie up~</span>\" she said, walking into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen and Buneary heard her talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, they heard screaming mixed with giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Celebi came back. Holding an annoyed-looking Zorua, who was wearing a bow and a top hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hi Zorua~ good morning~</span>\" Buneary sang. He mumbled something incomprehensible in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hi Zorua... nice bow~</span>\" Braixen snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill sighed as he bounced around, bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost likely, Buneary was punishing him for his attempt to escape by leaving him in a closed room. Alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... at least he was able to jump off the bed again and could move around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's words kept floating in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Try to adjust... this is your life now.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again. Was this really going to be his life now? A mere doll in Buneary's paws, unable to call for help because of the threat of being shrunk even further and left by himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">This is all my fault... why didn't I ignore Zorua when I saw him tiny...?</span>\" he said, bouncing to the window and staring at it longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the toy chest, he had no hope to reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was trapped for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot looking at the door, he didn't notice it opening slowly. But he luckily heard it, and he was quick to drop to the ground, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Buneary's mom, Lopunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly walked in the room, setting a basket with clean sheets on the bed, before casually gazing at the 'pokedoll' on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">When will that girl learn to put her toys away...?</span>\" she mumbled, before kneeling to pick Azurill up and putting him on the bed, before starting to replace the bedsheets with the clean ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Azurill pondered asking for help... but he quickly recalled that he'd better shut up if he didn't want to be a speck on the ground in a giant world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill choked back a sigh as he just laid there motionless, faking his best smile as he watched Buneary's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Buneary, how's-\" Zorua stopped to look at Braixen, who returned his gaze.<br>\r\n\"... Your mother. How is she?\" he awkwardly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped in a secluded area after walking for a while, and Zorua caught the moment to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary looked at him, understanding what Zorua meant.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh... she's fine.</span>\" she replied, before looking at Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">... Celi, can I tell you something?</span>\"  Buneary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, sure. What is it?</span>\" Celebi said, pretty much expecting what Buneary was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded slightly as she handed Zorua to Braixen and went to the bunny, lowering her head against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So? What do you want to tell me?... Is it about Azurill?</span>\" the fairy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary nodded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">He tried to escape... and he got injured when he did.</span>\" Buneary admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hmm.</span>\" she told.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Next time It happens, just tell me... I'll make sure that he won't try funny things again.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary nodded, before the two looked back at Braixen and Zorua<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm. NOT. Cute!\" the dark type cried in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled as she snatched him from Braixen and nuzzled him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yes you are~</span>\" she chimed in whatever conversation they were having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary giggled; Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Mom!

You two - together?!</span>\" Buneary cried in excitement as she skipped towards the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blushed and merrily nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Since when? How? Thatissocute~!</span>\" Buneary cried as she merrily skipped around Celebi while they headed into a random direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill felt sick as he was being carried by the overexcited bunny; Zorua, on the other hand, was in a state of deep embarrassment, between having to wear the bow and hat, having to deal with an overexcited Buneary blabbering about him and his girlfriend and having to keep an illusion over himself and Azurill to make the two of them look like actual dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, if Azurill didn't tell about him, Buneary would be the one blowing his cover though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Remember the other night's sleepover?</span>\" Celebi responded to the bunny's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Ohh~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup... will ya stop talking about it, now? Seriously, this is as risky as it is embarrassing...\" he told, causing Celebi to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I actually do think that it's nice... you two seem to like each other a lot...</span>\" Azurill chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And you're right!</span>\" Celebi responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed.<br>\r\n\"You're a doll kid. Act like one.\" he told while Celebi pecked him on a cheek.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're adorable when you act like you aren't just a little doll in my hands yourself~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn't he resist the power of Celebi's kisses? He could be still in bed, sleeping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't ya too big to carry pokedolls? Just let me go home...\" Zorua huffed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nope~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Buneary kept walking down a casual road, occasionally stopping to glance into shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Speaking of, Buneary, did you tell Braixen or your mom about Azurill? I mean... I know you're pretty close to them...</span>\" Celebi said at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny shook her head as she skipped forward.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">No... I simply went out when Braixen came to call me... I don't know, did you try to contact mom, Azurill?</span>\" Buneary asked to her tiny passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook her head... 'forgetting' to mention that he thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded, before deciding to change topic.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I should buy some gloves to match the hat, Zorua~</span>\" Celebi chimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Zorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"Waste of money, Celi~ no hands~\" he retorted as he held his paws out, happily thinking that he finally found an accessory that Celebi couldn't buy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary giggled as Celebi sighed in defeat.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm still buying you something else - and I swear you'll have to wear it.</span>\" she responded playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">You know, I did the same with Azurill... couldn't use the gloves on him though...</span>\" Buneary recalled, the quiet mouse in her paws blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Buneary... that's humiliating...</span>\" he told in embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Nope~ it's cute~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"Get used to it kid~\" he chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked down to scold her boyfriend... when she suddenly bumped into someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh... sorry...</span>\" she said, stepping back, noting that she actually bumped into...</span></div></div>",

Just because Zorua is smaller than a little kid doesn't mean he is one.</span>\" Braixen said and Celebi then realized her flub. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">W-well we don't need Zorua seeing that junk right?</span>\" She said grinning and Braixen just looked at her confused. \"<span class=\"corange\">Didn't you let him watch something like that the other...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gengar's Gruesome Gambit!

We should have standards!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Says the girl that works with Gardevoir to try to drag me to every other sappy romance movie...</span>\" Braixen said as her eyes slowly went over to Buneary, and she notices something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hey Buneary...that's a new doll isn't it? Don't think I saw you have that one before. Azurill huh? That's kinda funny, I heard that Azurill...went...Celebi?</span>\" She grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Y-yeah?</span>\" Celebi asked nervously, trying to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Is that...?</span>\" Braixen folded her arms, looking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Yeah...let me explain!</span>\" She said as she motioned Braixen off the street and the group went in an alley way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So that's it huh?</span>\" Braixen said. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, he threatened us and so I shrunk him, we're keeping him on lockdown for a bit, but he seems to have mellowed, him and Zorua are bonding over mutual dress up sessions already~</span>\" Celebi said teasing as Azurill and Zorua glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...At least I didn't have to wear a dress...\" Zorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">...At least i'm not wearing something right now...</span>\" Azurill shot back, getting a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">They seem fine, I don't get why you don't just let the kid go.</span>\" Braixen said shrugging and Celebi looked down. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">He just apologized today...it seems a bit premature, plus, this way they can do more than apologize, but maybe become friends, right? You want to be friends with Azurill, right Buneary?</span>\" Celebi smiled and the bunny nodded before petting the tiny blue pokemon, who seemed to flush red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">You too, right Azurill?</span>\" Buneary said as he sighed. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I am kinda enjoying this, hard to deny it...I just kinda miss Wigglytuff and the others...</span>\" He said and Celebi nodded. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Just hang in there a bit more, okay?</span>\" She said smiling and looking to Braixen. She had heard the kid had gone missing, but...it was weird, Wigglytuff didn't seem to be looking for him or anything, she had heard it from Swinub. She supposed it wasn't causing much of a stir in the village, which was...odd, but there was Azurill himself. He seemed to be getting along right now and wanted his size back, but he didn't seem to be taking it THAT hard either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere things fine right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">...I kinda like scary movies...Wigglytuff doesn't let me watch them though...</span>\" She heard Azurill mutter and she kinda smiled a bit at the small pokemon.</span></div></div>",

She opened the door and ran, the purple bat chasing after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJynx kept running through the castle, many Zubat coming out from the shadows to try and bite her. However, she managed to evade them all and ran towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point though, she tripped over her own skirt and fell face down on the hard, stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Run Jynx, you can make it!</span>\" Buneary shouted as screams erupted around her and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">She won't!</span>\" Braixen chimed.<br>\r\n\"Not with the Count right behind her!\" Zorua said excitedly, eyes glued to the big screen. He turned around to face his girlfriend, whose lap he was sitting on.<br>\r\n\"Whaddya think Celebi?\" he asked, noticing that she had her paws over her closed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Is it over?</span>\" she asked. Zorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"Yes~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi slowly removed her paws to see Jynx hiding in an apparently quiet, dark room of the castle. She looked around in darkness, before spotting two yellow eyes staring at her from the shadows... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before she could think of screaming, Count Crobat flew forward, his fangs sinking into her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams of fear erupted inside the movie theatre. One of them belonged to Celebi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I HATE YOU ZORUA!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox found himself being hugged hard to her chest, while the screen displayed rain falling down from the sky, thunderbolts enlightening the dark forest around the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>That was so cool!</b>\" Braixen and Zorua said in unison as Celebi stumbled out of the movie theatre, followed by the small group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy glared at her boyfriend.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... No more Count Crobat for me...</span>\" she says, trying to shake off the images of what she just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And more for me!\" Zorua chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">It was... ehm...</span>\" Buneary tried to say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Horrible. But so cool!</span>\" Azurill chimed in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was genuinely surprised at how much fun he had. Wigglytuff didn't let him watch that kind of stuff, and he truly enjoyed every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're talking, kid,\" Zorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Honestly, did you see how he avoided sunlight by covering himself with his own cape? It seemed like people were going to kill him... and he escaped! He actually did!</span>\" Braixen chimed with sparkles in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when Mr. Mime tried to attack him but got bitten and turned into a Zubat?\" Zorua asked, rising his paw and high-fiving Braixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please stop talking about it... I feel - hey!</span>\" Celebi said as she looked at Zorua, taking notice of something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Weren't you wearing your hat and bow? Where are they?</span>\" Celebi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, must've lost them~ told ya to not let your guard down~\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at him in silence for a moment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You know I'm simply replacing those, right?</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Have you got money with ya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi quieted down for good. She had spent all her money for the ticket... a total waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Celebi?! Outsmarted?!</span>\" Braixen stated in shock, causing Zorua to start snickering.<br>\r\n\"Nobody can outsmart ME!\" he self-praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi glared.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Just wait until we get home... I swear the next bow I buy you is going to be pink.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua simply shrugged.<br>\r\n\"It won't last long anyway~\" he said cheerfully as the small group started moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">So? Had fun Azurill?</span>\" Buneary asked as she slipped home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Yeah! It was amazing!</span>\" he chimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit, yesterday he wouldn't have even wanted to reply to Buneary... and there he was, enjoying her company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Glad to hear that~</span>\" she said, opening the front door of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Mom~ I'm home~</span>\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">Hi honey! Enjoyed your day?</span>\" Lopunny asked her daughter, who nodded gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">See? Was it hard Zorua?</span>\" Celebi asked her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting rid of the bow and hat? Nope~\" he snickered from her paws, causing the fairy to frown.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Very funny.</span>\" she said, glaring daggers at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... And no, I meant bonding with Azurill.</span>\" she continued, deciding to let it slide... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shrugged.<br>\r\n\"No, I suppose... kid's fun to be around when he isn't being a brat.\" he responded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Same goes for you~</span>\" Celebi sang, smiling again, causing her boyfriend to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned down to peck him... without noticing a pokemon coming their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Zorua did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi opened her eyes... to find herself kissing a pokedoll while Smoochum walked in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink pokemon blinked a few times, while Celebi blushed as she stopped.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, Smoochum... hi there.

It hadn't changed but...Azurill was missing and Wigglytuff was his current guardian, correct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Um...Wigglytuff, have you seen Azurill lately? I noticed he isn't around...</span>\" Celebi said, wanting to see his reaction. Smoochum looked like she was about to cry hearing that. The pink bunny stopped in his tracks and sighed. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Is Swinub still telling pokemon? Azurill...he...they found his body yesterday morning, Swinub is going around telling people that he's missing but...i've been trying to keep it quiet around the village, for the kids sake, but he's going around making a fuss...need to have another talk with that kid...</span>\" He mumbled and Celebi blinked. What...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't line up with...anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Anyways, it's getting late for you too, right Celebi? You oughta head home too!

You're tiny and he could take you out easy.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow me back, i'll mask myself with illusions. I'll be back at your place soon.\" Zorua stated and Celebi bit her lip before setting him down and growing him up. Zorua disappeared almost instantly to her, but he figured he was on the move. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">...In the meantime then...</span>\" Celebi smiled a little, she was going to her stash of money at home and heading to the pokedoll shop. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">A nice bright pink...that'll do nice~</span>\" She thought as she went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part was following the two pokemon back to his house. A nice little two story abode with multiple rooms for kids to share. 'What a nice little house ya got...freak.' Zorua thought as he saw it, holding back a gag. Wigglytuff opened the house, going in and Zorua narrowly squeezed in himself, being careful not to touch either pokemon or the door. Wigglytuff sent Smoochum up to bed before he looked around to make sure things were secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got on the phone and dialed a number, tapping the table impatiently. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey...yeah? Yeah it's me...the fake has been found? They bought it? Good! Good! I'll head down tomorrow to grab your cut then!...Can't believe they say don't get life insurance for kids, that's leaving money on the table when you raise so many!</span>\" Wigglytuff chuckled and Zorua's mouth hung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That...that...!' Zorua thought before shaking his head. He needed to get out of here but...Wigglytuff would notice the door opening and closing right? \"<span class=\"cpink\">Look...I gotta go, gotta go talk to Swinub...brat won't keep his yap shut.

He's already told all his kids that Azurill is dead!\" Celebi's mouth hung open. \"Well...if you want to think about it in another way, I guess we COULD'VE kept him at that size forever and no one would've been the wiser...\" Zorua mused before shaking his head to see Celebi moving past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where are you going?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">To Buneary's.</span>\" Celebi said, an edge of anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that's a bad idea Celi.\" And she didn't stop moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Celebi, that's an ACTUAL bad idea!\" And she stopped to turn around and look at him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">What, do you want me to grow Azurill back in a few days, none the wiser, and send him back to Wigglytuff saying 'surprise!' only to find out his friends thought he was dead and Wigglytuff faked his death for money!?</span>\" Celebi said, mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you plan to tell the kid NOW, after a day like today, where we made peace?\" Zorua said and Celebi bit her lip. \"Wait on it...hell, maybe don't grow him back, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What!? And how would he react to that!?</span>\" Celebi said and Zorua sighed. \"How about...we wait on it until another day, it's late, okay? We can discuss it later...rationally.\" He couldn't believe he was being the voice of reason right now and she sighed.</span></div></div>",

She gently set him down as she stretched, him looking at this giantess extend her limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cblue\">She also...kissed me...</span>' He thought, he was processing this bit of info differently than the rest. It's true that he had seen her at school...but he was always too shy to really make friends there, and Buneary...he shook his head. None of that mattered right now, and she certainly had no clue about him, she was just trying to reassure him with that kiss, nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">So Azurill...feeling better?</span>\" She asked gently, interrupting his chain of thoughts, he looked down. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I don't know how I could Buneary...it's...a lot that you're asking me to accept...</span>\" He muttered as she nodded. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I know it is...</span>\" She gently pet his head. \"<span class=\"ctan\">But today, we're not going to worry about that, okay?

He slightly backed away, slightly put off by the sudden closeness of her face. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Why...what can I even do there? Aren't you worried about taking me out in public anyway...</span>\" He said dejectedly and she got a serious look on her face. \"<span class=\"ctan\">We can do lots there Azurill, you'll see. This size...you don't need to let it get you down okay! We're going to have fun!</span>\" She smiled at him as she rose up from looking at him. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I'll be right back...okay?</span>\" She walked away, leaving Azurill on the bed as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there for a bit. '<span class=\"cblue\">I can't do this for the rest of my life...</span>' He thought. He looked at the window, before shaking his head. It was a hard position to be in...he had grown to like Celebi, and he thought he liked Zorua...Buneary...he sighed a bit before sitting on his tail. Soon Buneary returned and looked happy. \"<span class=\"ctan\">So um...my mom gave me a little bit of money too, so we can get a treat as well!</span>\" She said excitedly as she picked Azurill up, and saw the look on his face. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Please...let's just...try and have fun, okay?</span>\" She hugged him to her chest as she went to leave the room. He put on his best doll face as they passed Lopunny. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">Be careful honey, and have fun!</span>\" He heard her call. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I will, thank you again mom!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Buneary...I can't do anything here...</span>\" Azurill whispered from her chest as they approached the park. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Of course you can! We just need to find it.</span>\" She looked around before her eyes landed on something. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Imagine how fun a slide would be for you right now Azurill?</span>\" She said, trying to get him into it, as she approached it. He gulped. \"<span class=\"cblue\">S-seems...a bit dangerous...</span>\" He muttered, but she gently kept him to her chest with one paw as she used her other paw to help her climb the ladder. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Of course not, I have you safe and secure little guy! Just wait, I bet it'll be a blast!</span>\" She said as she approached the top and Azurill looked down...he felt like he was on top of a giant city building right now. It was...dizzying. \"<span class=\"cblue\">No, really Buneary, I don't knoo-aaaaaahhHHHHHHHHH!</span>\" He was cut off as he went down the slide with Buneary giggling as she went down it with him. They landed almost as quickly as it began with Buneary laughing and Azurill breathing very heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Wasn't that fun Azurill?</span>\" She smiled down at him. \"<span class=\"cblue\">...it was TERRIFYING!</span>\" He yelled before she shushed him. \"<span class=\"ctan\">We're in public...please don't attract attention...</span>\" She said, he nodded. \"<span class=\"cblue\">...but...yes, I did think it was thrilling too...</span>\" He said and her smile grew wider. \"<span class=\"ctan\">See, we can find stuff to do.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had less success finding other stuff besides the slide, which they did a few times. She did get on the spinner with him, but all it did was make him nauseous and uncomfortable so she opted to not revisit it. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Hmm...we shouldn't be out too much longer...listen, let's go get an ice cream cone and head home, okay Azurill?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">...sure...</span>\" He said from her chest, he wasn't trying to talk much, if to respect Buneary's wish to keep quiet. He didn't think seeking attention would be to his benefit, even if he didn't quite think Celebi would shrink him to nothingness if he tried to get it at this point. '<span class=\"cblue\">I don't think I want to rat them out but...I want to go home...</span>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">So...i'll let you pick the flavor, if you want?</span>\" Buneary said gently as he looked down. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Sherbet...</span>\" He said as she smiled. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I like that flavor too~</span>\" She giggled as she went to approach the stand. He put on his doll impression while she was buying it, and soon enough they were sitting on a bench. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Go ahead Azurill.</span>\" She said as she lowered the cone to him, it was...huge. He took a few licks, then she raised it up and did the same. \"<span class=\"ctan\">See, isn't this nice?</span>\" She said as she lowered it again. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I guess...kinda...</span>\" He said after he finished licking it another time. They say there for a little while, going back and forth until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Swinub, you need to accept it. It's hard for all of us...but...</span>\" Wigglytuff's voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">No! I just can't believe it...I can't...</span>\" Azurill's eyes started to water, and Buneary took notice. 'Oh no...' She thought, but she didn't know what she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I...saw him today Swinub, before they cremated him...please Swinub...you're making this harder for everyone, we have to accept it and move on. It's what Azurill would want.</span>\" The gentle voice was like a vice grip on Azurill's throat. '<span class=\"cblue\">I'm here!</span>' He wanted to shout, but he couldn't form the words as he felt a dizzying rush come and go through his head. They were...telling the truth, the whole time. Zorua, Celebi...that meant...Wigglytuff had really faked his death and...he was hyperventilating at this point and Buneary gently held him as she set the cone down. It was almost gone anyways and she had more pressing things to think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Swinub...here, we need to go home, you need to consider how your actions and constantly bringing up Azurill makes you and our family look in public...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">But...but...</span>\" Soon the voices faded as Wigglytuff led Swinub away, them having never seen the tiny Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I can't imagine Azurill...I really can't, I need to ask you to stay quiet, it's a selfish request I know, but...it's better for you too.</span>\" She whispered but the words didn't even register in Azurill's mind. He wasn't making any words anyway, Buneary gently got up as she held him close to her chest and went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Azurill, please...</span>\" He was wailing in her room, absolutely streaming down tears all over her bed. \"<span class=\"cblue\">W-why? It's true! He-he-</span>\" Azurill was hiccuping at this point as he flopped face first down onto Buneary's sheets. He didn't want to see anyone, he didn't want to talk to anyone, he didn't even want to be. \"<span class=\"cblue\">This is scary! I want to go home! I don't want to be small! I want to play with Swinub! I want to talk to them again! I want to ask Wigglytuff why he did it! He must've had a reason!? A mistake!?</span>\" Buneary bit her lip. This was far worse than any of the previous tantrums he had...she found it hard to blame him for feeling the way he felt though, but all the same her mom might hear him if he kept this up.</span></div></div>",

The room he was in...was dark, with a dim light emanating from the corner of his eye...a TV...a giant TV. He groaned a bit as he started to get up and he felt a gentle force touch his head, the TV was muted at that point he noted. He looked around to see...Braixen, and her finger stroking his head. \"<span class=\"corange\">Hey...</span>\" She said gently and he looked down.

As for what happened that night...what you did...is in the past, it's regrettable but you made peace with Zorua and moved on right? Dwelling on it...it'll only make you feel worse.</span>\" She said and he tried to look her in the eye. \"<span class=\"cblue\">But it caused all of this...me being tiny...my friends thinking i'm dead...my life...it's ruined.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hey now, none of that.

Take care, okay?</span>\" He turned around to keep running, towards a flash of light. What was in it...he wasn't sure.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill slowly opened his eyes to see that he was facing the giant sleeping face of the older pokemon he was staying with. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Braixen...</span>\" He muttered before he thought about his dream again. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Bye guys...i'll be okay...you might never know it...but I will be.</span>\" He muttered. He sat up, seeing light creeping in through Braixen's window and he waited for her to wake up. He enjoyed the quiet of the morning, using it to gather his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to live with Buneary...he'd have to be still when her mom was around, but he'd manage. She was kind...and sweet...and pretty...and...he shook his head. Okay, he would make his peace with Zorua and Celebi too. No one could have predicted what Wigglytuff would do...they probably would turn him back if they could but...as it stood, he'd make friends with them. And Braixen...he figured he'd be seeing more of her as well. She hung out with Buneary often, right? From what he gathered they seemed close, almost like sisters despite Braixen being quite a bit older than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...4 friends, right? Okay...none of them had done anything to hurt him at least...well, Zorua threatened to eat him, but that was a more hostile situation between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Yeah...i'll be okay...</span>\" He said more sure of it this time before he heard the fox behind him stirring. He turned to see her stretching her arms up and yawning. '<span class=\"cblue\">So big...</span>' Azurill thought before her eyes fell on him. \"<span class=\"corange\">Oh...morning Azurill...come on, I said i'd swing by Buneary's with you right? Let's grab some breakfast and head over.</span>\" She said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill was doing his doll impression as Braixen knocked on the door, in case it was Lopunny that answered, though it was Buneary who was at the door. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh...Braixen! Azurill! Don't worry, my mom is out, you can stop pretending!</span>\" She said and he let out a sigh. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Feeling better?</span>\" Buneary asked and Azurill, though he looked away for a sec, slowly nodded. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I've...come to terms with it. I don't begrudge this...</span>\" He muttered and he found himself being handed to the giant bunny before she pulled him to her chest in a hug. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I'm happy...don't worry, i'll take care of you Azurill.</span>\" She said kindly as she went into the house, Braixen following. \"<span class=\"corange\">So...how's it going bun?</span>\" Braixen asked before they reached her room to see...</span></div></div>",

I mean, it's kinda what I am...by choice, but hey, giant hugs, you don't need to stress about the outside world much, all you can eat...\" Zorua grinned. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Dumb clothes...</span>\" Azurill finished and Zorua laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit kid. Dresses for days for you.\" Zorua joked and Azurill chuckled a bit, before sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna be okay?\" Zorua asked and he nodded. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Yeah...yeah, I will...</span>\" Azurill used his tail to wipe his eyes before he felt Zorua's paw pat his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. And hey, if you need anything then i'm here, as are those girls in the next room. Buneary, she'll take care of ya...Braixen too, she'll probably let you get away with more than Wigglytuff ever did...and if you want to torture yourself Celebi told me to tell you that she'd be willing to lend you books or teach you.\" Zorua shivered at this and Azurill chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">That's...nice, really Zorua...though I can't help but be curious...you and Celebi huh?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua scratched at his ear. \"Yeah, she and I hit it off after I pranked her and she almost killed me. What can I say, i'm an endless well of charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill laughed a bit at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won you over, didn't I?\" Zorua grinned. \"Come on kid...I wanted to talk with you one on one, make sure things are cool...and hey, if you want to hang out, you and me...i've got your back, when they go back to school too...i've got ya.\" Zorua grinned at him. \"You need a best bud, right?\" Azurill looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Never would've imagined this...</span>\" He mumbled, but when he looked up he saw Zorua had moved, he was walking towards the door. \"Things are good!\" He yelled, and soon the room was populated by the three giant pokemon. Celebi picked up Zorua and Buneary picked up Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Glad we've got that sorted.</span>\" Celebi smiled. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Did you extend my offer?</span>\" She asked and Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">He said whenever I want to torture myself just go to you.</span>\" Azurill said and Zorua looked at him, with a look of mock betrayal. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh really? That's fine...Zorua, I brought something...</span>\" She said grinning as she pulled out a frilly hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azurill, pro tip, don't rat me out like that. Another pro tip, pay attention to me if you ever need to worry about making pokedoll clothes disappear.\" Zorua said as the hat was placed on him. \"Because this thing won't last.\" Braixen and Buneary laughed at this and Celebi hugged him a bit closer to her chest. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">We'll see.</span>\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill found himself laughing.

Why?</span>\" the fairy asks.<br>\r\n\"Just do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded her head and gently lowered herself, placing the tiny fox on the floor before cupping her paws together. Slowly, the two paws parted, a cyan ball forming in between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gave the ball a gentle push as it hovered towards Zorua, who closed his eyes, his body assaulted by a pleasant feeling as he grew in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was back to his height, Zorua opened his eyes, got a grin and removed the now normal sized frilly hat from his head. He looked at Celebi defiantly as he dropped it on the floor and unceremoniously kicked it under Buneary's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi glared as she went to look under the bed... only to find that the hat was gone. She sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You know I'm going to replace it, Zorua, you'll have to give up sooner or later.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark fox snickered, before turning his attention to Buneary.

I'll show you how much fun we can have, kid, even at that size.\" he suggested, gently snatching the blue mouse with his muzzle and launching him in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill landed on top of the fox's head after a short flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Aw...</b>\" the three girls cried in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed, but grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on tight kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group quietly walked down the road, Azurill riding on Zorua's head.<br>\r\n\"Let's go to my forest,\" the fox suggested at some point, glancing back to the girls following him.<br>\r\n\"We can have fun there... whaddya say ki- uh?\" Azurill was missing, he noted when he looked up. His red tuft seemed to be shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You again? When will you understand that you're not welcome here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua groaned as he looked forward to meet the always-hostile gaze of Wigglytuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instantly felt hatred growing, but decided to play it cool... for Azurill's sake... and, more importantly, for the sake of himself and Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Go choke on a carrot, will ya old, overgrown rabbit?\" he retorted, earning a death glare from the large pink and white pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why you-</span>\" Wigglytuff stepped forward, but stoppe as Celebi flew in between him and Zorua.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wigglytuff...</span>\" she started calmly, fighting the urge to shrink the rabbit to a speck... there he was, publicly menacing her boyfriend, after what he did to Azurill... thanks to him, Azurill had no more life. The thought of shrinking him and crushing him was really tempting... or better, let Zorua pick a proper fate for him - his devious mind never ceased to surprise her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... No.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff was a jerk, and an evil fraud, but he still raised kids... even though it turned out he didn't care about them at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Let us continue, Wigglytuff. Leave us alone.</span>\" she warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill peered through Zorua's black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff forced a smile - getting on Celebi's nerves wasn't very wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, you can continue Celebi dear... but Zorua, I just want him to understand what he does is wrong...</span>\" Celebi clenched her fists, her eyes started glowing menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fairy was soon pulled back by Braixen, who started pushing her forward without saying a word, but giving Wigglytuff a gaze of pure hatred. Buneary followed the fox, Zorua walking behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe too glared at the pink pokemon, who glared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Scram.</span>\" he said venomously.<br>\r\n\"... Make sure you lock the door tonight,\" Zorua told as he started to walk away.<br>\r\n\"Or ya might find one nasty surprise tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">He didn't even talk about me...</span>\" Azurill told dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget him kid - he ain't worth it.\" the fox he was riding on told, indignant.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I still can't believe it... he seems so nice and is such a... a...</span>\" Celebi couldn't finish her sentence, her teeth gritted in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">A monster who only cares about money.</span>\" Braixen finished, Buneary nodding timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group quieted down for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they finally reached Zorua's forest.

Soon, the ground started shaking as the girls and Zorua spread to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had given him twenty minutes to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to win the game, Azurill waited until the area was clear before starting moving...</span></div></div>",

'<span class=\"cblue\">I think i've got this...</span>' He thought when he bounced back a little bit into the bush only to find that he had lost his footing. Startled he wanted to look down only to find that he was sliding into darkness. He stifled a scream as he didn't want to give his location away just yet and he found himself tumbling down until he landed on his face in what appeared to be...a hollowed out tunnel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Whoa...</span>\" Azurill said as he peered down the tunnel. To a normal sized pokemon it'd probably be a tight fit to crawl through, but for him...he could easily walk down it if he wanted, he looked in as his eyes adjusted to the low light to find...discarded wrappers, cans...whoopee cushions, tacks, paints, all kinds of things to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">This must be one of Zorua's tunnels...</span>\" Azurill muttered as he felt himself stepping further and further into it, he couldn't help but be curious.

He kept walking, it getting darker and darker before he saw something that made him gasp, and nearly made his heart stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was...tattered...torn...half falling apart but...there it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Azumarill doll. His mom's doll that she gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">My doll...</span>\" He said, almost not believing it before he ran towards it, it was hard to see with the low light but...it had stuffing falling apart, bite and claw marks from where Zorua ripped it up in front of him...dust and dirt, all of that. His doll was in a sorry state...he also noted that it was bigger than him now. He ran himself into it, trying to hug it and bury his head in it, he was sure he got stuffing in his mouth doing it but he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">It's my doll!</span>\" He cried into it happily, laughing. He was thrilled in the moment to have found it. If nothing else, he was sure that Zorua would at least give it back now, right? He stayed there for who knows how long...it could've been minutes...it could've been hours, he didn't know...he almost felt himself drifting off with the comfort of his doll until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a muffled voice above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill!...okay, we give up! You can come out now!</span>\" It was Celebi, sounding slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Azurill!

I fell into a hole!</span>\" He yelled out, not sure if they'd hear him. There was a moment of silence before he heard a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where he is! Hang on kid, i'll come get you!\" It was Zorua's muffled voice. About a minute later Azurill felt tremors below him, he hugged his body closer to his doll before he saw Zorua's face smiling at him, his eyes piercing the darkness. \"Hey kid, how'd you find this pl-\" Zorua cut himself off as he saw Azurill clinging to his doll. He let off a sigh. \"I still had that huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You don't seem to clean up very well...</span>\" Azurill said shakily. \"<span class=\"cblue\">But...I found it...and I want it back.</span>\" Azurill said a bit more firm and Zorua's face softened. \"Well it was yours in the first place...here, get on my head...i'll bring it back up with us, okay?\" Zorua said as Azurill reluctantly broke his grip from the doll and hopped over to Zorua's giant head, climbing onto it. Zorua picked up the doll in his teeth and slowly crawled back out into the daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I don't think that thing is very sanitary...</span>\" Celebi said. She was gently trying to dissuade Azurill from it, but he wasn't budging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I don't care! It's my doll!</span>\" Azurill said back and Celebi sighed. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">It can't be good to keep around Buneary's house...if Lopunny sees it she'll throw it out.</span>\" She said and Buneary nodded. \"<span class=\"ctan\">She definitely would.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's his doll right? Just let him have the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're only saying that because you feel guilty about what you did to it.

Or fixed, you really want to just toss it? After you shrunk him down and said you'd grow him back, and then let him know you can't.

And Celebi looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Low blow Braixen...</span>\" She mumbled before her eyes landed on the doll on the ground that Azurill was clinging to, as if his life depended on it. \"<span class=\"cblue\">It was my mom's...</span>\" He muttered and she sighed.</span></div></div>",

Oh, that's Espurr's house.</span>\" Celebi said simply as Braixen and Buneary passed it, Buneary looking surprised. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Wow, she lives in a nice house...</span>\" She said as she held Azurill to her chest. They kept walking until.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">This is where she lives.</span>\" Celebi said simply to the giant mansion with the music note statue in front of it. Zorua's jaw dropped. \"Wh-wh-you know all these loaded pokemon!?\" He said and Celebi rolled her eyes with a smirk. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I don't visit her often, like I said, she enjoys her solitude...she just happens to owe me a favor.</span>\" Celebi said as she approached. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Um...should I hide Celebi?</span>\" Azurill asked and she smiled. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nah, she won't say a word about you or any of this.</span>\" Celebi said as she knocked. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">If anything she'll be happy to meet you. She probably wants to know who she's helping.</span>\" They waited for a few moments before the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">I wasn't expecting visitors...oh, Celi~</span>\" A melodic voice called as the door opened to reveal Meloetta. \"<span class=\"chunter\">And friends?</span>\" She finished as she saw the group behind her. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Meloetta...can I ask you a favor?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">I think I can fix it~</span>\" She said as she saw the torn doll. \"<span class=\"chunter\">But I need to ask...just what happened~</span>\" Meloetta said seeing the tiny Azurill, the infamous Zorua, and the torn doll with Celebi. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's a long story...and not one that I want to get out much...</span>\" Celebi said and Meloetta smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">You know you can trust me to keep a secret~</span>\" Meloetta said as she got materials. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay...i'll explain as you work.</span>\" Celebi said and Meloetta looked at the group and smiled. \"<span class=\"chunter\">Let me show you all something while you wait~</span>\" She said as she got up to lead them somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez...this place is fancy...\" Zorua commented as they walked through the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Definitely...it puts Espurr's place to shame...</span>\" Braixen muttered as they followed Meloetta who opened two double doors to reveal...a giant indoor pool. \"<span class=\"chunter\">You're all welcome to it if you want~</span>\" She said as the group stared in awe at it...except Celebi. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm gonna stick with you for now Meloetta...I do want to let you know what's going on...</span>\" Her gaze traveled to the tiny Azurill in Buneary's grasp. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I...have another thing I want to ask you too...</span>\" She said. It was an idea she got as they were walking to Meloetta's but...the more she thought about it, the more she thought it may be for the best...for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, that tail is way too convenient.\" Zorua said looking at the tiny Azurill who was lounging on his own floating tail in the pool. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Oh please, the trade off isn't worth it...I have no paws...</span>\" He said and Zorua scoffed. \"Until you're a Marill when you get to have both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I'll be too big for my tail then!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that big...\" Zorua remarked with a smirk and Azurill gave him a deadpan look. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Really?</span>\" He said, unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">I see...you found a boyfriend Celi~</span>\" Meloetta said as she worked on the doll. \"<span class=\"chunter\">Good for you~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It has been nice, but...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">It leaves Azurill in a pickle, doesn't it~</span>\" Meloetta said and Celebi nodded. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">The kid came at us and...I might've overreacted in shrinking him down like I did. I was going to grow him back when he apologized but...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Hmm~ The fake body and Wigglytuff...that's just depraved.</span>\" Meloetta didn't seem to say that in her usual tone as she frowned slightly and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">I think I know what you want to ask me, am I right~</span>\" Celebi looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You...like kids. It's why you have your profession, right? And you can't...have any either...Buneary can't keep him forever, Lopunny might find out, and there's the matter of her going back to school in a few months...he'd be cooped up in her room all day most likely, or Zorua would keep him company but...here...he'd have a degree of freedom, no one would bother him...I can't grow him back, but I want him to move forward with his life. You're the best one I can think of to help him with that.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">I see~ Hmm hmm hmm~ done~</span>\" Meloetta said as she held up the good as new Azumarill doll. \"<span class=\"chunter\">As for the other thing~</span>\"</span></div></div>",

But she offered to take him in...she seemed really nice, but he had just made peace with Zorua, with all of them and had fun today, and the day they all hung out. But...he thought back to when he didn't like them, when he was just cooped up in Buneary's room. Aside from him being bitter and mad...he was bored, he was trapped and he didn't like it. Sure he could hang out with Zorua, that would be nice too, but...every day? There was also Lopunny to consider, if she came in the room to clean it for a long while if Buneary was at school...when Azurill needed to go to the bathrom, or got sick...and Zorua wasn't around, what'd happen? He shook his head and looked at Meloetta's eyes. Something in them...reminded him of her. He looked down. He knew his choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I-I'm sorry Zorua...what Celebi is saying...makes sense. I'm out of the way this way right? And I can...live my life in peace like this.</span>\" He said and Zorua looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, I don't want you out of the way anymore.\" Celebi was letting him talk now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I...If it's not a problem...can I stay?</span>\" Azurill asked Meloetta who closed her eyes and hugged him. \"<span class=\"chunter\">Of course dear~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Buneary's turn to look down as Meloetta turned her attention to her and Zorua. \"<span class=\"cblue\">You're welcome to visit, when you'd like~ He's a friend right~</span>\" Meloetta smiled and they looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I might.\" Zorua said, indignant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He will.</span>\" Celebi smiled. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">He's just being pouty.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I will too.</span>\" Buneary smiled. \"<span class=\"ctan\">It's...okay Azurill, I understand.

Of course I know them!</span>\" He said happily and she pet him a bit. \"<span class=\"chunter\">I've been writing for about 8 years now~ Probably when I was around Celi's age actually~ I'm always happy to hear kids talk about how much they enjoy my stories~ Usually through letters~</span>\" She smiled before she returned to her work and Azurill tried to look. \"<span class=\"chunter\">No peaking~</span>\" She said gently and he stopped. \"<span class=\"chunter\">I'll read it to you when i'm done with it though okay~</span>\" She smiled sweetly and he nodded, instead leaning against his doll.

They had parted ways with Buneary and Braixen - the first had to go home to have lunch with her mom, the other had a \u2018super cool new movie I gotta watch!\u2019 much to Zorua's excitement and Celebi's exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yep... I can't stop thinking about this Zorua... and I feel guilty...</span>\" she admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You two were getting along so well... and I've suggested he went to live with Meloetta... all because of that jerk Wigglytuff...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiled softly.<br>\r\n\"Celi, don't feel guilty - you've done much for me... too much. I mean, new home, life, friends and...\" he grinned.<br>\r\n\"... You. Azurill... he was nice to be around after all... and if you didn't shrink him, this all wouldn't be happening but... let's just say, the life you took from him, you gave me. You're one good pokemon.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked down... before glancing back at her boyfriend with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sweet talker.</span>\" she said, leaning forward to peck his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed as he snickered awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So? It's just me and you now... what do we do?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi thought for a moment - what could she and him do now that they were alone?</span></div></div>",

On Wigglytuff...I can't let this go.</span>\" Celebi finished and Zorua smiled, then he grinned, then his entire face contorted into a sinister smile as he laughed. \"Aha! Oh, oh yes! Yes I would love to do that Celi! I've wanted to do that pink bunny a solid one for a loooong time, and these past few days have only fueled my desire even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wow...you're into it.</span>\" Zorua's face calmed into a mere grin as he snickered. \"Oh, yes I am.

And we're bonding right now! Just us!\" And Celebi rolled her eyes but smirked. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Aye aye prank master.</span>\" She said with a mock salute as he kept digging and she watched, sipping an iced tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Just don't pull a muscle...</span>\" She said smiling as he continued to work. He had been at it for a while, and she had to admit he was pretty speedy in digging the hole. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">How do you get out of this after you dig it anyway?</span>\" Celebi asked, and he answered without turning. \"I had a ladder system or something similar that I could disassemble before my victim fell in. This time I figured...I dunno, you'd levitate me out?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ah, I gotcha, so you're relying on me to get you out then...seems wise.</span>\" She teased and he looked at her as she took an innocent sip of her tea. \"...Why you...\" He muttered as he kept digging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hole itself was located not terribly far from Wigglytuff's home, but it was in a relatively isolated area, the location of it was vital. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Why the rock and paint?</span>\" Celebi asked at the giant boulder Zorua requested and the bucket of black paint. Zorua started snickering. \"I gots an idea~\" He said in a deviously sing song voice and Celebi smiled at him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're enjoying this way too much.</span>\" She said and he smiled back. \"You want to nail him too, it was your idea. Trust me, you'll think this was worth it when we get to tell Aurill.\" Zorua said as they started towards his house. \"Okay, now we get quiet...i'm going to be pulling some serious work with my illusions on this, i've got you covered there, you just need to do your part.\" Zorua said and she nodded before Zorua used his illusions to make her invisible to the naked eye. She floated up to the window to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"clgreen\">Wow, Zorua was right on the money...</span>' She allowed herself a small giggle at her terrible pun as...she saw Wigglytuff counting money at his desk. She waited for her opportunity...and waited...and waited, until. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah, i'm coming...</span>\" She heard his muffled voice from the other side of the window before seeing him get up and leave the room. She gently opened the window just a bit before she levitated the money away from his desk and to the window, holding it in place. Zorua saw this and nodded to himself, so far so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited until he came back in, and it took him a moment to notice that his money wasn't at the desk. \"<span class=\"cpink\">What the...</span>\" He saw the window and Celebi immediately made her move as Zorua masked her aura to make it seem like...wind was carrying his money out the window, bill by bill. The look on Wigglytuff's face was one of pure horror as he ran for the door and soon slammed the front door of his house open to chase the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Got him!' Zorua thought, smiling, as the money was leading him right to his little hole in the ground, that Zorua had masked over with a green tarp to match the grass. At night and in a panic, Wigglytuff would have no hope of telling the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Zorua silently followed him, and soon, they heard the crash as Wigglytuff fell into the pit. Zorua nodded and the money unceremoniously fell into the pit with him. Wigglytuff was in a frenzy as he ran to each bill, picking it up and collecting them all, barely noticing his predicament until he had them all. He sighed in relief before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...What the hell? What is this?</span>\" Wigglytuff said before he looked up to see...an absolutely devious looking Zorua. \"My my, I knew you were fat, but the ground collapsing beneath you? Maybe you should eat more carrots.\" Zorua grinned and Wigglytuff started fuming, before starting in an ice cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You...you've made the biggest mistake of your life you piece of-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know if you can call me that bunny boy, ya see, I might be a piece of...work, but you, oh you take the cake. And with that...i'm going to bid you a fond farewell in your little hole.\" Zorua gave him a mock look of sadness before turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW YOU-</span>\" Wigglytuff was cut off by a rumbling as the rock was moved by Celebi's psychic force over the pit, essentially trapping Wigglytuff down there and leaving him in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE, YOU'RE THROUGH ZORUA! THROUGH! I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN IN YOUR FOREST! I'LL GET A GROUP! YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET THIS FOR EVERY SECOND YOU HAVE LEFT OF YOUR MISERABLE LIFE!</span>\" Wigglytuff kept going as Celebi bit her lip, Zorua whistled a happy tune as he grabbed the paint brush in his mouth and wrote out on the boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Here lies Wigglytuff</i></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>The ground could not support his massive generosity</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua put a paw to his chest and bowed his head in a mock display of grief before he started rolling with laughter and started to walk away from the pokemon that was STILL hurling out insults and threats. \"Nighty night~\" Zorua said in a sing song voice.</span></div></div>",

For now though...ya got a jar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff sat in his glass prison that stretched up and up. He whimpered as he curled up and looked around.

She wasn't sure if Meloetta would approve of what she did...or what may happen to the pink dot in this jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff for his part was scared out of his wits as the world swirled around him in a cacophony of movement and sound among these gods. He heard the voice of a pokemon he didn't recognize and had no idea what was about to befall him, but he heard the name...Azurill. Celebi had said it. So...this was where Azurill was, he surmised. Which meant...he needed to figure out a way to win the kid over to his side again, should be easy enough. Zorua destroyed his doll and Wigglytuff raised him after his mom died after all, he had no doubt that the two of them could figure this out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Ah, Azurill~ I believe he's in the library reading~</span>\" Meloetta said and Celebi's eyes lit up as Zorua looked at the ground. \"I gotta have a talk with that kid...\" He muttered as Celebi playfully smacked him with a free paw. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hush you.</span>\" She said teasingly as they followed Meloetta. They took note that...all the doors in her mansion were open. Probably to give Azurill free access. \"So how's he working out so far?\" Zorua asked and Meloetta smiled. \"<span class=\"chunter\">Oh, he's a little sweetheart~ He likes to be around me and he loves to explore~</span>\" She said as they entered the room to find...he had bounced his way up a chair and up onto a table and was reading a book comically too big for him. He was intently moving down the page with his face to it before he bumped the book with his tail to jostle the next page, and he caught it in his teeth to turn it. \"Smart kid.\" Zorua noted and Celebi's eyes were lit up. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's adorable.</span>\" She said, and Azurill heard their voices at this and turned around excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Zorua! Celebi!</span>\" He said happily as the two giants came over to the table to greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">He sounds...happy to see them!?</span>\" Wigglytuff fumed as he felt himself placed on the table. Azurill was a giant to him he noted as well, though still far smaller than the gods that had been tormenting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reading...really?\" Zorua said in mock disappointment and Azurill just smiled. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Yeah, it's a great book!</span>\" And Celebi patted his head with a finger. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">What's it about?</span>\" She asked and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">A village is beset by a bunch of Unknown pokemon and a cosmic horror rips their lives apart! It's an anthology horror series!</span>\" Celebi's smile faltered a bit and Zorua howled with laughter. \"Maybe I SHOULD read sometime!\" He said, though Azurill just looked confused as their reactions seemed to swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Um...anyway, we brought someone here with us...if you don't want to talk or confront him that's okay, we can leave and take him with us to deal with ourselves but...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figure you'd want a crack at him, scope out the jar bud!\" And Azurill turned his attention to it. He approached it and gasped as he made out...the tiny Wigglytuff that looked horrified at the center of the jar. He was puny...even to Azurill. Azurill slowly closed his eyes and let out a sigh, he opened them and responded...</span></div></div>",

If he ever managed to grow back to his size - improbable because Celebi was the only one showing such prowess as shrinking or growing things and living beings - he couldn't tell anyone about what they did, because the couple would reveal the fraud with no hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, frankly, he didn't think they were letting him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua wouldn't want to let this chance go, he figured with a shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an explosion echoed, muffled by the thin glass of the jar... but it was in reality the door of the library opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a blue mountain was placed in front of the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse stared down at the pink rabbit with a mix of pity and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azurill...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I tried... but you deserve whatever they have in store for you.

Let's stop in my forest Celi. We'll think about what to do there.\" the dark fox suggested as the couple walked past Espurr's mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo sat at the foot of a big tree, the jar placed in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So... whatever do we do with him?</span>\" Celebi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"We could let him go.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at him questioningly. Wigglytuff perked up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Please!</span>\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We <i>could</i> let him go, Celi...\" Zorua repeated, ignoring the faint cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy stared at him for another moment... before she smiled in understanding.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh... we <i>could</i> let him go... but we have no intention of doing so, am I right?</span>\" she asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At all~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff's world shook as the jar was picked up by Celebi, who put an eye closer to it as she tried to see the look upon the rabbit's face: desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wigglytuff Wigglytuff Wigglytuff... what do we do with you? We could let you go back to your kids...</span>\" she said teasingly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But first, I want to know what Zorua thinks about you... Zorua?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate his guts.\" Zorua responded, and Celebi giggled as she neared the jar to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I think he dislikes you...</span>\" she whispered mockingly, before the giant couple started laughing, Wigglytuff feeling terrified instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">N-No, seriously,</span>\" Celebi stuttered, unable to control her laughter.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What do we do with, him Zorua?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox grinned.</span></div></div>",

Celebi shut her book to go get it only to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Hi miss...have you seen Wigglytuff...</span>\" It was a group of kids that greeted her.

He had deserved his fate, she was firm on that...but...she needed to reign in her shrinking trigger finger.

They might see Zorua! And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Would that be bad? Of course it would! It could lead to her shrinking them down too and...but then maybe Azurill and them would be fine, but then they'd be in HIS boat...She bit her lip again.

You're going to be our pet!\" he told in a mockingly solemn voice that successfully scared the pink rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Please!</span>\" he shouted, but the duo either didn't hear him or ignored him as Celebi got up, grabbing a hold of the jar.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now that we decided... let's go home Zorua.</span>\" she said, before looking at the jar in her paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hope I don't trip over something you.</span>\" she warned playfully as she started walking, Zorua hurrying to catch up with the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff felt sick... and not only because each step Celebi took made the jar he was trapped in vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he going to spend the rest of his life as a pet to these two gods?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... he brought that on himself, he sourly realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day lazily went on quite uneventfully... for Celebi and Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped in his jar, Wigglytuff could only watch as the duo occasionally shook his prison and laughed as they watched him being thrown back and forth within the glass confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink fairy that was Celebi's mother was off to work, so Zorua had opted to remain to his size inside of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we get to have more fun.\" he told to Celebi, who agreed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, the sun had left its place in the sky and was replaced by the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff was silently sitting in his solitary jar, watching as the couple snuggled in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was currently reading a book, head resting against Zorua's and one arm wrapped around his neck; the fox was instead munching on some chips while drinking from a soda bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Save some for later, Zorua.</span>\" Celebi told, and he nodded.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... it's way better when I'm tiny... I can feast on these!\" he said cheerfully, causing Celebi to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua then eyed the jar on top of Celebi's desk.<br>\r\n\"Hey Wigglytuff, I bet you're hungry... I bet you want one of these~\" he chimed, waving a chip in front of his own face before biting it and snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff watched the fox eating longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe WAS hungry... although he feared asking for food to the two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if reading his mind, Celebi sighed and shut her book to look at her boyfriend.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Give him one Zorua... at least the crumbs. He needs to eat after all.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at the half-devoured chip in his paw, before taking another bite, leaving a few crumbs onto his red paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering, he leaped from the bed and, balancing on three legs, moved closer to the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinnertime, bu-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door. Zorua looked alarmed - there was someone in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Celebi terrified, and her eyes glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey, it's me! I'm home!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed. Her mom had the keys to the house, she forgot... instantly, she sprang back to alert as she eyed the still big Zorua, who disappeared behind an illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in time as the door opened to reveal a pink Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother of Zorua's girlfriend stepped in the room.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hello honey~</span>\" she said cheerfully as she moved to the bed to hug her daughter, who awkwardly returned the hug, knowing the Wigglytuff and Zorua were watching...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's eyes shot open as she looked at her desk - the jar was still there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invisible Zorua noted Celebi's alarmed look and followed her gaze, noticing the still visible jar... he forgot to make it disappear as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's earlier fears were becoming reality - if her mom noticed the jar, it'd be the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing her daughter looking at the desk, her mom broke the hug and looked in the same direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, a jar... why is it here Celi?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked away.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ehm... I... uh... needed it. For an experiment with the... uh... microscope...?</span>\" she told, before realizing how wrong her sentence was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua face-pawed as he watched the pink time traveler moving towards the jar, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Really? I want to see~</span>\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi desperately looked at the point where the invisible Zorua was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox gritted his teeth - Celebi's mom had seen the jar... but not its prisoner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to be quick.</span></div></div>",

Oh yes, he'd navigate this treacherous territory. Hell, the body was in the forest right? He was definitely pinning it on Zorua now. The mansion came into view as he ran up to it and snuck to its side to open a window.

However, at such a small size the water was a mere droplet, which instantly sucked in and consumed his body. Azurill stared as Wigglytuff flailed about, just barely breaking out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Be careful with water at this size,</span>\" Azruill mentioned, not being able to stop himself from smiling sardonically as Wigglytuff coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Rrrgh...</span>\" Wigglytuff groaned and used Metronome again.

Let it be and don't worry about Igglybuff, we'll take care of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Stay the hell away from my daughter, you little creep!</span>\" Wigglytuff shouted defiantly as his fingers lit up, instantly draining him of all his powers.

The others were regular-sized, but the blue Pok\u00e9mon was way too small, there was no way he'd survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azurill...

Her expression became one of absolute panic as she suddenly leaned down towards the two shrunken Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">WHAT DID YOU DO?!</span>\" she screamed with such ferocity that both Azurill and Wigglytuff were blown away by the sheer force of it. Tumbling through the air with his light body, Wigglytuff could hear another roar approaching. Apparently his size had done nothing to dminish the size of this attack. Since floating came natural to balloon Pok\u00e9mon and he wasn't really in the shape to walk anymore, he twisted his body and managed to slam straight into the panicked Azurill. Mustering up the last of his powers, he used Protect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Mom?!</span>\" Celebi asked with a frightened voice as the pink Celebi hugged both her and Zorua close to herself, erecting a Barrier around them.

He couldn\u2019t breathe...Wigglytuff was psychically choking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cpink\">He\u2019s my hostage. You\u2019re gonna let me go if you don\u2019t want me to-</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t get the chance to finish as he felt a stranglehold on his own throat. He reached for his throat as he floated, struggling to breathe. He felt dizzy and couldn\u2019t maintain his hold on Azurill any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small blue mouse was trying desperately to get air as he floated there, his eyes shut tight, when he felt the hold on him stop. He started gasping and choking for air as he felt himself fall. His fall was stopped by a soft surface and he found himself pressed against a warm soft surface. He opened his eyes, still choking to see a wall of pink. The older Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cblue\">Thank you....</span>\u201d He choked out. She didn\u2019t say anything, nor did she take her gaze off of the speck before her as she glared death at it. The giantess merely hugged him tighter to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff was trying desperately to breathe as slowly, he floated closer and closer to her face. \u201c<span class=\"cppink\">My daughter...you attacked my daughter Wigglytuff. And attempted to hurt a child in front of me after attempting to kill him earlier today...you\u2019re going to face my wrath personally now!</span>\u201d!She spat with venom. She was a vengeful goddess before the speck.</span></div></div>",

And that pokemon over there you're trying to choke...</span>\" she pointed to the pink speck floating in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time traveler's grip had lessened, though it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi looked at the rabbit angrily.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yeah... he did <i>that</i> miss...</span>\" she pointed to the destroyed mansion behind there, before her finger landed on top of the still startled Azurill's head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And this... he attempted to kill this poor child...</span>\" she said softly, the blue mouse still gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit stared with an amused look - the kid was feeling strong emotions too! - before she turned her head to Wigglytuff, playfully shaking it.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I wonder how such a tiny pokemon could be such a troublemaker...</span>\" she said, one of her tails rising and swinging back and forth, its tip gently but repeatedly slapping Wigglytuff across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Here, let me fix this~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill, who had finally stopped coughing, felt his fear waning and felt oddly serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Mesprit with curiosity. The new giantess smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Thanks miss...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You're welcome, sweetheart... but you are probably wondering why I am here, right? I feel your curiosity~</span>\" she asked, turning her head to Wigglytuff once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom nodded as Mesprit began to explain,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">... I felt his intense emotions... It was an incredible rage! Rage, hatred, I doubted someone could feel something like that! And now, it's fear... he's terrorized to massive levels~ oh, wait, now he's creeped out, by me I must assume...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill psychically held by the time traveler, Wigglytuff stared at the newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust who the hell was this...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom nodded a few times.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay... so, why are you here? I doubt you've came from...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Far.

I'd like to have him instead of you killing him. He won't be bothering you anymore... oh, now he's hopeful.</span>\" Mesprit explained, and the pink pokemon in front of her looked confused as did Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Miss, he's a true monster...</span>\" the blue mouse timidly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">It's undeniable sweetheart... I mean, he did that... I'm still wondering how...</span>\" Mesprit said, pointing to the destroyed house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom stared at the pink dot in front of her murderously. He looked exhausted, he had been trying to get free from the psychic grasp of the pink giantess... however, she was holding him quite firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time traveler gave a quick squeeze, causing him to cry in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... There's three more pokemon in the house. They're unconscious... my daughter... he almost killed my daughter...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit shook her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">This keeps getting worse for you, huh?</span>\" she asked, briefly floating around the pink dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff kept trying to slide out of the psychic grip on his neck.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm s-sorry...</span>\" he stuttered, trying to use the least amount of oxygen left in his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">No you aren't... you're just scared for your life... but nice try~</span>\" she revealed, still savoring all of his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear, hope, repressed anger... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let... Let me go... with m-miss h-here...</span>\" he pleaded, feeling like he was about to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You don't have a say in the matter!</span>\" Celebi's mom shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Yet... please, miss, give him to me... I'll make extra sure to punish him for all of his crimes before I start having some actual fun with him...</span>\" Mesprit said as she eyed her desired prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff stared at the pink and blue goddess... she wanted to use him as a toy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was better than being killed in these dire circumstances, he thought, shrunk to a microscopic height, by the hand of a fairy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom closed her eyes, in an attempt to decide what to do with the pink rabbit... she wanted to kill him for all his crimes... but then, what would she teach to her daughter? Killing solves problems? She usually tried to teach Celebi the opposite thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as friendly as this expectant legendary was, she was a total unknown pokemon. Why should she just give Wigglytuff to her...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">It's...</span>\" she sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Not up to me.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat...? She was trying to kill him and now it wasn't up to her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Confusion~ Anger again~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Azurill...</span>\" the blue mouse looked at the pokemon hugging him questioningly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You deserve to pick his fate... because of him, you're legally dead, and you were about to be  dead for real always because of him... so, you more than anyone, even more than Zorua, deserve to pick a proper fate.</span>\" she said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked at his former legal guardian. Celebi's mom was letting him decide which fate Wigglytuff was going to face... but then again, the rabbit saved him from that Draco Meteor, no? He could be merciful with the rabbit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Who attempted to use him as a hostage when Celebi's mom stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azurill...</span>\" Wigglytuff meekly tried, still hovering in midair. It wouldn't be long before he passed out from the lack of air.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Remember... all the great times we had together...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mind of the young mouse flashed with memories. They came in couples, good memory, bad memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff buying him ice cream... him trying to kill him in the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff complimenting him on a trick... him trying to choke him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff hugging him... him destroying his new house and almost killing all the pokemon he loved the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill thought long and hard, but in the end gave his response.</span></div></div>",

They couldn't simply treat him like a toy, they couldn't kill him like nothing was, they couldn't let a brat decide his fate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't going to have any of that. The grip of the pink Celebi had weakened enough for him to breathe... and move slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, he started wagging his finger, much like he had earlier. Azurill suddenly looked at him... his eyes locked on the wagging finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff smirked at him. Azurill looked alerted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Ma'am-</span>\" the blue mouse couldn't finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright light was released from the pink speck as Metronome picked Flash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinded, Celebi's mom, Azurill and Mesprit covered their eyes. The pink Celebi released her psychic grip on the pink rabbit, who landed on the ground... his rubbery body broke his fall as he hastily got up and started running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything was better than facing these crazy pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom opened her eyes and snarled, while Mesprit giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh~ Fun~</span>\" she chimed, savoring the adrenaline coming from the running rabbit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'M GOING TO EXTERMINATE HIM LIKE THE BUG HE IS!</span>\" the elder Celebi shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Mom...?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to see Celebi, Zorua and Meloetta walking close to the trio, looking extremely dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at Azurill.<br>\r\n\"Kid... what's going on...?\" he asked, his mind trying to process the past hour. He looked at Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"... Who's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Mesprit~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Wigglytuff escaped!</span>\" Azurill blurted out. Zorua's eyes widened as he looked around.<br>\r\n\"Bug...!\" he exclaimed, immediately darting away, chasing the pink dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group behind him looked at him running in the night for a moment, before they all snarled - giggled in Mesprit's case - as they followed the dark type fox. Azurill was quickly handed to Meloetta as she flew up, hugged the mouse to her chest and started chasing the one pokemon that destroyed her house and almost killed her beloved Azurill... she was going to make Wigglytuff pay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">My house! Azurill!</span>\" she said, seething.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">My daughter!</span>\" Celebi's mom added.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Get him Zorua!</span>\" Celebi screamed, and Zorua sped up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">This is so fun~ your emotions are so...</span>\" Mesprit moaned, savoring the rage emanating from the crowd as she too followed Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Wigglytuff, he kept running through a forest made of blades of grass. He had to reach the actual forest... maybe this size worked to his advantage after all, the angry giants couldn't find him easily. In the forest, he'd have plenty of places to hide, and then he would have to just reach the village, get someone's help... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced back - Zorua was on his tracks... he forgot he could see in darkness too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Damn it!</span>\" Wigglytuff cried, speeding up while cursing his overgrown stomach... maybe he should have eaten more carrots for real...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was he thinking about that now?! He needed to get away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua chased after the pink dot - he was sure he saw the grass moving as the extremely tiny bunny passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, Zorua leaped in the air and landed... finding he missed his target. And the grass had stopped shaking. The dark type fox sighed - where that pink rabbit was...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile searching for Wigglytuff, Zorua casually glanced to the side... and saw Espurr's mansion. The lights inside were on... Espurr was a mind reader...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned.<br>\r\n\"Ya hear me, Wigglytuff? You're doomed!\" he shouted at top of his lungs as he quickly shifted his location from the grass to Espurr's front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, the other pokemon finally managed to catch up. Many of them wondered what Zorua was up to, but Celebi smiled - it was a good plan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua knocked at the door impatiently, waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Coming...</span>\" the voice of his probably best friend rang, deadpan as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, revealing a small psychic type. Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Zorua, then at the group behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, reading the mind of the dark type, she gently stepped outside, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Espurr.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... He wants to get to the village... get help from someone...</span>\" Espurr revealed, picking up on Wigglytuff's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... That doesn't help dear, where is he?</span>\" Celebi's mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr focused. Then, she turned to Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Your forest...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Espurr was done speaking, Zorua darted off in direction of his forest, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Find him Zorua!</span>\" his girlfriend encouraged from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox snickered, needing no further encouragement - Wigglytuff was doomed, he knew each and every inch of that forest. One quick noise, and it was going to be the end for extremely tiny rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the pink tiny rabbit finally reached his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sweating, panting... but he was close to getting help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny bunny hid in a bush to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the giants he left behind had no chance of finding him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya hear me bug? You've dug your grave! I'm going to find you!\" Zorua's voice rang, followed by a devilish snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff gritted his teeth as he felt the ground beneath him quake as Zorua moved to find him. He had no chance of finding the little bunny. There were to many places to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut little did Wigglytuff know that Zorua knew his forest like his fur...</span></div></div>",

Wigglytuff felt his heart pound and he gulped as he huddled down to the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that meant he was beneath notice right? Safe from his gaze...he had to be. He was breathing erratically, he knew that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part was having a tough time locating the speck of a pokemon, but he wasn't about to let the little piece of scum escape. He had done far too much to earn the ire of him and his friends and they were counting on him to find Wigglytuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Zorua said nothing of bringing him back to them. He grinned, Wigglytuff was his prey...this was his forest. And Wigglytuff would pay dearly for thinking it would give him sanctuary against its master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua made all the bushes in the vicinity start dancing as an illusion, something simple to rile the bunny up and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">AAH!</span>\" It was a small, tiny squeak to Zorua, barely discernible with the wind if he hadn't been listening for it, but he looked towards one of the dancing bushes with malice as he ceased the illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff felt the tremors grow stronger and stronger until they were close. He whimpered, he couldn't believe he had screamed like that, he couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice spoke, dangerously close, a whisper to Zorua and a threat to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out now or i'll destroy the bush with you in it speck.\" The voice intoned and slowly he came out. He saw the legs, rising higher and higher into the air of this great titan. This...this...impossibility. He whimpered and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry...</span>\" He said and Zorua rolled his eyes as he lowered his face as much as possible to Wigglytuff, who had to fight the urge to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not. But you will be.\" He said. Zorua took one of his paws, and with a claw, casually dug a small circle in the ground around the speck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggletuff fell to the ground from all the movement and a cacophony of sound as the giant beast dug the ground around him, trapping him on a bit of ground, his island that was cut off by a deep abyss he couldn't traverse on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made that with my one little claw Wigglytuff...bet you can't get over it. That's how pathetic you are...you want to try and go get help? You don't get it. There's only one pokemon that can ever make you normal again and she never would. Never again. You had that chance briefly when Celebi's mom found you but like the idiot you are you squandered it...I can barely hear you...me, with my amazing hearing, and I need to TRY to hear you. Azurill is puny too but i'd imagine even he struggles to hear you now...if I blew on you, just a bit you'd go flying to parts unknown. If I screamed at the top of my lungs I wonder...would you even survive? I bet your ear drums wouldn't...\" Zorua chuckled, a deep rumble to Wigglytuff as each word crushed his hopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">P-please...Zorua...don't k-kill me...</span>\" He begged and Zorua raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should you know...it would be so easy...and we both know that we hate each other.\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">B-but Azurill wanted me to live right...h-he's your f-friend right?</span>\" Wigglytuff tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he is...and you tried to kill him. I'd also like to let you in on something.\" Zorua leaned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was shrunk by Celebi for a prank...she almost killed me from it...imagine how different things would be if she had for you? Oh, just what could've been...Azurill...loathe that I am to admit now, I almost snacked on when we first shrunk him, Celebi stopped me...but out here...well neither of them are here, are they? It's you and me, no one to stop me from punishing you...\" Zorua intoned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You attacked me, my girlfriend, and her mom, and a friend.

What a cowardly bug... you don't deserve life...\" Zorua snickered, and Wigglytuff gulped as he tried to back up... but he ended on the edge of the minuscule circle in the ground... which was a humongous pillar to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua moved his muzzle closer to the pink dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... ya know, I'm feeling generous... that's why I'm letting you live...\" he said with a grin. Wigglytuff felt slightly relieved, but he knew there was something behind Zorua's generosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're living... as my pet! Forever!\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff's eyes shrunk as the booming words sank into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't have much time to think about as Zorua lowered his muzzle, opening his mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff's world became dark and hot as the lips of the fox scooped him up and took him inside before sealing the rabbit in complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">H-Hey! Let me out!</span>\" he screamed, his voice echoing inside the slippery cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered, a deafening sound raining onto Wigglytuff, who dropped onto the slick tongue, holding his ears in pain.<br>\r\n\"Shut up bug.\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox then started walking, each step he took sending vibrations inside Wigglytuff's prison and rocking the tiny rabbit back and forth within the hot confines of the giant mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig drops of saliva fell from Zorua's palate and onto the scared bunny as he was thrown around like a rag doll, the giant tongue beneath him tasting him and menacing to throw Wigglytuff on one of the razor sharp fangs that were bigger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne wrong throw forward, and Wigglytuff would end up impaled; backwards, and he would end up falling down to his fate, melting slowly inside of a death chamber that was the stomach of the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat must've been what hell is like, Wigglytuff sourly thought as he tried desperately to remain in the middle of the mouth as Zorua walked towards an unknown destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox snickered again as he felt his tiny 'passenger' being thrown around in his mouth. He felt slightly disappointed - Wigglytuff was so tiny that he couldn't taste him. But that was only another reason to keep him as a pet, he thought as he went back to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of pokemon Zorua left behind was waiting for him, everyone was quite anxious... save for the excited Mesprit and the deadpan Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they noticed the dark type stepping out from the thick forest and walked towards them, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi darted forward, wrapping her arms around his neck, causing Wigglytuff to flip onto his face on the giant red tongue and swallow a mouthful of saliva that was not his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusted, the pink rabbit sat up and stood still as he spat out Zorua's own saliva from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard voices from outside, muffled but still very audible to him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Did you find him?</span>\" was Celebi's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Wigglytuff found himself repeatedly hitting the giant's palate and tongue as he purposefully nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">... Where is he?</span>\" Meloetta asked.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You haven't killed him, have you?</span>\" Azurill chimed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Sure hope not... I wanted him~</span>\" this was that lunatic emotion-sensing newcomer, Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Wigglytuff's world shook sideways as he was carelessly thrown against the fleshy cheeks of the giant he was in, before being ultimately thrown against one of his teeth and hitting his head against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">No... he didn't... Wigglytuff is...</span>\" Espurr was stopped by a movement of Zorua's paw. She smirked as she quieted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink rabbit trapped in Zorua's mouth loooked at the sharp tip of the canine, grateful that he didn't hit <i>that</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he was hopeless. Exhausted, beaten, scared, Wigglytuff could only stand still and hope Zorua released him soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis prayers seemed to be answered... in the wrong way. Zorua suddenly tilted his head, and the tiny rabbit found himself sliding towards his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a scream of terror... before cold hair hit him, while his butt hit the hard, cold ground as Zorua unceremoniously spat him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a weak, almost inaudible cry, Wigglytuff slid in the middle of a circle formed by all of his captors, aided by the copious saliva sticking to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at them all, everyone but Mesprit and Zorua was glaring at him. Both exceptions were grinning down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Great work Zorua.</span>\" Celebi's mom complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">So? What do we do with this bug now?</span>\" Meloetta asked while Azurill glowered at his former care-taker from his perch behind her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit started giggling - she was savoring so many emotions tonight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I do recall that he was coming with me... or miss was going to kill him...</span>\" she remembered, Wigglytuff shivering at the second suggestion.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Please, can I have him?</span>\" Mesprit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua started snickering.<br>\r\n\"Lady... none of those two things is possible... because Wigglytuff here is my pet!\" he revealed, before looking at Celebi.<br>\r\n\"... <i>Our</i> pet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled and hugged her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua... Mesprit really wants him...</span>\" Celebi's mom  said. Zorua looked at her.<br>\r\n\"But ma'am - I caught him! It's fair that I get to decide his fate!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom discovered that she couldn't argue with that and slowly nodded her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Aw! That's not fair - hey, you two are so in love, that's so cute~ - but I still want him!</span>\" Mesprit whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mesprit complained, Celebi's mom talked to Meloetta,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Say, now you and Azurill have no place to stay, right?</span>\" she asked, and Meloetta nodded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Until I have my house repaired... why?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink fairy in front of her smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Because you're free to stay with us in the meantime.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta gave a smile as she looked down at Azurill.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Azurill dear, what do you say? Want to go stay with miss, Celebi and Zorua for some time?</span>\" she asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill didn't even blink.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Yes!</span>\" he chimed, excited by the idea of living under the same roof with Meloetta and his new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta smiled even more as she looked back at the mother of Zorua's girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Deal~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder time traveler smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Glad to see you happy sweetheart - aw, fine... you keep him...</span>\" Mesprit said, her momentary smile fading as she looked at Zorua and Celebi with a dejected expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Sorry lady...\" he said, somewhat glad that the argument was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom looked at Mesprit and seemed to ponder something.</span></div></div>",

This lunatic legendary was going to toy with him, alongside Zorua and Celebi! Before he could further protest, the bunny was psychically gripped by Celebi and lifted off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ready to go back in the jar pet?</span>\" the green fairy snickered as she psychically shook the still saliva-covered rabbit, causing him to feel quite dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"And here's the answer to my \u2018Why her\u2019 questions.\" he said, earning a peck from his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder Celebi smiled and shook her head, before turning to the quiet Espurr.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And you, Espurr dear? Do you want to come with us?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small psychic type shook her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I need to stay... dad is coming home tonight.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Another time, maybe,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mother smiled in approval as Espurr moved to Zorua and hugged him... before glancing at Mesprit, picking up on her thoughts. Sadly, she couldn't interrupt in time,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh~ you too~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr's cheeks flared up as she broke the hug, hugged Celebi and hurried to her house.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Bye everyone.</span>\" she quickly said as she entered the mansion, shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving heard Gardevoir, Espurr and Zorua talking about it, Celebi giggled, already knowing about Espurr's crush on Zorua. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi's mom looked at Zorua, frowning. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua...?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed.<br>\r\n\"... She had... a crush on me I believe, but I... already liked someone else.\" he replied sincerely, and Celebi hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom smiled again as she floated forward, leading the way to her house, the group following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">So, you two take the guest room,</span>\" Celebi's mother said to Meloetta and Azurill, opening a door to reveal a simple room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at Celebi.<br>\r\n\"Hey - where was that when we did the sleepover?\" he asked, recalling the first night with Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy giggled awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hehe, they always sleep in my room... they would have suspected something...</span>\" she explained, before floating to her room, a quiet Wigglytuff floating behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Mesprit, you take Celebi's room,</span>\" the elder fairy continued, pointing the door of her daughter's room, before looking at said daughter, who came out of her room, psychically holding the jar that was Wigglytuff's new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey, the couch... Zorua.</span>\" she said, her gaze traveling to her daughter's boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black fox looked down.<br>\r\n\"I must go, right?\" he asked dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Not until you've answered me... then, we'll see... you've already been here for quite some time, huh?</span>\" she asked, recalling the tiny pokedoll on Celebi's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua meekly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">These two are so cute~</span>\" Mesprit remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Agreed~</span>\" Meloetta chimed while Azurill laughed from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mesprit and Meloetta went to the rooms they were assigned to, while Celebi's mom sighed as she looked at the couple in front of her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm ordering something... we'll talk while we wait for dinner.</span>\" she said, before floating off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at his girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"So? What do we do in the meantime?\" he asked, hoping Celebi wasn't going to pull out a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smirked, and held the jar containing Wigglytuff up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff gulped. At this point prison, or death, or Mesprit, would be better alternatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay you two...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi, her mother and boyfriend sat at the table, Wigglytuff placed in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked calm, but determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered good, he kept his house and girlfriend; he answered bad, he was going to be thrown out... but Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't lose Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">So...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yes... Zorua is my boyfriend, mom.</span>\" Celebi interrupted. Her mother looked at her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I think you two made that clear... but dear, you know how I feel about this kind of things... plus, you didn't tell me.</span>\" she lectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Would you have approved it? And if not, would you have believed that under his pranks and behavior he's a true sweetheart and friend? He's an example of smart, funny and cute mom.</span>\" Celebi complimented, and Zorua flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hm...</span>\"  the pink Celebi mumbled, before signing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Okay. Now... how long have you two been together?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shrugged, acting nonchalant, but feeling like his heart was going to explode from the anxiety.<br>\r\n\"A week... maybe two...\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And have you always been here... tiny and all?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded meekly.<br>\r\n\"Yes... you see ma'am, I haven't actually got somewhere to stay... Celebi did me a favor.\" he answered, smiling gratefully at his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You're homeless...</span>\" Celebi's mom said, pitiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo points in favor of the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had one final question, the most important one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay Zorua... now, regarding Espurr's behavior, I necessarily need to ask... do you like my daughter and my daughter alone?</span>\" she asked, looking at Zorua intently, seeking for any hint of agitation in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was any, the answer was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom!</span>\" Celebi's protested, but her mother remained firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed, but looked at the elder Celebi firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am... Espurr is my friend... my best friend probably, but Celebi and I are on a different level... I <i>like</i> her, nothing could change my feelings for her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I could~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua made a startled leap and looked to the side to see a smirking Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Don't do that no more...\" he said, his heart beating faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom mentally repeated the words of the fox a few times... and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her daughter and her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay you two, I've heard enough. Honey...</span>\" Celebi and Zorua tensed up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... You two may stay together.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud cheer echoed in the house. Inside the guest room, Meloetta smiled as she petted Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Zorua locked themselves in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Aw~</span>\" Mesprit chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder fairy smiled too. Inside his jar, Wigglytuff snorted - that scoundrel got a home while he had to be confined in a jar for the rest of his days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom looked at the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And, Zorua, about you living here...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

He stood still for a moment, dizzy, before resuming laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust one of the many, many disadvantages of being tiny, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...\" Zorua got caught in another fit of laughter, before he started to shake his head.<br>\r\n\"N-No, seriously...\" he cleared his throat as he looked at the blue mouse, adopting the best serious expression he could make with the thought of a nearly-crying Wigglytuff in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad he didn't have a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk kid.\" he said. Azurill nodded cheerfully and leaped on top of his own tail as he sat on it. Zorua felt the sting of jealousy as he recalled the mouse floating on his own tail in the pool... he shook his head once again. There'd be time for jealousy later, he decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">What do you want to talk about, Zorua?</span>\" Azurill asked. His ears rang as Zorua sighed - something similar to a plane soaring right above the small mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fox looked at him.<br>\r\n\"Y'see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Quit... Stop i-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff's protest was reduced to silence, nausea assaulting him as the jar he was in was psychically flipped upside down by a snickering Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled, sitting on the couch beside the pink headed legendary, watching her toying with Wigglytuff; Meloetta had gone into the guest room again while her mother was cleaning the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Why are you worried? And happy - that's a weird mix... which I sure don't mind~</span>\" Mesprit broke the silence, causing the fairy to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's about Azurill...</span>\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What about that little sweetheart - oh, don't feel relieved just yet you~</span>\" she said, and the jar was thrown up in the air at high speed, before descending again while being flipped over and over, causing its tiny occupant to feel extremely dizzy as well as sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm going to...</span>\" he put a paw to his mouth, keeping himself from throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's right, don't... you're going to clean it up otherwise.</span>\" Celebi said with disgust while Mesprit laughed, savoring the emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">... Anyway, I was saying, what about Azurill?</span>\"  the pixie repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's about... what he decides to do, if to return to normal or stay like that...</span>\" Celebi explained.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">He's quite happy right now - I can tell... oh, he's confused now.</span>\" Mesprit told, sensing the emotions of the blue mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi clasped her paws together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what were Zorua and Azurill doing in that room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Don't worry about them... they're fine... in the meantime...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jar containing Wigglytuff started spinning around, the bunny thrown back and forth within, hitting the glass walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's infallible abilities proved to be worthy of that adjective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked at Zorua in confusion, surprised by the fox's statement.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">What do you mean, \u2018Are you truly happy like that\u2019? Of course I am Zorua... sure, there's a couple disadvantages, but in the end I've got you, Celebi, Meloetta... so yes, I am quite happy like this.</span>\" Azurill told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"You've got me, huh? Funny... you wouldn't have told that a week ago...\" he said, causing Azurill to smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Glad we've given each other a chance.</span>\" he said, bouncing on top of the fox's head with his spring-like tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his angulation, Azurill couldn't see his expression, but Zorua had returned serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azurill...\" he told.<br>\r\n\"Kid, listen here... you still like your friends... the other kids I mean...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked perplexed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I... of course... Igglybuff, Swinub, Magby... I miss them...</span>\" he stated with a sudden hint of sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n\"Listen... you have a choice kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked at him, more confused than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, you can either stay like that, tiny and with Meloetta...\" Zorua explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Meloetta...</span>\" Azurill murmured as he recalled all the beautiful moments he spent with the green headed pokemon already... and in just a few days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that... or you can go back to your friends kid, normal-sized...\" Zorua continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">R-Really? Can I see them again?</span>\" he asked, hopeful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff was technically gone... but still, he and the other kids were a family... he missed them all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed. This was going to destroy Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the catch though... If you see your friends, you'd be publicly alive again... and that would mean one thing: orphanage.\" he bluntly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, Azurill looked horrified. Zorua felt him tumbling down his head and onto his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked up in the icy eyes of his giant friend - he was giving him a dejected look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it - he could lose Meloetta! Not only, he'd lose Zorua, Celebi, Braixen, Buneary, all his new friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time kid... choose carefully.\" Zorua warned, apparently reasoning on the same line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis beloved family... or his beloved new friends?</span></div></div>",

Is it juicy?\" He asked, making a light joke before Azurill looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Meloetta...reminds me of my mom.

You were his for a few years right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I know he's a scumbag...horrid pokemon, bad dad but...I can't help but care about his well being...just a little.</span>\" Zorua smiled.

I'm easy to hurt, i'm not strong, you're all very loud, but don't underestimate me. I can get by just fine with a bit of help.</span>\" Azurill nodded to himself.

I could help her get over with the loss of daddy...</span>\" Mesprit offered, letting go of Wigglytuff's emotions to savor the repressed storm of emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, the minuscule rabbit gritted his teeth - this lunatic wanted to what?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Stay away from my daughter you creeps! Especially you!</span>\" he snarled angrily, eyeing Mesprit, who looked amused - again, that wonderful wave of rage she couldn't get enough of...<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You kidnapped me!

Zorua, your pet will have to learn to behave.</span>\" she said, half serious, half playful, causing the fox to snicker along with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom yawned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm going to bed now... tomorrow I've got a day off from work, we'll see how to accommodate the other kids as well...</span>\" she mumbled drowsily.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Good night you all...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Celebi's mother hovered inside of her room, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the group heard the sound of the pink fairy literally collapsing on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must've been tired...\" Zorua mumbled, before Azurill yawned too. Meloetta smiled, gently picking him from her lap.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">We're off to bed too...</span>\" she gently said. The blue mouse in her circular paws nodded as the giantess floated inside the guest room, shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Zorua, Celebi and Mesprit were left on the couch, a whimpering Wigglytuff laying face down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit leaned back and smiled while looking at the couple.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You know... quite glad I came here... you all feel such strong emotions~</span>\" she chimed, before starting to stretch.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">And things are quite fun here...

You lost that right when you tried to murder Azurill.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff huffed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why? Didn't you all try to kill me at some point? Plus, Zorua, I saved Azurill!</span>\" he retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, after destroying his new house, knocking out his new mo-\" Zorua abruptly stopped to prevent the world \u2018mom\u2019 from escaping... he promised to keep it a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Monolithic friends... and attempting on his life... plus, you tried to get away like the coward you are.\"  he finished.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And the only thing Zorua could be blamed for were his pranks... he never attempted to kill someone like you bug.</span>\" Celebi chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah whatever... Tell that to that hole in the ground you led me into... I could've died asphyxiated down there...</span>\" Wigglytuff retorted. Celebi discovered that she couldn't argue with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny bunny was floated back into his jar, the top sealing its only opening as Wigglytuff laid on the glass floor of his prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bedtime for us too Zorua...</span>\" she said, getting up and floating to her room, knocking at the door and entering, returning with a pillow and a blanket, the door of her room closing again but its current occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe your mom gave Mesprit our room... how do we sleep on the couch?\" Zorua mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi merely grinned as she put down the items she was holding, before looking at her boyfriend and crafting a ball of cyan energy in between her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ready?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zorua seemed to be thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi... how about I stay big for tonight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi tilted her head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... your mom knows about us, approves us... why don't we try... cuddling... with me normal-sized?\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blushed, but smiled.</span></div></div>",

That's too nice.\" Zorua said and she shrugged before they got on the couch together, watching Wigglytuff wrap himself up in the hankie and turn away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Mesprit chick is weird...\" Zorua muttered as Celebi giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">She seems nice...besides, I doubt she'll be here for that long, it might help to have her around for the kids to transition at least...make it smoother.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real world has real pain, they shouldn't be that sheltered from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh? Wonderful insight Zorua...but i'm afraid that we don't need more questions than necessary leading to Wigglytuff and Azurill...and you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little shocked the kid decided to stay with us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...I am too. But it'll be good right? At least for a while...Meloetta will take care of him, we'll have each other...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we have our new pet.\" Zorua grinned. \"Sleep tight bug~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't see Wigglytuff's tears as he looked out the jar at the world beyond him now. Too big and treacherous for him to navigate ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Kids, morning.</span>\" Zorua groaned from his sleep as the voice of Celebi's mom greeted him, he felt another being close to him stir as well as she sat up, forcing him to move up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wow, it's easier to get you up when you're normal sized.</span>\" Celebi remarked and he blearily looked at her before yawning. Celebi rolled her eyes at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What's up mom?</span>\" Celebi turned her attention to her mom who smiled. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Wash up, i'm making breakfast, then...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Zorua looked at her sympathetically.<br>\r\n\"Of course Celi... I mean, come on,  your mom will deal with them just fine.\" he said encouragingly as he sat down at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral plates of meat and eggs were waiting on the table, along with several glasses of juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua questioned about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We have guests Zorua...</span>\" she simply responded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Speaking of, go wake them up, mom doesn't like when food goes to waste...</span>\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">There's no need to~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Zorua leaped on his chair as a certain pink-headed pokemon appeared in between him and Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Mornin\u2019!</span>\" Mesprit chimed cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Zorua cried, causing Celebi to giggle.<br>\r\n\"Stop doin\u2019 that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit snickered - she loved toying with Zorua as much as she loved toying with Wigglytuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">She's right anyway,</span>\" another voice said as Meloetta appeared in the kitchen, holding a drowsy Azurill.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Morning everyone~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Mornin\u2019...</span>\" Azurill said, before opening his mouth and letting out an exaggerated yawn to empathize that he didn't approve his lack of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group sat at the table and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, feed Wigglytuff.</span>\" Celebi said at some point, her boyfriend raising his head, cheeks stuffed and mouth full of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mh-hmm...\" he replied, sounding much like a Grumpig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Manners Zorua... don't speak with your mouth full...</span>\" Celebi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shrugged, and gulped loudly before looking at his girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"He's probably still asleep... let him, because later I'm going to...\" Zorua stopped upon noticing the look on Celebi's face.<br>\r\n\"... Fine.\" he said, using a claw to cut a small slice of meat and leaped off his chair, balancing on three legs to carry it to the living room where Wigglytuff's jar was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox stood on his hind legs as he leaned against the coffee table, using his free paw to shake the jar.<br>\r\n\"Breakfast bug!\" he snickered as Wigglytuff's world was rocked back and forth by his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large but minuscule rabbit was rudely awoken as his head hit the glass of the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Argh! Igglybuff quit it!</span>\" he exclaimed, evidently still half asleep.<br>\r\n\"If you weren't such a monster, I would daddy!\" Zorua cried, emulating Igglybuff's voice the best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink rabbit finally seemed to fully regain his consciousness as she glared at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">The hell do you want?!</span>\" he cried in annoyance, his voice echoing around his glass prison. In response, Zorua held the meat in front of the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff just seemed to realize how empty his stomach was. He ran up to the glass wall and pushed himself into it, maybe hoping to somehow go through the glass. Which, of course, was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the scariest legendary would be powerless in such pitiful size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"Eat up bug.\" he said, opening the jar and unceremoniously dropping the meat inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type looked as Wigglytuff started eating his meat, mentally repeating why the rabbit deserved this all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened as he recalled something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You took your time Zorua...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Why so worried?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the attention of the four pokemon sitting at the table was focused on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed as he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What's up Zorua?</span>\" Celebi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">You do look gloomy~</span>\" Meloetta chimed cheerfully. Only Azurill remained quiet, but he was wearing a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I was just thinking.\" Zorua explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">About?</span>\" Azurill finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh, na\u00efve curiosity~ that can be lethal you know~</span>\" Mesprit chimed, earning a frightened expression from Azurill - seriously, as nice at this lady was, there was no denying that she was lunatic... or at least obsessed with emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Go ahead Zorua.</span>\" Celebi told, placing a piece of meat in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I remembered it now.\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n\"When I discovered that Wigglytuff faked Azurill's death... well, he was actually talking to someone about it... apparently, that someone was the one putting Azurill's fake body in the forest... Wigglytuff had a partner, and they're still out there...\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, Celebi let go of her fork, Meloetta gasped and Azurill trembled. Mesprit looked amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wha...?</span>\" Celebi asked incredulously. Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">A-Are you sure Zorua?</span>\" Meloetta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... and if whoever it is discovers that Wigglytuff is here, we might find a murderous pokemon out of the door someday...\" the fox mused, comprehensibly scared by the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I can't believe it...</span>\" Celebi said, grabbing her head in her paws in an exasperated manner. Azurill had \u2018died\u2019 days ago, they had dealt with Wigglytuff and <i>now</i> it came out that he had a partner? Damn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Well... why don't we go find this... partner?</span>\" Mesprit calmly chimed, looking at Celebi.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Your mom is out and there's nothing better to do... until she returns, in which point auntie Mesprit will have to deal with a few sad kids~</span>\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">... You're right. Whoever it is, they don't know about Wigglytuff, but they might find out soon... unless we find them first.</span>\" the experienced Meloetta mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Can I come too?</span>\" Azurill timidly asked, earning a weird look from Meloetta.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">... Normal-sized?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let him Meloetta... now, where could this partner be right now?</span>\" she wondered, looking at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Celi, the fake Azurill was found in my forest... we could find something they left behind there... or we could find them straightaway. Trust me, I know every single blade of grass of that forest, I'm going to notice if something is wrong.\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I dunno,</span>\" those weren't words that Celebi spoke often.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Why don't we interrogate Wigglytuff?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And you expect he's going to talk?\" Zorua asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table nodded. After all, Wigglytuff was speck-sized and terrified by the giants... but he could try to slip away with Metronome again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Celebi surely didn't want her house to be destroyed by a speck... that'd be hard to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Zorua pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh, Uxie would just love to be here right now.</span>\" Mesprit mused out loud at some point, feeling the curiosity rising around her as everyone looked at her. She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Anyway, what do we do?</span>\"</span></div></div>",

The dark type sighed as the ball penetrated his body, which glowed briefly as he began to shrink down to size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around Zorua grew, and he soon found himself having to crane his neck to look up at his now towering girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking ended, and Zorua discovered that, once again, he couldn't be bigger than a tiny doll to Celebi... though he was way bigger than Wigglytuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll never get tired of doing this~</span>\" she chimed, bending to pick up her tiny boyfriend, who smirked.<br>\r\n\"And I'll never get tired of you carrying me around, kissing me, buying me stuff...\" he retorted as his girlfriend walked up to the light switch and turned off the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Dressing you up as a doll~</span>\" Celebi interrupted the fox's monologue as she laid on the couch, wrapping the blanket around herself and Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox snickered while he was placed on his own bed - Celebi's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's three-on-one sweetheart, it's no match.\" he said, causing Celebi to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his solitary jar, Wigglytuff watched Zorua, envying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat scoundrel was in Celebi's graces while he had to sleep on the cold glass of this stupid jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he had his own fair share of crimes, but he never actually harmed anyone before today... tried to harm, because he was totally overpowered by Meloetta, slammed here and there by Celebi's mom and knocked out by Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox seemed to sense Wigglytuff's nasty thoughts. His ice-blue eyes pierced the darkness of the living room as she shot the jar a mischievous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's jealous Celi~\" he snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi too looked at the jar, narrowing her eyes to see Wigglytuff in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy started giggling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What's up pet? Jealous~?</span>\" she asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny bunny didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps the jar is too hard for him...\" Zorua said, before snickering.<br>\r\n\"... Or too soft... ya got tacks?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Meh... you know, I'm happy tonight, so I shall do something for our tiny pet...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff's interest was stimulated by the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked through the glass of his jar to see the giant Celebi getting up from the couch, gently setting a complaining Zorua down on it, before moving into darkness, reappearing shortly after in front of the table the jar was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff noted the top being removed, something was dropped inside and landed straight on top of Wigglytuff... it was soft, and lightweight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piece of cloth of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And sleep tight pet.</span>\" Celebi said, sealing the jar once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff wrapped himself up in the cloth as he laid back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Thanks... psycho...</span>\" he murmured. Luckily for him, Celebi didn't hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, Wigglytuff wouldn't have lived to see another dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy laid back on the couch where Zorua was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blanket was once again wrapped around the two as Celebi grabbed the fox and cuddled him to her chest as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, that was too nice regarding what he did...\" Zorua said, and Celebi giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">A little bit of decency won't hurt, Zorua... If he's gonna be our pet, we need to make sure he lasts as long as he can.</span>\" Celebi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his jar, Wigglytuff shivered - this was an open declaration: they didn't care one bit about his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right... like always.\" he told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi rolled on her side, trapping the fox in between her chest, paws and one of the couch cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You know cutie... I'm so happy mom allowed us to stay together~</span>\" she sang, and Zorua smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Celebi's next sentence made him wear a perplexed expression,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And I think we're ready... to move on to the next level.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Celi, your mother told \u2018no funny business\u2019...\" he reminded her, and she blushed, but giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm not talking about that... yet~</span>\" she chimed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No Zorua... I'm talking about this~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken dark type wanted to ask what she meant, but he discovered that it was pretty hard to speak with Celebi's mouth glued to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart skipped several beats and his eyes widened, a blush spreading across his cheeks as Celebi kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like he was on fire, his body slowly consumed by a wave of heat... a pleasing wave of heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing he could think about right now was one and one only: Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, his mind flashed with images of their relationship so far: the sleepover at her house, the first day together, shrinking Azurill, learning about Wigglytuff, having him as a pet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore this all, he had thought Celebi was nothing more than a boring bookworm... but, he discovered, things were quite fun when he was around her... and he was dating her from just a week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Celebi pulled off, blushing, but smiling merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wow... never thought I'd give my first kiss to you~</span>\" she giggled, before laying down and cuddling Zorua again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good night, cutie~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stared at her for a good while... before closing his eyes in shock, praying that sleep would take him away from this embarrassing situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis prayers were answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A door opened inside the quiet house as a pink fairy slowly walked out of her room, looking absolutely tired. She didn't catch much sleep - she had too many things to think about. Azurill tiny, her daughter dating Zorua, Wigglytuff's dark side, Mesprit, Meloetta and Azurill in her house, kids needing to be taken care of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned, trying to physically force the sleep out of her eyes by rubbing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother of Zorua's girlfriend quickly made coffee, and sat down at her table with a steaming cup. She desperately needed that today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a long sip, before drowsily glancing around, noticing a jar on the table. Inside, Wigglytuff slept, wrapped up in a piece of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom huffed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I was hoping you were just a nightmare...</span>\" she murmured to herself with high disdain in her voice, before her gaze landed on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, Celebi slept, buried under the blanket, only the tip of her green head emerging from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Wigglytuff wasn't a dream, so Zorua too was really there... but he was missing... Speaking of, where did he actually sleep? With Celebi?... That seemed fine to the older time traveler - it didn't count as \u2018funny business\u2019 - but just where was he...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom causally looked at Wigglytuff's jar... she quickly pieced it together and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was there on the couch with Celebi... but doll-sized! Looking closer, the pink fairy could actually see a small lump where Celebi's chest was under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder time traveler took another sip from her cup, watching her daughter sleep, cuddling Zorua like he was a common doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made quite an odd couple... Celebi was sweet, and a bookworm... probably mischievous at times, but not that much; Zorua was rough, a scoundrel that pranked others for his own amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink took yet another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had told her Zorua changed... and that was why they were together on the couch right now. Celebi's mom took her last sip of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daughter was happy... that was all that mattered. And, if Zorua truly changed, both had her blessings. The only thing a mother really wants is to see their child truly happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi smiled as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well... let's wake these two lovebirds up.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she moved to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey wake up~</span>\" she started. Celebi didn't move.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey~</span>\" the pink fairy started gently shaking the green one, who let out a cry of annoyance as she tried to cling to the remains of whatever dream she was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blanket was removed from the sleeping Celebi, revealing the green fairy, Zorua cuddled to her chest. Her dark eyelids opened slightly as she drowsily looked at her mom, muttering incomprehensible words of disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Good morning honey~ slept well~?</span>\" her mom teased, obviously referring to the tiny fox in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Moooom...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Breakfast will be ready in no time, get up. I need to go out in a short while, I'll deal with Wigglytuff's kids... there ought to be a solution to this situation...</span>\" the elder Celebi said, walking away from her daughter, who sighed in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi yawned, before distractedly eyeing Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had to suffer the lack of sleep, <i>he</i> had to suffer the lack of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua wake up.</span>\" she said, obviously getting no response from the heavy sleeper that was her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled and moved a paw to his backside, grabbing his tail in two fingers and pulling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua got back on his legs and stared daggers at Celebi, who snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!\" he cried in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stifled a giggle and gently jabbed his chest with a finger.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">If I don't sleep, you don't sleep.</span>\" she said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... you monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smirked, and leaned forward to peck her boyfriend on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What was that?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You green kiss-abusing fiend...\" Zorua offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Celebi leaned forward, touching his face with hers and slowly raising her head, forcing Zorua to do so too. Then, she placed her lips on Zorua's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, his cheeks flared up, but Celebi quickly pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, but smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey... breakfast!</span>\" her mom announced from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey!... Whaddya want?!</span>\" Wigglytuff asked as his jar was kicked by Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I gotta suffer because of her, you gotta suffer because of me!\" the fox said, snickering.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And me~</span>\" Celebi added cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff growled drowsily, before letting himself fall on his back on the glass floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Zorua were sitting out of the fairy's house. Her mom left a short while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Say Zorua... what do we do today?</span>\" she asked her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Aside from playing with this-\" he kicked the jar again, causing it to vibrate and Wigglytuff to snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled as she reached out for the tiny fox. Zorua found himself hugged to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah... what could we do today?... D'you want to be big again?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was about to reply, but his words died down when he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CELI!\" he shouted, startling the fairy.<br>\r\n\"Let's switch roles!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"For once... why don't you grow me and shrink yourself instead? I can carry you around like you do with me! It'll be fun!\" he suggested, tail wagging in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... What?</span>\" she asked, not sure if to laugh at the suggestion or actually consider it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Celi, there's quite a few advantages being this size... and you never tried it! Why don't you?\" Zorua asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi pondered an answer... Zorua seemed sincerely excited, and she too wondered how being tiny would be... but she never actually tried shrinking herself - she didn't know what effects that could have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it...\" Zorua insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at the dark type in her paws again and have her answer.</span></div></div>",

Her mother's shield was enough to reduce the force of the Draco Meteor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at her mom, at the small Azurill in her paws and, behind them, at a choking Wigglytuff floating in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...

He's still knocked out, he's bleeding!</span>\" despite the murderous glare she was wearing, Celebi felt tears in her eyes, tears of hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother stared at her in silence, remembering what she had learned earlier: Zorua had been, and still was, her daughter's boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, while still wanting to get a couple clarifications, Zorua had fought to save Azurill... she guessed that he had truly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... He's all yours, honey,</span>\" she relented; Celebi needed to hear nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the psychic grip on Wigglytuff loosened a bit, before it was replaced by another as his world shifted from pink to green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You...</span>\" Celebi cried venomously, making the tiny rabbit shiver in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Destroying a house, almost killing a kid, I don't care anymore! You almost killed Zorua! <i>YOU WON'T GET OUT OF THIS ALIVE!</i></span>\" the fairy screamed, destroying both Wigglytuff's long ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">P-Plea-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's eyes glowed cyan as she eyed her target. Her mind shouted a forceful command, \u2018<i>Shrink!</i>\u2019 and Wigglytuff started shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't move, held by psychic, and Celebi became first a planet, then a galaxy, then a goddess, then... nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's psychic grip came to an end on its own, its target disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Aw!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary Mesprit stopped in mid-air, frowning in disappointment and folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had felt a strong fear, she was delighted by it, but then it simply disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever was feeling it was no longer alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged as she turned around, starting to fly back from where she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, she had an excuse to leave, even if for a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, she wondered when it would be the next time she'd finally meet someone with such intense emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few good words and a bandaged head can work miracles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days after Wigglytuff's disappearance, Zorua, laying in bed next to a reading Celebi, knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only Celebi's mom allowed him to keep dating her daughter, he also was permitted to keep living with her!... On a certain condition: he had to remain tiny in the house - much to his girlfriend's delight - to avoid him and her getting involved in \u2018weird business\u2019 - much to his girlfriend's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox couldn't be happier right now... if it wasn't for the fact that Wigglytuff's Draco Meteor hit him straight on the head and he didn't have a chance to finish the rabbit off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the events that had occurred two days ago, the group decided to not talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Meloetta whose house was destroyed gladly took the offer to stay with her friend Celebi - much to Azurill's happiness -  while her house was repaired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Wigglytuff's disappearance and the fact that Zorua, Celebi or the other inhabitants of said pokemon's house were supposed to keep it a secret meant one thing: the kids he had left were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom was still trying to find a way to take care of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that single inconvenience, all was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Meloetta and Azurill were out, while Celebi and her boyfriend rested on their bed, the first reading and the other laying beside her. The mother of the fairy was at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still can't believe what had been going on these days...\" Zorua mused at some point, scratching his head - the bandage was itchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Me neither,</span>\" Celebi responded, turning the page. She looked at her tiny boyfriend, smiling,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But at least mom allowed us to stay together... that's something I wasn't expecting... not after-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appeared in your room after Wigglytuff told her that you and me wanted to keep him as a pet?\" Zorua finished, his girlfriend nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yep. Oh, and Zorua...</span>\" the book was suddenly closed as Celebi eyed the fox with a smirk,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We've got some privacy...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Zorua sprang up, tail wagging as Celebi's lips approached him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the moment was ruined when someone knocked at the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Zorua complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled, kissed him anyway and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Coming!</span>\" Zorua heard her saying from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi reached door and opened it, finding...</span></div></div>",

I was thinking we could brew it.</span>\" Celebi said with a smile but Espurr had a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Are you okay Celi?</span>\" She asked with concern and Celebi looked at her with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Of course I am! Things are great right now.</span>\" She said as she got out a tea kettle, some teabags, and china to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Celi...I know what you did...Zorua thought it and...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr...it's fine, trust me. He had it coming to him, he tried to kill all of us! Even the pokemon he used to call his own!</span>\" Celebi said and Espurr looked down into the empty cup she was holding for a second before meeting Celebi's gaze, with a far more timid look than Celebi was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">...How does Azurill feel about it?</span>\" She asked and Celebi took a sharp inhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He's fine...he has feelings to work through, but he'd managing, Meloetta is helping him in that regard...and my mom is definitely doing what she can to help the other kids too.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">...And you? Are you okay?</span>\" Espurr asked quietly, for a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr, i'll keep saying it, i'm fine!</span>\" Celebi insisted but Espurr didn't relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Celebi, you've done...something that you can't take back.

About you and Zorua...</span>\" Celebi's eye twitched a bit. Her and Zorua...of course, Espurr still had feelings for Zorua. Well Espurr should back off, Celebi had it under control as far as she was concerned. She was fully committed to the actions she had taken with Wigglytuff and didn't regret it one bit. But Espurr had to make one comment, it was innocuous, but Celebi internalized it and didn't know how to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">To shrink...into oblivion...it must be a terrible way to go.</span>\" Espurr said solemnly.</span></div></div>",

Espurr reared back: the fairy was carrying a definitely hostile gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay, you know what? Zorua is fine, I am fine, everyone is fine without Wigglytuff!</span>\" she exclaimed, causing Espurr to shiver. After all, not only Celebi was bigger than her, but she had time-traveling powers, shrinking abilities and could destroy the entire neighborhood - if not the entire village - if she only wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">His kids aren't...</span>\" Espurr timidly pointed out, feeling like something out of her reach was coming at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom is taking care of them!</span>\" Celebi repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid green pokemon was breathing heavily, barely containing her rising anger.

Have you forgotten that?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the third time since her seventh birthday, Espurr was speechless. Celebi was right, but it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be considered as an abuse of her power, but Espurr didn't dare to point it out. Celebi was seething, any wrong word might end with the psychic-type suffering the same fate as Wigglytuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now, are we done talking about what I did?

Zorua loves <i>you</i>, I can't do anything about it, can I?</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the five pokemon that were supposed to be in the other room stepped in the kitchen, Zorua blushing furiously while eyeing Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espurr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Alright, what's going on?</span>\" Braixen bravely stepped forward, paws on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You stay out of this.</span>\" she hissed, Braixen's confidence waning as she instinctively took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time-traveler looked back at Espurr,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You should listen to him, how he talks about his \u2018best friend\u2019!</span>\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that just once or twice!\" Zorua chimed in, held by Kirlia, whose cheerful smile was completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi didn't appear to have heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir, who had been staring at her two friends arguing, gently picked Zorua from her sister, before pushing her and Buneary out of the door, locking it.

His forest was out of question, he needed someone to watch over him... because he was sure, asking Celebi to give him back his size now would be a waste of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his mind traveled to a certain group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

Was Espurr right to worry about her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know, but he kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I...</span>\" Celebi was full on bawling at this point, and psychically she yanked on Zorua's tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think you can keep me here y-\" Zorua started but he took a look at Celebi rubbing her own eyes, tears leaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I don't w-want you to leave me t-too...</span>\" Celebi hicced, and Zorua looked at his giant girlfriend with pity...former girlfriend possibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why I am?\" Zorua asked solemnly and Celebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I-I s-shouldn't have done that...I k-know, and now they hate me...and you hate me...</span>\" Celebi whimpered and Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might hate you...but I doubt it. You should make this right Celebi. You need to go and apologize to all of them. Espurr especially. And you need to grow her back.\" Zorua said firmly and Celebi looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr was crying into the cushion that Braixen had set her on. She didn't want to see the world right now, as it was, big and frightening, she didn't want to read the minds of her friends, only thinking of how mad they were at Celebi and how they pitied Espurr right now, she didn't want to think of how her oldest friend...the one that had gotten her out of her shell...shrunk and threw her away, over her genuine concern for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen and Gardevoir were looming over Espurr with sympathy...they had taken Buneary and Kirlia home, hoping that the two could take care of themselves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Espurr...</span>\" Gardevoir said it quietly, and as gently as possible...but it was still so, so loud on Espurr's poor ears. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Celebi will realize what she's done...she'll come and grow you...say sorry...right?</span>\" She was trying to be optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen had her arms crossed. She wasn't so sure that would happen. She only hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Celebi...?\" Zorua inquired at the silent green fairy. </span></div></div>",

She looked at Zorua, he had been crying a bit too. She smiled weakly at him and he found himself growing up, to full size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Let's go, okay?</span>\" Celebi said and Zorua nodded, as the two left the house though...they had to wonder where the group had gone. They might've gone to Braixen's, Buneary's, or Gardevoir's house. They doubted that they went to Espurr's home...they were probably doing everything in their power to make Espurr feel better and seeing her house at her size might not be something she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi bit her lip and opted for Buneary's home...she figured that or Braixen's would probably be the likely choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I know this is gonna be hard for you to do Celi, but it's the right thing to do...and you know it.\" Zorua said, he had been in these shoes, needing to apologize like this...to pokemon he had hurt. Celebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know.</span>\" She said firmly. She had come to her senses, and what she had done...she didn't even know if Espurr would forgive her. For all intents and purposes she'd be within her rights to avoid Celebi for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made for Buneary's house, awkward silence following the two as Celebi hung her head. She knocked on the door and was greeted by the little brown Buneary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">O-oh...Celebi and Zorua...</span>\" She sounded nervous, instinctively she half shut the door and peeped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary was frightened right now...of her...Celebi's heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I-is Espurr....here?</span>\" She asked and Buneary slammed the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">No she isn't...they went t-to Braixen's...I was t-told to tell you that if you came by and I did.</span>\" Buneary said from the other end of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">If you want to come and play with Azurill sometime, you're welcome to anytime.</span>\" Celebi tried to sound bright as she said it, but she got no response. She hung her head and trudged back onto the path. Zorua watched all of this in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt bad for Celebi, his heart ached for her...but he couldn't deny that all of this...wasn't unearned either. He had been here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give Buneary time...she'll come back around.\" He tried to encourage. Celebi silently nodded, but seemed wholly unconvinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their walk through the village, in silence. Some pokemon looked at the two sad teens, but most went about their business...though it was odd seeing Celebi like that and Zorua at all without causing mayhem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they came upon it. Braixen's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gulped and Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" He encouraged gently and she took a deep breath and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir was the one to answer. Her lips were thin and her visible eye narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Celebi.</span>\" It was curt, and pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Celebi did was nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm sorry...I really am...</span>\" She mumbled and Gardevoir said nothing, she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I'm not the one you need to say that to the most. She's inside...sleeping after having bawled her tiny eyes out.</span>\" Gardevoir's words sounded ice cold as Celebi winced and Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis WAS going to be tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir led the two inside, into Braixen's guest room, where on a pillow on the guest bed was the little spot of purple, curled up and taking a nap. Braixen was sitting in a chair near the bed, her arms crossed as well as she glared at Celebi. She stood up and led the group silently out of the room before shutting the door as quietly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You're gonna wait for her to wake up before you even get the privilege to speak to her. Got it?</span>\" Braixen growled and Celebi's mouth hung open, but she nodded, shutting her eyes. She really did have a long way to go after what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Good.</span>\" Braixen said, and then led the group into the living room where they all sat. Zorua broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...really is sorry you kn-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, I appreciate it, but they don't need you to say it...right?</span>\" Celebi interrupted and Braixen and Gardevoir nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">...Why green? Why'd you do it?</span>\" Braixen asked, in a far gentler tone and Celebi had shaky breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I...I'm the one behind Wigglytuff's disappearance...</span>\" Celebi was gonna tell the whole story, she had to, come what be. If she could get across how she felt then maybe...they'd forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He had done some truly heinous things...you know that Braixen...but when Zorua and I decided to prank him...things escalated quickly and...he tried to kill us. All of us, multiple times. He tried to kill his own kid...me...my mom...Zorua...and he almost succeeded...he destroyed my friend's house with a draco meteor...when all was said and done...I shrunk him into oblivion, so small that he no longer exists...at least not in our reality. Essentially...I killed him.</span>\" Celebi said. Gardevoir gasped at this and Braixen shut her eyes, taking this in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had it coming...if you'd have been there you'd have known. Even Celebi's mom was on the brink of finishing him off...\" Zorua said and Celebi nodded before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr caught onto this through Zorua's thoughts and earlier today...confronted me about it. I had been feeling slightly hostile towards her for a little bit now, subconsciously...I only realize that now, slightly worried that she'd...try to steal Zorua from me...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">She'd never!</span>\" Gardevoir seethed and Celebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...I know Gard, it was irrational...but her right there, confronting me about Wigglytuff...I think she was just trying to see if k-...killing a pokemon had affected me in a bad way...trying to see if I was okay...if it was the right thing to do too, by everyone involved and...I snapped on her.</span>\" Celebi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It kept escalating until you all saw what happened.</span>\" She finished then bowed her head. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I am so, so, SO sorry girls...</span>\" There were tears again as Gardevoir and Braixen took all of this in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Celebi, again, the one you need to apologize too is in the next room. Until then i'd recommend you just reflect on it. You broke Espurr's heart, and you broke her trust. Earning that back might be harder than you think it'll be, and quite frankly, i'm not ready to forgive you until Espurr's ready to forgive you.</span>\" Braixen said, as she got up. \"<span class=\"corange\">I'll be waiting for Espurr to wake up, i'll talk with her and bring her out when she's ready. And not a moment sooner, you're welcome to wait here.</span>\" And with that she left the three other pokemon in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Kirlia handling the house by herself?</span>\" Celebi tried to break even a small amount of the awkwardness and Gardevoir looked at her, maybe to throw her a bone she responded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">As well as can be expected I hope.</span>\" She giggled a bit and Celebi did a little too, but then it fell to silence once more. Celebi looked to Zorua, he really was letting her do all the talking for the most part. He smiled to her as she looked over. He was on her side at least...but she felt that should Espurr not forgive her, even Zorua wouldn't blame Espurr for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour and a half passed, agonizingly slow as Celebi rehearsed what she'd say to Espurr when the opportunity arose. First she'd say her piece, then grow Espurr and allow her to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was counting the seconds before, though it was quiet, the sound of a door opening was like a gunshot signaling Celebi to mentally prepare herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">If you don't want to see her it's okay...</span>\" Braixen said gently, but a tiny, tiny voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It's okay Braixen...thank you...</span>\" It was definitely Espurr's, but gone was the deadpan, almost playful tone. Her voice was raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen walked into Celebi's vision, cradling the small spot of purple in her white paws...it was her, Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr looked up at the looming face of Celebi, she had clearly been crying too...and she looked like a mix of worried and guilty. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr...</span>\" She whimpered the name, but it was still loud on Espurr's ears...like everything was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I...</span>\" The speech she had planned eluded her, all of it in the face of what she'd done to her friend. The normally calm, cool looking Espurr, deadpan and ready to lend a firm ear as well as mess with her friends with playful mind reading...this wasn't her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr had clearly been crying too, her eyes, though tiny, were still quite readable and the normally imperceptible pools were full of her emotion. Scared, tired, hurt, sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi bowed her head to the bug sized pokemon. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I am so, so sorry Espurr. What I did to you was wrong. So wrong...I thought that...even if you had a crush on Zorua once, that you'd try to steal him from me...you, my friend...and I took out my frustrations and lingering ill will towards Wigglytuff on you...I...am overwhelmingly guilty over what I did to you, and I want to time travel to this morning to take it back but...i'll face you for what i've done...please forgive me...</span>\" Celebi whimpered and soon Espurr found herself growing, out of Braixen's paws and soon enough able to look Celebi in the eye. Celebi stretched her arms out, tears running down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please forgive me...</span>\" Celebi whimpered as she motioned for Espurr...she wanted to hug her. Wanted Espurr to feel comforted and for herself to be comforted as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr looked at her, her mouth open. Celebi wanted a <i>HUG</i> from her, after all that she had done today!? Espurr was still feeling hurt, betrayed by the green fairy she thought had been her friend but...Espurr made her decision.</span></div></div>",

Something rendered easy thanks to her long arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiled. He didn't need to be as smart as Celebi to understand that she and Espurr made peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other fox in the room understood that too, but stood there, arms folded and a neutral stare on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Espurr looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yeah, you d-don't like sentimentalism t-too much, do you Braix?</span>\" she stuttered, smirking even when she was still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen stopped her facade: her arms unfolded, tears started sliding down her face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">S-Shut up you creep...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Braixen too joined in the group hug. She looked at Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Don't y-you dare doing that again...</span>\" she said shakily, the fairy biting her lip.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'd rather committing suicide... I'm sorry...</span>\" she apologized again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi inhaled sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I should've thought better, I was so blinded by jealousy that I... lost it...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">It doesn't matter anymore...</span>\" Gardevoir sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">B-But...

All his problems but one: Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile faded, replaced by a serious expression. Celebi was sweet, loving, maybe a bit mischievous... and a total wild card. Regardless, the dark-type still loved her... but felt like he had to pick his next move carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he ready to forgive Celebi too, to return being her boyfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr rubbed herself into the green fairy... before discovering that she didn't have a psychic block, and she could freely read her thoughts. Perhaps the fairy didn't even notice or care right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with memories of the past years they had spent together as friends, Espurr saw saw the tiny Zorua literally breaking up with his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the fox, who dropped his smile, realizing what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Is this... you two broke up?</span>\" Espurr indelicately asked, causing Celebi to shut her eyes open, Gardevoir to gasp and Braixen to glance at the dark-type fox, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">W-Wha...?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Zorua! Y-You...</span>\" Gardevoir chimed, recalling the night Zorua had confessed his feelings for the fairy; she had helped him, she couldn't believe he was breaking up with her!... But she also couldn't blame him, she discovered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at the dark-type fox's chest, not finding the courage to look at him in the eye. She could definitely feel his blue gaze fixed straight on her. She had totally forgotten about the reason that made her realize her mistake: Zorua was leaving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi...\" he mumbled, unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his friends let go of Celebi, who fluttered in front of the fox wordlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she DID speak one word though,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked away, feeling the gazes of his friends and girlfriend on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua... you still want to break up?</span>\" Celebi insisted, tears rolling down her cheeks again. Those weren't normal tears though, those were tears coming from a broken heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at his girlfriend; this time, he had an answer.</span></div></div>",

He grinned a bit too, he couldn't help but find it contagious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Braixen came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Read the title, please.</span>\" Espurr said and Braixen rubbed the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Uh...yeah 'The lake of Carvanha and the spirit of the Dusk: Uncut edition' this was the cut deemed too gruesome for theaters and was banned in a few providences for content...to be honest, even a few scenes unsettled me...no one knows that I have this but I should've figured you'd know Espurr...</span>\" Braixen said, her eyes fell on Celebi...who had gone white as a sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr...please no...</span>\" Celebi said and Zorua was looking like a kid in a candy store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espurr...please yes...\" He said and Celebi eyed all of them. Gardevoir just shrugged, Braixen too just scratched the back of her head...and Espurr was smiling. There would be no mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed...if it'd put her actions to rest, then she'd take her lumps. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay...we can watch it later tonight...</span>\" She said, almost a squeak. Espurr smiled gentler. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">It'll be fine Celi...it's just a movie.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah...</span>\" Celebi said, she knew she'd get at least one solid night of nightmares...but it'd make Zorua happy too, and Espurr had more than the right to get a little revenge. This was mild compared to what she'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So...should we invite any others? Maybe smooth things over with Buneary and Kirlia, invite Azurill as we-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Absolutely not!</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes.</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Not having them watch this movie!</span>\"<br>\r\n\"I'm for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone spoke over each other at this...then Celebi spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">This movie is WAY too graphic for little kids! Are you NUTS!?</span>\" Celebi asked and Braixen eyed her. \"<span class=\"corange\">Nuts would go to the pokemon that just-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I realize i'll be hearing about this for a while from you girls, and I realize you aren't wrong either, but there's no WAY i'd feel comfortable putting Kirlia, Azurill or Buneary in front of that screen!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">...they don't need to watch the movie, but i'd like to discuss something with Azurill.</span>\" Espurr said calmly. Celebi looked at her...then it clicked. Despite all of this, Espurr was still wanting to talk more about what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Celebi was apprehensive, but she realized that was just Espurr's innate nature. If she wanted to help a pokemon...she would at any cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was silent too, Espurr had talked with him that one night...about his past and his father, the mind reading thing...it let her find answers the pokemon didn't want to give, but she tried to help her friends with it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...i'm for them coming Celi, I GUESS they don't need to watch the movie.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir looked around the room. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">If Kirlia doesn't watch the movie...fine. I guess I owe her for dumping her back at home like this anyway.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes fell on Celebi.</span></div></div>",

Espurr?</span>\" She heard from her paws and she looked down. She had a deadpan look. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">...you don't need to call me ms.</span>\" She said and Azurill nodded.

Maybe he was a good pokemon...once. And...I wished for him to repent. I didn't want it to end like that. I'm sad for him...i'm sad for Igglybuff, for Swinub...for all of them. I can't argue that he earned his fate, and I won't argue that...but whenever the topic comes up in the house i'm in...how am I supposed to say how I feel to them? He tried to kill me...kill all of us, and he destroyed Meloetta's home...hurt her. I can't forgive that. But I can't get rid of the feelings I have too...</span>\" He said, he was looking at the lap he was sitting on and starting to feel misty eyed.

Thoughts, emotions...they're complex things, and if you need help sorting through them, there are pokemon that care about you...the kids Wigglytuff looked after...they don't know you're alive. They're not only mourning Wigglytuff, but you as well...though it was his fault. And if Igglybuff learned the truth of her father, how would she feel? I know this is a lot to sort through...and I know it's all been on your mind for days.</span>\" She said. Azurill started sniffling now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It's okay...I want to help.</span>\" She said and Azurill started to cry full on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I just want things to be okay for them...for all of them...but I don't know how that can happen.</span>\" Espurr grabbed the little mouse in her paws and hugged him to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">...I think you should talk with Celebi's mom about it. She's the one that wants to address the kids, and I think talking with her and Meloetta will quell your concerns more than you realize...until then, enjoy the evening, okay?</span>\" She said as she got up, holding Azurill. She was going to keep this to herself, Celebi was convinced of how she felt about all of this and she wasn't going to push that button again, resolved Zorua tensions or no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she did need to hash things out with the fairy one on one in the near future, for now, she'd enjoy the whining from her about the movie.</span></div></div>",

I'm not feeling well...</span>\" she whimpered as her feet touched the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's something I can do for you,\" he said, his back arching up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend gave a weak smile as she climbed onto him, laid belly-down on the black fur and wrapped her arms around Zorua's neck, her feet hanging from the sides of the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that done, Zorua started walking with his passenger on his back. He walked very slowly: knowing Espurr, she was still halfway there with her heart in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi swallowed, before placing her fist on the door as she started knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know why she was knocking, given how Espurr could read minds and certainly already knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, there was no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr...</span>\" the fairy called shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she received no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called out for her former friend one last time, but she got the same response as earlier: silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears rolling down her eyes, Celebi looked at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Le-Let's go...</span>\" she mumbled, starting to flutter away, her heart sunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua didn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's heart sank even deeper into her chest. Was Zorua reconsidering about not leaving her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Zorua...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time-traveler watched as her boyfriend stepped forward and knocked at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espurr! It's me, Zorua! Can I come i-\" the door suddenly opened, and Zorua was literally dragged inside by a psychic grip, before the door was hastily slammed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blinked, before sighing deeply as she sat down next to Espurr's door, placing her arms on her knees and her head in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked around the large mansion with awe: he had never seen it from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him, Espurr stood in silence, her wide eyes still wet with tears and her small body still shaken by sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaze of the dark-type fox ultimately fell on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espurr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">No.</span>\" she interrupted before Zorua even spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the words of the fox evaporated in a sigh of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn mind-reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you're feeling Espurr,\" he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I don't think you do.</span>\" the psychic-type interrupted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart, I've been through worse with Celi... I was smaller than you were earlier... it still hurts,\" he rose the paw that was once broken when he was reduced to a nanoscopic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr looked down: if there was someone that could comprehend her, that was Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... My best friend did that to me... I felt so helpless... I was only trying to help...</span>\" she finally started to open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">But, please, let's sit down... I'll make tea...</span>\" she said, gesturing for a rather large couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua could respond he was fine like this, or that he didn't particularly like tea, Espurr had disappeared in her kitchen; she came back into the living room several minutes later, holding a steaming cup and another one full of dark liquid that Zorua identified as soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thanked Espurr, and took a sip, before signing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, when Celebi did that to me, she was incredibly sorry: she had almost killed me. She... healed me, took care of me and... you know how things went.\" Zorua said,<br>\r\n\"What I'm trying to say is: Celi is really sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">She wasn't before you threatened her to break up, was she?</span>\" she pointed out upon reading Zorua's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was... that wasn't the Celi in know and love. She was scary, I had to do something...\" Zorua admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It worked...</span>\" Espurr bitterly said, taking a sip of her tea; the hot liquid noisily slid down her throat and into her empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr slowly put her cup down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua, tell me something,</span>\" she said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">How do you feel about Wigglytuff's literal disappearance?</span>\" she changed subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time today, Zorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I regret not finishing him off personally. Other than that - and this whole mess - I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr pointed to his bandaged head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's itchy, but I don't feel so much pain anymore... will probably take this thing off in a few days...\" he responded, but Espurr wasn't listening anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had moved forward, closer to the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, Es-\" the smaller psychic-type grabbed his head in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You tried to save me... from Celebi...</span>\" she recalled. The fox blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah!... Remember when you hid me from Braixen?\" he recalled, but Espurr didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Zorua's cheeks began to burn as the psychic-type feline pushed her lips on one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty seconds, Espurr pulled off, shoving her head against Zorua's as she hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Thank you.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered sheepishly - if Celebi was seeing any of this, he was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...\" he replied - if Celebi was seeing any of this, Espurr was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about his girlfriend, Zorua smiled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Want to talk to that girlfriend of mine out there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sat next to the door, seeking any kind of comfort in burying her head in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the door beside her opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up as her boyfriend came out with a neutral expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">S-So?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi watched as Zorua...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the next day, and once again Zorua and Celebi had the house to themselves. Celebi smiled at her diminutive boyfriend. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr's favorite. Bittersweet chocolate cake. I can't just leave it be Zorua, but I understand why Espurr feels the way she does...but I have to keep trying!</span>\" She said. She felt much better about this stuff today and Zorua eyed her wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this'll work?

A small package and some wrapping paper psychically flew into the kitchen as the fairy prepared her gift for her former friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake that was supposed to be delivered to Espurr was put down again as the fairy grabbed Zorua instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Because I'm sure that my sweet little Zorua would do that and more for me.</span>\" she replied with a honey-sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua didn't fell for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

I just know...\" Zorua huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And you tell them the truth,</span>\" Celebi replied as her boyfriend started growing, until he was back at his original size, slightly bigger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom knows about us anyway.</span>\" she finished by pecking Zorua on the cheek and setting the plate with the cake down on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this cake falls, it's not my problem. Okay?\" he had to make sure there weren't going to be any unwanted consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't worry, I'll make another. Now go.</span>\" she pecked Zorua again and psychically opened the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type fox inhaled sharply as he walked out of the kitchen, reached the door and left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's gaze followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped Espurr was going to forgive her... but, even if she didn't, she still had Zorua. That was a good consolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua walked through the village, whistling while desperately trying keep the cake on his back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox rounded a corner, waved a paw in Lopunny's direction, received a neutral stare from the same Lopunny - for some reason, her daughter kept gushing about him - and kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox walked, pokemon shooting irritated glares, fearful looks or even curious looks in direction of the package on his back, but they left him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from one pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Stop right there ya!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice came from behind Zorua. He stopped, a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, finding Graveler standing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">What's in the package?</span>\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business.\" Zorua replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Graveler didn't relent,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Is that cake I smell?</span>\" he asked again, grinning at the thought of a good snack before lunch.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Well well well, looks like someone stole from the pastry shop again... I thought Slurpuff said she didn't want to see you anymore...</span>\" the rock said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered at the memory - that cake was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't stole it you moron. My girlfriend did this. Though I doubt I need to give you any explanations.\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveler growled, but then smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">\u2018Moron\u2019? My Zorua, such bad words... but let's say that I'm going to forget you said anything... if you give me that cake. I'm sure your girlfriend, whoever that is, would be pleased if you \u2018shared\u2019 it...</span>\" he said, figuring that whoever Zorua's girlfriend was - if she really existed, and he doubted it - wouldn't complain if she didn't want to be beaten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock pokemon was merrily unaware of who Zorua's girlfriend was and, quite frankly, he was unaware of what the mind of a prankster can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I'm giving it to you.\" Zorua responded, while mentally formulating a plan: taking on Graveler up close would be suicide... but using his trickery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered as the rock took a step forward,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Maybe I need to rephrase that...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr's house was after his forest... Graveler had no chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I changed my mind,\" Zorua said, grinning maniacally.<br>\r\n\"Take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn illusionary cake was flung at Graveler, who got hit in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes and growled, discovering Zorua running like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch me if you can, rock-head!\" he shouted, his cry followed by his characteristic snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveler growled again as he started running behind the fox, who struggled to balance the plate on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock chased the dark-type throughout the whole village, both earning curious looks from the villagers, although no one dared to step in. Both of them were jerks, they didn't want to get in whatever they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua was hopelessly too agile for Graveler to catch up in time before the fox disappeared into his forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, the heavy rock pokemon made his way into the woods as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Come out and fight like a man! You're dead!</span>\" he called out, walking through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua was nowhere to be seen. The other way around, the fox saw Graveler perfectly, hidden by countless plants, Espurr's cake safely resting on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe purposefully made some of the bushes around Graveler shake with an illusion, the rock followed the shaking bushes... and suddenly felt the ground beneath his feet receding as he sank into it, falling into a pit Zorua himself dug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering, the fox walked out of his hiding spot and made his way to the edge of the pit, where Graveler was shouting horrible words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever considered losing weight?\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">When I get back up there, you're dead Zorua. DEAD!</span>\" the rock seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Zorua raised one of his paws in a poor imitation of a hideous gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before a rock was thrown at him. Zorua tilted his head, the rock barely missing him. He frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was thinking... you'll be in there for quite a while... I'll get ya something to drink buddy.\" he said, disappearing from Graveler's eyesight, returning a minute later with a bucket, which was thrown at the rock-type, splashing him with green paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveler growled again as Zorua howled with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Wrong bucket! Hahaha!\" Zorua laughed, before turning around.<br>\r\n\"I have something to do right now. But don't worry! I'll find some time to come and mess with ya some more!\" he said, walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">GET BACK HERE ZORUA!</span>\" Graveler shouted, but the tricky fox ignored him as he made his way out of his woods, the echo of Graveler's screams following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua anxiously knocked at the door of Espurr's mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis response was a minute of silence, before Espurr opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was right, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Hi Zorua...</span>\" the psychic-type greeted, looking deadpan as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she was back to her normal self, but she probably still didn't want to see anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zorua beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Espurr! I'm here to give you this...\" he turned around to show Espurr the package Celebi made. The psychic-type feline stared at it, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made with love and humble apologies from Celebi!\" Zorua mentioned happily, turning around again to grin at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr remained silent for a moment, before taking the package from Zorua's back and opening it. Her eyes widened... even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi made her that cake, was probably trying to win her over again with that... but it was a symbolic gift: it was the cake Celebi herself had made for her on her last birthday, and she loved it. Not only because it was good, but also because her best friend had made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake was psychically lifted from her paws and flew inside her mansion, landing on a table, before Espurr faced Zorua again, reading the thoughts behind his grin. He knew what was going on, but he didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic-type looked surprised for a moment - Graveler-related memories - before she read Zorua's thoughts of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope that she was going to give his girlfriend a second chance.</span></div></div>",

If you bring this part up to her, please don't do anything rash again!\" Celebi looked at her tiny boyfriend, then took a deep breath and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she opened them and smiled. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay...I think I understand.</span>\" She said as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm gonna go visit Espurr then...keep Meloetta and Azurill company in the meantime.</span>\" She said as she fluttered out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah...\" He said, but he smiled watching her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would hopefully patch it all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi made her way through the forest, and as she did she passed the pit with Graveler. He asked for her help to get out as he was covered in drying green paint and she just smiled at him before psychically dropping a Beedrill nest onto his head from a tree. Hearing approaching buzzing Celebi continued on her path, disregarding the yelps and buzzing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the mansion, putting up a mental block and sighing. She'd need to address the kiss on the cheek as well as her attitude towards Espurr. Put it all on the table, and then discuss it. No shrinking, no psychic battles...two pokemon hopefully reconciling a friendship, that's what this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened to reveal Espurr, who was looking more or less normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Come in.</span>\" She said in her deadpan voice and Celebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr I-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">At the table.</span>\" Espurr simply said as she led Celebi into the home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silence as they made their way to the dining room, and at a small table Espurr had set up was a small dinner of soup, salad and breadsticks, with the cake at a side table for desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wow...</span>\" Celebi said as Espurr sat at the table and Celebi followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">We'll eat, and discuss these things...</span>\" Espurr mumbled, she was clearly still nervous, but Celebi wanted to ease tensions. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Been a while since I had a dinner with you like this...it's nice.</span>\" She said. Espurr gave a slight smile. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yeah...</span>\" She said, almost wistfully, but soon she was back at her default. Celebi sat and looked at her plate and bowl before Espurr nodded. Celebi sipped at her soup, it was nice and Espurr sipped it as well. Celebi put the spoon down and started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Look, about yesterday...I was out of line...I know that, and...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I'd like to discuss something else first Celebi...Wigglytuff...</span>\" Espurr said and Celebi nearly spat the sip of soup out of her mouth. Still!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Let me speak first...Igglybuff. I want you to comprehend her...think of her for a moment right now in silence. Then speak.</span>\" Espurr said simply and Celebi calmed herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nice kid, a little spoiled, but innocent. Loved her foster siblings...loved her dad. Smiled a lot. Celebi sat in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It's not an easy thing to lose a parent, despite their true nature Celi...that's what I was trying to make you understand...</span>\" Espurr said solemnly and Celebi nodded. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">We tried to make him understand that too...my mom...Azurill...both of them pushed for it...it isn't like...I intended to kill a pokemon when it started, it just...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Escalated?</span>\" Espurr said, much like the situation yesterday had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Celebi...i'm worried that you're going to lose yourself the more you use that power...and what you did to me just makes me double down on that thought...</span>\" Celebi was about to open her mouth when Espurr said something that shocked her. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I kissed Zorua yesterday. On the cheek, for gratitude for what he had done for me...i'm sorry.</span>\" She said and Celebi sighed. She had already known that, but the mental block kept Espurr from gleaming that. Celebi closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know, Zorua told me.</span>\" She said and Espurr seemed surprised before nodding. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Do you want to dispose of me?</span>\" She asked and Celebi shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I wasn't in my right mind yesterday, I-I won't do that ever again, I need you to know that...</span>\" Celebi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Celebi...I thought the world of you you know...I was jealous...not of your power or anything like that, you never desired to bring attention to that...but of your kindness, your optimism, your silly naivete that seemed to make the room light up...I think you're losing that...</span>\" Espurr said and Celebi quietly took a bite of her salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm not any different than the pokemon you knew...i'm not...</span>\" She said. Espurr looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You've shrunk 4 pokemon...a delinquent that's more or less reformed, a small child with his own share of problems, a depraved soul who still had a family, and myself. You had options beyond shrinking to deal with all 4 but opted for the shrinking one. It has altered lived irrevocably and ended a life. Please say you understand why i'm doing this?</span>\" Espurr urged and Celebi put her fork down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What do you want me to do? I just wanted to reconcile our friendship...</span>\" Celebi said, she didn't know if she was annoyed or not...once again, but she reigned it in. She wouldn't direct it at Espurr, she'd hear her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I want you...to be the kind, considerate Celebi I grew to love, and not someone that would harm without considering the consequences...my heart goes out to Igglybuff and all of her siblings...in a way that I truly don't think you understand.</span>\" She said, her voice cracking a little and Celebi realized what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's dad was merely divorced from her mom, and she still saw him a lot. Espurr's mom had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked down as she remembered that...was she doing that to Igglybuff? To all of those kids? Wigglytuff deserved it! But if he had gone to jail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside Celebi clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr...I am so, so sorry...</span>\" She said, tears almost welling up. Espurr smiled, she had gotten through to her. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I won't...I won't use the power on a pokemon unwilling ever again...</span>\" She said and Espurr nodded, tears rolling down her cheeks. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Good...then let's finish dinner, and have some cake...</span>\" She said and Celebi looked up, tears rolling down her cheeks too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening went fine, Celebi reconciled the fact that she'd shrunk Espurr, and Espurr said she wouldn't intrude on Zorua. Both of them finally hugged and it was dark by the time Celebi left.</span></div></div>",

Pretty much everything in Meloetta's house was destroyed, Wigglytuff noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill's eyes fell on the unconscious owner of the mansion, who was laying flat on the ground, completely covered in dust and small debris. She looked fine... except for the fact the she was fainted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Meloetta!</span>\" Azurill cried as he tried to move towards the giantess, his massive tail knocking Wigglytuff over as the blue mouse moved up to the unconscious giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Ow...</span>\" the pink rabbit whimpered as he stood up, feeling pain in his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Draco Meteor had drained most of his energies... but at least, it had the desired effect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff was forced to reconsider as two massive shadows eclipsed his incredibly tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and her mother - both wearing murderous glares upon their faces. A third giant rose behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're so going to pay for this one dirty trick, you bug,\" Zorua said as he looked around the partly destroyed house, noting the unconscious Meloetta, the crying Azurill and both the raging Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You...</span>\" Celebi spat venomously, her eyes glowing as she psychically gripped the throat of Wigglytuff, lifting him off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm going to shrink you so much that you'll disappear from existence itself!</span>\" she threatened, causing the terrorized rabbit to gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Celebi's mother didn't share her daughter's opinion. No, she had much greater plans for the tiny rabbit who just attempted to annihilate her and her daughter, along with Zorua, Azurill and Meloetta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that, Wigglytuff didn't deserve jail... he deserved hell. And only one pokemon in the destroyed house could give him that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Wigglytuff... have you got an idea of what you just did?! You insulted my daughter and menaced Zorua for no reason... and that's only the tip of the iceberg! You faked the death of one of your kids, broke in a house, attempted to murder said kid! Not to mention that you destroyed this house! No jail sentence will ever be enough to repay this all... and, despite what I try to teach my daughter, your crimes can't be forgiven... and I know a proper fate for you,</span>\" she said, each word she spoke falling hard on Wigglytuff's soul... if he had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld in midair by psychic, he could only watch as the pink time traveler turned around to look at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua dear... you more than anyone in here deserve to decide the fate of this worthless bug... anything you wish for, do it.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at the floating pink dot... and started snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure ma'am...\" he said as he got closer, Celebi stepping aside to let him place his gigantic muzzle in front of the terrified rabbit.<br>\r\n\"Hey bu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Ow... my head...</span>\" Meloetta whimpered as she finally regained consciousness and sat upright, looking around dazedly, noticing the damaged that the Draco Meteor caused to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took notice of a familiar blue mouse standing beside her too. He was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess quietly picked him up and hugged him to her chest, before looking where the trio was standing, a minuscule pink speck floating in midair, almost invisible to the naked eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta glared.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">... Pick a proper fate, Zorua.</span>\" she encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"Ya heard the ladies?\" he asked Wigglytuff, his words menacing to break the rabbit's eardrums due the closeness of the fox and his much bigger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wigglytuff, d'you remember earlier, when I suggested Celebi to keep you as our pet? I did mention \u2018I'm getting hungry\u2019...\" Zorua recalled, and Wigglytuff went pale like death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the death he was probably going to face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess what bug... I'm hungry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Wigglytuff's world became as Zorua leaned forward, his lips parting briefly before closing around the pink dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeat. Darkness. Razor-sharp teeth. And a dreadful abyss of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the things Wigglytuff noted as a giant red muscle started throwing him back and forth inside the confines of Zorua's mouth as the fox tasted the small rabbit... although it resulted pretty hard for him to do so, he discovered, due how small Wigglytuff was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the confines of his hot entrapment, Wigglytuff whimpered... it was over. Zorua would swallow with no doubt, and he was going to meet the fox's stomach up close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Please... I saved Azurill!</span>\" he cried, his body hit with huge drops of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You also attempted to kill him, so you two are even! But you also destroyed this house, and that can't go unpunished I'm afraid... or pleased to say!</span>\" Zorua snickered, showing his tiny prisoner each time his mouth opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the rabbit, he was forced to hold his ears, Zorua's words comparable to explosions as he was just on the edge of his vocal chords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark fox savored the moment - and his prey - as long as he could, before grinning as he started to tilt his head backwards...</div></div>",

It was true, the sun had to have set at least an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'll order us something...</span>\" The tired voice of Celebi's mother cut through the night and Zorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza!\" He said in an excited tone. \"All meat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi rolled her eyes. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't be selfish...a pizza sounds good though.</span>\" She said and Celebi's mother nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'll order...probably that.</span>\" She relented and Zorua whistled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Please dear, I know you're excited but he's sleeping~</span>\" Meloetta asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...We need to discuss the matter of what he'll do la-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know, but that's later right? For now...let's just worry about one thing at a time. Getting us all fed...rested...and having our nice chat about <i>us</i>\" Zorua teased, he was changing the subject, and Celebi was certain he was going to prolong dealing with asking Azurill if he wanted to be normal and leave them for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I know it isn't a mansion, but...</span>\" Celebi's mother was showing Meloetta the guest room. A simple room with a two person bed, which currently occupied a tiny sleeping Azurill and his doll, a desk with a lamp, and a small closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">It's wonderful~ Thank you very much for having us~</span>\" Meloetta bowed her head to the older Celebi who just rubbed a paw to the side of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, it's really no trouble. Sorry again about what happened earlier...I need to go make some phone calls. Ordering the food and I need to let my boss i'll be out tomorrow...I don't really want to leave things alone right now. Then...I need to talk to them.</span>\" She looked behind her to see Celebi and Zorua on the couch in the living room, with him listing off various pizza toppings as Celebi rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">If you or Azurill have any questions, myself or Celebi are happy to answer or assist.</span>\" She said as she went to make her calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Will you wake him for the food?</span>\" Celebi's mom asked and Meloetta looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">I'd rather him sleep through the night, but he does need to eat...I probably will~</span>\" She said looking a slight bit concerned for the child...she didn't want to admit it but...she hoped Azurill would stay with her. Tiny or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We've got some time before the food is here...now...explain it.</span>\" Celebi and Zorua looked at the pink Celebi in front of them, her arms folded and tone stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ma'am...i've uh...been staying here...for a bit now. The shrinking ability your daughter has...she's...\" He found himself somewhat at a loss for words, it was difficult to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom, Zorua's my boyfriend.</span>\" She just decided to rip that band-aid off. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">He's homeless, didn't have anywhere to go and he was the first pokemon I shrunk after he pranked me. We...went through a lot when I did that, and I wanted to make things right with him. I offered him the chance to stay with me under your radar shrunken down and we grew attached from there.</span>\" Celebi bowed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm sorry mom, I know how you feel about me dating but...he's a good guy, beneath the bluster and ego...he's a real sweetheart.</span>\" She said and Zorua blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Celebi sighed. \"<span class=\"cppink\">This has been one large mess missy...and the two pokemon in the next room got wrapped up in your shenanigans as well...then there's the matter of Wigglytuff...</span>\" She sighed again. \"<span class=\"cppink\">At least...he can't hurt anyone anymore though, and we have your shenanigans to thank for that too I suppose.</span>\" Her look softened. \"<span class=\"cppink\">You're really homeless Zorua...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a sorry story ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Tell it to us sometime...you might feel better.</span>\" She said and Zorua chuckled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds exactly like something a friend told me...\" He had told Espurr that night...it felt like a lifetime ago now, the time he spent with his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">As for the living accommodations you have now...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

In that time she needed to figure out how to deal with Azurill, the other kids Wigglytuff had, discuss how long Meloetta would be staying under her roof, and smooth over Wigglytuff's disappearance from the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be a long few days...maybe tomorrow they should...do something to wash the taste of today out of their mouths though.

Just great.</span>\" Celebi sarcastically stated as a hand found its way to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt an annoying ache in her head, caused either by all the screaming or by the abuse of her size-changing ability today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo ease things, she removed the psychic shield from her mind, allowing it to be read by Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the psychic-type remained quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Zorua spoke instead as he looked around the destroyed house, his gaze going from the shattered windows to the smashed ceiling, from the several expensive objects that caught fire to a completely destroyed staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Wigglytuff... wreck a place like this... I hope those kids eat him!\" Zorua commented with a frown, causing his girlfriend to giggle lowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I don't think staying here will repair anything,</span>\" Espurr finally spoke as she looked at the couple in front of her, noting how much bigger they were than her.

Sure, you're glad that everyone survived that cataclysm, but it was still a great house, huh?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at the blushing Zorua, unwrapping her arms from him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Me, my mom, your friend and mine are fine Zorua, thank you for caring.</span>\" she remarked sarcastically,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">God, you have the priorities of a spoiled child...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that why we're together right now?\" Zorua mused, nudging the fairy, who responded by hugging the fox again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr put her empty cup with a bit more strength that she intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I was thinking,</span>\" she said, the hint of a smile on her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Why don't you two stay here for the night?

I have quite a few movies we can watch, and dad isn't coming home and - your mom discovered about you two and wants to confront you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi, who opened her mouth to speak, closed it and nodded: Espurr must have read Zorua's mind, since hers was blocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah... after tonight, I doubt she'll kick Zorua out, but we can't be sure... plus, Meloetta and Azurill are staying with us now, they need to be taken care of as well,</span>\" Celebi recalled the words of her mother and forcefully swallowed a lump in her throat: the thought that she could lose Zorua tonight tied itself around her stomach tightly, like a knot, and it squeezed pretty hard, like an Ekans with a particularly chubby Rattata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smiled, comprehensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I understand,</span>\" she said as Zorua began looking anxious too,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">But if you were you, I'd let things calm down a bit first.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right...\" Zorua agreed, causing his girlfriend to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi pondered her next choice.</span></div></div>",

Thing is, we've lied to her. And well... she doesn't like being lied to.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention, one of the time-traveler petite paws grabbed Zorua's rougher one in a quite strong grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox remained silent, though Espurr needed no words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yeah, being kicked out would be quite unpleasant. You've come so far, Zorua, became a better pokemon, so different from the one you were before. <br>\r\nYou matured in both heart and mind,  and all in just a few weeks. I must admit I am truly impressed.</span>\" she said, blushing furiously but smiling brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua too blushed furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Thanks, I've had a lot of help.\" he replied, looking in between the two girls, who both embraced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox's blush became more intense, but the sensation he felt was rather nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sad that it probably wasn't going to last long though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night went on, movie after movie, until  the three occupants of Espurr's house didn't declare their intention to go to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after having shut the TV off, Espurr led her guests to her bedroom, which left Zorua speechless as it was far, far bigger than the small bedroom he used to share with his girlfriend, and it was surely far, far better than the cold hard ground he used to call 'bed' back in the woods where he previously lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single glance at the bed was enough to make it feel embarrassed. If Espurr's sleepovers were similar to Celebi's, that meant the two girls were going to share the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he had already shared a bed with both, but that was before Celebi became his actual girlfriend... and when he was doll-sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... perhaps I should take the couch...\" he pointed out, starting to retreat back from where the trio came from... only to halt when a ball of shrinking energy was shot straight into his body, diminishing him to only a couple inches. His small body was hastily picked up by a smiling Celebi, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Dream on, cutie~</span>\" she sang, pecking her diminutive boyfriend. Espurr watched the scene in silence, smiling a bit. Both her friends were lucky to have each other, she felt happy for them... though she was sure she would have felt happier if Zorua-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic-type discarded such line of thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It's quite late. Let's go to bed.</span>\" she chimed instead, pulling back the blankets of the huge bed with Psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giantesses slid into the bed, Celebi hugging the tiny Zorua to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Goodnight, you two~</span>\" the fairy chimed while the lights were turned off by the same Psychic from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe received drowsy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zorua, he leaned into his girlfriend's chest, hugging back. If this truly was going to be his last night with her, he was going to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox let the warmth envelop him like a second blanket and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he, along with the two giantesses, was asleep. </span></div></div>",

Celebi nodded as she leaned over to hug her friend. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Thanks Espurr, and thanks for having us over last night.</span>\" She said, as Zorua found himself pinned in the hug between the two pokemon, feeling a bit of pressure. \"G-girls, this is sweet and all, but...\" Zorua felt his voice cracking as Celebi pulled away, and he tumbled onto the sheets beneath him, making Celebi giggle. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on Zorua, we'd better get going.</span>\" Celebi said as she picked up her boyfriend and made her way out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had restored Zorua as they made their way back to the village, her riding on his back as they passed by the ruins of Meloetta's mansion. \"I hope those kids make that rabbit's life a living hell...and if he tries anything...\" Zorua seethed as Celebi rolled her eyes at him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Relax, it should be taken care of, anymore stunts from him and i'll shrink him into oblivion. Right now, we just need to focus on the task ahead of us.</span>\" Celebi said as she wrapped her arms around his neck, making him blush fiercely. \"Y-yeah...I just want Meloetta and Azurill to get their house back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So you can use their stuff?</span>\" Celebi said, half teasing half scolding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not...the only reason.\" Zorua defended as they walked to the village, enjoying the peace of the morning as they went on. When they finally entered the village Zorua felt eyes on him, and especially on Celebi in shock of what they were witnessing. Zorua didn't care though, at this point he wasn't too stressed about his reputation among the villagers, he'd repair it in time, especially now that a certain stupid rabbit wouldn't be saying anything anymore. He needed to focus on the conversation ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh, Zorua! Celebi!</span>\" A familiar voice chimed to Zorua's side as he saw Buneary hop over to the two. She looked cheery as she regarded Zorua and Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Buneary, how's it goin'?\" Zorua asked with a carefree grin as Celebi smiled warmly at the bunny pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh, it's going well, my mom gave me some money for sweets, so I was gonna get some then go see if I could spend time with Azurill, Meloetta would be fine with that, right?</span>\" She said before Celebi blinked and Zorua frowned slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, kid, you should come with us...we can explain on the way.\" Zorua said as Buneary looked confused but complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi opened the door to her house, quietly and nervously, anticipating what was to come, she noted the light on in the kitchen, and thought she heard chatter. The three pokemon entered the house, Celebi leading as they went in to find that the older Celebi and Meloetta were sitting at a table as Azurill sat on his tail on the table, all three chatting as the older Celebi and Meloetta sipped at some coffee. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey mom...</span>\" Celebi said with a smile. The older Celebi looked to her daughter with a warm smile. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Hello dear, I assume you stayed over at Espurr's last night?</span>\" She said and Celebi nodded. Zorua and Buneary entered the kitchen as well at this point, Zorua looking incredibly nervous. \"<span class=\"cppink\">And Zorua, just the pokemon I wanted to talk to.</span>\" The older Celebi said as she sipped her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hi Ms. Celebi, Ms. Meloetta, Azurill!</span>\" Buneary chimed in, smiling.

And Zorua and Celebi!</span>\" Azurill said, as Buneary went to pick him up, Zorua rolled his eyes. \"Can see who the favorite is...\" He said as his gaze met the older Celebi's, a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Meloetta, Buneary, Azurill, may I have a moment alone with my daughter and Zorua please?</span>\" She asked, her voice composed and friendly, though the statement was more or less a command. Meloetta got up from the table as she and Buneary exited the room, Azurill in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh...how'd the other thing go?\" Zorua asked as the pink Celebi sighed. \"<span class=\"cppink\">With Wigglytuff? That was quite the charged discussion with those kids, and a lot of them didn't quite believe it, though Azurill being there seemed to convince them to an extent that he was keeping things from them. As for Azurill, you can grow him back anytime dear.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I will later on today most likely...but that isn't what you wanted to discuss, was it?</span>\" Celebi said nervously as her mother looked at her with a neutral expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No, it wasn't. Zorua...you've certainly changed quite a bit young man.</span>\" She said, paw around her mug of coffee. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Though I don't approve of how you hid this...and how the situation spiraled out of control.</span>\" She said regarding both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I know that i've made my share of mistakes, but I promise ya i'm genuine, I love your daughter and i'm on the straight and narrow.\" Zorua said, Celebi blushed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please mom...I promise no more secrets, but he has nowhere to go...let him stay with us, please...</span>\" Celebi pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Celebi sighed. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Yeah I knew that was coming...believe me, Azurill has been doing his darndest to convince me too.</span>\" She said as Zorua grinned a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the older Celebi spoke.</span></div></div>",

His perch was too high for him to jump to the floor without getting injured; however, if Wigglytuff got him, his 'injury' would be impossible to fix, given how openly the pink, overgrown rabbit stated his intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid pink pokemon approached the table calmly - there was no rush. He would be quick, just press his paw on Azurill's respiration sources until the kid choked, in which point he was free to leave and carry on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, Azurill, stop running and come to me. In a minute, it will be all over. I promise you won't feel a thing.</span>\" Wigglytuff said like a psychopath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill could do nothing but back away in fear, until he reached the edge of the table, where his hopes were shattered like glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was truly over then? Now that he got to be happy again...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill let a tear roll down his cheek; Wigglytuff approached him, his shadow completely obscuring the young pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now kid, say good-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crash made Wigglytuff trail off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Night?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink pokemon turned around, hearing noises in the other room. Voices, too. Voices tremendously familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"cpink\">Not now, damn it!</span></i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill had apparently noticed the noise too, and his heart began swelling with hope. Was he safe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clgreen\">This way Zorua, I sense them!</span></font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill's eyes widened. Celebi! And Zorua! His friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd surely enough, two figures familiar to both Wigglytuff and Azurill made their appearance on the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Celebi and Zorua's eyes locked with the scene in front of them: a startled Azurill with a clearly nervous Wigglytuff dangerously near the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You!</span>\" the legendary hissed, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Get away from him this instant, you monster!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff gritted his teeth, thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple in front of him was way younger and surely less experienced than him in battle, and he had his own fair share of battles in his day; but they still outnumbered him and one possessed a great power while the other could trap him in an illusion to incapacitate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way out. Unless... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Celebi and Zorua. It looks like I'm done, am I not?</span>\" he sarcastically said while raising his hands and walking closer to the couple, having apparently surrendered,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But what do you plan to do? Send me to jail? No, that's ridiculous, you have no proof, except for Azurill over there, who I'm sure you wouldn't want to show around at such small stature,</span>\" Wigglytuff continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi frowned, feeling her hatred for the rabbit rising to extreme levels. He was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Then you're going straight back to the jar.</span>\" she growled. Zorua remained silent, examining his opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something wrong, he gave up too easily... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff offered a polite giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Alright.</span>\" he agreed, walking past the couple, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sure you will want me to lead the way, so I don't...</span>\" Wigglytuff trailed off as a grin crawled across his face, though Celebi and Zorua couldn't see it because he was giving his back to them, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Try anything funny.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Wigglytuff turned around and rose his paw, only for it to glow as he performed Brick Break and brought it down... right against an azure shield crafted by Celebi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Seriously? That's a clich\u00e9, Wigglytuff.</span>\" Celebi nearly laughed, before her eyes glowed as she got ready to shrink the menace in front of her; however Wigglytuff only smirked more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThem, despite his age, he made a swift leap in the air and jumped past Celebi's protect, landing right behind her. And behind Zorua who, taken aback, could only watch as the paw of the pink rabbit came down straight on his head, hitting him square in between the eyes and knocking him unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua!</span>\" Celebi screamed as she saw her boyfriend falling flat to the floor, his body limp; on the table, Azurill was horrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRage filled the green fairy entirely as she looked at Wigglytuff with a hateful expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>You will pay for this!</i></span>\" she growled, before whizzing towards Wigglytuff with as much speed as her wings could offer, wishing nothing more than to grab a hold of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the rabbit was prepared and stepped to the side, avoiding the green bullet of a fairy, before driving his elbow straight into her back, causing Celebi to drop to the floor with a loud thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for Wigglytuff, the time came to finish things up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot Azurill a murderous stare, right before moving a step towards him. Then another. Then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step Wigglytuff took, Azurill took one as well, only backwards, mentally invoking for his green haired savior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA savior came indeed, though it was covered in black and red fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn illusion faded and Zorua roared as he threw himself at Wigglytuff, tackling him to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink pokemon grunted as he rolled on his back with the fox on top of his white stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why won't you brat just stay out of-</span>\" Wigglytuff was interrupted when an invisible force pulled him back; looking up, he discovered Celebi, still on the floor, pulling him along with Zorua towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type fox jumped off his belly while he began struggling to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let go!</span>\" he cried, before he growled in pain: Zorua had driven his fangs deep into his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stood back and flew forward, driving a knee right into the opponent's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You brats just don't know when to let go, do you!?</span>\" the stubborn Wigglytuff roared, suddenly emitting a powerful psychic wave to push back Celebi's own psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to get free, and tried to prepare an attack, but his two opponents were faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Shadow Ball and an Energy Ball hit him from both sides, causing thunderous explosion that was heard in the whole house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, albeit he had proved to be incredibly thick-skinned, Wigglytuff couldn't withstand the combination and fainted, leaving both Celebi and Zorua panting to catch their breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon nothing the bunny was unconscious, both looked at each other and spoke at unison, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I thought you were knocked out!</b>\" they exclaimed, before donning two smirks,<br>\r\n\"<b>It'll take more than just one hit to knock me out.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon hugged each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You okay, kid?\" Zorua called from Celebi arms, remembering the reason of this s whole mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the library table, Azurill gave a shaky nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Y-Yes... I think...</span>\" he stuttered, startled but unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi called upon her psychic powers and gripped the mouse to levitate him towards her and her boyfriend, letting him sit on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Thanks you guys.</span>\" he said with a sigh of relief. Zorua smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't even mention that.</span>\" Celebi said with an awkward smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow different this was from their first meeting, she mused. But now, that was all in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Celebi's statement, silence fell into the room and nothing was said or done for a few minutes; but then, the silence was broken by a sudden noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three pokemon turned to the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... </span></div></div>",

I figure that's why the prank happened. But you're fixated on me calling you pathetic, aren't you? Is that the part that broke the camel's back?

You'll have to look inside!\" Zorua said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Braixen left the couch to Celebi, who was looking at Zorua with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shiny vixen grabbed the jar from Zorua's back and examined it carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, in the glass, she spotted something pink and extremely tiny. If it wasn't for the long ears, she wouldn't have recognized who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... Wigglytuff,</span>\" she looked at Celebi incredulously; the fairy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bug,\" Zorua proceeded to explain,<br>\r\n\"Not only threatened me and you, not only he faked Azurill's death - oh no. He called me, you, Celebi and Buneary \u2018pathetic\u2019,\" Braixen glared at the jar at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was notoriously very protective of Buneary. And of her friends, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought it would have been fair to punish him. And here we are!\" Zorua concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">No... it would be fair if Azurill punished him, not me or you,</span>\" Braixen countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought, too,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But Azurill didn't want to because Wigglytuff still has a family...</span>\" Celebi chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen looked at the jar again.</span></div></div>",

After this, some drops of water the size of Wigglytuff were dropped in as well, forming a drinking source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen sighed, Azurill was right on the money, Wigglytuff had a family...she was sure the kid was also wrestling with his own conflicted feelings on this depraved bunny...but there was no going back at this point. Wigglytuff was this for life, and Braixen would deal with him for now. She tucked the jar into a drawer of hers, causing Wigglytuff\u2019s world to shake once more, and as she shut the drawer, he was left in darkness with his food and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelp, that\u2019s that.

I\u2019m gonna get a new book!</span>\u201d Celebi said with a smile and Zorua grinned, his mind wandering to what Azurill had been reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Zorua said, but then a voice Celebi recognized from school stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelebi and...Zorua?\u201d The voice said as Celebi turned to greet the pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill was sitting on his tail, thinking, looking at his doll as he closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cblue\">Stupid Wigglytuff...why couldn\u2019t you just leave it all be...I\u2019d have come home...</span>\u201d He considered when he had jumped the gun trying to get an edge on Zorua...if he hadn\u2019t done that...but what was done was done and in the end, though hopelessly small, fragile and weak, he could make peace with his existence...with Meloetta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Wigglytuff had to get involved further and now all of his friends would suffer even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"chunter\">Azurill, dear...I\u2019m coming in...</span>\u201d Even in the world of giant voices, her voice never hurt or rang in his ears...it soothed him, and soon he saw the smiling face of his caretaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"chunter\">Oh...are you done reading?</span>\u201d She asked as she approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cblue\">Yes...thank you M-</span>\u201d Azurill almost said it, almost called her mom...maybe one day he would...but for now, he\u2019d consider it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cblue\">Meloetta</span>\u201d He finished with a smile, and she approached, taking the small child in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"chunter\">Let\u2019s go get some food then, okay Azurill.</span>\u201d She said as she left the room with the child she was quickly starting to consider hers.</span></div></div>",

Yeah, Zorua was the town jerk, but there was also the fact that lately nobody had been telling horror stories of what happened when they went into his woods, as well as the fact that quite a few of his prank victims, including one young and impressionable Buneary, were vouching for his having changed. Azurill wanted to believe he was still a menace, something he could get the villagers to rally behind, but lately his most malicious act, aside from the death threat, was complaining about being forced into wearing doll clothes (a complaint he could most definitely relate to).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">...Azurill?</span>\" Buneary attempted to snap him out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">What?</span>\" he replied exasperatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Why are you still so grumpy?

For some reason, lying didn't seem an option: Braixen seemed to read his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he meekly quieted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I suggest you think about it Azurill while we go to Celebi's, Azurill,</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">T-To Celebi's?</span>\" he asked,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">R-Right now?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary looked at Braixen, who nodded solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yes Azurill, the sooner we solve this thing, the sooner you'll get your size and life back,</span>\" she said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">And keep in mind, Celebi won't give you back your size if you don't apologize to Zorua and her.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, Braixen grabbed Buneary's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started walking, but soon stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big ears of the fox, the long ears of the bunny and the reduced ears of the mouse detected an irregular sound in the forest: someone was talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen placed a paw over her mouth, silently telling her two companions to be quiet as she listened carefully.</span></div></div>",

As Azurill stepped forward to leave the hole he felt a very, very sharp and intense pain in his back...he stumbled forward out of the hole, dazed, crying and yelping...with bleary eyes he saw moving shadows, giant moving shadows as he fell forward and landed on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary and Zorua's eyes widened, seeing him in the darkness of the cave...with a wound on his back...purple was oozing out of it, as well as blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Weedle, proud of itself, went back further into its den to rest, sure that the intruder wouldn't bug him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">gmh...ugh....aaahh....AAAHHHH!</span>\" Azurill was slurring before he started screaming, his entire body felt like it was flaring up, hot hot hot...his head felt like it would crack open from the pain...he couldn't see clearly. The pain was intense, more intense than anything he'd ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buneary, get Celebi, NOW!\" Zorua barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, of course it was a Weedle den...Zorua was used to the little buggers, he'd been stung a few times too, and it generally hurt, though he could suck the venom out and be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Azurill was tiny, tinier than tiny right now, that amount of venom in him could be fatal, not to mention painful on a whole other level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'stupid...stupid Azurill...stupid me...damn it...' Zorua thought as he gently lowered his muzzle to the tiny pokemon. \"Azurill...i'm gonna try to suck the venom out, okay?\" He said as he lowered his lips to Azurill's back, he gently tried to get a certain angle so he could get the venom out of the tiny round pokemon, but it proved difficult with the size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got some of it out at least, and spat it out, still tasted terrible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he heard pokemon behind him...Buneary, Braixen and Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi, shrink me.\" Zorua said simply and Celebi went to open her mouth to say something, but then shut it and shrunk Zorua...soon Azurill looked normal size to him, and Zorua had a much easier time sucking out the venom...though now there was much, much more than he was used to ever sucking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">AAAHHH....aaahhhh...</span>\" Azurill was looking purple and his body was burning up in heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it kid, stay awake!\" Zorua yelled, as he tried sucking faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Is there anything...we can...</span>\" Braixen started, but shut up as Zorua kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you've got some medicine to help with poison or pain or...something like that...probably go get it, just avoid the search party.\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Come on Buneary...</span>\" Braixen coaxed and Buneary looked from the fox to Celebi, to the tiny fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Should we leave Azurill with them...</span>\" She started but Celebi smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Things'll be fine...meet us at my house, okay?</span>\" Celebi said gently and the bunny nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Just...be nice...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will, we will.\" Zorua said as he continued working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls left, leaving only Celebi and Zorua with the tiny poisoned pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua kept working in silence as Celebi considered the path forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she being unfair to Azurill? Well he needed to accept that she wouldn't let anything happen to Zorua!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But he did seem willing to make peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, I...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll settle things with him later...i'll say this, it ain't gonna be today. He won't be coherent enough to discuss things...for at least a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill was fading in and out of being conscious, not sure if dreaming or awake...he could blearily understand the conversations around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsoon he found himself lifted from the ground...floating until he was set on something soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">...what's going...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to say it, but his strength faded, and soon he fell unconscious completely.</span></div></div>",

Buneary looked at him sadly before producing a very tiny empty cup...still larger than Azurill, but she tried to angle it for him to look in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">If you need to use it...</span>\" She said before she winced and heard Azurill start to regurgitate the contents of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip and didn't look...but soon the sounds from Azurill reduced to heavy breathing...then somewhat normal breathing...then a few groans until Braixen returned with a glass of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Azurill, you need to drink this.</span>\" She said gently as she came over, noting the cup Buneary was holding but saying nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">It'll help what you're going through.</span>\" She smiled as she got closer and was soon looming over the tiny blue mouse...she picked him up between two fingers in her free paw and held him close the the glass in her other paw for him to drink. It was a red liquid...Azurill, still somewhat confused by what was going on took a sip...then grimaced and coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">This is gross!</span>\" He said and Buneary and Braixen both looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">It's medicine Azurill, and you need it right now...your tiny body needs all the help it can get to get back to normal, and this'll give you the strength to fight whatever poison is still in you.</span>\" Braixen said firmly. \"<span class=\"corange\">You're lucky it was a Weedle...their stings are painful, but generally harmless in the long run...but considering your size...if it had been another poison type...</span>\" Braixen shuddered to think of what could've happened<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill started to piece together the events of the past few hours...that's right, he had been stung and...Zorua saved him, right? After everything that had happened between the two of them. But it was Zorua's fault all this happened! If he'd just taken the apology...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill glared but kept drinking the bitter medicine for a bit longer before Braixen pulled him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">That should be enough for now. But you'll need to take more later, it should help for pain too.</span>\" Braixen said as Azurill shivered in her palm. He was so cold...he looked at the teenage giantess, her face filling his entire vision<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hmm...you still look a bit pale.</span>\" Braixen frowned, before gently handing him back to Buneary who hugged him to her chest. Azurill let it happen...he couldn't fight it anyhow, and her body was so warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">For now, you need to rest Azurill, we're at my place right now...Buneary and you are staying the night.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">What about-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Celebi and Zorua? They're at Celebi's...right now, they need to consider what to do too. I let them have an earful, and they do plan to discuss things in a more fair sense with you later on...but that means meeting them halfway, you need to make genuine peace with Zorua, apologize for your mistakes, and then hopefully befriend them...Zorua saved your life, whatever bitter feelings you may have, remember that.</span>\" Braixen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">For now though, just relax with us, okay? You need to rest lots...</span>\" Buneary said, hugging him a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">The search party should hopefully not ramp up for you over the next few days...within that time we'll figure it out...but you're taking it easy for the time being.</span>\" With that, Azurill's world moved as both giantess pokemon left the room they were in, and went to a dark entertainment room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill felt his world shift as soon he was sitting in Buneary's lap who sat on the couch. Azurill shivered before a soft paw wrapped around his form, softly pinning him to her lap a bit, but keeping him warm. He tried to look up to the looming, smiling face of Buneary as Braixen turned on the TV in front of them and Azurill's world lit up to some sort of action movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'll go get a bit of food...something to get you some energy, alright little guy?</span>\" Braixen smiled gently as she got up, leaving the two young pokemon to the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Azurill was feeling a bit more like himself...though still with a hell of a headache...and soon after that, he was in a bed with two pokemon far far larger than he, cuddled to warm brown fur as he got drowsy...the morning would hopefully be better than today was...</span></div></div>",

Soon she went over to the side of the bed, and looming over Azurill, gently picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Feeling any better?</span>\" She asked as she help him to her face, her curious and concerned eyes practically taking his whole vision. \"<span class=\"cblue\">A bit...I think.</span>\" Azurill said, as he shook his head, a dull ache in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">...well, Braixen said when you woke up to have you take more medicine.</span>\" Buneary said and Azurill groaned as he was taken over to a glass on a table and held over it, the bitter red pool of liquid below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Come on, the sooner you take it the better you'll feel...it'll help your body recover.</span>\" Buneary said as Azurill started to drink it, a grimace on his face as he did. After a few large gulps Buneary lifted him from it and put him over some water, something to help at least get the taste out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took some greedy gulps of that and with a sigh was once again free to move in Buneary's paws. She was smiling at him warmly. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Good, don't worry Azurill, this'll all be resolved soon.</span>\" Azurill blushed as he looked at her, then averted his eyes. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I hope so, I really do.</span>\" He said as she carried him to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Where is Braixen anyway?</span>\" Azurill asked as Buneary sat on the couch. \"<span class=\"ctan\">She went to do some shopping, then to talk to Celebi and Zorua about a good time to talk with you.</span>\" Azurill's hopes soared as Buneary smiled sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">It won't be today Azurill, you need to rest, and Celebi has plans with her mom. But soon, Braixen is making sure of that...and when you become friends with Zorua and Celebi, they'll let you go!</span>\" Buneary said as Azurill looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Right...friends...</span>\" He said bitterly. His feelings on those two were conflicted. Celebi, as far as he could tell, didn't care one way or the other about what happened to him, and Zorua had had no intention of giving Azurill the chance to plea for his case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua did save his life...and promise him a genuine shot at trying to make amends. Azurill had some soul searching to do before that happened though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Maybe it's better that it isn't today...I don't know if i'm ready to talk to them I guess...</span>\" Azurill said and Buneary looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I know that you're sore about...some of the things that happened, you did some things you shouldn't have done...but they did some things they shouldn't have done too. Things'll work out though...you just gotta be willing to talk, right?</span>\" Buneary tried to encourage and Azurill smiled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Well...when it happens I guess i'll try...</span>\" And with that, the door opened and Braixen walked in with some bags of groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Whew...i'm back...did he take the medicine?</span>\" Braixen asked, looking at the two kids on her couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Yeah, I took it...</span>\" Azurill said and Braixen grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Good!</span>\" She said as she went past the couch and around the corner to drop the bags in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'm gonna cook some food, alright? Feel free to throw whatever on the TV, just nothing too graphic without me around, okay?</span>\" Her voice called from the kitchen before Azurill thought of something. It had been on his mind this whole time, and he needed to talk to SOME pokemon about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Um, Braixen, can I talk to you alone for a sec?</span>\" Her giant purple head appeared from the corner as Buneary looked down at her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill was looking down at her lap before a shadow was cast over him, Braixen had come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Sure kid, hop on.</span>\" She said, and a paw was lowered, Azurill jumped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">If you're wondering about the meet up, it'll be the day after tomorrow. We'll come up with a cover story for your disappearance too...if things go well enough that you get let go at least.</span>\" Braixen said and Azurill shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">That's good...I guess...I just, this is something else...</span>\" Azurill took a breath as he thought this over...this was something he'd had going on since school, and these past few days had only made it worse...Buneary being with him almost at all times...and her coming to his aid yesterday...being the one that cared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">What's up Azurill?

You're hurting him!</span>\" But all Buneary got was shaken around by her ears as another free hand clamped over her mouth, making her quiet. Braixen stood up as Graveler tormented the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Graveler...you're gonna regret doing this...</span>\" She seethed, as he just grinned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">I'll let 'em go...once you tell me where Zorua is...</span>\" He said as he rolled Azurill around his fingers, he was screaming, but he himself didn't talk. If he ratted them out, he'd never get his size back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen considered this...he could gather pokemon...go after Zorua...but this was Graveler, he was hated and dumb and overly confident in his own strength...he'd go after Celebi on his own for sure. She could handle him, but it'd be a betrayal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Buneary...he was threatening her Buneary! And Azurill as well...if she played ignorance, maybe he'd relent? Doubtful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was defiance even an option? She could try and take him.</span></div></div>",

You're all DEAD! And when I find Zorua, he'll join you!</span>\" the rock-type fumed as he charged Braixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen shielded herself with her paws and stumbled back as Graveler hit her, before another Water Gun hit him in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill didn't know why he was even doing this, but figured he had more chances to regain his original height if he helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, his attacks was far, far too weak in his current state, and Graveler turned back, staring daggers at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stomped his stone foot down, knocking Azurill on his behind from the earthquake that was caused by the rock-type, who grinned evilly, moving a step towards the helpless mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Graveler didn't get to touch Azurill: Buneary stepped forward, one of her ears extending as it hit the rock in the face, soon emulated by the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock-type initially snarled, but he found himself unable to retaliate... in fact, he found that all he could do right now was stumble around. He felt sick and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was lucid, he would have realized that Buneary used Dizzy Punch to incapacitate him. It wasn't enough to hurt him, but it did manage to confuse him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Graveler had a chance to snap back to reality, he was hit by another Flamethrower and stepped back, trying to process what hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, confused and helpless, he didn't notice where he was going; Braixen did though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass behind the rock-type wasn't grass at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leg of the vixen raised as she kicked Graveler, who took another step back... and the ground beneath his feet suddenly sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe too sank along with the green sheet into a deep, tight hole that was one of Zorua's traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact caused by the rock hitting the bottom of the hole made the ground quake beneath Braixen, Buneary and Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen sighed deeply as her legs gave up; she slid down on the ground, losing her stick in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I never thought I'd say this but... I owe you, Zorua,</span>\" she said, awash with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bottom of the hole, Graveler just came to his senses,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Hey!

Azurill,</span>\" she said, picking up the mouse,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">That was pretty brave of you... this might just help you get your size back,</span>\" she praised, gently caressing the blue mouse, who blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Now, what do you say if we go find...</span>\" she stopped, looking at the hole Graveler was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to discover where Zorua was... although that'd be the last of his mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking at Celebi's door, demanding to hurt Zorua... Graveler probably wasn't going to get out of the house alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy was notoriously overprotective with Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Braixen know what there actually was between her friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and a pink Celebi came into view, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, she had another day off today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill instantly smiled, pretending to be a doll again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, Braixen, Buneary... hello there!</span>\" Celebi's mom greeted cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hi miss...</span>\" Braixen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink time-traveler dropped her smile: something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hey, what happened?

I was like you Azurill, I was angry, I was making death threats... but my friends stopped me from doing something I would have regretted. They made me realize that Zorua wasn't that bad after all.

And in those moments, she had woken up, almost crying, each time repeating herself that all was fine, that Zorua wasn't going to be killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when someone knocked at the door, she didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the knocking continued, until she finally woke up, was forced to drop Zorua on her bed and get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hazily moved through her own, yawning, trying to rid her mind of the gruesome scenes she witnessed in her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Not my Zorua... they won't get him...</span>\" she murmured, still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her front door by bumping into it and quietly opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her eyes as an indistinct mass of purple, brown and blue came into her view, soon assuming the various shapes of a vixen, then a bunny and in the end a small mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh...

We're here because Azurill would like to tell Zorua a few words,</span>\" the vixen explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at the mouse intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... This way, he's in my room. Wait until he wakes up...

You don't want to be a wittle bitty doll?\" Zorua said, half mocking, but definitely pushing the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen folded her arms, but left it be. If Azurill wanted out of his situation, he needed to be genuine. She was wondering what was taking her friend with washing up though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked the fox in the eye, his lip quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">O-okay, I admit that's part of my motivation...a lot of it...but...m-maybe you've changed and...gone through your own ordeals too.</span>\" Azurill started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I...heard about your leg...and you being really really small...and that you tried to make amends with other pokemon...maybe I was too hasty yesterday, okay? I shouldn't have threatened you...or Celebi...</span>\" Azurill finished. The three pokemon in the room were silent, and at this moment, Celebi entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay, now what is going on here? Why is Azurill here?</span>\" Celebi asked, looking intently at the shrunken mouse...she was frightening with her height and look, he shivered a bit at this. Braixen just gave Celebi a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Relax Celi, we're trying to resolve this whole mess, right?</span>\" She looked to Buneary who nodded, who looked to Azurill...who also nodded, though still shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi folded her arms and looked to Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua spoke.</span></div></div>",

Hand over that pest, Espurr, I'm gonna teach him a lesson!</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"corange\">CALM DOWN?! Have you forgotten what that pest did to poor Buneary?!</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Buneary's reaction to him at his size...fear, then hesitation before forgiving him. Azurill ran headlong into a situation he knew nothing about and opened his mouth in a way he shouldn't have, but...would she have done any different? He was also a little kid, around Buneary's age, and he probably wasn't thinking things through. Her expression softened. \"<span class=\"corange\">Azurill, you have your reasons for hating Zorua, I know that...I did too, as did Buneary, he HAS changed, and...maybe you can't see that yet, but we're gonna resolve this situation. You need to put in effort too though, because like it or not, you HAVE to make peace with him.</span>\" She said, getting stern on that last bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Why should I make peace...</span>\" Azurill said and Braixen did have a retort on stand-by. \"<span class=\"corange\">Because it's the only way you'll get your size and get to go home.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Tch.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen then turned her attention to Buneary. \"<span class=\"corange\">We need to go to Celebi's.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Alright, are we going to make Azurill and Zorua friends then?</span>\" Buneary asked hopefully and Braixen grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah, after I give them an earful.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exited the house to see pokemon wandering about, some going about their business, a few others helping Wigglytuff look for Azurill...all the kids that stayed with Wigglytuff were there too, Swinub, his actual daughter Igglybuff, Cleffa, and Magby. Braixen thought quick and stashed Azurill in her tail. \"<span class=\"corange\">Be quiet, go with me on this okay? It's the only way you'll get big again.</span>\" She didn't hear a peep from her tail so she hoped that was a sign he got the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Have either of you seen Azurill?</span>\" Swinub asked them, approaching them. \"<span class=\"corange\">Um...no...sorry Swinub.</span>\" Braixen scratched at the back of her head, noting that he immediately looked dejected. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Well...if you see him please let us know...okay?</span>\" He turned around, only to stop the next passing pokemon to ask the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Jeez...this is a mess and a half Celi...</span>\" Braixen muttered and Buneary just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk itself was uneventful for Braixen and Buneary, but Azurill was having a heck of a time trying to keep his senses in her tail. if being carried shook his world then this was a flat out earthquake. After a while it stopped though as they reached their destination. Braixen knocked on the door and soon enough it was answered by a smiling Celebi. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, Braixen, hey! And...Buneary...</span>\" She hesitated on this last one. Braixen was giving her a serious look. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You know?</span>\" Celebi said and she nodded. \"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah, Buneary told me, though you should be more worried about the fact that the entire village knows he's missing, and half of them are helping Wigglytuff search for him.</span>\" and Celebi scratched her head. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well...what was I supposed to do? He threatened Zorua! He would've told if I let him go!</span>\" Celebi said as the two other pokemon stepped inside. \"<span class=\"corange\">Is your mom home?</span>\" Braixen asked and Celebi shook her head. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Just Zorua and I...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Cool, then we can all talk openly.</span>\" She said as she reached in her tail to pull out the flailing Azurill. \"<span class=\"corange\">Okay, first round. Azurill, apologize to Celebi for threatening Zorua and her by proxy.</span>\" Azurill looked down at the ground. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Sorry Celebi...</span>\" He muttered defeated and she looked taken aback. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay...</span>\" She said, not sure how to respond. \"<span class=\"corange\">Okay, cool. Go get Zorua Celebi.</span>\" Braixen said, in total control of the situation despite being weaker than Celebi. She nodded as she went to go get Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought him back about 30 seconds later. \"Oh, it's Braixen, Buneary, and the blue blabbermouth!\" Zorua said snickering as Braixen looked at him. \"<span class=\"corange\">I'd take the situation more seriously Zorua since there's already a search party out for Azurill.</span>\" She said and Zorua looked unimpressed. \"They won't find him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">THAT'S NOT THE-Okay, anyways...Azurill, apologize to Zorua for threatening him and trying to blackmail him.</span>\" Braixen was about to tear into him, but caught herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked shocked at this. \"<span class=\"cblue\">No.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Just do it Azurill.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">No!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Azurill...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">NO! HIM!? ME APOLOGIZE TO HIM!? AFTER HE DESTROYED THE LAST THING MY MOM EVER GAVE ME BEFORE SHE DIED AND LAUGHED IN MY FACE ABOUT IT! AFTER HE HURT MY FRIEND SWINUB AND TRAUMATIZED HIM!? AFTER HIS ATTEMPT TO EAT ME YESTERDAY!? I WILL NEVER APOLOGIZE TO HIM!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outburst caught everyone in the room off guard, and tears were running down Azurill's face at this. Celebi scratched the back of her head looking down at the floor, Buneary was shivering a bit from the outburst, and Zorua was just looking at Azurill wide eyed. Braixen recovered quickly and sighed. \"<span class=\"corange\">Okay, this is going to take time...maybe you should apologize first Zorua...</span>\" She said and he just stuck up his nose. \"Why? He's the one that threatened my life last night FIRST! Over a doll and some pranks!\" He said and Braixen wanted to smack her head. \"<span class=\"corange\">Okay, change of tactics, Buneary, hold Azurill. I'm going to talk to these two alone.</span>\" She said handing him off to her as Buneary was petting the crying pokemon, trying to soothe him as Braixen and Celebi stepped out of the room, carrying the tiny Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Zorua, he's a little kid who lost his mom and you are the object of his ire, by your own paw too. Of course he was going to do something stupid when he saw you like that!</span>\" Braixen scolded and he just stuck up his nose. \"I'll apologize when he does.\" He said and Braixen grunted in frustration. \"<span class=\"corange\">There are 3 ways out of this situation safely, I will outline them.very.carefully.</span>\" She emphasized. \"<span class=\"corange\">The first one, is you make peace enough that he won't BLAB about you and we all go our merry separate way. That's the ideal</span>\" She said. \"<span class=\"corange\">The second is that Celebi grows you both back, and we deny anything he says.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That would mean giving up my roomie...</span>\" Celebi said dejectedly and Zorua shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">The third is you dispose of Azurill. I won't be friends with any pokemon that would hurt a child though so be wary of that.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I would never!</span>\" Celebi said before Zorua could respond, he sighed and said. \"That's not an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Then the first one it is...i'm going to call over Espurr, she'll be able to read his mind to tell when he won't rat out our secret.</span>\" Celebi thought a second before nodding. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay.</span>\" She said. \"<span class=\"corange\">And as for you Celebi...you need to think things through better, or did you forget that I also threatened Zorua when I first discovered him? Did you not shrink me down because others were around or because I was your friend? Maybe it's because you weren't as close to Zorua as you are now?</span>\" Braixen said in a lecturing tone, Celebi looked down at the ground. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll apologize too...</span>\" She muttered and Braixen nodded. \"<span class=\"corange\">First thing's first though...we need to let these two hash it out on their own.</span>\" Braixen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Zorua said. \"Don't leave me alone wi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's for the best Zorua.</span>\" Celebi sighed as he muttered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pokemon were glaring each other down. They'd been boxed into a small part of Celebi's room with her books and some small furniture and they had no way of leaving. They had left the room and shut the door, and weren't allowed out until Espurr okayed it. They had already been glaring for 15 minutes like this until eventually...</span></div></div>",

Fortunately for the atmosphere, Zorua eventually decided that a grumpy staredown wasn't going to bring in any results, so he finally attempted to start a discussion with the moody young Azurill. Clearing his throat, he looked up to notice the other occupant of the area was still looking at him, although he seemed a bit less moody and a bit more exasperated now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...\" Zorua began, before getting cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I don't wanna hear it, pal. You're the reason we're in this at all.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so that means I have to fix it then, right? And I can't do that if you aren't even gonna listen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Why should I?! You took the last thing I had to remember my mother by, trashed it without a care in the world, and harassed my closest friend!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first, the reason you should listen to me is because we're probably never getting out of this box otherwise. Second...\" Zorua began to choke up a little bit, \"I'm sorry about the doll... and your mother. If I'd known that toy was a gift from your late mom...\" Zorua looked away ashamedly, but Azurill didn't seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">And what about young Swinub, I haven't seen you go out and apologize to him!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was beginning to get a bit more aggressive in voice, but not demeanor. \"Well, as much as I'd like to now, people like you and Wigglytuff are still constantly giving me a hard time every time I happen to be in the general vicinity of anyone. It's hard to go out and apologize to people when your presence causes a constant one-sided shouting match and everyone treats you like an outcast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Well, you wouldn't be an outcast if you hadn't spent all your time pranking people, now would you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm past all that now-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">So explain why you threatened to eat me, then.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was just that, a threat. Celebi's keeping me straight these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">And just what is that supposed to mean?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her and I are a couple now, and she wouldn't want to have a murderer be her boyfriend.

You don't get it, do ya?\" he said to the glaring Azurill.<br>\r\n\"This works to our advantage. Just accept my apologies, let's make peace, and then <i>you</i> get your size back, <i>you</i> get out of this house and keep your mouth sealed, and <i>I</i> get to live in peace!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill gritted his teeth.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You don't deserve peace!</span>\" he shouted, before shaking his head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">This isn't about the doll, Swinub, or everyone.

D'you think I'd be here right now if Celebi hated me? If she did, she'd just have let me die instead of saving me when she broke my leg!\" he recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat story had the power of making everyone sympathize with his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked shocked for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi did what...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.<br>\r\n\"No more pranks...

Proof was that he befriended even with Braixen, who hated him not three days ago. He even made her, Espurr, have a crush on him... although he already had feelings for Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she accepted that and encouraged their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">How come?</span>\" Celebi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">He said that everyone hates him... he just told you shouldn't have healed his broken leg back then... he literally just told him that he should have died.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary gasped, Braixen sighed and Celebi frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Seriously, are we sure Zorua is the jerk in there?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr remained silent for a moment, glued to both tiny pokemon's minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she slowly turned her head and gave the group a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Things just got rough.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to be nice!\" Zorua seethed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill's hate was comprehensible, but still Zorua was apologizing to him. Regardless, Azurill kept barraging him with not-so-nice words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I don't care! Drop this charade Zorua! You're not nice, you never were nice, you'll never be nice!</span>\" Azurill retorted, earning a glare from the dark type fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua growled, moving a menacing step towards the blue pokemon... only to stop immediately after to give an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm done with pranks. I'm... sorry for your doll, sorry for laughing at you, sorry for this whole situation...\" he said, sounding exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill stared at him skeptically.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You're done with pranks? How can I believe that?</span>\" he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua placed a paw over his chest.<br>\r\n\"I swear.\" he said, before the paw fell, stopping in midair as he held it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill looked at it reluctantly. He pondered making peace to Zorua and get it over with... he seemed sincere... but what if it was a trick? To convince him to not tell about him? The mere thought made Azurill seethe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just make peace.\" Zorua said, interrupting his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill stared at him in silence for a moment.</div></div>",

With Wigglytuff and his adopted kids? You have fond memories of your mother? The kind you'll cherish forever? Let me tell you something Azurill, you're damn lucky and don't understand what you have, what you can go back to if you leave here. I'll tell you how <i>I</i> grew up! I grew up with daddy dearest.\" Zorua paused to see Azurill was listening still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...didn't have it good Azurill, it was constant belittling, sometimes he physically took out his frustrations. I was useless in his eyes, a burden, couldn't help him hunt, couldn't help him steal, when I said he was being mean he called it whining, there were times where he wouldn't feel me for a few days, called it an 'incentive' to evolve and make myself useful to him. I got fed up one day, I ran. I ran and ran, crying the whole way until I ended up here. Know what I saw? Happy families, smiling families. And something in me...oh, it tore up Azurill, I was seething...so I shared a little bit of myself with you all! Gave you a taste of that bitterness I carried. You're clearly still savoring the taste, aren't you?\" Azurill seemed stunned by all of this, but Zorua kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right, still so intent on this grudge. Swinub, yeah, he didn't deserve what I did to him, I acknowledge that. Buneary, i'm sorry to her too. She's a sweet girl that clearly didn't deserve that. To you? I don't know...maybe a slap in the face is what you need, get with the program! I shouldn't have torn up your doll, I shouldn't have laughed about it, but if you aren't careful you're going to grow up spiteful, bitter, alone...and tiny. As for me...I got a little taste of what <i>YOU</i> had, and...I liked it, I don't intend to go back, I don't want to go back, so no, I won't be pranking anymore, regardless of what you think.\" Zorua said, finally finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an air of silence as Azurill looked at the ground, processing this information.</span></div></div>",

The psychic grip released Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!</span>\" the giantess cried. Azurill ignored her, and noted that he was free from the psychic force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Mom!</span>\" he shouted as he tried to jump off Braixen's paws. Even better, she was taller than Buneary, he'd be dead for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Braixen gripped him firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill stop!</span>\" Celebi said in alert, inadvertently squeezing Zorua in her hands as she watched the tiny pokemon struggle in Braixen's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored her and kept crying incoherently while he struggled to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Mom... help... I want to see my mom...</span>\" he cried, warm tears hitting Braixen's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... He's delirious. He's in a state of desperation, and wants to try to commit suicide again...</span>\" Espurr said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Azurill...</span>\" Buneary whimpered, tears rolling down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one remained silent, and it was Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" she whispered, poking him. He turned around, expecting an angry face, a disappointed face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, he found a pitiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" Celebi repeated as she lowered her head in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instinctively backed up.<br>\r\n\"Don't ya try to blame me, I had no-\" Celebi's finger covered his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know I know... you had good reasons, you couldn't know and I'm not blaming you,</span>\" she quietly said, her finger leaving Zorua's mouth as she gently caressed him on the head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But... just tell him you accept his apologies... or he might attempt suicide again...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua... we weren't going to kill him, remember?</span>\" the fairy gently recalled, not a hint of rage or lecture in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed and perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that...\" he told, causing Celebi to smile a little.<br>\r\n\"In the meantime...\" he turned to see Azurill still squirming to get free from Braixen's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she looked like she was having a hard time at keeping the agitated pokemon under her control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr turned to face Zorua, reading his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... That might actually work.</span>\" she said with a nod as she picked the small fox from Celebi and put him onto Braixen's closed fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger fox started at him confused, but he ignored her and walked to the struggling mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azurill.\" he said, grabbing the crying pokemon with his paws and forcing him to look in his eyes. Azurill struggled, but Zorua's eyes glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Azurill suddenly found the room, the giantesses and Zorua disappearing around him as he discovered himself falling into a dark pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't oppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cblue\">Mom...</span></i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit an illusionary surface. Darkness claimed the fairy type, and he fell into a dreamless slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed as he watched Azurill's eyes closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen looked at him, shocked.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Did you just...?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Zorua...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.<br>\r\n\"No.\" he responded.<br>\r\n\"He'll just sleep for a while... hopefully, he'll wake up without suicidal thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed in relief as she picked both tinies from Braixen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to the bed, gently placing Azurill under the bedsheets, before looking at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good work Zorua.</span>\" she said, pecking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed, while Braixen stared at the two in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's just hope he feels better when he wakes up...</span>\" Celebi said.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Let's just hope he DOES wake up...</span>\" Espurr said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'm sure he'll be fine...</span>\" she said dejectedly, thinking that it was entirely her fault. If only she hadn't suggested that Zorua and Azurill made peace, none of this would have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes off the thought, deciding to focus on something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at Celebi and Zorua.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">In the meantime...</span>\" she moved a step towards them.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You two... together?!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">That's so cute~!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.</span></div></div>",

He failed...he wouldn't fail again though. He saw he was near the edge of a table and was about to run off when a force stopped him, it felt like a wall. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Oof! What the heck?</span>\" He muttered as he looked around, then up and realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a cup...and looking at his surroundings that also meant...he was smaller than he had been. \"You know, you have serious issues.\" A familiar voice rang out, louder than he was used to. He turned around to see Zorua peering at him from outside of the glass, much larger than he was now. Azurill started whimpering. \"Jeez, relax...i'm not going to eat you.\" Zorua said and Azurill seemed to process something. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Actually...you should...please do Zorua...or let me out of this glass...so I can...</span>\" Azurill felt motion as he was spun around and around before landing on his butt, dazed. Zorua had spun the glass a few times. \"You will stop suggesting that right now or i'll keep spinning this glass.\" Zorua said, before he sighed. \"You are a seriously demented brat, you know, when I say you have issues, I mean you HAVE them, and they ain't me.\" Azurill glared up at the giant to him fox who looked back before sitting down, leaning his head against the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Why are you even here...</span>\" Azurill said, bitterly. \"Simple, I said i'd be the one there when you woke up so I could say we'll grow you back.\" Was all he said and Azurill's interest seemed piqued. \"Buuut, I haven't decided if i'm going to go with that or not.\" Zorua said and Azurill started bouncing up and down. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Why you-</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here Azurill, I did give you every opportunity you know, and you threw them back in my face, then when the prospect of reality started to hit you suddenly own up, AND THEN you try and off yourself when it seems you have no other alternative.

She made them for me though...when I got hurt or sick she never left my side...she was...she was...</span>\" Azurill had tears in his eyes now and Zorua sighed. \"Good mom, huh?\" And Azurill nodded. \"Can I ask what happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill sat down and curled up with his ball. \"<span class=\"cblue\">She...she got a call one night, urgent...she didn't say what or why...she only told me she'd be right back and she put me to bed...I woke up alone. In an empty house.

Zorua slowly peered at the bunny from his hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was talking to someone, he noted, though from his angulation, Zorua couldn't see who he was talking to. To worsen things, Wigglytuff and whoever he was talking to were whispering, so Zorua and Celebi had no chance of hearing what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Celebi, that all was very confusing; to Zorua, it was a confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Azurill said!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" Celebi whispered from behind him, intending to ask why the heck they were spying on Wigglytuff... although very curious to know why said pokemon was up at such dark hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua ignored her as one of his ears peeked out from behind the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only managed to catch a single sentence,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...

These last few years...what was going on with everything? Zorua had promised to grow him back, but then immediately turned on him when he got the info he wanted, and even told Celebi...\"<span class=\"cblue\">Why was I stupid enough to say anything?</span>\" He asked himself. It didn't matter, he was determined, he was either getting his size back or seeing his mom again, those were his options. The door was opening and not two...but three pokemon were coming in quietly. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Huh?</span>\" Azurill felt his world shake as the glass was levitated by a psychic force and quietly carried away from the table, the three pokemon were going back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Can you see what he's doing?</span>\" Celebi asked, it was dark and Azurill was far tinier than previously, so she was relying on Zorua's sight in the dark on this. \"He's shaking like a leaf.\" He said. She nodded. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">His thoughts?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Disheveled mess of fear, anxiety, confusion, and animosity.</span>\" Espurr stated frankly. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So nothing new...okay, can you hear him Zorua?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...just barely, but yes.\" Zorua said, making out his whimpers. He wouldn't be able to get anyone's attention but the 3 pokemon there this way, but to him...they were titans among titans, and he was scared stiff of them. Their voices pierced through him as well, larger than life. \"<span class=\"cblue\">J-just do whatever you're going to do with me! None of it matters anymore...</span>\" Azurill said and Zorua looked at him before relaying what he had said to the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill, we aren't going to hurt you, we just want some answers.</span>\" Celebi gently said and Espurr nodded. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">The night that your mom disappeared...do you remember if she talked to anyone else that day?</span>\" And Azurill started shaking. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I don't...I don't know...</span>\" He said and Zorua relayed it, Espurr confirming his thoughts. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What happens with Wigglytuff, do you know what he does after a bonding day?</span>\" And Azurill winced when he heard this. Zorua had told everything...Azurill's life was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Azurill, no one is going to hurt you, just please tell us.</span>\" Espurr urged gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">He...he buys Igglybuff a new toy and each of us something sweet, he's always very happy...I don't know...I guess sometimes he buys something really expensive, but that isn't for us or anything...</span>\" Azurill said, Zorua nodding. He had figured it was something like that, he relayed the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Profit...he's profiting on the kids.</span>\" Espurr said and Azurill looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">What are you talking about?</span>\" And Zorua relayed it, with Celebi looking at him sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Azurill...you're not going to like these words...and i'm sorry that you're finding out like this but...</span>\" She started to tell Azurill what was going on, what Wigglytuff was really doing, and what had happened to his mom, as well as the other kids parents. Whenever Wigglytuff was done with a kid they figured, or when they maybe snooped where they shouldn't, he replaced them with another, after another incident. Zorua coming along was a boon, and Wigglytuff intended to use him as a scapegoat and smokescreen all in one. Azurill fell right into Wigglytuff's clutches after he had killed his mom...or his partner had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill was staring at the three titans before him, and tears started to pour down, harder than before. \"Kid's crying...\" Celebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">His mind is...</span>\" But Espurr was cut off by Zorua. \"He just said...\"</span></div></div>",

Azurill looked at Wigglytuff, his face contorted with hate. \"<span class=\"cblue\">And you killed my mom...</span>\" He seethed as Wigglytuff flew out of the house and landed on the grass, surrounded by the angry group of pokemon, though Wigglytuff didn't seem phased. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Hmm...oh my oh my oh my, you told~</span>\" He said as he looked at Azurill. \"<span class=\"cpink\">You told about what you do and they pieced it together~</span>\" He started laughing earning glares. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, you've caught me, oh no, it's not like...I don't know psychic myself...</span>\" He said and suddenly the grip on him was released as Azurill came flying to him. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Now now, who has the upper hand now...I believe i'll be needing this brat to make my exit, won't I?</span>\" He said as he held the screaming Azurill. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Any sudden moves and...well...do I even need to say it?</span>\" He grinned. The group looked stunned and Espurr realized something. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">He can block me!</span>\" She said, stunned by this, and Wigglytuff just grinned. \"<span class=\"cpink\">When I want, yeah...I may be normal-fairy, but it isn't out of my reach to get psychic abilities!</span>\" He said as he slowly edged away from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I assume you took care of Weavile right? I'll be expecting her back if you want the brat, then we'll be on our merry way~</span>\" He said as he noticed something...his world was getting bigger, in fact...the only thing not getting bigger was Azurill, who was starting to comprehend what was happening. \"<span class=\"cblue\">You've lost...</span>\" Azurill said as Wigglytuff was surprised by everything happening, he went to make a lethal blow to Azurill, but the little blue pokemon went flying out of his grasp. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Lopunny...can you hold onto him please?</span>\" Celebi asked as she gently set him down in her hands, doll sized again. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">Um...yeah...were you?</span>\" She asked and he looked down. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I was the doll Buneary brought home, yes...</span>\" He stated, and started shivering, did Wigglytuff almost...? He felt a gentle force on his back as Lopunny started petting him. \"<span class=\"cbrown\">You've been through a lot, haven't you?</span>\" She said gently and he just nodded, starting to get misty eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where he had stopped shrinking, Wigglytuff kept going, down and down until he was as small as Weavile, and he found himself deposited into the cup. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Great...now what!?</span>\" Weavile huffed and Wigglytuff put a paw to his chin. \"<span class=\"cpink\">This is a problem...</span>\" He started but was cut off as he looked up to see a titanic Eevee grinning. \"I can eat them, right...?\" she said and Celebi looked at her.</span></div></div>",

Espurr and Celebi got several new books.

Zoroark was gone.

It'd be nice for Buneary to always have a friend around, no matter what size he is,</span>\" Lopunny replied, bringing a smile to the blue bunny's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I go and get Celebi real quick?\" Zorua said, leaving the 3 in the room as he departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling across the village, the reformed prankster saw Gardevoir, seemingly lost in thought. He wanted her to come along to Celebi's, as he wasn't sure if her mom was home, or how she would respond to him knocking on her door if she was. With Gardevoir around, he could easily play the \"friend of a friend\" card to avoid making things awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gard', you busy?\" Zorua asked, snapping the green-haired girl from her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Oh! Um, not in particular, why?</span>\" she confusedly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want an escort to Celebi's house.

Lopunny quickly opened the door and welcomed them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">I'm so glad that you're willing to do this, Celebi. Azurill has been so excited to start living with us... although he seems a bit embarrassed to be around Buneary.</span>\" Zorua and Gardevoir both smirked at this, the former due to his knowing very well how it feels to be treated as a doll, and the latter due to being happy to help form another cute couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Just point me towards Azurill and I'll be done in a minute, miss.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">Over in the living room.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quartet walked into the living room, where Azurill was currently sitting on the couch next to Buneary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready, bud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Y-yeah.</span>\" Azuril moved to the floor, and Celebi focused her energy on forming a cyan ball that looked familiar to everyone. She then gently released it, and it slowly went across the living room and entered Azurill's body. The mouse began to shrink down once more, stopping at the size of a doll. Buneary gently got off of the couch and lifted him into a hug as Gardevoir began to clap excitedly again, sparkles in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">If you ever need him back to normal size again, just come and get me,</span>\" Celebi told the family, before turning and walking towards the door with Zorua and Gardevoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio reentered the village, Zorua noticed there was still some time left in the day.

The lights were on, suggesting that her mom and sister were awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I'm going home... thanks for letting me come too, Celi.</span>\" she said, and Celebi waved a paw dismissively.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Bye you two... have a nice evening... alone~</span>\" she chimed, making the couple blush as she walked up to her front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

Damn your kisses...\" he said with a sigh as he started walking with the fairy clinging to his neck as he headed to the house they shared... with Celebi's oblivious mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the pink time traveler worked until it was late in the night, so there was no problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Zorua stopped in front of Celebi's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy gave him another peck before climbing down his back and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glowed blue.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ready, Zorua~?</span>\" she asked, ready to have her miniature boyfriend back in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fox shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's eyes stopped glowing as she offered a confused look, suggesting that she was waiting for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking... your mom won't come back until we're asleep, no?\" he asked, making Celebi nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... can I stay this size for now? Until we go to sleep?\" he asked while Celebi closed the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Of course!</span>\" she said, the dark fox snickering as he followed her in her bedroom. She closed the door, while he hopped on the bed, watching Celebi grab a book and hovering over the bed, letting herself fall on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and moved closer to Zorua, snuggling up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned as he adjusted his position, so that his girlfriend's head was leaning against his furry side as he sat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't know if you work better as a boyfriend or a pillow~ perhaps I should consider sleeping <i>on</i> you tonight~</span>\" she said cheerfully as she opened her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The relaxed couple suddenly sprang up, alert. Why was Celebi's mom home so early? They didn't really have time to ponder this, as Celebi and Zorua both figured she was about to come into the room. The young time traveler cast a glance and a nod at her boyfriend who was laying atop the pillow, and he nodded back and cast an illusion of a pillow that didn't have a Zorua sitting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Uh, yeah mom! What's up?</span>\" Celebi called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Work got out a bit early, and I just wanted to talk with you, since I haven't really been around that much.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, uh, okay then. Go ahead and come in.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened a few seconds later, revealing the pink Celebi and mother of Zorua's girlfriend. Zorua was wondering when he'd finally formally introduce himself to her... if ever. Although his reputation as the infamous prankster of the woods had settled down ever since Wigglytuff's \"disappearance\" - thanks in part to a combination of good word of mouth from Lopunny and the fact that nobody had actually been pranked in the woods for a few weeks now - Celebi's mom was still looking out for her daughter, and Zorua didn't want to be the cause of a conniption fit if she discovered her darling daughter had a boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she'd be more calm about it than he expected. Either way, suddenly revealing himself in the room right now would definitely NOT be a way to make good impressions on the pink Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So, was there anything in particular you wanted to talk about?</span>\" the younger Celebi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I mostly just wanted to see you again, sweetie,</span>\" her mom replied, before pulling her in for a hug. Celebi was close to the age of being embarrassed by her parents showing her affection in public, but went along with the hug to avoid being suspicious... much to the amusement of the invisible Zorua, who gave a smirk at the events in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I love you too, mom,</span>\" the green Celebi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">So, what about your friends, are you still keeping up with them?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, I just saw Gardevoir today.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom knew that the green-haired emotion-sensing psychic loved playing matchmaker, and decided to take this opportunity to nudge the conversation towards romance. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Did she try to match you up with random people again?</span>\" she knowingly asked. She wanted to make sure that if her daughter was actually interested in someone, that they were a good person and influence. After all, she only wanted the best for her girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the younger Celebi, she didn't want to reveal that she was already with Zorua, as her mom would probably disapprove greatly of him, so instead she pretended that she was still looking for the right guy. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, a few of them seemed okay, but none of them were quite my type.</span>\" '<span class=\"clgreen\">Not that the one I'm with is even close to my type, either,</span>' Celebi mused mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well, you're still young and have plenty of time to search for the right guy. Don't feel bad if you can't find him now.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Thanks, mom.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No problem, sweetie. Now I'm off to bed for the evening, so good night,</span>\" the older time-traveler said, before giving the younger one a kiss and heading for the door. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Enjoy your rest, dear.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Thanks, you too.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed and Zorua waited a few seconds before dispelling his illusion, before whispering to his girlfriend. \"Hey Celi, how do you think she'd feel about... y'know, us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Depends on how and when we reveal it. I've heard your reputation as a scoundrel is mostly diminished, much like you are when you get shrunken~.</span>\" Celebi said, a cyan ball forming in her hands. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">She does believe in the goodness of people, so she'd believe you truly changed your ways.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear, Celebi. Now go ahead,\" Zorua stated, before Celebi shot the shrinking ball into his body and reduced him back to doll sized, the pillow he was on large now enough to be its own bed for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now then...</span>\" Celebi said, before getting up, flipping off the lights, and getting back into her bed. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good night, Zorua,</span>\" she said, pulling him off of the pillow and cuddling him to her chest, as she was so accustomed to doing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Celi,\" he replied, letting sleep quickly claim him.</span></div></div>",

She had a reputation for waking up quite early in the morning and bury her head in a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things changed since Zorua had started sleeping in the same bed with her. Celebi had started waking up slightly later, usually forcing Zorua to wake up as well to make up for lost time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, today was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night went on quietly for the sleeping couple... and so did the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the clock stroke midday, Celebi slowly started to fidget in her sleep as she readjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, fate decided to be cruel with the poor fairy. A breeze blew inside the room through the open window, gently moving the curtains aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot by much, but enough for sunshine to seep inside the room, hitting the time traveler's dark eyelids. Bothered by the sudden feeling, Celebi started to move in her sleep, shaking the tiny fox in her paws in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua groaned as he tried to get comfortable in between the paws and the chest of the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the end, Zorua was forced to wake up because of the movement; at the same time, Celebi finally opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a yawn, making the ground beneath Zorua rise. The fox hazily looked up at her, watching as the two gigantic blue eyes of his giant girlfriend were fixed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blinked a few times, before wearing a sleepy smile on her face, which he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared at each other in silence, savoring the moment together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mhh~...</span>\" Celebi broke the silence as she stretched.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good morning my little Zorua~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the paws resting on the fox's back started caressing him. In response, he started nuzzling her chest.<br>\r\n\"Mornin' Celi...\" he happily chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy smiled brightly as she gently lowered her head  towards Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a gentle, loving peck before she raised her head again, watching with glee as a blush spread on Zorua's black fur. He laughed awkwardly, causing her to giggle while her gaze casually shifted onto a clock on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, she froze up, her smile dropping and her hand stopping its petting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi...?\" Zorua called out, noticing the green titan looking to the side with a shocked expression... although he couldn't make out what she was looking at, his vision eclipsed by the bedsheets and by Celebi's monolithic arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Celebi soon made clear the reason other weird behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... M-Midday?!</span>\" she exclaimed, looking back at Zorua, who was surprisingly calm. He yawned.<br>\r\n\"Oh... it's still early...\" he said as he closed his eyes and leaned his head on his green 'bed', hoping to catch five more minutes of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Celebi wasn't going to let him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">E-Early?!</span>\" Celebi couldn't believe what she heard.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, we lost half the day! We've got to get out of this bed - every second that passes makes the day... <i>unproductive</i>...</span>\" she whispered that word like it was the worst one in her vocabulary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua groaned as he attempted to stop the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi-\" it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had gotten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into her kitchen, and smiled as she noted that the breakfast was already set up... her mother was probably in a pretty good mood after the talk they had yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a confirm, she spotted a note on the table,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018See you later honey. Love, mom.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What do we do now that you've thrown me out of bed and spoiled a wonderful moment?\" Zorua sarcastically asked as he bit into a cookie Celebi gave him for a late breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lazily sat on her chair, sipping juice from a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure to leave some for her boyfriend, cleaned her lips with a napkin and gently placed the glass in front of Zorua, before gripping said fox and lowering him into the cup, letting him sip the sweet liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled. She learned something by Zorua's stay in her house: he hated being woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">If there's something your taught me, it's that is important to spend some time outside too,</span>\" she commented, and he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... And that's exactly what we're going to do! D'you agree?</span>\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua happily nodded as he gave a satisfied sigh, half of the giant cookie gone into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patiently waited for Celebi to finish with her own meal, before she pulled her chair back, put away the bag of cookies, washed her cup and grabbed Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a sweet smile as she headed to her room to grab a book... Zorua didn't let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Celebi!\" he said as she reached out for a book, causing her to stop with her arm hovering in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">B-But...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going outside... it means me~ you~... no books.\" the fox firmly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi meekly sighed, knowing the she couldn't oppose to his logic. She begrudgingly abandoned her book on top of her nightstand as she exited the room... only to enter again to grab the tiny bow and top hat from her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yes~</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi exited her house, holding an annoyed-looking Zorua, who was wearing his blue bow and his tiny top hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate ya.\" he said. Celebi childishly stuck her tongue out in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other paw joined the other as he enclosed Zorua in a hug, the warm sunshine hitting the couple as she walked out and psychically closed the door behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stretched in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Much better~\" he snickered.<br>\r\n\"You get to carry me more easily~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi simply sighed at her boyfriend's antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So? What do we do today?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Celebi smiled as she explained what she had in mind...</span></div></div>",

Where are we headed?\" he casually asked, before grinning at the green girl.<br>\r\n\"Oh, let's go to my forest!\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, the two could relax, play together, enjoy sunshine, wait for someone to throw rocks a-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo... he was reformed now... still, it'd be hilarious, he thought with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Celebi disagreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nope~ I've got a better idea~</span>\" she said, grabbing one of Zorua's paws and speeding up, literally dragging the fox to an unknown destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celi, slow down!\" he exclaimed, desperately trying to keep up with the fairy, who smirked as she glanced backwards. Zorua noted what she was looking at... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! No! N-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't resist as Celebi dragged him inside of the clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh~ cute~... ohh, that one that one!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed as he followed his girlfriend through the store while she excitedly watched clothes, commented how cute they'd look on her and picked up some to examine them up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed again, bored, before lazily gazing at the prices...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! How can you afford these clothes?\" he asked her, shocked that such things could cost that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I save money.

Zorua looked at it half-heartedly.<br>\r\n\"Ehm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, an indignant Celebi exited the store in a rush, Zorua running behind her.<br>\r\n\"Celi!\" he exclaimed, wondering the reason of her weird behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps... was \u2018I'm clueless\u2019 a wrong answer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua had to apologize several times before Celebi finally decided to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Fine...</span>\" she said, finally unfolding her arms and looking at the dark type fox, wearing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, let's go watch a movie!</span>\" she suggested, and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds...\" he abruptly stopped to look at her.<br>\r\n\"... You're not dragging me to see some romantic trash, are ya?\" he asked, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was a smirk appearing on Celebi's face as she started walking in direction of the movie theater, Zorua giving as sigh as he followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of the movie theater, Zorua eyed a particular poster and quickly ran up in front of it, tail wagging in front of the image of Giratina, encircled by Gastly, towering over a scared Eevee who was running in a spectral scenario, chased by the huge dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018A date with the devil\u2019 Zorua read with an excited snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I know what you're thinking, and I totally approve it.</span>\" a voice chimed behind the fox. He recognized it and snickered as he turned around to high-five a shiny Braixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you here to watch this Braix?\" he asked, and she snickered while Celebi got closer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Of course! I've been waiting for this to come out for months!</span>\" she chimed, before eyeing the couple with a grin.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Please tell me you're coming to see it too.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No!</span>\" Celebi exclaimed, before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looked at Zorua and pointed to another poster... the blue eyes of the fox shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Espeon and an Umbreon, cuddling on a green field, tails wrapped together and mouths locked in a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... no thanks... Braixen can I come with-\" he was interrupted as Celebi pulled his tail.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No Zorua, we're out on a date, you can't leave me all of sudden!</span>\" she scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen snickered.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Don't worry, Zorua! I'll tell you everything later on! See ya!</span>\" she said cheerfully as she walked inside the theater, while Celebi literally dragged the poor fox inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Isn't it beautiful Zorua?</span>\" Celebi asked with clasped paws and sparkling eyes as she watched Espeon and Umbreon nuzzling each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy received no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua?</span>\" she looked to the seat beside hers... Zorua was snoring on his, head resting in his paws and tail wagging slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox's eyes shot open as he looked at a frowning Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">How much time have you been asleep?</span>\" she asked as he yawned.<br>\r\n\"I dunno... when Espeon moved from her old town?</span>\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But... that was the beginning!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Arceus... you're hopeless.</span>\" Celebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"Isn't that why you're dating me?\" the fox asked, causing Celebi to smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">For once Zorua...</span>\" she leaned to kiss his chest, before hugging him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're right.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox snickered triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I had fun... kinda...\" Zorua stated as he and Celebi walked home. The sun had set down a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Me too~ it was great to spend a day without thinking about Azurill...</span>\" Celebi chimed with a smile as they finally approached the house... noticing that the lights inside were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hm... mom must be home.

Thusly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Maybe it's the perfect time to introduce you to mom,</span>\" Celebi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now? Are you sure about this, Celi?\" Zorua asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, we're still only a few weeks into our relationship, so it'd be a lot less awkward to do it now.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds about right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Alright, you just wait here, I'll go in and start the conversation.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.

Unsure of how exactly to break the news to the pink Celebi, the green one simply said \"<span class=\"clgreen\">hi, mom,</span>\" and got her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, hi, sweetie!</span>\" the elder Celebi happily exclaimed upon seeing her daughter. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Where have you been?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I was just... out with friends.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom smiled at this. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm glad to see that you're getting out more, sweetie.

I know I brought it up yesterday, but you didn't need to go and look right away!</span>\" the elder Celebi jokingly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No... it's... I've actually... known him for a while...</span>\" the pink Celebi raised an eyebrow at this. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">We've actually been... together for a little bit...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Celebi's mom was simultaneously intrigued, concerned, and confused. Her daughter just told her yesterday that Gardevoir was still trying to match her with people, and today she was admitting she's been with a guy for some time? Her sweet daughter had never been the lying type...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Why didn't you tell me before, honey?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Because I... didn't think you'd approve of him...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Why would that be?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden knock on the door interrupted the moment between the two time-travelers. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I'll get it,</span>\" the older time-traveler said. Celebi already had a good feeling who it was, and followed her mom over to the door where, true to her expectations, her mom was now looking at Zorua. The pink Celebi quickly put two and two together and looked back at her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You're in love with Zorua?</span>\" Celebi looked away after being asked this. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm not mad, sweetie...

She obviously wanted to know how long this had been for, whether Zorua had truly changed, if he was a gentleman... all sorts of stuff. But which one should she ask? Obviously there would be lots of bias since they like each other, and her daughter had lied about being in a relationship, but was Zorua any more honest than Celebi?</span></div></div>",

He called his broken leg a help in front of her mother, a blessing in front of Buneary, always told that she had given him a new life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm glad to be hearing this, honey... and you Zorua, I'm quite impressed by your change too... but I need to know something else - how long?</span>\" she asked, adjusting in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">How long have you two been together?</span>\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story...\" Zorua replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We have time.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed as she looked at Zorua, but he turned his head away, making her understand that he was letting her do the talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well... a week or two ago, I found Zorua sleeping in the woods...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"I'm homeless, miss...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi looked at him, he nodded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... You have nowhere to go?</span>\" she asked. Zorua shook his head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And... your parents?</span>\" she asked, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.<br>\r\n\"I never knew my mom... and my dad wasn't exactly what I call the perfect parent... he was a jerk... I ran so much time ago...</span>\" he admitted, causing Celebi to look at him, flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never told her this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy nervously scratched her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... And so, I offered him to... to come living here... and he agreed, he's been living with us since then...</span>\" Celebi admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">B-But... I never noticed you!</span>\" her mom exclaimed, perplexed, before yet again remembering the pokedoll she held in her own hands some time ago, noticing that it was well made... that seemed like real fur... and Zorua was able to use illusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery piece went to its place... except...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Why pretend to be a pokedoll?</span>\" she asked before he could explain, and Celebi gulped.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I mean... of all the illusions you could use, why a pokedoll?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the most awkward confession she had to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Technically mom, I do this...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the pink Celebi's green eyes, a free chair around the table was hit by a cyan ball and reduced in size, before growing back at its original size upon being hit by the same ball again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink fairy looked back at her daughter.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Since when you can do such thing?</span>\" she asked, not sure whether to feel proud of her daughter for having such unique ability or disappointed because she used it to let a scoundrel live in their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">A Minimize TM... I used that to develop this... I shrunk Zorua so that he could freely stay with us... he still does... the pokedoll was the perfect disguise...</span>\" Celebi admitted.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Please mom, let Zorua stay, he's nice now, you won't even see him, I'll take care of him, please...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at his girlfriend longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that if her mother disagreed, he'd lose his girlfriend and his home... sure, he'd go straight back to living in the woods, but losing Celebi was something he didn't want to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, maybe Celebi was a bit boring at times, and she loved dressing him up like a doll, but he loved her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi looked at the two young pokemon staring at each other... she saw the worry in Zorua's eyes, and smiled.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cppink\">Young love...</span></i>\u2019 she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older time traveler gave a sigh that successfully earned the attention of the two pokemon in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm glad about this all, kids, and I'm glad you told me the truth... I'm happy you helped him change, honey, and I'm happy you like someone...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi fought back a smile. That was a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink fairy turned her head to Zorua.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">As for you, Zorua... did you REALLY change? Are you truly done right pranks?</span>\" she asked, unsure if she could trust him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua chose his words carefully, knowing that his girlfriend was the price to pay if he told something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes miss... I'm done pranking for good... please, I really like Celebi...\" he told.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Same goes for me...</span>\" the green fairy chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom nodded. She had enough answers to give her response, she decided.<br>\r\n\"Zorua...</div></div>",

He grinned at her.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom smiled brightly in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, a cyan ball was shot inside the fox's body as she found the chair he was sitting on growing bigger, until he was sitting on a wooden land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gently picked him up, smiled at her mom and went to her room, closing the door behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Celebi moved on the bed, sat down with her legs crossed and moved the tiny fox up to her face, noticing his tail wagging<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Celebi kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm so happy!</span>\" Celebi chimed as she returned to her room after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiled - he was interrogated by the mother of his girlfriend during dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions were quite easy - \u2018When did it happen?\u2019, \u2018How did it happen?\u2019 and other questions along those lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua seemed to have answered to them all correctly as Celebi's mother smiled brightly when they finished eating and quietly let them go back inside the fairy's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... me too...\" the dark type responded from her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gave him a gleeful smile, before gently putting him down on her pillow and reaching inside her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Please don't pull out the chess board.\" he told with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked back to smile as her paw emerged with a bag of chips... Zorua's hickory chips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It was nice, finally telling it, huh? We can finally, freely be together~</span>\" the giant fairy sang as she set the bag down in front of Zorua, who started munching on a giant chip.<br>\r\n\"Mh-mhmmh~\" he said, mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled, and gently gripped him, setting him down on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grinned, and snuggled closer to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Are you happy?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Elated. You?\" he asked back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Blissful~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi turned to her closet, psychically pulling out something... Zorua's smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis most dreaded nemesis after the bow - the chess board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled as she gripped the checkered board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">One match before bed? Pretty please?</span>\" she asked pleadingly, eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checkmate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black king was kicked hard, and it slid across the chess board to hit the white king, which fell from the board, in front of a flabbergasted Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua had beaten her. Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snickered.<br>\r\n\"Only because I'm bored doesn't mean I can't do it, ya know!\" he exclaimed cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant green fairy in front of him smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I let you win...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't... nice try, Celi.\" he answered. She opened her mouth, but he intercepted what she was about to say,<br>\r\n\"You were looking surprised since I cornered you when my bishop took down your queen!\" he stated proudly, Celebi's mouth hanging open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Okay, you're being too smart now.</span>\" she said playfully as she scooped him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Don't like it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Celebi pecked him on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That was a fair victory... you earned your reward cutie~</span>\" the giantess said as she happily nuzzled the tiny dark type, who nuzzled his head against her giant cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing went on for a whole minute, before Celebi pulled back and smiled brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's go to bed Zorua, what do you think?</span>\" she asked, putting the chess board away inside her closet again, before looking down at the dark type, who nodded happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gently picked him up and moved towards her bed.</span></div></div>",

Zorua himself mustered a half-asleep \"goodnight, Celi\", as he adjusted the best he could to get into a more comfortable sleeping position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the lights, the young couple's falling asleep also went quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Celebi's mom decided to check on the couple. After all, they were a pair of teenagers who were alone in a bedroom together, late at night. Floating in through the doorway, she moved over towards the bed and its sleeping residents. They were asleep already, giving the elder further credence to Zorua's statement that he wouldn't be engaging in any \"weird stuff\" with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was he? The pink Celebi telekinetically lifted the blanket, revealing... Zorua being held like a doll in the paws of his girlfriend, her stomach making itself his bedspread. If she wasn't trying to be quiet, Celebi's mom would've chuckled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cppink\">I thought you were too studious to be playing with dolls, sweetie,</span>' she sarcastically thought, before letting the covers fall back onto the sleeping couple. The elder Celebi levitated back out of Celebi's bedroom and closed the door, before returning to her own bedroom and letting out that laugh. She quickly let sleep claim her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door of Celebi's bedroom creaked open, but the happy couple ignored it. After all, they were in the middle of a quite pleasant sleep and didn't want to be interrupted. The cause of the creaking? Celebi's mom, come to wake her daughter (and by proxy, her boyfriend as well) at a reasonable hour. Plus, she had already made breakfast for the two and didn't want it to go to waste. Fluttering over to the sleeping pair, she gently shook Celebi (and by proxy, her boyfriend as well) and jostled them awake and away from dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the Celebis immediately heard the groaning coming from under the blanket, with the green one giving a knowing smirk towards her stomach. Moving her right paw, she pulled the blanket off of herself (and by proxy, her boyfriend as well), exposing him to the air and light once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi... can't we sleep in one of these days?\" the small fox grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We were asleep until noon yesterday, was that not enough?</span>\" his girlfriend asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a word, no.\" Celebi mockingly scoffed at this reply. \"Now what time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">About 9 in the morning,</span>\" Celebi's mom said, leading to Zorua suddenly realizing she was also in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh! How long have you been there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">The whole time, Zorua. Now I've made breakfast for you two, so come and get it,</span>\" the pink Celebi stated, before fluttering back out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well, you heard her. Let's eat,</span>\" Celebi said to her boyfriend, before getting up and heading for the door with him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at the table, Celebi set the tiny Zorua on a napkin next to her plate, which was adorned with meat and eggs, with a glass of juice. She broke off some meat and eggs from her own meal and set the smaller portions next to Zorua before digging into her own. They ate in pleasant silence for the most part until Zorua looked up and asked Celebi, \"what's the plan for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well, Zorua, I was thinking...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

When she saw Celebi at the same table with Zorua, she shot a questioning look as well as a disappointed one. Celebi promptly ignored both, sure that she was going to have to give a lot of awkward explanations whenever school started again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n\"Why should I care? I don't even go to school.\" he replied, causing Celebi to giggle and her mom to sigh - she became quite serious when it came to school business. With a daughter like Celebi, it wasn't hard to see why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Anyway, going out with the other sounds good.\" the dark-type finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached to grab another mouthful of meat, but Celebi picked him up from his napkin and pecked his left cheek... or better, the left side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, he nuzzled the fairy's giant cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the scene from the other side of the table, Celebi's mom giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You two make a cute couple after all~</span>\" she said, sending Zorua in a state of deep embarrassment and causing Celebi to giggle awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... We're heading out in a bit then.</span>\" she said Zorua, who nodded, his cheek flared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously...\" the dark type stood still while Celebi tied the familiar blue bow around his neck.<br>\r\n\"Your mom knows about us... no need to hide anymore...\" he meekly opposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Still, other pokemon don't, and it'd be weird if they did... and, by the way, you look cute with this~</span>\" she chirped in response, before placing a tiny top hat on the fox's head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And this~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed - this was humiliating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought faded from his mind as Celebi, noticing his dejected stare, picked him up from his perch on top of her pillow and pecked his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on Zorua... you've got to believe me, you look even more cute with those on~</span>\" she chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua meekly looked up. When your giant girlfriend wants you to do something, it's hard to tell her \u2018no\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zorua thought about making one last attempt.<br>\r\n\"... At least the hat?... I saved Azurill?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smirked.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Something <i>that</i> big over this Zorua? That's dumb... but seeing you plead is so cute~</span>\" she said cheerfully, removing the hat from the head of her boyfriend and throwing it onto the bed, earning a grateful smile from the dark-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on cutie,</span>\" the fairy said, holding the fox against her chest and starting to walk.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom! We're going out!</span>\" she shouted, getting a prompt response,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay sweetie~... Zorua. Just don't be late for dinner!</span>\" her mother exclaimed from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she heard the front door closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... My little girl is grown up so fast... and now, she has a boyfriend...</span>\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she looked around the quiet house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a day off and was alone in the house. She smiled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nice armchair, ice cream and a good movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be the perfect day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Celebi, Braixen, Gardevoir and Espurr were walking down the road... Zorua held by a very affectionate Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi, mind opportunely shielded by a psychic block, was trying to keep herself from acting jealous... a hard task to achieve when another girl was holding her boyfriend right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zorua, he enjoyed the embrace of the pokemon who was probably his best friend, happily ignoring his internally-seething girlfriend behind them. Since the sleepover in which he learned about Espurr's crush for him, the psychic-type had been way more affectionate around Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the two didn't escape Gardevoir's eyes, which were quite vigilant when it came to this sort of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Aw~ aren't these two cute~?</span>\" she intoned, causing Celebi to clench her fists and Braixen to snicker with a paw over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could already tease Zorua because of his bow, but this was even better! Shame Lopunny wanted Buneary to hang out with her and Azurill, she would've enjoyed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr blushed as she picked up on her friend's thoughts, but shot her an annoyed look. Braixen stopped laughing instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smirked - it's not so hard to make your friends stop teasing you when you can read minds and have eyes as large as your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of mind-reading, Espurr sensed Zorua's thoughts and smiled, comprehensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Hm-mh... I see your point.</span>\" she simply said, stroking the dark-type, who sighed. As much as he liked Espurr, he wanted her out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi saw the perfect opportunity to remind Zorua who his girlfriend was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What? Anything - you tell me - now.</span>\" she quickly said, picking him from Espurr's arms and holding him in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bow-adorned tiny dark-type and Celebi's boyfriend shrugged.<br>\r\n\"No big deal Celi... just, I was thinking - I can't do anything like this... I thought it would have been nice if I could be big again for today, that's it.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at him, before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, that's up to-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">No wait, don't!</span>\" Braixen chimed in, snickering, earning the attention of the couple.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">That bow looks cute on him, it'd be a shame to let him take it off~</span>\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why don't <i>you</i> shrink and put this bow on Braixen?\" Zorua snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hm... it'd look nice on you...</span>\" Gardevoir chimed, looking at her purple friend, who looked betrayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... Keep that thing away from me or I'll roast it.</span>\" she playfully threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua perked up.<br>\r\n\"... Do it!\" he exclaimed, the perspective of getting rid of the blue piece of fabric making his eyes gleam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Shut up Zorua...</span>\" she said before smiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Anyway, it's up to you! Say, do you want to stay like that or grow back?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" the dark-type pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, this size had it's advantages. He was carried around, food lasted longer - he saw Celebi grabbing money, so she was either buying other pokedoll clothes or snacks - Celebi was way more affectionate with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut growing back... he'd get rid of the blue bow still tied around his neck. That was really a tempting perspective, even though pokemon tended to be nicer when he was at his current size... those he knew and befriended anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf someone from the village saw him, it'd be bad... for them anyway since Celebi could shrink them to specks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zorua himself, he finally told his girlfriend his decision.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps, you really don't enjoy my company?</span>\" the elder Celebi then supposed, feeling both concerned and offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at her, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What - no! Miss, I do enjoy your company,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"... I was just thinking about something, that's all.

And when one's giant girlfriend is that firm on a particular subject, there's no denying her desires... for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm fine, let's go.\" he said, Celebi smiling triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother shrugged, before smiling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well you two...

Even if playfully, causing a scene in public is embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sorry you two... were you saying?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid... don't ever fall in love,\" Zorua said Azurill, before noting the look his girlfriend was giving him.<br>\r\n\"... It's too late for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second those words left Zorua, Celebi leaned in to peck his cheek, causing Buneary and Azurill to laugh again. To Azurill, it was fun to see Zorua humiliated after what he did to his doll... although, he had to admit, all his sour feelings towards the fox that once was a prankster were gone, replaced by friendlier ones; to Buneary, the whole thing was cute to extreme levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">We're doing fine Celi... Mom is happy about Azurill too, she says she loves having another kid in the house.</span>\" she revealed, making Azurill blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Glad to hear that. Zorua?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her paws, but Zorua wasn't paying attention. Instead, he was looking intently, a frown on his face, out of the store, in direction of Lopunny and the pink Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green one followed his gaze, and understood why her boyfriend was acting like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom was frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Lopunny, what happened to Wigglytuff? He disappeared, they say...</span>\" Celebi's mom asked at some point as she and her friend sat down on a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny shivered at the memory, she had nightmares about it for a few nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for Celebi, Zorua, Braixen and the others, she'd have a hole in her chest now, while Buneary would be an orphan under Wigglytuff's \u2018care\u2019...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff and Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if they were already dead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Lopunny?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">Hm?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom was looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Look, you said that you already knew about Celebi and Zorua. But that means that you also knew about Celi's powers, and that was why you asked her to shrink Azurill... after Wigglytuff's disappearance.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny wore a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbrown\">... I don't follow.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink fairy sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I don't know... I feel like Celebi and Zorua might be involved with his disappearance. Do you know anything about it...?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny looked at her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If Lopunny didn't want Buneary to know what really happened... or was about to happen, she couldn't have her around. She'd talk to Azurill some other time.

Celebi's mom internally smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No honey, in fact it isn't...</span>\" she said, eliciting a sighed of relief from her daughter and Zorua. The pink fairy looked around, before sighing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You two... let's head to the park. We need to discuss something.</span>\" she said, starting to flutter off, emulated by Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... About?\" Zorua questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi smiled. She decided against a classical \u2018not angry, just disappointed mom\u2019. She had to put Zorua and Celebi at ease, that way they'd be more willing to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">For now, only about what ice cream you like.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi reluctantly grabbed the ice cream her mom was insistently offering to her, while Zorua gladly accepted his with his tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh cutie~</span>\" Zorua briefly looked at her, discovering her smirking down at him wordlessly. He shrugged, and turned back to his ice cream... but it was reduced to the point he could hold it in one paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... When are ya gonna stop doin\u2019 that to my giant food?\" he asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You mean, like the hickory chips back home?</span>\" Celebi asked innocently, and Zorua looked horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't dare.\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Try me~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom let out something between an amused giggle and an exasperated sigh, resulting in a weird sound similar to a menacing growl to come out of her mouth, drawing the attention of the two young pokemon in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink fairy held her own ice cream as she sat in front of them on the bench in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">So... about Wigglytuff...</span>\" she decided to rip the bandage off straightaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked surprised, but her clever mind immediately pieced it together. Lopunny told her about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua seemed to be on the same line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy nonchalantly took a lick at her ice cream, feeling her cheeks flaring up. She liked it, but she wasn't a kid anymore. She looked at Zorua, he was licking his ice cream repeatedly, suggesting that he was letting her do all the talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed as she met her mother's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... I don't think there's anything to say mom. Wigglytuff and his partner Weavile tried to kill Lopunny to adopt Buneary... but she told you that, no?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder Celebi nodded solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">She also told me about the consequences of such actions...</span>\" she said. Celebi glanced at her mother.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom... if you could do what I can... wouldn't you have done the same thing?</span>\" she asked back, and her mother looked taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she have done that...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... No Celi,</span>\" she answered.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And it's only because I have someone to teach right and wrong to.</span>\" she admitted, her words falling hard on her daughter's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Lopunny also told me about something you did to Azurill...</span>\" the pink fairy continued. Celebi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He attempted to blackmail us ma'am.\" he chimed in, the pink Celebi's gaze traveling down to him as she adopted an expression of curiosity. Zorua nodded. Though the situation was serious, Celebi's mom couldn't help but smile - he had ice cream all over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah ma'am... he wanted to tell about my current size... pokemon would have hunted me and Celebi down...\" he revealed, Celebi nodding each word that came out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That's not a reason to deprive him of freedom... you could've told me for example. I would have given the kid an earful... I would've taught him to respect my daughter...</span>\" she said, before smiling at Zorua.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And her interest.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blushed, but remained serious. Her mom looked down at her half-molten ice cream, looking deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi felt what every other daughter feels while witnessing her mother looking like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom... are you angry? About Wigglytuff... Weavile...

I doubt it, but they deserved it, no?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every single bit of it.\" Zorua agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom sighed.</span></div></div>",

About the two pokemon in the jar I mean...\" Zorua asked as the older Celebi looked at him.</span></div></div>",

It's getting a bit late,</span>\" the elder time traveler said to the two lovebirds, the trio getting up from the park benches. The sun was setting, meaning it was time for certain size-distanced couples to begin making their way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...'kids'?\" Zorua questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sounds like mom has taken a bit of a shine to you, Zorua~,</span>\" Celebi said, her face radiating happiness. Zorua let out an approving \"hm\" before polishing off his ice cream. The pair of Celebis returned to their own cones as well, continuing their stroll home with only the pleasant sounds of nature around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm surprised you managed to stop complaining about the doll clothes, Zorua,</span>\" Celebi sarcastically remarked. The couple had retreated into Celebi's bedroom for the night, as per usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, believe you me, I'm still complaining. Just not out loud,\" he replied, having left the bow and hat on the pillow for her to put away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That sounds about right,</span>\" Celebi jokingly said, telekinetically lifting the diminutive Zorua into her hands. Placing the doll clothes on her desk for the night, she flipped the lights, casting a shroud of darkness on the bedroom once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Goodnight, cutie~,</span>\" Celebi said, pulling the blankets over herself and her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Celi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been about 20 minutes since the lights had gone off. Celebi was fast asleep, but Zorua was deep in thought. So deep, in fact, that he barely registered Celi's bedroom door creaking open. Her mom was just coming in to check up on the happy couple, and perhaps get a laugh out of her wanting to play with dolls again. Once more, she fluttered over to the bed and lifted the blanket psychically, but instead of seeing the couple asleep, she noticed a very awake Zorua being held against her daughter's stomach. Putting a paw to her mouth to signal him to keep quiet, she lifted her daughter's paws, gently pried Zorua out of her embrace and left with the tiny fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking him over to the living room, Celebi's mom sat down in a chair and put him on the armrest. A brief silence ensued as the two looked at each other in the dark room. Zorua was the one who breached the quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh... is there a reason I'm out here right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I was checking on you two to see if you were doing anything weird... but I sensed you were still awake, and wanted to know why.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just... thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Thinking about what?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Celi.\" The elder wasn't expecting to hear this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Don't tell me you're getting cold paws, Zorua!</span>\" she exclaimed, believing the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's not that! I do still love her... but I'm a bit concerned about the relationship itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What about it?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it's about my power in it. Now, I know this sounds like something petty, but you're the one who wanted to know what I was thinking about.\" Zorua had piqued the pink Celebi's interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No, no, go on.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lately... I just feel like I don't have any say in this relationship. Like, no agency. What Celebi says, goes, no matter what. Since I'm so small, she can basically force me to do anything, and since she's the only one who can change the size of people, I can't change that fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh...</span>\" The older Celebi leaned in closer to Zorua, wanting to hear the rest of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, up until now, she's only used that for extremely...\" he thought about the doll clothes again, \"...minor, but annoying things, like forcing me to wear doll clothes, waking me up extremely early, or interrupting my eating. But earlier today, we were talking about me possibly being my regular size while I was hanging out with you guys, but since she's in control of who changes size, and she prefers me like this for... some reason... I basically had no say in the matter. Which is kinda concerning, considering it's <i>my</i> life and <i>my</i> size, not Celi's. So now I'm thinking, 'what if she does this with something more serious? What if she forces something that's actually significant upon me and I'm powerless to stop it?'\" Having said his part, Zorua stopped to let the girl before him gather her response.</span></div></div>",

He didn't know how to feel about having his girlfriend's mom help him talk about his feelings of powerlessness TO his girlfriend, but Celebi's mom did have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was outmatched in pretty much every regard on his own, and on the off chance Celebi DID decide to brush his concerns off, he couldn't really do anything to stop her. He didn't want to be away from Celi, but he didn't like being pushed around either, even if Celebi didn't mean anything by it or even realize she was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder time traveler patted his head again, something that still felt kinda odd, but it was reassuring. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Don't worry, my daughter didn't mean anything by it i'm sure, and in the morning we'll clear all of this up.</span>\" She lifted Zorua up and carried him back to her daughter's room. She set the teen on the bed near her daughter and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Goodnight Zorua, get some rest, okay?</span>\" She said gently as she departed to her own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hope this doesn't stir the pot, all i'm thinking...\" He muttered to himself, with a sigh he approached his giantess girlfriend on the bed and laid down against her. Celebi's smile widened a bit in her sleep and her paws gently curled around him. Trapping him in a sheet of warmth and comfort. Zorua closed his eyes and went to sleep, at least somewhat relieved that come what may, they'd talk in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Celi, Zorua...up and at 'em.</span>\" The gentle voice made both teens groan as they slowly opened their eyes. Celebi sat up groggily and looked at her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ma...? What time is it...?</span>\" She asked only to get a smile in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">5:30, i'm about to get ready for work...don't worry, you can go back to bed after this, we just need to talk, the three of us for a bit.</span>\" She said and Celebi blinked in tired confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua knew what was coming and mentally prepared himself. Celebi got out of bed and slowly fluttered out of her room, carrying her tiny boyfriend in her paws as they sat at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two mugs of hot cocoa at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...mom?</span>\" Celebi seemed a bit more awake as she asked this only to get a smile in return. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Go ahead dear...have a drink. Let Zorua have some too.</span>\" Her mom said as she sipped one of the cups. Celebi lowered Zorua to the mug and let him have a few sips, before she took a sip...they all looked at each other and Celebi's mom broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua, why don't you start, okay?</span>\" She said gently, and Zorua looked up at his girlfriend's face from her paws, she looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi...I...last night...maybe it's just me seeing something that isn't there, but your mom pulled me aside after you fell asleep and...i'll be honest, sometimes I feel really powerless around you...like you're dictating what I do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blinked. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">What...?</span>\" She said, confused by all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What he's talking about is the way that you're using your size and psychic powers willy nilly on or around him dear...it's what we talked about when you were a child on occasions...being very careful not to use your overwhelming powers to...well, overwhelm. It's a hard thing to do, and I admit i've stumbled in it when I was your age, but it can make the pokemon we care about uncomfortable, and it might've made Zorua uncomfortable...we just want to clear the air, right Zorua?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gulped. \"Right ma'am...it isn't that I entirely hate being this size...i've gotten used to it and to an extent enjoy the benefits of it...but you see fit to keep me like this when you want and...you shrink the food I eat, maybe to tease, maybe out of concern for me overeating, and you make me wear the doll clothes...I know this all seems petty, and I still love you...it just makes me a bit uncomfortable...\" Zorua was also remembering that Celebi had almost killed him not too long ago...and doomed Wigglytuff and Weavile to a horrid fate, though much earned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi internalized all of this and finally responded.</span></div></div>",

Celebi's smile shrunk: she already know what kind of movie would be picking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day before, Braixen had called her at some point and kept her on the phone for half an hour, gushing about a new movie: \u2018The Forest of Death\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Braixen's complaining about Celebi not wanting to see it, there she was, carrying Zorua to see it on her own free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed - at least, she'd have him to cuddle during gruesome scenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy hovered to the movie theater... as expected, Zorua's eyes instantly fell on the poster showing the image of a Togepi staring at a humongous Victreebel, who had its mouth gaping open as it towered above the small pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gulped, Zorua wagged his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Lookee here...</span>\" Celebi turned around to see a smirking purple vixen staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey Braix...</span>\" the fairy greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hi Zorua,</span>\" the fire-type saluted, Zorua grinning at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I take it you both are here to see...</span>\" she made a bored face as she pointed to a poster that showed an Altaria and a Flygon, holding paws in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Draconic Love\u2019 the poster read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... no.\" Zorua said; Celebi stared at the poster longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know what I said but... pretty please?</span>\" she begged, making puppy-dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich oddly didn't manage to get to Zorua's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that dirty trick ain't gonna work... you already dragged me to see that Espeon and Umbreon the other day, and I fell asleep...\" he recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to keep me - and you - very, very awake.\" Zorua spoke with a sinister grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi thought that it was justified payback, given how he apparently felt about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...

Your mom makes us breakfast almost everyday now, I don't think she'd be too pleased...\" Zorua stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">She wouldn't be pleased with me watching these movies either!</span>\" Celebi retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick: hungry Victreebel or angry mom?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Are you kidding?

I don't want to be erased from existence!</span>\" the fairy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're her daughter...\" her reduced boyfriend pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Exactly. That's why she'd go easy on me...</span>\" Celebi mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered again, while briefly wondering what Celebi's mom was truly capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother motivation to not upset her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please Zorua... I don't want to go...</span>\" Celebi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, there's nothing to be scared of!\" Zorua reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was about to set down, but Zorua wanted to go to one final destination: his forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie, Celebi was understandably scared, but Zorua didn't relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whining girlfriend gave up: she had told Zorua he could pick what they could do, she had to keep her promise now... much to her regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Celebi fluttered into her boyfriend's home and sat down on a log, placing Zorua on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">There. Now what? Can we leave this place soon, before I get a heart attack?</span>\" she asked, imagining that giant Victreebel coming out at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet Celi... y'know, few pokemon come here, the others are too scared...\" the fox proudly stated, although the number of scared pokemon leaving his forest with tears in their eyes was reduced to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're alone Celi...\" Zorua continued, tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blushed massively... so that's why Zorua wanted to come here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy forgot her fear and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, I get it...</span>\" was all she said, before Zorua found himself traveling upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no hesitation, his giant girlfriend started showering him with gentle kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua closed his eyes and grinned, feeling the smooth pair landing all over his body while he floated in front of Celebi, held by psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, Celebi smirked, and psychically lowered Zorua onto the log, before laying belly-down on it, pushing the fox down with her head as she kept smooching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That tic-tickles...\" Zorua laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dared to return some of the kisses he received, getting rewarded with less gentle but more loving pecks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing went on for twenty-five good minutes, before Celebi finally pulled off, blushing furiously but smiling brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well, that was some experience~</span>\" she chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sprang back on his feet. He was blushing too, but unlike his girlfriend, he wore an almost wicked grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now you're happy we came here, aren't ya?\" he rhetorically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smirked as a paw traveled to Zorua, scooped him up and brought him to his bed, mode of transport and anything else he could conceive: her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi hugged him, before she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on cutie... let's go home now... if mom saw any of this...</span>\" Celebi shivered slightly at her own musings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she won't know about any of this as long as we do it here.\" Zorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend smiled in response as she fluttered out of the forest and headed back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne good way to end the day.</div></div>",

Why, were we fighting?\" Zorua stated with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh Zorua, you little-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously, it was just me complaining about something, that's all...\" Zorua interrupted, earning a giggle and and peck from the green giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom watched the scene with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was fine between her daughter and her daughter's boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm going to start dinner you two,</span>\" she said as Celebi pulled back from a blushing Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay mom, we'll be in my room.</span>\" the green fairy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi turned around and walked to the familiar place that was her bedroom.<br>\r\nShe closed the door behind herself and laid down in bed, setting Zorua on her chest. He was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Celi, we weren't fighting...\" he repeated, causing the green mountain he was laying on to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll keep it in mind for when we have a real fight,</span>\" she replied, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Do we have to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No. But you're cute when you're angry. And pouty. And sad. And cute in general.</span>\" she giggled, leaning forward to peck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi pinned him down with a paw, while the other telekinetically drew a book from her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the book with a paw and hugging Zorua with the other, the fairy started reading in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox, bored, decided to take a nap, and managed to sleep for fifteen minutes before a familiar voice rung in the room,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Kids! Dinner!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled, shut her book, shook her boyfriend awake - much to his annoyance - and headed to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Honey, isn't it a bit early to go to sleep?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question took aback Celebi, who was about to leave the kitchen table upon finishing dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I wasn't,</span>\" Celebi shrugged,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I was thinking of playing chess with Zorua.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boyfriend shot a bored stare, one that was answered with a snicker,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey, you beat me the other night, are you still complaining?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's. Boring.\" Zorua replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom got up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I was thinking... why don't we do something all together? Like watching a movie?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Celebi was taken aback, but then smiled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sounds good!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at the pink giantess warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of movie?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at the TV screen with sparkles in her eyes as she sat next to her mom, a bored Zorua sitting on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huffed as he watched the TV as it flashed with the romantic movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething told him that Celebi's mom thought that him watching it with the two of them would have made the experience more pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have any clue about how wrong she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pretended to watch in silence, but slowly, his consciousness was fading. His eyelids became heavy, and he yawned drowsily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Isn't it beautiful Zorua?</span>\" Celebi whispered as she looked down at her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua wasn't moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi glanced at her mom, which was watching the movie intently, not paying Celebi or her boyfriend any mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, carefully, Celebi lifted the small fox from her lap, bringing him up to her face to examine him up close: he was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled. Quietly, she grabbed his tail in two fingers and pulled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" his eyes shot open as he stared daggers at Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You mo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">After all you made me do today, you deserved it.</span>\" Celebi replied with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua could make any smart comeback, he was pushed forward, right into the chest of the fairy. Shortly after, her lips landed on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good night Zorua...</span>\" she whispered as she leaned back against the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response of the dark-type never came as he closed his eyes once again, grumbled and relaxed, soon falling asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout paying the movie anymore mind, Celebi watched her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned - watching Zorua sleeping gave her a sense of drowsiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes for a single instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe credits rolled on the screen. Celebi's mom smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">How was it you two?</span>\" she asked, stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Kids?</span>\" she turned her head, but nothing could have prepared her for the adorable scene her eyes met: Celebi, asleep next to her, an as well asleep Zorua cuddled to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That is one adorable doll, honey...</span>\" she whispered to herself.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Let's put these two to bed.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unconscious Celebi (and Zorua as well) were lifted psychically as her mom fluttered to her daughter's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blankets were telekinetically lifted, and the sleeping Celebi was gently laid under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom leaned down, kissing the green fairy on the forehead, before her paw found Zorua's head as she gently caressed the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the psychic force holding the blankets faded, letting the sheet fall onto Celebi and her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last, loving glance, Celebi's mom left the room.</span></div></div>",

Anything else you want to say, honey?</span>\" she said, noticing Celebi's blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearly identical Celebi shook her head, silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next few moments, Celebi, her mom and Zorua stared at each other wordlessly, each with a different feeling: Celebi stared at her boyfriend, upset; Zorua stared at his girlfriend's mother, confused; the pink Celebi stared at her daughter, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... I really need to head to work, kids. Go back to sleep, I'll see you later... have a nice day.</span>\" Celebi's mom said, but couldn't shake off he feeling that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered taking a day off, but she really couldn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the two lovebirds gave any response when the pink legendary finally headed out of the kitchen and, eventually, Zorua and Celebi heard the front door closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then, Celebi automatically pulled back her chair and got up, like she was a puppet, controlled by the same psychic force she and her mom used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, the fairy grabbed the tiny Zorua, who was still feeling quite uncomfortable. She hugged him, but there was no warmth in her embrace, despite the warmth her body emanated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi fluttered through the dark kitchen and flew back into her room, shutting the door and moving back to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blankets were psychically lifted as Celebi laid down. Then, she set Zorua down onto her pillow, before pulling the blankets up to her neck, staring at the dark-type blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still wasn't sure what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to apologize, promise Zorua she'd make it up to him... but the fact that he talked to her mom and not to her made her feel bad... worse. Zorua was supposed to tell her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox fidgeted nervously, looking at the twin blue lakes that were his girlfriend's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So, do you want to talk or-\" Zorua couldn't finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed shook beneath him as the gigantic Celebi turned her head away, shifting on her other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gritted his teeth - he knew this was going to happen! He knew that if Celebi's mom stepped in it would have worsened things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk to me Celi!\" he exclaimed, receiving no reply but the sheer, uninterrupted silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Celebi... I still love you, you know it! It's just... it's hard, okay?\" he sourly admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi didn't even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You can do anything you want to me Celi. I know... you don't want to hurt me, you don't mean to humiliate me with the doll clothes, I don't know why you shrink my food, but seriously... it's how I feel Celi. I can't help it... what if I have to take an important decision, but that decision is made for me? This is what I'm afraid of... but, seriously Celi, I still love you...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small confession seemed to have an effect: Celebi twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy stared at the darkness of her room, silent, not quite knowing what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was she supposed to reply? Apologize to Zorua first? Counter his frustration with <i>her</i> frustration?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the pillow Zorua was resting on shook as his girlfriend turned around again; her eyes finally landed on him again as she stared at him, still wordless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua talked again, relieved that his girlfriend was at least still willing to look at him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Celebi... I want our relationship to go on, I really love you,\" after saying those words for three times, Zorua opened that the green giantess would open up a bit,<br>\r\n\"But... you need to understand me. I... I can't do anything... and whenever I ask you to grow me back, you simply won't... and I feel so powerless that... I feel like you don't care about my feelings, just how cute I look with that stupid bow.\" he admitted bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing honest was the best option here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi didn't talk throughout his whole speech, but simply took in all her boyfriend's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she finally talked,</span></div></div>",

It's me Celi,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy looked surprised for a moment, before her mind started to put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnhappy Zorua plus the sentence \u2018you're abusing your size-changing ability\u2019 could only mean one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi started laughing merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">SERIOUSLY Zorua?</span>\" she asked, struggling to control her laughter.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">All this speech about our relationship only because I make you wear doll clothes and shrink your food?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed as he turned around again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point!\" that was exactly the point.<br>\r\n\"... You force me to do things Celi! When I wanted to be big this morning, you didn't grow me because \u2018you'll have more fun like that\u2019!\" he exclaimed, Celebi's laughter ceasing as she looked at him with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't expect such outburst from Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox continued,<br>\r\n\"... I'm not saying that I mind being tiny Celi, but I mind if the decision of being big or small is made for me! It should be up to me, <i>not</i> you!\" he exclaimed, Celebi's jaw hanging open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince when Zorua started feeling like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox hung his head as he breathed heavily, inhaled and exhaled sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I know, doll clothes, shrunken food and the lack of sleep are all dumb things to complain about Celi... but I'm asking myself, \u2018What if I have to make an important decision, and that decision is made for me because I'm powerless to stop you from forcing me to do whatever you wish while I'm in such state?...\" he said in a much calmer tone, before sighing in what seemed exasperation.<br>\r\n\"... That's all. There's nothing more to say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type quieted down, clearly waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, after a few moments of being dumbfounded, Celebi gave hers.</span></div></div>",

You have feelings, and you're not my pet or anything like that.

You're my sweet little boyfriend, nothing of what we do - heh, <i>I</i> do - will make me forget that. I know, sometimes it may look like I don't care about how you feel or I might not ask for your opinion, but I always care for your feelings.</span>\" she finished reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Zorua felt tears in his eyes - Celebi's speech had touched him... but figuring that her seeing him crying would be the ultimate downfall of his already damaged reputation, Zorua hid his emotions behind his characteristic grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Thanks Celi,\" he said, feeling reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward, starting to nuzzle his girlfriend's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a lot better... I love you too...\" he whispered the last part, but it didn't escape the green fairy, who smiled brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy that Zorua told her how he felt, she felt like she had helped him getting rid of a crushing weight on his heart... and she got rid of her own crushing weight on her heart too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua had been her only boyfriend so far, and the only guy her mother approved... she couldn't risk losing him, not when their relationship was blossoming! And especially NOT because of some dumb doll clothes or some shrunken food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer paw started to stroke the fox gently as she rolled onto her back, readjusting her position upon noting that her arm hurt, probably having fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now Zorua, what do you say if we go back to sleep? It's quite late...</span>\" she said, empathizing her suggestion with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiled and leaned down, legs spread as his girlfriend hugged him to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Celi,\" he said, suddenly feeling drowsy.

She looked into her daughter's room to see her and Zorua sound asleep. She smiled to herself as she got ready to take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she left the two to their day as she greeted hers and the morning continued to pass without much fuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past few days had been...certainly odd. Her daughter had an unprecedented power...she befriended and reformed one of the most notorious local delinquents in town...and he turned out to not be a bad pokemon...a bit unsure of himself, and maybe more sensitive than he wanted to let on honestly from what she could tell. He was a good fit for her shut in daughter...and cared for her beyond what she could do, that was certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy for them. Almost reminded her of happier days herself...she shook her head and smiled, chuckling as she left the house in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed from that point and Celebi awoke with a yawn as she looked around...morning. She smiled a bit to herself as she went to rub the sleep from her eyes and noted the sleeping form of her tiny boyfriend. She gently set him on the bed and got up herself. She looked at him...still sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">This once Zorua...i'll let you sleep in.</span>\" She said quietly as she ventured out of her room to the silence of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really didn't mean anything by what she was doing to Zorua, it was gentle teasing to her...though she needed to keep the balance in mind too, it was very easy she supposed how he could misconstrue things in his position. He was small right now and...though she didn't want to say it outright to him, their power gap was rather large, and he knew that too. She didn't want to push him around or discount his feelings, but that was a very real thing that he could assume from his perspective. She was good about avoiding this kind of stuff with her friends, but this was before the size ability came into play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing she got herself a bowl of cereal. Today would be simple...just relaxing at home with her boyfriend. Maybe watch or read something...she MIGHT even let him watch something horror related...during the day, with the lights on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, she ate her bowl of cereal and flipped through a newspaper on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much, an article on Wigglytuff's disappearance and his...known deeds, and some stuff about Miltank's passing...that was sad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi finished up as she stretched a bit and went back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noted that Zorua was groggily waking up on his own and he looked up at his towering girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You let me sleep a bit longer.\" He noted and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I figured i'd let you do that today...I just want to let you know Zorua I do value what you want...and your feelings. I'm not...trying to push you around or anything, you know that, right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at her, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I know.\" He grinned and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Do you want to be normal sized for right now?</span>\" She asked and he contemplated it.</span></div></div>",

The dark-type almost choked from the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forced himself to swallow, before staring daggers at his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi didn't respond. She psychically grabbed the unfinished piece of meat, the half-drank glass of juice and remains of the egg and walked back into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back down on her chair, placing the curious Zorua beside her, setting the meat in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny fox blinked, confused, before shrugging and resuming eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi grabbed her book again, her head sinking into the pages again... and, she discovered, now she was able to read normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could that mean, she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remained silent for a while, Zorua chewing was the only sound that could be heard in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the fox eventually finished eating and patted his stomach with a paw, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked up from her book, gently closing it and eyeing Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Satisfied?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boyfriend nodded cheerfully, before asking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now Celi?...

Espurr had told him to not worry for her if he liked Celebi herself more than her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi?\" Zorua called her back to reality,<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" she must have been looking at the void for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hmm?

Zorua had a bad reputation... but such reputation had improved to some better one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, for the past few weeks, the pranks in the village mysteriously ceased and Zorua himself had changed... that was what Lopunny was telling around anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi's mom was unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to make sure Zorua was a good pokemon for her daughter.

No offense, but I'm not sure I can trust you.</span>\" the fairy bluntly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua closed his eyes, feeling uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"... It's understandable, miss. However, whatever you heard, it's true... I'm done with pranks...\" he said, before opening his eyes a bit, allowing himself to smile.<br>\r\n\"And it was because of Celebi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder fairy looked amused.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">My daughter? My daughter made you quit with pranks?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded happily... the memory of that fateful day was still fresh in his mind, and he was sure he was never going to forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain, blood, a broken paw... contributed to give him a house and a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see miss... your daughter had... helped me in a particularly rough situation...\" he admitted.<br>\r\n\"I-I... I couldn't help but... but fall in love with her...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom watched as Zorua's cheeks flared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fought back a smile - her sweet daughter had the power of making Zorua change. It was wonderful... however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay Zorua... how long have you two been together?</span>\" she asked, taking a step closer to the black fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... A while... one/two weeks I think...\" he sincerely answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonesty was the only thing that could help him... if he lied to the pink Celebi, he was sure that he wasn't going to see his girlfriend again... even worse, he was going to be thrown out of his new house!... Although, Celebi's mom didn't know about that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new doubt found its way inside the mind of the fox - did he have to tell that too? But... if he did, he would have to reveal about Celebi's powers, and he wasn't sure how her mother would take the news, which would be surely followed by her asking all sorts of questions about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped. The fairy in front of him noticed that the fox was getting nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Are you feeling alright?</span>\" she asked with a slight hint of concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded.<br>\r\n\"Anything else you want to ask, miss?\" he asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom pondered her next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua had already told when it happened and how it happened... now she had to make sure he was loyal to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua... listen, I need to know... do you truly like my daughter? Answer honestly, please.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type looked at her, before closing his eyes and opening his heart.<br>\r\n\"Miss... your daughter is the best thing that ever happened to me... she's sweet, funny, caring... so yes, I do truly like Celebi, and I would never dream of breaking her heart if that's what you're thinking.\" he said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink time traveler in front of him smiled brightly. There <i>was</i> passion in the little speech Zorua made... so, she assumed, he was being sincere... better for him if he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, she really couldn't think of anything else to ask. She was quite tempted to give the fox and her daughter her blessing and let them be together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one last question lingered in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua dear... one last question if you agree.</span>\" she said, smiling gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask miss... I'll be happy to answer.\" the fox responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Quite some time ago... in Celebi's room, there was a Zorua pokedoll...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood froze in the veins of the black fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Was that you?</span>\" the elder Celebi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua pondered lying... but decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes miss... that was me...\" he admitted, looking down and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom nodded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay... but I remember picking you up that day, and it was like I picked up a real pokedoll... how was that possible, young man?</span>\" she asked, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Zorua felt his blood freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't think about that - obviously Celebi's mother would have asked herself why a normal-sized pokemon could be picked up with two fingers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped as he looked up at the time traveler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps... was it the moment to reveal the truth?</span></div></div>",

Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n\"She did... but let's proceed in order.\" Zorua responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox took a deep breath as he psychologically prepared to tell his story. Celebi's mom noted that he was tensed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be something big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see miss... nearly two weeks ago, I pulled a prank on Celebi.\" he admitted.

Come again?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded.<br>\r\n\"Your daughter... can shrink... or grow things and living beings at will.\" he repeated to the shocked mother of his girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"...

Since when did she have shrinking powers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">A-And... what did she do to you?</span>\" she asked, eager to know the rest. It was getting quite late, but she didn't care - she had to continue... he had to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, bad memories filling his mind.<br>\r\n\"I... was shrunk down to a nanoscopic size I believe... everything was so big... Celebi was a planet...\" he recalled, struggling to keep gazing at the fairy in front of him.<br>\r\n\"... I don't quite know what she had in mind for me... I only know that I was suddenly threw far up in the sky... and when I landed, I felt pain... a lot... I was seriously injured miss...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom looked at him, dumbfounded... her sweet daughter did something like that, kidnapped and hurt a pokemon. Even though it seemed like he deserved it, this wasn't what she taught her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua seemed to sense the disappointment inside of the pink fairy... mostly because she suddenly glared back at the house, seemingly wanting to give her daughter a metaphorical earful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Don't think bad of your daughter, miss, it was an accident. I don't think Celebi could ever hurt anyone on purpose... unless she's truly angry.\" Zorua quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom looked at him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Go on.</span>\" she simply said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded, feeling like this was going to be even more awkward.<br>\r\n\"... After I got hurt, Celebi healed me and sent me back in my forest.\" he said. Celebi's mom looked confused.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Wait, don't you mean \u2018home\u2019?</span>\" she asked. Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n\"No... I'm homeless miss...\" the elder time traveler looked at him pitifully after the revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's the point of the situation. Your daughter visited me a few days later, learning that I don't have anywhere to live but my forest... she suggested I went with her... in your house. On one condition though - I had to be tiny. Not nanoscopic again, the size of a small doll... the one you picked up a few days ago. I've been living with you two since then.\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mother looked shocked again. The dark type fox nodded.<br>\r\n\"And that's when... when I started to have feelings for her. I called Celebi my best friend, I called what she did to me a blessing, I... I confessed my feelings in a quite awkward situation...\" he recalled the sleepover he had one week ago, Espurr and Gardevoir overhearing behind the front door of the house he and the pink Celebi were outside of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Celebi's mom, now she wore a look of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... One last question. Then I'll decide.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Ask miss... but keep in mind - I've been telling the truth so far.\" he responded. Celebi's mom mentally smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I appreciate it... now Zorua, why didn't you or Celebi tell me sooner about... everything?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss... can I ask you something now? Would you have approved our relationship back then? Do you approve it now that you know everything?\" he asked, looking ready to explode. The tension was killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom went quiet. She had to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she approve this relationship? Or did she not? Zorua answered to her questions with sincerity, she could tell that... but Celebi had done terrible things, and lied to her own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she and Zorua himself had technically lied to her, not telling her what had been going on for a whole week...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... Zorua seemed truly reformed now, and he and Celebi were in love...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she have the heart to break theirs over a few lies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Zorua again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, she gave her ultimate answer.</span></div></div>",

Better to save the sweet words for when Celebi's mom was going to find out about his girlfriend: her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom sighed.

Will I have to grow him, shrink him when school is done only to grow him back the next morning? For how long?</span>\" even to Zorua, that seemed like a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smirked. That was one good idea of what she was going to do to Zorua when she was going to school, shrinking him if he wasn't tiny already - and she doubted it - only to stuff him in her backpack, taking him out for lunch and when school was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that Zorua was going to hate, she thought with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll...\" the dark-type fox quieted down, discovering that he had nothing to counter with. It was no surprise, Celebi was really smart after all, her logic surely enough beat his. But, still, this was for Azurill, his new friend, he had to convince her. If <i>he</i> couldn't, who could have done it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed - this called for extreme measures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at his girlfriend with big, puppy-dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Celi, do it, he'll be fine, Lopunny will take care of him, we'll all do, <b>please please please</b>...\" Gardevoir repeated his words at the end, hands clasped together, red eyes gleaming with a sad spark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed - stupid puppy-dog eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I... want to make sure Azurill and Lopunny are fine with this first.</span>\" she meekly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua and Gardevoir grinned - the battle was won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill and Lopunny totally agreed to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, let's go then!\" Zorua cheered as Gardevoir opened the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither she came in that moment or she was there the whole time, because the pink Celebi didn't draw any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second, before her mom opened her mouth to talk, Celebi wondered if she had heard anything of what they said.</span></div></div>",

Celebi saved her.\" Zorua said, his girlfriend internally thanking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Why Zorua is here, like he had for quite some time. You said he pranked you and you took his \u2018punishment\u2019 too far. That doesn't explain pretty much anything.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger fairy looked up and opened her mouth, but no sound came out, her words unable to leave her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was me, ma'am.\" Zorua chimed in, causing the pink giantess to look down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After she... punished me, Celebi came into my forest for... some reason. We were already friends more or less and she... she discovered that I have no one and nowhere to go.\" that story had the power of making anyone sympathize with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot as much as the \u2018broken leg\u2019 story though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, the mother of his girlfriend softened all of a sudden, looking at him with pity. Though the disappointment didn't leave her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... And so, I asked him if he wanted to come with me and he agreed.</span>\" Celebi finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">A heartwarming story.</span>\" she commented before placing both her paws on the table and standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Now... I want to know... what is going on between you and this tiny pokemon in front of me?</span>\" she said, before looking at Zorua,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You said that my daughter is your best friend?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">HEY!</span>\" Celebi cried, looking at her boyfriend sternly. That before she realized her mistake and placed both her paws on her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom smirked. Zorua looked at Celebi, flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I must assume that there's more than simple friendship between you two then.</span>\" she concluded, feeling something between happy and disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daughter was dating someone, which made her happy; her daughter was dating Zorua, which made her disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi began muttering incomprehensible words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... There's no denying that now Celi...</span>\" Zorua sourly revealed, his girlfriend looking at him dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Really sweetie? Why didn't you tell me sooner?</span>\" her mom continued, softening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I didn't know how you would have taken it...</span>\" Celebi admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cppink\">Quite frankly, I don't know either...</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You know I only want to protect you...</span>\" her mom said, looking at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celebi met her mother's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Protect me? From Zorua? He's harmless, and a true sweetheart!</span>\" she exclaimed, causing her boyfriend to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please mom... let him stay, he makes me so happy...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling's mutual.\" Zorua spoke, and the green fairy hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom stared at the scene... and her heart finally seemed to melt. A mother <i>always</i> wants the happiness of her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was <i>Zorua</i> they were talking about... could she really trust him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, there were the other things too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">...

This had to be a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wonderful, lucid dream, one she didn't want to wake up from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, reality hit the green time-traveler when both her mom and her boyfriend nodded their heads: this was no dream, this all was happening for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Thanks mom!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi found herself being physically assaulted by her green daughter as the younger time-traveler hugged her. She smiled as she returned the gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would a really adorable scene to watch, if it wasn't for the poor Zorua, who was in the middle of the hug, being squeezed between the two Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi... ma'am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giantesses quickly broke the hug, giggling sheepishly while Zorua gasped for air. Something that didn't result too easy for the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, before his lungs could pop out of his ribcage, the two time-travelers broke the hug, leaving him into his girlfriend's paws, red-faced, his mouth opening and closing as he desperately tried to fill his lungs with fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hehe, whoops...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sorry sweetie...</span>\" her mom added sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua waved a paw in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's go in my - our - room Zorua, before dinner... we'll spend some time alone~,</span>\" Celebi sang, causing Zorua's tail to start wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the elder time-traveler had another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... What do you say if we do something together instead?</span>\" she suggested, before hastily explaining upon noticing the look on the couple's faces,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'd like to spend some time with the both of you... honey, I've been quite distant these days... plus, I need to keep an eye on both of you. To prevent funny stuff going on between you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe declaration made Celebi flush bright red and Zorua snicker nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger fairy decided to let it slide, and focused on Zorua, who shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sounds good?\" he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom smiled, but said nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she turned around and disappeared into the kitchen, leaving her confused daughter and her even-more-confused boyfriend behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder time-traveler returned a few minutes later, telekinetically holding a plate of food, two steaming cups and a third cup filled with a dark liquid, small bubbles rising and popping in mid-air; Zorua identified it as soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food and drinks were set on a coffee table in between the TV and the couch, where Celebi's mom sat, motioning for her daughter to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi did as told and sat down next to her mom while she psychically switched off the lights, turning on the TV, which projected a sinister shadow on the wall behind the three pokemon as it enlightened the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We can watch a movie.</span>\" the pink Celebi declared with a smile. The green Celebi smiled too, while Zorua stared at the TV attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething told him that he wasn't going to like this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's suppositions turned out to be quite true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after two full hours of being forced to watch a romantic movie with the two fairies (Celebi kept crying all the time; although she hid it pretty well, her mom couldn't stop a few tears from glistening her eyes) he was finally being carried back into Celebi's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Seriously?!\" he screamed, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That was easily one of the best movies I've seen, Zorua,</span>\" Celebi mused, one of her paws leaving the fox as she wiped her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair of the movie had rejected the beautiful Milotic to stay with his love, Altaria. A scene that Zorua wanted to get rid of badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi climbed in her bed, and the lights were turned off by psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy smiled as she heard the door of her mother's room shutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm so happy Zorua...</span>\" she said, kissing the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... me too...\" he said, and Celebi gleefully took notice that he was smiling despite his embarrassed behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well then... goodnight Zorua. Sleep tight.</span>\" she said, readjusting the fox on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type nuzzled himself into his giant girlfriend, getting comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you too Celi,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon closed their eyes and, soon, they both fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Rise and shine Zorua!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type hazily opened his eyes, letting out a sound between a drowsy yawn and an annoyed sigh, before finding himself face-to-body with his gigantic girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What time is it?\" he sleepily asked, while a green finger gently petted his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">About 9 AM, Zorua.</span>\" Celebi giggled while Zorua groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nice as she could be after the incident, Celebi had a thing for forcing the poor fox out of bed too early in the morning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So? What's the plan for today?\" he asked, attempting to change subject to avoid him or her getting annoyed in a fight over his right to sleep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He leaned into the lips as much as he could, and tried to kiss back, his face flush red at this point, as he enjoyed the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi for her part felt him kiss back and started blushing herself...it was such an odd sensation though, having a doll sized pokemon as a boyfriend kissing her like this.

He was with his mom again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran to her, wanting to hug her... but his body went right through hers. Azurill fell on the ground, before hastily getting back to his feet and looking at the Azumarill in front of him, who gave him a sad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Azurill... my sweet, sweet child...</span>\" she said, her voice making Azurill cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Mom...</span>\" Azurill repeated as he sniffled. She nodded... before her smile dropped.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Azurill... dearie, why did you do that? Why did you want to end your life?</span>\" she asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small mouse cried.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I couldn't... I didn't want to be a doll, mom! They were treating me like one just because of Zorua! H-He called me a coward!... I wanted to see you again...</span>\" he whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Azumarill's expression didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I didn't give you life for you to waste it.</span>\" she lectured, causing Azurill to look up, tears rolling down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzumarill continued,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Azurill... I'm highly disappointed with you... you didn't have to try such thing!</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Well... doesn't m-matter n-now, right? I-I'm dead...</span>\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his mom smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">No dearie, you're not dead... you're luckily still alive...</span>\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill felt a pain in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt... didn't work... he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And you should be grateful for it, young man,</span>\" his mom scolded, making him cry harder.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">M-Mom...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Azurill, listen to me,</span>\" Azumarill said, her paws clasping.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Don't do that again my sweet child... you're so young, live your life, be happy... you must live for me too... I'll always be with you, no matter what,</span>\" she said as she stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Azurill's wish came true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hugged her, hugged as hard as he could, crying into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe too cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Now go sweet child... it's time for you to return where you belong, back to the living...</span>\" she said, hugging harder.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And... try giving Zorua a chance... you might find that he truly changed...</span>\" she told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a smile, Azumarill released her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tears rolled down Azurill's cheeks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Mom...</span>\" he told, when his surroundings started shaking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Azurill looked at his mother... but found that she was fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue mouse cried harder.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">M-Mom! I... I love you!</span>\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzumarill smiled, her lips moved... but Azurill didn't register the sound...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill's eyes shot wide open as he woke up from what seemed an endless slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, like someone was whispering in his ear, he heard a voice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clblue\">Mom loves you too my wonderful child.</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill hastily looked around with his vision blurry.

Celebi, Espurr, Buneary, Braixen and Zorua were staring at him with concern, the last from his usual perch behind the paws of Celebi. Oddly, he too looked concerned... but quickly adopted a neutral expression once he noted that Azurill was staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue mouse noted he was resting on top of Celebi's bed, a bandage wrapped around his head. Azurill grunted as he felt a lingering ache in his temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...

I'm sure you won't try again, am I right Azurill?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, for the first time since he woke up, Azurill finally responded by nodding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Mom...

He gladly accepted it, and drank slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Azurill, know that we're highly disappointed... true, Zorua did wrong by not accepting your apology - though he had a good reason - but you didn't have to attempt suicide!</span>\" she scolded as the tiny mouse drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe signaled that he had enough water, and Celebi removed the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill took a moment to swallow, before looking at Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Speaking of... do you accept his apologies now, Zorua?</span>\" she asked, looking up at the dark type, who eyed Azurill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room but Azurill sighed in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" Celebi said as she frowned. But the fox was firmer than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Celebi, no \u2018Zorua\u2019. I can't simply accept an apology coming from a pokemon who apologized only because he hoped to get away from Buneary!\" he said, indignantly as he turned his head away from the mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His apology wasn't sincere, and I won't accept it. This is my last say, Celebi, and if you, or anyone else, is got something to say against me, just grow me back and I'm outta here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked up, shocked. For a moment, she couldn't help but admire her boyfriend, who had fiery eyes. He was right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one spoke after Zorua's outburst - they all knew he had all the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed dejectedly as she looked back down at Azurill.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm sorry Azurill... there's nothing I... we can do for you... We can't force Zorua to change his opinion...</span>\" she told, before quickly adding,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But you... can't deny he's right... you weren't totally sincere... please, don't try to commit suicide again...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzurill simply sighed, not caring about Zorua's refusal of his apologies. He had to give him a chance like his mom asked... but he'd take some time before apologizing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the fox was indignant, and apologizing again would end with another refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I won't... I don't want to die.</span>\" he said.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Mom wants me to live. And I WILL live.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at Espurr, the simple action of her turning her head causing Zorua to be thrown off his perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught him in her paws, him slightly startled, but maintaining his firm expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Espurr?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I don't know.</span>\" that wasn't something Espurr told very often.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">His mind is in an inordinate state... I don't know what he will do in the near future.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed, before her gaze traveled to Buneary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Buneary...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

And it doesn't make what you've done any less wrong.</span>\" Azurill didn't raise his voice, didn't scream or cry, he simply stated it all in an even tone.

The kid might have a point...but right now, emotions and tension was raw and he frankly didn't feel like hashing this out right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid...let's save this talk for another time.\" And with that silence overtook the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Celebi and Buneary returned. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So...it's fine for her to stay over tonight.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Yeah, mom just wants me home early tomorrow.</span>\" The bunny smiled.

There was no denying that now, Zorua was discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he would be thrown out he was lucky. As for Celebi herself... she didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi inhaled sharply in disappointment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well... I think I deserve an explanation. Why is the most infamous pokemon of the village tiny and in your room pretending to be a pokedoll?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua meekly looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Celebi tensed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Because he's not infamous anymore mom.</span>\" she quietly said, earning a curious look from her surprisingly calm mother.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua here... went through something bad. I... I helped him.</span>\" Celebi recalled the moment she healed his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat moment, their friendship and successive relationship started... although Celebi was very careful to leave such details out of her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older time traveler blinked, her gaze landing on Zorua.<br>\r\n\"... Hi, ma'am...\" he meekly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Is that true, Zorua?</span>\" she asked softly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Did you change?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded.<br>\r\n\"Yes... no more pranks...\" he told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay.</span>\" she said, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That's very nice of you, and it's nice that you helped him Celebi... but none of these things does actually respond to my questions. Why is he tiny? Why is he here?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I... I shrunk him...</span>\" Celebi admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Since when you have shrinking abilities...?</span>\" she asked, confused.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Remember that TM Gardevoir gave me?</span>\" Celebi responded, looking at her desk with glowing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pen shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi looked at it with confusion, before looking back at the two pokemon on the bed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Okay?... On to the second question... why is he here...?</span>\" she asked, deciding to just accept what she saw without an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi bit her lip, before opening her mouth to speak... but Zorua preceded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...\" he nervously cleared his throat as the pink giantess looked at him.<br>\r\n\"I really had... I really had no place to stay ma'am... Celebi discovered, and she offered me to stay here...\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom looked at him with a mix of pity and mistrust.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You... are you homeless?</span>\" she asked, searching for a confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink time traveler looked at Celebi on the bed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Celebi...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she snapped out of a trance, Celebi clasped her paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please mom-don't throw him out-let him stay-I'll take care of him-you won't even see him-please please please please-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Celebi!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the green fairy went quiet as she looked at her mother pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Let me understand - Zorua is not a scoundrel anymore because you helped him, and he's tiny because you shrunk him and suggested he came living into our house because he's actually homeless?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi meekly nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

She gently picked him up and set him on her lap.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Say Zorua...</span>\" she started, gently starting to pet the small dark type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? About those rules?\" he interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No pranks, no weird stuff - that's debatable~ - and make each other happy...</span>\" she repeated cheerfully, before getting to the point.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, do you want to hang out with me and my mom tomorrow?

I know it seems simple, but it takes a lot out of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it apparently failed as Celebi merely grinned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Whoever talked about me carrying a doll? I'll be carrying the REAL you, cutie~</span>\" she responded, gripping Zorua and laying down on her bed, her long green arms holding Zorua far up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blinked.<br>\r\n\"...

Zorua. Dinner!</span>\" Celebi's mom called from out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Coming mom!</span>\" the fairy says, grabbing her tiny boyfriend and heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shook HER Zorua as she tried to wake him up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua~ wake up~ we're going out~</span>\" she sang cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua groaned in his sleep, but managed to cling to his dream and remain asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on, roomie~ we've got a day of fun ahead of us~</span>\" the fairy said, leaning down to peck his cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing her mom entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi watched her daughter kissing Zorua... and smiled.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cppink\">Kids.</span></i>\u2019 she thought as she saw Celebi trying to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a smirk on her face and moved forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi cries in surprise as a pink arm suddenly pushes her aside.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Out of bed!</span>\" her mom exclaimed, causing Zorua to make a leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" he cried in alert as he turned around to see a snickering pink Celebi and his startled girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older fairy looked at the two pokemon.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well? Breakfast is ready you two. We're heading out in half an hour~</span>\" she told cheerfully while exiting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blinked a few times, before looking down at Zorua, who was looking perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy shook her head and smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good morning~</span>\" she said, pecking him on a cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed, but smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin'...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Anyway, are you coming with us like that... or do you want to be normal sized, Zorua?</span>\" Celebi asked her boyfriend as she and her mom sat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink fairy sipped coffee from a steaming cup she was holding.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Honestly, I think you should remain like that... to prevent funny ideas.</span>\" she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm done with funny ideas, ma'am.\" Zorua meekly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Celebi didn't share her mom's opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What do you think would happen if someone saw him like that?</span>\" she asked while chewing a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">He brought that on himself...</span>\" her mom told, before giving the small fox a sympathetic smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">...

He was vulnerable at this size...incredibly vulnerable, and he knew that if he went out like this, Celebi and her mom would probably be stopping at a doll shop to tease him or buy another accessory. He'd also probably end up wearing the damn bow. He hated that bow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he also pondered the other end of it. Who wasn't vulnerable? Celebi and her mom. He imagined that they'd probably be enough to keep him from harm, hell, probably be enough to make anyone think twice on implying anything too. It was also what Celebi's mom wanted which...he was quickly learning just how in charge she really was. The happier he made her he figured, the better. Plus, he also got to be the lazy one this way, he wouldn't be walking around all day like this. Eventually he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Celebi, I can remain like this while we're out and about.\" He said and the older Celebi smiled. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I think that's for the best.</span>\" And the younger Celebi shrugged. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">If you're sure Zorua...then okay.</span>\" She then grinned at the little Zorua. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">But that means I need to get you dressed for the day~</span>\" She said snickering as Zorua gave her a deadpan look. \"I thought that thing was to hide me from your mom and didn't have any other purpose?\" He said and she snickered again. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah right.</span>\" She said as she got up and the older Celebi smiled as well. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay you two, just be quick.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed from Celebi's grip as they went around town. He HATED this bow, but he supposed in the long run it was a small price to pay really. The two giants had been eyeing different shops, clothes, cosmetics, sweets, etc. etc. he had kinda lost track at some point. He almost felt like he was dragged along as an afterthought with the two fairies enthusiastically talking to each other about girl stuff that he had no context, desire, or motivation to engage with. Eventually though he was dragged into the conversation. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So Zorua, how do you think this would look on me?</span>\" Celebi asked as she showed him a pink hat. \"Um...like you wearing a hat?\" And the older Celebi face palmed. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh dear...</span>\" She muttered and the younger Celebi just looked at him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, you really are clueless.</span>\" She sighed as she put the hat back. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's alright, you'll pick up on it sooner or later.</span>\" He didn't know what he had done, but apparently it was something? Celebi however, just smirked. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Here, i'll show you how you're SUPPOSED to answer~</span>\" She said as the older Celebi followed her daughter down to a shop a little ways away before smiling. '<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, I see...</span>' And Zorua saw the shop before he started struggling. \"Not again! Not again!\" He said as they entered the pokedoll shop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi, no...\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But it's adorable~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am...\" He meekly tried before the older Celebi shrugged at him, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You need to learn somehow young man.</span>\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned as he tried to shake off the sailor hat that Celebi had attached to his head, but he couldn't shake it off on his own, it was strapped around his head and his paws gave him no way of unstrapping it. \"At least tell me you aren't buying it...\" He said and Celebi just smiled at him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Of course I am~</span>\" She giggled and he just groaned again. So now he was stuck with a bow AND this dumb hat! It didn't help that he felt like eyes were on him now that he wasn't even really trying to hide. No one had bugged him he'd found, but it didn't stop the fact that he, Zorua, the baddest pokemon around, the raddest of the rad from HIS forest, the pokemon you don't mess with!...was here, out in the open, with two giggling girly fairies the size of a doll, wearing a <i>cute~</i> blue bow and an <i>adorable~</i> sailor hat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Celebi paid for the hat and Zorua found himself rocking two accessories. There was no way he would be able to show his face to certain pokemon again at this rate...Celebi looked at him and her mom smiling. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey, i've got an idea! Why don't we go see a movie!</span>\" She said and the older Celebi smiled. \"<span class=\"cppink\">That sounds fun, what about you Zorua?</span>\" And he seemed to shrug. \"Sure...at least it'll be dark in there.\" He said making the two girls giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No Zorua.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but...\" He was staring longingly at the poster of the Haunter holding his claw over the head of a scared Hoppip, but the older Celebi was putting her foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Zorua...what's the rating on that movie?</span>\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Adult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And what are you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...A young adult?\" He offered as the older pokemon looked at him. He was defeated he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom, Zorua, what about this one?</span>\" They heard as Celebi was looking at a poster of a Jynx and Bewear hugging. The older Celebi came over smiling. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, Lopunny was telling me about this one, she said her and Buneary liked it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a chick flick!\" Zorua complained making the two girls giggle. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Come on, let's go get three tickets.</span>\" She said as they approached the ticket booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I really...really...thought it was just okay.</span>\" Celebi shrugged as they were back out, noting that it was getting later in the afternoon. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I quite enjoyed it, what about you Zorua, how did you like it?</span>\" The older pokemon asked as Celebi giggled. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I think I can tell you how much HE liked it.</span>\" She said as she showed her mom the sleeping Zorua in her paws. The older pokemon laughed at this. \"<span class=\"cppink\">He must have adored it!</span>\" They both laughed until they noticed that a pokemon was approaching them...and quickly, the pokemon seemed to be eyeing the sleeping Zorua too. It was...</span></div></div>",

Let's see what he does.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff smirked... before his smirk shrank into a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh... do you think I could have a word with him...? You know... tell him to leave my kids alone?</span>\" he asked with methodical gentleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi backed up. Her mother didn't move of an inch.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">He's asleep, I'm sorry. But... if you tell me, I'll make sure to deliver your message when he wakes up.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh no... I have to say this myself... make sure he gets the gist... let me wake him up, tell him a few words, and then I'll be leaving if you don't mind...</span>\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi shook her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No... and excuse me for telling, but I think that you don't want to \u2018talk\u2019 to him...</span>\" she frankly told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff's smile dropped.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why are you protecting him, Celebi? I don't know why he's tiny, I don't care, I just want to make sure he stays away from my kids... and from the village - he's not wanted here.</span>\" he said, his gentle voice assuming its characteristic gruff tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom smirked, her daughter watching from distance with Zorua hugged tightly to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">...

That black runt is and will always be a menace, Celebi... now, PLEASE...</span>\" he looked at the green Celebi, who gripped Zorua tighter.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hand him over.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, right then, the fox started to regain consciousness. His eyes slowly opened as he looked around.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">C-Celi...?</span>\" he asked as he yawned, before looking forward, spotting the pink Celebi and Wigglytuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Wigglytuff...\" he yawned, before his eyes shot open.<br>\r\n\"Wigglytuff?!\" he shouted in terror, before Celebi covered his mouth with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large bunny looked at him, having heard his annoying voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh... you're awake...</span>\" he told with a glare as he stepped forward.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Listen close you runt, you-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom fluttered in front of him, placing a paw on his stomach, halting him while causing him to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, there was no one watching, Celebi noted.

He could squeeze the life out of him if he could just get to him! But he knew that he was no match for...either Celebi that was there, let alone both at once. The older Celebi narrowed her eyes. \"<span class=\"cpink\">All he's gonna do is go back to his same old shtick the first chance he gets! Pokemon like him don't change!</span>\" Wigglytuff tried to say, almost pleading for them to hand him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">He won't do anything like that again, not on my watch. If you'd like to discuss apologies to the kids i'd be more than happy to oblige, but while you stand here implying threats and throw around accusations you will have no business with us.

She smiled. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Now that we're done with that sorry business...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The movie?\" Zorua earned a stern look from both of the Celebi's for that before she continued. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Why don't we go get some ice cream kids?</span>\" Celebi looked at her mom. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Really mom, we're not little, we don't ne-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, she speaks for herself and I am little so yes, I would like to get ice cream.\" Zorua interrupted, making Celebi sigh and the older Celebi smile and chuckle a bit. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Come on, it'll be fun Celi, how long has it been since we had a day like this where we finished it with ice cream?</span>\" And Celebi flushed red. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Since I was little...</span>\" But she was outvoted she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The biggest mint chocolate chip they have! That's what i'm after!\" Zorua stated with Celebi looking at him. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're getting a small.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What do you mean why?! Zorua, do you THINK you could eat the biggest they have like that!?</span>\" And Zorua tilted his head at her. \"I know I could.\" And Celebi sighed. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">And when you do finish one at that size I promise to come to your funeral, but for today it's a small.</span>\" And Zorua gave up. The older Celebi was listening to all of this and smiling, shaking her head as they approached the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Go ahead and sit down you two. Mint chocolate chip for you Zorua? And I already know what you want Celi~</span>\" Her mom said teasingly as she approached the counter and Celebi set Zorua down on the counter before slowly burying her head in her hands. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So embarrassing...</span>\" She muttered and Zorua snickered. \"Glad to hear it!\" He said, at least happy that he wasn't alone right now as he wore the hat and bow, his eyes slowly drifted out the window they were sitting at to see...Swinub? He was looking in the window longingly it almost looked like, not even noticing the tiny Zorua. \"Hey Celi, check it out.\" Zorua said as she looked out. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh hey...</span>\" She said as her mom came back from ordering. \"<span class=\"cppink\">They'll bring it over in a few minutes.</span>\" She said smiling as she sat in the booth, seeing them both looking out the window. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, Swinub? What's he doing I wonder...</span>\" The older Celebi mused. \"Probably wants ice cream but can't afford it.\" Zorua stated simply. The older Celebi got an idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hey Zorua, he's one of the kids you pranked right?</span>\" She said, almost sternly and he winced. \"Uh...y-yeah. He's actually probably one of my biggest victims honestly...I dropped him down a pit and left him down there for hours...eventually I accidentally dropped Munchlax on him...\" Zorua muttered before finishing. \"Won't do it again! Never again!\" And the older Celebi nodded. \"<span class=\"cppink\">I should hope not...here, i'll be right back.</span>\" She said as she got up to step out of the booth. '<span class=\"cppink\">Pokemon can't change, huh Wigglytuff? That's an awful lesson to teach kids.</span>' she thought '<span class=\"cppink\">And I won't let you teach it.</span>' \"What is she...?\" Zorua wondered before he saw her on the other end of the window, crouching down and smiling at the young Swinub. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">If I know my mom, which I do, she's inviting him to eat ice cream with us and make you apologize to him.</span>\" Celebi stated simply and Zorua looked out before narrowing his eyes. \"Seriously? That kid is scared of his own shadow...he's gonna book when he sees me, regardless of size.\" Zorua stated. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well...just saying what she's doing.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the older Celebi was leading the little pokemon into the shop. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">U-um...are you sure miss?</span>\" They heard the timid voice say. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Of course, just come over to our table, someone has something he'd like to say to you.</span>\" They heard the kind voice of Celebi's mom say. And soon Zorua felt the presence of Swinub down below. Slowly, he approached the edge of the counter to look down at him. \"Um...hey, Swinub...\" He said and he saw the giant to him kid start to shake like a leaf. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Z-z-zorua...Wh-wh-</span>\" Swinub was very nervous before the older Celebi gently put a hand on him. \"<span class=\"cppink\">It's okay, he won't do anything. In fact, I think the only thing he could do right now is captain a toy boat.</span>\" She joked, hoping to calm the young pokemon down as he looked at Zorua flushing red with the sailor hat. Swinub seemed to relax a little. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Here, why don't you eat ice cream with us, our treat, and Zorua can tell you what he wants to tell you, okay?</span>\" She said gently as Swinub looked down. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">I-I don't know...</span>\" He said and Zorua sighed. \"Come on, dude, it's free ice cream...you don't want to pass that up, right?\" He said, trying to reassure the kid.</span></div></div>",

He merely wanted to apologize, and I swear I saw him doing it with sincerity...</span>\" Celebi's mom stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Wigglytuff dropped his smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I just saw you through the window, and Swinub is one of my kids, so I think I know what I'm saying when I tell him to stay away from...</span>\" he made a gesture for Zorua, who was watching from Celebi's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink fairy remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And quite frankly... I don't know why you're protecting him. He hurt so many pokemon...</span>\" Wigglytuff continued, struggling to not lose his temper, knowing who he was talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting on Celebi's nerves was dangerous; getting on her mom's nerves was lethal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi folded her arms.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Learn to forgive, Wigglytuff... He showed that he has a good heart, and that's enough for me.</span>\" she said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinub moved beside the bunny.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Yeah... he apologized... he's nice now...</span>\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff decided he heard enough. He stepped towards Swinub and grabbed his paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let's go... we'll talk at home.</span>\" he said, before glaring at Zorua.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And you... just pray I never catch you alone at that size... or you're going to pa-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mom floated in midair to grip Wigglytuff's chest.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Leave. My. Kids. Alone.</span>\" she hissed through gritted teeth as she let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigglytuff growled, before starting to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Thanks miss... bye Zorua... bye Celebi...</span>\" he said, Wigglytuff speeding up as he heard his words. The duo disappeared past a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then, the pink Celebi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked bemused.<br>\r\n\"\u2018Leave my kids alone\u2019...?\" he asked to the giantess holding him, who gave a beaming smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's a good sign, Zorua! It means she took a liking to you!</span>\" Celebi said, leaning down to peck his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mother turned around and smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Kids? What do you say if we go home too?</span>\" she asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded and got up, adjusting Zorua's position in her paws as she walked alongside her mom out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it kinda early?\" Zorua pointed out, looking at the sky. It was sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No Zorua... we wouldn't want someone else to bother us, would we?</span>\" she said as her daughter got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Celebi gently petted the dark type.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You know, young one, you were honest... you truly changed... The way you apologized to Swinub was perfect,</span>\" she complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, ma'am...\" Zorua responded  awkwardly, causing the pink Celebi to adopt a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You know you two, I'm happy... I think you and my daughter make a cute couple too...</span>\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom!</span>\" Celebi cried in embarrassment. Her mother giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Come on... let us go home...</span>\" she said as she started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at Zorua, smiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You did it, Zorua... you managed to get on mom's good side...</span>\" she said sweetly, leaning to kiss his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did ya expect otherwise?\" he told with a grin, making Celebi giggle as she followed her mother on the road to their house.</span></div></div>",

This might just be a good thing. Her daughter, though she worried about some kind of boy going after her to take advantage of her legendary status...it seemed to be a moot point with Zorua...Zorua of all pokemon, and she seemed genuinely happy with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing seemed to be making Zorua mellow out too, which could only be good for the village. Maybe she should try to help Zorua make peace in his own way...Wigglytuff certainly wouldn't help matters, but his voice didn't resound with EVERYONE in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mom, you alright? You seem to be zoning out...</span>\" Celebi asked as she looked to the pink legendary who shook her head. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, don't worry about it...just thinking about stuff...I need to work tomorrow kids, but I want you to know...I want to do this again sometime, don't you~</span>\" She said cheerfully and Celebi nodded her head and Zorua looked up from her paws and nodded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as we can skip the movies...and the shopping...\" He said making both of the girls giggle as they started to approach the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">See, it wasn't so bad, right?</span>\" Celebi said to the tiny pokemon standing on the bathroom sink as Celebi got ready to brush her teeth, to his surprise Celebi lowered a towering toothbrush down to him and he blinked as he looked at it. \"What...?\" He asked and he saw the toothbrush shrink down to his size. It seemed to have a paw grip for him as a quadruped too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I got it when we were shopping...I know you weren't paying attention, but if you're going to stay with us you should take care of yourself.</span>\" Celebi said as she put some toothpaste on her brush and the tiniest dab on his. He blushed as he looked at it, and picked it up gingerly. He looked up to see Celebi using the brush now and he looked to his again. He started to rub it in his mouth, against his canines and he winced at the taste of the paste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept going though, not wanting to disappoint Celebi, and she did buy this for him...and that lame bow he was stuck with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Celebi was sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of tea as she considered the day, the kids had gone to bed a bit ago and she smiled a bit to herself before she had to get ready for bed, she looked in the door at the kids one last time, Celebi nestling the tiny lump of black fur to her chest that could only be Zorua, she frowned a bit when she saw him though, he looked to be...shivering? And that's when she heard the cough from him too, tiny imperceptible squeaks almost, but she heard it, and it sounded pretty hoarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh dear...</span>\" She muttered as she went to the kitchen to prepare something, and left a note before she herself went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Zorua felt like his head was on fire as he woke up, blearily looking around and he felt an intense chill go through his body. His throat felt hoarse and lumpy and he looked around to see it was still dark out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celi...\" He muttered, his voice cracking and weak as he struggled against her grip. \"Cele-\" His voice was cut off by his coughs, now much louder and he felt his girlfriend stirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...what time is it?</span>\" She asked, drowsiness evident in her voice as she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\" He started coughing again and Celebi blinked before looking at him and gasping. He was shivering and the temperature of his body felt much warmer, he also looked a bit pale in the face and his nose looked far slicker than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked at him sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're sick.</span>\" She said simply and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I know, it's happened from time to time.\" Zorua said and Celebi looked at him sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's because you don't take care of yourself...</span>\" She said and Zorua nodded. \"Well, I didn't have the means really...\" His voice definitely sounded different, congested too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll be right back, okay?</span>\" She said gently as she removed him from her belly and paws and set him on her bed, covering him with sheets as she went to the kitchen to find a note with a bit of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\"><span class=\"cppink\">I saw that Zorua was sick last night when I checked on you. Here is some money for medicine. There's soup in the fridge that can be reheated. Had to go to work, will talk when I get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove you<br>\r\n             Mom</span></div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked in the fridge to see the chilled bowl, and to see some juice as well. She smiled a bit as she prepared the stuff, and went back to her room to check on Zorua, he almost seemed to be falling asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay Zorua, don't worry, some soup is heating up and then i'll go get you medicine in a bit when the store opens, okay?</span>\" Celebi gently said and Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what? We going out today?\" He asked and Celebi blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No way buster! You're staying in bed.</span>\" Celebi said and Zorua groaned but didn't argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair 'nuff...\" He said, and at that, sleep claimed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi considered waking him for the soup, but figured she'd wait until he was ready to eat it. She at least went to get a glass of water so that it'd be ready for him when he woke up.</span></div></div>",

E-Eh?\"</span> Gardevoir stammers, shocked by Zorua's blunt statement, before adopting a very excited tone, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Really?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Shh!\"</span> Zorua tries to calm the giant Gardevoir down before she wakes up the entire house, <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"She doesn't know it! Heck... I didn't even realize it until just now!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"You didn't... Realize it?\"</span> Gardevoir repeats quietly with an expression of confusion, one which in some ways reflected Zorua's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Look, I... Always got kind of nervous around her,\"</span> Zorua explains with a dejected voice, <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"But everyone did! I figured I was just being creeped out! She's a total creep, she stares at people and says weird things!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"That doesn't sound very romantic,\"</span> Gardevoir points out while sounding disappointed and looking over the kitchen to make sure they were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"It wasn't. The only reason I didn't prank her was because I was legitimately afraid of what she'd do to me,\" </span>Zorua continues with a shrug, feeling his fracture stinging with the trials and tribulations leading him to this point, <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"But after I got this small... And my life was literally in her hands... She didn't lecture me. She didn't make me do horrible tasks. She just... Wanted to protect me from more harm.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir could tell Zorua was blushing now, because her Synchronize ability made her blush as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"It was kind of... Cute,\"</span> he admitted quietly, <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"I never had anyone protect me before. Especially not someone like her.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling to herself, Gardevoir feels Zorua's ambarassment increasing. To see this roughskinned Pok\u00e9mon, the same that had replaced the expedition group's Reviver Seeds with X-Eye Seeds, act in this manner was making her heart titillate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Zorua... That's so cute!\"</span> she suddenly burst out and hugged the small dark-type, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"I'll be cheering you on!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"W-Wait!\"</span> Zorua gasps as he is pressed up against her massive body, <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"You don't get it! I'm small!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Oh! Sorry,\"</span> Gardevoir exclaims while feeling Zorua's sadness reflected in herself,<span class=\"cgreen\"> \"Wait... Why are you sad?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Like I said, it's all because I'm small. The size of a little doll,\"</span> Zorua mumbled hopelessly,<span class=\"cmaroon\"> \"The only reason Espurr or you or anyone even bothered to talk to me is because I'm completely harmless like this. Will she still care for me when I'm back to my original size? I'll probably just scare her off with my antics like everyone else.\"<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"But... Your antics? You said you were reformed!\"</span> Gardevoir said and felt a pang of guilt synchronized in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"... It's not that easy, OK?\"</span> Zorua mutters with a hint of regret,<span class=\"cmaroon\"> \"I just said all that so I could get out of here alive. Honestly, I don't... Know what'll happen when I'm myself again. It's not like I haven't tried to 'be normal' before, it's, just, some people see that as weakness and use the opportunity to get back at me. Once a scoundrel, always a scoundrel, you know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir stares at him, her cheerful expression fading. This isn't really what she had in mind when it came to playing match-maker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Look, Espurr's too nice. There's no way she would like the real me,\"</span> Zorua explains quietly and shakes his head, <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"I'm a ruffian and she's a softie. Well right now I'm a dustmite and she's a goddess, but that won't last forever. Just let me do my time here in Celebi's bedroom and I promise I'll never get involved with any of you again. Just forget I exist.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling like this is too good of a moment to pass up, Gradevoir decides there has to be a solution. Love finds a way. After thinking to herself for a few moments, she has an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I know!\"</span> she says with a sense of joy, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"You should stay small until she gets to know the 'real you' and then decide!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looks up at her.</span></div></div>",

And Zorua was one of her friends now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Well, you're living with Celebi now, no?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"For the time being...\" Zorua corrected.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" he then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Well, why don't you ask Espurr if you can spend a day or two with her?

Isn't it why you're even talking about it with me?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shakes his head.<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant,\" he responds, before sighing.<br>\r\n\"I won't be this size forever, Gardevoir. As a result, I won't be harmless forever. Whenever Celebi grows me back up, I might just start pranking others again,\" he reasons.<br>\r\n\"What if Espurr falls for me now, but will hate me when I start... y'know... again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">IF you start pranking others again,</span>\" Gardevoir interjects.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">If it happens... we'll make sure to help you change again, Zorua. Friends don't let friends ruin their reputations.</span>\" she says with a confident smile, earning one from Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then gives a small yawn. Gardevoir smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">For now, though, I suggest we hit the hay. It's still early, and I'm done eating anyway,</span>\" and says, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir travels through Celebi's house, before slowly opening the door, careful to not make any noise. Then, the psychic type slides inside, heading towards the bed where Celebi, Buneary and Espurr are sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir moves over Espurr: her eyes are shut and she's snoring, meaning that she wasn't reading Zorua's thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Well... See you in the morning,</span>\" Gardevoir says, using a paw to spread Celebi's arms.<br>\r\n\"W-Wait... D-Don't-\" Zorua doesn't get to finish as Gardevoir lowers him down. Celebi's elongated paws dart forward, grabbing him and snuggling him to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's cheeks burn with embarrassment. Gardevoir laughs a bit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Hehe... someone missed you.</span>\" she remarks, before moving to her improvised bed and laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighs and lays still as he closes his eyes, Celebi snuggling him further in her sleep, causing the dark type to blush even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the bedroom, Celebi, the bed and all the girls soon fade away as sleep claims him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Wake up Zorua...</span>\" a familiar voice disturbed Zorua's slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply ignored it as he kept on sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on, my tiny roommate, time to rise and shine,</span>\" the voice repeated in a gentle manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua turned in his sleep.<br>\r\n\"Five more minutes...\" he groaned. A giggle followed his sentence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Aw... He's adorably stubborn...</span>\" another voice chimed. Other giggles were heard.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Not even five seconds - wake up.</span>\" the voice said, a bit more firm than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua huffs loudly, before opening his eyes, noticing that Celebi is holding him in front of the four other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary was giggling, Braixen snickering, Gardevoir was giving a smile. Espurr looked deadpan as usual.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Why good morning, Zorua,</span>\" Celebi chimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grumbled a bit.<br>\r\n\"... What's going on all of you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">The sleepover is... over. We're leaving,</span>\" Braixen clarifies with a smile, reaching out to pet the smaller fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" is all Zorua responds, dejected. Now that he finally made some friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Yeah. Well, need him a second, Celebi,</span>\" Gardevoir says, picking Zorua from the fairy and leaving the room, leaving four confused pokemon behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">You've gotta tell Espurr Zorua!</span>\" Gardevoir exclaims, holding the fox in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blinks.<br>\r\n\"Tell her what...?\" he inquires, before remembering the talk he had with Gardevoir. He blushes.<br>\r\n\"... Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic type nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Want an advice? Hurry up.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And do what?</span>\" Celebi chimes from behind her, startling Gardevoir, who hastily turns back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Nothing...</span>\" she says, gently handing Zorua to Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... In that case,</span>\" Braixen tells, smiling at Buneary.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">We'll be leaving. Come on Buneary, I'll bring you home,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny doesn't respond, but snatches Zorua from Celebi, hugging him to her chest.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">See you around Zorua~</span>\" she chimes, before giving him back to Celebi and hopping next to Braixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah, see ya around small one,</span>\" the fox tells with a warm smile, before she and Buneary take their leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">I'll be leaving too,</span>\" Gardevoir says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">See you all around - and, Zorua,</span>\" she turns around.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Let me know.</span>\" she says, winking as she disappears outside, leaving only Zorua, Celebi and Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blinks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What she was talking about...?</span>\" she asks Zorua, who freezes up.<br>\r\n\"...

I guess I'll see you around,</span>\" Espurr says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Try to not choke him while you cuddle him, Celebi,</span>\" she warns, sending both Zorua and Celebi in a state of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait... E-Espurr...\" Zorua calls out, stopping the psychic type, who turns around again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was wondering... would you be okay if... if I came with you...? I'd like... I'd like to spend some time with you after... after last night...\" he timidly explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What? Why? When?</span>\" Celebi asks, growing more and more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr herself looks confused, and doesn't reply. Instead, her eyes suddenly widen... even more, and she adopts a surprised expression as well as a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua mentally slaps himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr just read his thoughts and found out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Espurr...\" he quietly murmurs, praying she doesn't blurt out what she just learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Espurr remains quiet as she ponders an answer.</span></div></div>",

If it's okay with Celebi.</span>\" Celebi just looked from the blushing Espurr to the blushing Zorua in her palm and started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh~ I see~</span>\" She said, now understanding what Gardevoir was getting at. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, you little lady killer you~</span>\" She teased as Zorua's face flushed even redder and he looked away from both of them. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's absolutely fine with me Espurr. I'm actually happy to do it, this would be good for both of you to come out of your shells a bit more.</span>\" Celebi handed the tiny dark pokemon to Espurr, and he looked up at the giantess holding him. She looked away from him briefly, blushing furiously as she started to hug the tiny pokemon to her chest almost as hard as Celebi did when she cuddled him in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I'll make sure that he's safe Celebi, and i'll bring him back tomorrow. Thank you.</span>\" Espurr said, not quite as monotone as she probably intended and she made for the door. Celebi just grinned. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">This is DEFINITELY not what I expected.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so um...Espurr...wait, are you in my head right now?\" Zorua said from her chest as they walked the quiet road to Espurr's house. She lived a bit further out than he had expected, even passing through his forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I'm uh...n-no.</span>\" She hastily said. He was quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess it makes sense why I saw her so much if she passes through here to get home.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...last night, um...thanks for...that....with my dad and all...\" Zorua was trying to strike up a conversation with the giantess, and with how much they had talked last night or how many quips she'd have for a situation to poke and prod at her companions, she was being oddly quiet herself right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Oh, anytime Zorua...I was happy to be there.</span>\" She said, still with a hint of nervousness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-if you want to talk to me about anything, you can...um...y'know, do that.\" He was looking down now at the far ground. 'Why is this so stinking hard Gardevoir!?' He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Is that what you two talked about...?</span>\" Espurr asked before she realized her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You are SO in my head right now!\" Zorua exclaimed and Espurr started to get a bit jittery. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I'm sorry, it's a habit...I do it unconsciously sometimes.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, i'm not mad Espurr. I'm not.\" He said, feeling a little queasy from her jittery motions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the walk was more silence and more awkwardness as they got to Espurr's house. A big, big nice house. \"Wow...\" Zorua said, a bit impressed. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yeah...that's what everyone does when they see it for the first time, even if it's not out loud.</span>\" Espurr remarked as she went to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was...eerily quiet. Very eerily quiet. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well, why don't I show you around...there's a lot of rooms.</span>\" Espurr said as she gave him the grand tour of a game room, a library, kitchen, many many guest rooms, ball room, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tour went on Zorua still noted that it was just him and Espurr...no other pokemon. And she didn't seem the least bit nervous about anyone turning a corner to see Espurr carrying a doll sized Zorua around. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">That's because it's only me and my dad that live here, and he works all the time.</span>\" She said frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment last night about distant parents being normal started to make sense in his head. He looked at Espurr, but her expression was her default unreadable state. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I take care of my studies, chores, meals, and entertainment choices quite proficiently on my own and I enjoy quiet so it isn't so bad Zorua.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still Espurr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">No, it isn't the same. My dad is distant but he's still my dad, and he cares in his way. It's why we live in a place like this.</span>\" Zorua said nothing to this, though the hollow mansion gave him quite a few thoughts that Espurr would see anyways.</span></div></div>",

Come on, there's one more room I need to show you,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That's not an answer...\" Zorua points out perplexedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr remains quiet, and starts walking towards the unknown room. The giantess takes a few minutes to reach her destination. Quietly, she opens the door, which leads to... the biggest bedroom Zorua's ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nice, big bed occupied a good part of the room; a bookshelf full of books, a desk where some sheets rested. Some had drawings, some were written and some were blank, giving Zorua an accurate idea of what Espurr liked to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, there was an armchair in a corner, while sunshine seeped through a big window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yeah. It is quite nice in in here - completely silence helps me sleep,</span>\" Espurr chimes, slowly moving to the bed and sitting down on it, setting Zorua on her lap.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">And speaking of - you'll be sleeping here tonight... If you don't mind of course...</span>\" she continues, blushing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua flushed red too, even if the perspective is something he was secretly hoping for. Though, well aware that Espurr didn't keep the promise of staying out of his mind, he buries the thought deep into his mind, replacing it with another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Say, Espurr,\" he starts, getting her to look at him.<br>\r\n\"Answer me - don't you want to talk about your dad...?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr looks dejected for a moment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... There is really nothing to say, Zorua,</span>\" she responds after a moment of silence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It isn't like you think. Sure, my father works all the time, and he can be quite distant at times, but he cares for me... I actually see him once or twice a week, and he always brings something nice for me...</span>\" she admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe revelation made Zorua a bit sad as his mind traveled to his own father. All those harsh words, all his tears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Probably my dad is happy that I ran off, so I can't disappoint him anymore...\" he bitterly says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr stared at the small fox for a moment, before pulling him in a hug to her chest. Zorua blushed, but he couldn't deny how nice it felt. Espurr's fur was warm and soft, and be could literally feel all the care in the hug she was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, everything faded from Zorua's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom, his father, Celebi, the girls. Only Espurr remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was alone with the girl he loved. Nothing else mattered to him at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading his thoughts, Espurr blushed even more, feeling her cheeks burning with embarrassment. But she says nothing about it. Zorua's new size made him harmless... but helpless, too. And Espurr couldn't deny just how cute he was like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Just forget him Zorua,</span>\" she repeats the same words from the last night.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You've got Celebi. You've got a home. You've got friends...</span>\" she smiles sheepishly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... You've got me...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement makes Zorua blush even more.<br>\r\n\"Yes... you're right...\" he replies while returning the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a good while, Espurr finally broke the embrace, holding the little dark type in front of her, a smile painted on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Let's... Let's leave our parents out of our minds for today, alright?</span>\" she suggests.<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Zorua responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smiles even more.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Okay. I've shown you my house... what do you say if we did something together now?</span>\" she asks, laying back down on her bed, holding Zorua up in the air with her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed.<br>\r\n\"Sounds good...\" he admitted, staring at the psychic giantess below. He was really starting to get used to those endless lilac wells that were Espurr's eyes, although he couldn't shake off a slight sensation of uneasiness whenever she looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well... what do you want to do then?</span>\" Espurr asked, ignoring his last thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua thought about it.</span></div></div>",

It might bore you.</span>\" Zorua considered this, before returning with a grin. \"Well...you unfortunately know my ideas for fun, but I want to get to know more about you Espurr, and what you like. I wouldn't be bored doing that.\" Espurr gave a small slight smile to that before she sat up and set him down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Okay Zorua, i'll be back in a little bit. Be patient here.</span>\" She got up and left the room, leaving him in silence. 'Hmm...odd, but alright' He thought before stretching out. \"Maaan, this bed is huuuge!\" He said to himself before getting an idea. \"I did say we could do what she wanted, and she told me it might bore me...welp, may as well get exercise now.\" He grinned before running to the other end of the bed, occasionally leaping to get a bit of a spring in his step. \"Man! Feels good to get going, i've been taking it easy since Celebi shrunk me again!\" He whooped as he turned on a dime at the other end of the bed and started to run back to his starting point, before stopping mid way to just start rolling around. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">If you're stir crazy we can go outside.</span>\" He heard a voice that immediately brought him back to reality and he covered his face with his paws to hide his embarrassment. \"It's not what it looks like!\" He blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes it is.</span>\" Espurr said in the same deadpan voice as ever, though he couldn't see the slight smile she had. Zorua heard her setting a few things down before he felt himself being lifted up to her face, she had lost the smile and was back to her default before saying. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Are you sure you're okay with doing what I want?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Espurr, I was serious...what do you do for fun?\" Zorua asked. She said nothing as she carried him over to her desk and very gently set him on a pillow. She sat down in her chair and gathered together the things she had brought in her room. she then slipped him a banana chip from a bag she had and took a small sip of a steaming cup that she had set down. It smelled...good. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">If you want some apple cider, be sure to ask me during this. I won't be looking at your thoughts. I also got you this to read if you'd like, I tend to get lost in my own world when I sketch and draw.</span>\" She said simply as a comic was set before Zorua. Of course, he had seen the drawing when he came in! That made sense. He took a small bite of his banana chip before sitting there silently and watching her. She was levitating a pencil over paper as she stared at the page before her. 'Wow...intense' He thought looking at her stare before catching himself...then realizing she wasn't in his head. He eyed the comic a bit, but realized he'd have an awkward time turning the pages or even reading all the panels. He opted to watch her instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time wore on Zorua was actually far more impressed with her sketches than he had expected, and far less bored than she would have predicted. She said she had wanted to draw Buneary a few things to hopefully help the young pokemon feel more comfortable around her, and she sketched Braixen and Buneary fishing together, as well as one of a normal sized Zorua and Buneary running through his forest. The attention to detail was...impressive. \"Can I have a sip?\" Zorua had asked, this was really the only interruptions that had happened since she started and Espurr was quick to pick him up and lift him to the cup before she gently set him back on the cushion, wordlessly. 'Seriously intense...but impressive.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just finished working on a sketch of Celebi hugging the tiny Zorua, intent to give it to her on her next visit, and she started in on another sketch before she spoke for the first time, the lack of silence startling Zorua. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">So have you given thought to what you'll so when you're restored to your normal height?</span>\" She asked, frankly. \"Oh...uh...not really, I was normal there for a bit between the 'punishment' and the 'roomie' portion of this whole thing and honestly...all I did was sleep and eat from my hidden stashes of food. I was kinda bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Hmm, I thought so. You need an outlet.</span>\" She stated simply, not looking away from her sketch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outlet? That would be bad for me to have, I had that, it was my pranks.\" He said frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua, you're boastful, love to be the center of attention, take pride in your skills in trickery, and enjoy making complex contraptions.</span>\" She said, deadpan as ever, not even looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well I can't deny any of that.\" Zorua hung his head in shame. Why was she doing this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">None of those are inherently bad qualities by themselves Zorua. You went about it wrong is all. You're an extroverted pokemon, and you were lashing out when you got here. It got bad, and many pokemon suffered because of your tricks...and I need to apologize to you myself. If i'd taken the time to find the context to the bitter thoughts you had, maybe I could've reached out to you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seriously doubt you'd have gotten through to me, it took a hiiiigh dose of fearing for my life, and a whole lot of pain to get me to rethink my choices. Sadly, you might've become a target to me...\" Zorua said, slightly wistfully, he tried to eye the sketch Espurr was making but her paw touched his chin and had him look up at her face. She looked...sad, but still wore a smile. He was starting to see just how much she really could emote with her eyes. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I could've tried...knowing that you could've changed, and knowing what I know about you now I just think of all those years that you hurt others...and were hurting yourself and I think 'I could've said something'...i'm an introvert, I don't like trying to connect with others, usually they try and connect with me before i'll make the effort. Zorua...I want to help you find a use for your talents, and to make things right.</span>\" At this she finished her sketch and gently let go of his chin. He looked down at it from his cushion and saw...himself, on a stage, fully grinning with fireworks going on around him, shimmering bubbles surrounding him with rings and halos of fire and electricity surrounding the bubbles. A crowd of young pokemon that he had tormented were watching him. Buneary, Azurill, Swinub, Pichu, Magby, and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Your illusions, your tricks, your fancy ideas for contraptions...you could do shows, make pokemon laugh...smile. Zorua...you should give it a try, maybe discuss it with Celebi when I bring you back to her...</span>\" Espurr said gently. Zorua thought on it. It was...what he wanted. He realized he wanted that really badly right now, it would be great to make it up to them that way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...would any of them WANT to see that? He had stolen, swindled, trapped, tormented, and scarred many of those pokemon. Buneary forgave him, but that year she spent like that...and he had done just as bad to many of those other kids. A show like this...? That probably wouldn't be enough, he needed to earn this right.</span></div></div>",

'<span class=\"cgrape\">I'm sorry Zorua</span>' She mentally said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed. 'She already knows, may as well' he mentally told himself. \"Of course I am. It's hard not to be, considering my position, like you said, I know better than anyone...but that doesn't mean that I hate any of you, I don't! Not at all! You're all my friends, and i've had so much fun too! I like all of you! Especially you Espurr.\" He said, trying to put on a carefree grin. Espurr still had the sad look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">None of us would EVER do anything to hurt you right now Zorua, you need to know that, I wouldn't do that...you need to stop hating yourself Zorua...</span>\" She said and his smile faded. \"But I-I don't...\" He muttered, looking down. \"I just...worry about what will happen when i'm given my own agency back is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you WILL do something Zorua, you know that...the thoughts you just had when I said those awful things confirms it to me, you HAVE changed and you wouldn't do that stuff anymore...i'm trying to help you Zorua...this show would work. I know it's what you want too.</span>\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Before you tell me no in another way, I want you to internalize it and think about it...for now, let's just go outside, okay?</span>\" She said gently as she picked him up from the pillow. '<span class=\"cgrape\">Maybe exercise will help him think about it.</span>' She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Espurr, you should get out here too!\" Zorua said grinning as he ran through her backyard, she was sitting on her patio, watching him. He had done a complete 180 once he got going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It's fine, i'm not the running type.</span>\" She said. \"Oh come on! Try and catch me!\" He shouted before he felt a tug, he was being lifted by a psychic aura and he went flying towards her as she hugged him to her chest, still deadpan. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Caught you.</span>\" She said simply as Zorua struggled in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is NOT what I meant and you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Like I said, i'm not the running type. It would've ended the same anyway, with or without me just using my psychic powers.</span>\" She stated and Zorua felt slightly insulted. \"Oh really?...is that so?\" He said before grinning up at her. \"You know, I bet you COULDN'T catch me without those powers, even with me at this size.\" She just looked down at him. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">You're trying to bait me.</span>\" She said simply. \"Call it what you will, but tiny or not I could still outmaneuver circles around you. Few have ever caught me and the first was a legendary mystic so...\" He stated cockily before Espurr set him down and pondered this. '<span class=\"cgrape\">He's serious...</span>' She thought reading his thoughts. He really did think he could evade her, even that tiny, she smiled a little, maybe...a wager then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Okay Zorua, i'll try to catch you...no psychic powers...and no illusions from you either.</span>\" Zorua contemplated this. \"Hmm...sounds fair.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">All you have to do is avoid me for 5 minutes, if I pin you or trap you without any psychic powers, I win. If you can evade me for that time and remain free, you win.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, cool cool.\" He said carefree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">BUT, if I win...you need to do the show.</span>\" She stated as she smiled down at him. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">For sure.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!? No bet...i'll just head back out an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">But if you win i'll kiss you.</span>\" She stated, blushing slightly and he stopped in his tracks. '<span class=\"cgrape\">Got him</span>' She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-k-wh-\" He was stammering, his heart had skipped a beat and he felt like he needed to steady himself. He looked up at her, she was smiling wide at him. 'No way she can beat me...i'll get my exercise, show my stuff, and get to kiss Espurr....it's in the bag' he thought grinning. '<span class=\"cgrape\">Oh don't be so sure.</span>' She thought before he said \"Deal.\"</span></div></div>",

Even without his illusions, he still had the wicked mind of a trickster, and that would be his trump card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Espurr, as soon as she saw Zorua running, she... did absolutely nothing. She simply stood there in the grass, watching Zorua running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the small fox noticed the lack of activity behind him. So, his running soon slowed down to a mere walk before Zorua halted completely to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed Espurr staring at him while standing perfectly still.<br>\r\n\"Uh...

Like a Beedrill just stung him, he sprints in the opposite direction, causing Espurr to halt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, realization hit the small pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>If I keep running, she won't move... I've got this!</i>\u2019 he thinks, grinning to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr, who was reading his thoughts, smirked herself.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"cgrape\"><i>If you only knew how wrong you are, Zorua...</i></span>\u2019 she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan worked. Now, she only had to wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua kept running for a good while since he was almost caught by Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he could win the game by merely keeping running. He was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just three minutes, he was panting. His reduced size wasn't of any help at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got... this...\" he panted. Espurr was still watching without moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Zorua came to the point where he couldn't keep it up no more. He ran as far as he could get from Espurr, before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small fox panted, trying to regain his breath. But that was when the ground beneath him started shaking. It didn't take long for Zorua to realize that Espurr started moving in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shaking grows, he hastily makes another sprint, but he ends up stumbling and falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" he muttered as a shadow eclipsed his view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Espurr gently bent over him and picked him up, hugging the small fox to her chest, a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Looks like I win Zorua,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">And sooner than I had anticipated.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighs as he rests against Espurr's chest.<br>\r\n\"So... guess I'm doing the show now...\" he mutters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes.</span>\" Espurr responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua closes his eyes. Before abruptly opening them again as he puts two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr had revealed him that she was just waiting for him to stop... but there was a second purpose : she only wanted to keep him running. And, when he was tired out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You got it right,</span>\" she confirms happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua frowns.<br>\r\n\"NO fair!\" he shouts as he starts struggling in Espurr's grip.<br>\r\n\"You were supposed to CHASE me!

He simply nodded and stood on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out into her yard for a bit, and even tried his hand at making one of those fireballs surrounded by electricity from Espurr's drawing.

So, Zorua only lost because she outsmarted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, he lost anyway, so Espurr couldn't reward him... by kissing him like she promised. But she was sure he earned his rest with her. Zorua would have appreciated it, she hoped, since he seemed to really like her like he said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass, and the sun starts to descend over the horizon as the sky darkened, the moon taking its place into the starry night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, at some point, Espurr started waking up. A breeze blew past her as her eyes start to open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess yawns as she looks around, discovering that she's still on her hammock, it's nighttime and she's still cuddling the small Zorua to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr blinks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">How much time passed...?</span>\" she asks herself, before gazing at Zorua again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Aw... he's adorable...</span>\" she mutters to no one in particular.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">And after the show, everyone will understand that.</span>\" she adds, before looking at the starry sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, she thinks, she could give him a chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr's attention is drawn as Zorua starts fidgeting in his sleep. Her expression returns back to normal as the tiny fox wakes up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua yawns, before blinking a few times as his vision adjusts to the darkness.<br>\r\n\"E-Espurr...?\" he calls out upon noticing that the giantess he slept with is staring at him.<br>\r\n\"W-What time is it...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It's nighttime Zorua,</span>\" she quietly says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">We overslept.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua simply stares at her dejectedly.

Especially after the show...</span>\" she promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiles a little a she makes eye contact with the giantess.<br>\r\n\"Espurr...\" he mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before his stomach decided to ruin the moment by growling, remembering him that all he ate in the whole day was a banana chip and a sip of apple cider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushes and looks at his belly, silently cursing it for the bad timing. Espurr giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Let's head inside. We eat something, and we go to bed,</span>\" she says, leaping off the hammock and starting to walk towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr walks through the quiet backyard, reaching the even quieter mansion and enters, heading towards her dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You're wondering what I'm going to give you,</span>\" she points out upon reading Zorua's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs.<br>\r\n\"When are you going to stop doing that?\" he asks, earning a smirk in response.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... I think that your current size might be useful after all - anything can fill you, and you wouldn't even finish whatever I give you to eat...</span>\" she says, gently placing Zorua on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... you're right. I mean, last night I didn't eat much of Celebi's snacks, did I?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You barely ate one cookie and it was mainly because you were more irritated and bored than hungry because Celebi beat you when you at chess, and because she made you be the banker when we played Pokeopoly...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blinks. As always, Espurr was hard to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah.\" he responds.<br>\r\n\"I'm still wondering how you won that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smirks, before starting to walk towards her kitchen.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Be right back.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Something bothering you?</span>\" Espurr asked as she carried Zorua to her bedroom. They had just finished dinner, and decided to go to sleep... when Espurr noticed Zorua's dejected look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny dark type sighed.<br>\r\n\"It's... it's about the show, Espurr...\" he sincerely said.<br>\r\n\"I'm clueless about how I should even do that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr looked down at her chest, noticing illusionary fireballs, electricity encircling them. Although, she could definitely tell they were fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You need to practice, Zorua,</span>\" she suggested.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Take a few days to do so, and when you feel like doing it, you do it,</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua quietly nodded, not really convinced. All because of a plan and lost bet, he bitterly thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Cheer up, Zorua,</span>\" Espurr said gently while opening the door that led to her immense bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over the bed and leaped onto it, before pulling back the blankets with psychic. She placed Zorua on a pillow, before sliding under the sheets herself, wrapping them around her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights were then psychically switched off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr lays her head on the same pillow Zorua his, her eyes piercing his soul even through the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, he noticed the small grin on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You know, Zorua? Maybe...</span>\" she said, her paw grabbing a hold of him and dragging him closer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... Maybe... I suppose I could give you <i>that</i> reward after all,</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush spread across Zorua's cheeks. He knew what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espurr...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr dragged him even closer, before her lips landed on top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a few seconds, she pulled back, giggling and blushing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Heh, sleep tight, Zorua,</span>\" she said, moving him to her chest and hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she got in response was a mix of incoherent sounds, which made her giggle harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she rolled over as she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stays quiet for a good while more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't tell how much time passed since she kissed him, but her chest started rising and falling along with her rhythmic breath, meaning that Espurr fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Zorua muttered, before leaning against the giantess' chest and snuggling up to her. He closed his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" was all he managed to say before he too fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She tilted her head. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Is that why you have a crush on me?</span>\" She asked and he blushed again, trying to feign annoyance. She merely smiled at this. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">You know it won't happen like that, right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know it won't!...Jeez, nightmares are just that, nightmares!\" He said, looking back at her.

No one crossed the woods, dreading the possibility of being victims of the infamous Zorua... not knowing that said fox 'mysteriously disappeared'. But in this case, it was luck - what would have pokemon thought seeing Espurr carrying a minuscule Zorua and a drawing of Celebi hugging him levitating behind her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Obviously they're scared - and angry - and vengeful - but you'll see,</span>\" Espurr smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">After the show, no one will have these hard feelings anymore.</span>\" she reassures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so...\" Zorua responds, not really caring. He was doing this to please Espurr... but if it turned out to be useless, he wouldn't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a scoundrel, always a scoundrel, he repeated himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking his thoughts, Espurr frowns, but says nothing as she keeps walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she finds herself in the village, and goes straight to Celebi's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Now...</span>\" Espurr says upon reaching her friend's front door. She rises Zorua up to her face, before rising her ears.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Celebi's mother might be inside. Be quiet.</span>\" she warns, gently placing Zorua on her head, her ears falling back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom beneath her ear, Zorua heard Espurr knocking. Shortly after, he heard the door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr!</span>\" he recognized Celebi's cheerful voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Did you bring my roomie back~?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings shake beneath Zorua, making him assume that Espurr just nodded. Then, light shined on him as the giantess' ears rise up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he notices is a smiling Celebi, staring straight at him.<br>\r\n\"Hi Cele-\" he can't finish as he's snatched by the fairy, and hugged to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Missed you~</span>\" she chimes, before eyeing Espurr, noticing her holding out a sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What's that?</span>\" Celebi asks as she takes the sheet from Espurr's paws and glancing at it. Her expression of curiosity shifted back into a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Aw! That's beautiful!</span>\" the fairy says cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smiles while blushing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">It's nothing...</span>\" she responds, before her face returns to its usual deadpan expression.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going back home.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sure you don't want to stay over for breakfast?</span>\" Celebi suggests. Espurr shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">No, thank you. Already eaten,</span>\" she says, before her eyes fix on Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">See you both around...</span>\" she adds, before snatching Zorua from Celebi, and turning around. Then, to his surprise, she pecks him, sending him in a state of deep embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">See you soon. And practice.</span>\" Espurr whispers with a smile as she nuzzles Zorua, before handing him back to Celebi, who eyes the two with a gleeful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bye Espurr. See you around!</span>\" Celebi exclaims cheerfully as her friend turns around to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before the fairy slams the front door close and moves to her bedroom at supersonic speed, closing the door and locking it behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the time traveler looks at Zorua with a huge smile as she sets him down on the bed and places the sketch on her desk before leaping on the bed in front of him, making the small dark type bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">EVERYTHING.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You've gotta tell me everything.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gulped.<br>\r\n\"Is this necessary, Celebi?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Absolutely!</span>\" Celebi responds with a wide smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Also because I won't leave you alone until you've told me every single detail.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small dark type sighs.<br>\r\n\"We've done nothing, really. I've watched Espurr sketching, then we played outside. Then we took a nap, but we overslept and we woke up at night and we slept together.\" he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blinks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's it?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I've also lost a bet, and now I have to do a show whenever you grow me back and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi interrupts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Show? What show?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"... Right. Long story short, Espurr had an idea to... 'redeem' me. A show with my illusions. But I refused...\" Zorua explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy nods as she listens attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I bet with Espurr I could escape her without my illusions or her psychic powers. If I won, she would have kissed me... if I lost, I would have to do it... the show I mean...\" the small fox continues, blushing vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stares at him, before starting to laugh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And you lost? Aw, how sa-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"She tricked me. And she kissed me anyway.\" Zorua cuts her off, blushing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stops giggling to look at the tiny fox with amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she roughly grabbed him and hugged him to her chest as she started fidgeting on the bed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ohmy-ohmy-ohmy! Gotta tell this to Gardevoir!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's eyes widen.<br>\r\n\"Don't! Please, she's gonna talk about it forever!\" he begs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi laughs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Fine...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But now, you have to do this show... right?</span>\" she asks while manipulating Zorua so that he's facing her whole still in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nods.<br>\r\n\"Yes. Whenever you... whenever you grow me back...\" he admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's smile fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I should do this... as a way to apologize... make others laugh...\" Zorua mutters.<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quietly, the five girls move behind Celebi's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr gently places Zorua on the ground, and he soon finds the world around him shrinking as he grows back to his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good luck Zorua~ we'll be in the crowd cheering for you~</span>\" Celebi sings as she and the others move to reach the other pokemon.

And, with determination, he leaps on the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll kinds of faces - glares, smirks, cold stares and not-so-polite gestures from the pokemon watching him. He sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there everyone...\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I... I know I've been a jerk to... all of you actually, so, I hoped to apologize to y'all... and on that purpose, I put up this small show...\" he paused to don his brightest smile.<br>\r\n\"... Which I truly hope you'll enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fireworks display came to an end as colorful sparks rained on Zorua, who was panting from the struggle... but was still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for the grand finale people!\" he shouted as he performed the trick that took a lot of practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the dark sky flashed with various shades of red as a figure soared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gigantic phoenix made of fire flies around, electric spheres encircling it, sparks of both fire and electricity falling down from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the phoenix landed on top of the stage, spread its wings and exploded in a rain of sparks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at the crowd, panting, sweating, but smiling brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was clapping but... the pokemon were still wearing unimpressed looks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...

Yes?\" he risks responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">You've hurt me...</span>\" Swinub timidly said... psychologically traumatized, Zorua recalled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the whole crowd started yelling awful things... the whole crowd but his friends, who were looking devastated. Espurr was looking around in shock, he noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua closed his eyes, listening to all the insults thrown at him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Keep calm Zorua...</i>\u2019 he thought... before feeling something hitting his head quite hard. He opened his eyes... a rock fell on the stage, followed by another, and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same type stared at them, before gritting his teeth. THAT was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, y'all, I get it! You hate me, and you have a good reason to do so!\" he shouted, his words having the effect of making Wigglytuff's arm stop in midair as he was about to throw a rock too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was seething.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, I've been a jerk to all of you, I deserve all this!

Even Espurr was being oddly quiet, but the explanation was that she was reading Zorua's thoughts... and was bracing herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore everyone's gazes, the dark-type began moving; slowly, very slowly, Zorua stood back on all fours, sticky substances of all sorts mixed with his own blood rolling down his body, rendering his fur sticky, the dark strands intermingled because of the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the comical appearance, there was nothing to laugh about. At his normal size, Zorua easily towered above a few of his friends such as Buneary, Espurr and the one pokemon who started it all, Celebi; somehow, being covered in smashed fruit and blood only made him look rather imposing to the three girls. Even Braixen and Gardevoir looked quite anxious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, his eyes opened, two bright blue disks fixed on each and every one of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr stepped back, intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bomb was about to blow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Zo...

Could 'redeem' me! 'Just do a bloody show, Zorua, you'll see'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frustrated fox dropped back on the ground, paws over his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

It'll hopefully calm him down...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua growled at the mention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi offered a slight nod as she hovered closer to the pokemon she shared her house with unbeknownst to her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on, Zorua,</span>\" the legendary spoke sympathetically, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's just fix that nasty wound so you can-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time-traveling fairy was interrupted when Zorua's paw darted away from his eye to intercept hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Do what? Go back to being small? I don't think so.\" he growled, pushing Celebi away while standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">What?</span>\" Gardevoir spoke all of a sudden, alerted by the fox's statement. She shot Espurr a look, causing the psychic-type to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua ignored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I want to be alone. Like I've always been.\" he said in a calmer tone as he hopped down the stage and onto the hard ground, droplets of blood falling from his body, staining the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox stared back at his friends one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go. Go have your fun and leave me be. I'll show up again... eventually.\" he stated, beginning to walk away, in direction of his former home: the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr sided to Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Don't let him go!</span>\" she whispered,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">He could try to get revenge! What'd happen then?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at the dark-type walking away, putting a good distance between himself and the stage where the five girls stood in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He won't listen...</span>\" she pointed out resignedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">We need to stop him.</span>\" the small psychic-type replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth psychics' eyes began glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn distance, everyone could see Zorua suddenly hovering in mid-air. Braixen, Gardevoir and Buneary gasped, but quickly followed Celebi and Espurr when the duo began dashing towards the trapped fox, who was now struggling furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua, be reasonable!</span>\" Celebi exclaimed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We're all here to help you! If you just listen for a moment, we'll let you go and I'll-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not going back to being small!\" Zorua roared, causing Buneary to shiver. Even when trapped and outnumbered, Zorua looked scarier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt it, the old Zorua, the fox she had dreaded for so long... he was coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">It's the best thing, dude!</span>\" Braixen chimed in, followed by Espurr, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You're in a fragile state of mind right now, we just want to keep you from-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you shut up, all of you!?\" Zorua snapped,<br>\r\n\"You guys, you don't even respect me enough to let me take my own decisions! Since all of... all of this started, you've been just controlling my life, like you would with a damn pet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gasped at the statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Espurr felt like their hearts sinking in an ocean of sadness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">That's not-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, allow me to say, ladies,\" Zorua unceremoniously interrupted his romance-loving friend while adopting an enraged look on his face again,<br>\r\n\"That this ain't happening, not anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the split second that followed the fox's last statement, he glowed of a purplish/black light as a wave of pure darkness spread around him, knocking the  pokemon surrounding him back while also causing the psychic grip that held him to fade, allowing him to fall on all fours on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the five girls blinded by his Night Daze, Zorua took the opportunity and cloaked himself in an illusion, before sprinting away into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, the cloud of darkness dissipated, allowing the five pokemon to see clearly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially Braixen, who angrily gazed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Why that little-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We need to find him,</span>\" Celebi interrupted, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We need to clarify this.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">He's headed for the forest.</span>\" Espurr told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gave a hasty nod, before she began fluttering away, in direction of the woods, followed by Espurr... who ran in a very awkward way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir was next to sprint away, followed by Buneary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a last growl, Braixen followed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group had no luck finding Zorua on the way to his forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the woods were very quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Z-Zorua, come on out!</span>\" Buneary yelled despite the fear she felt towards the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">He must he be around here.  Let's search for him.</span>\" Braixen suggested.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">And watch out, this place is full of nasty tricks.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group began searching for the fox, unaware that he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden behind his illusion, watching them as they searched for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began feeling somewhat conflicted seeing the effort everyone was putting into trying to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, he recalled some of the good times he shared with Espurr, Celebi... lies, he told himself, illusions even more effective than his, because he believed them to be a reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... he didn't feel hateful towards those pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry, betrayed, sad, but not hateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... should he have given them a chance to talk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox felt conflicted, lest they'd feed him even more lies, despite them claiming those lies to be the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zorua knew, they only acted friendly because, when tiny, he was harmless. Still, they had been nice to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should have he done?</span></div></div>",

He didn't need their pity, if not for them he wouldn't be dirty, matted in blood...shit like this reminded him why he was better off alone. Even when he'd resolved to try and turn over a new leaf the village would have none of it. \"Then let me be evil...\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Zorua...please come out, we just want to talk and help you feel better...</span>\" Buneary said. She couldn't have realized she was looking directly at Zorua, even if he was about 20 feet away. The illusion masked him quite well, but looking into those black eyes, full of worry from a pokemon he'd hurt so badly in the past. His expression softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Zorua, come on...you can't just go back to this life. If you do then I won't forgive you.</span>\" It was Braixen. She looked more worried than she was letting on in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">If you don't want to become smaller right away that's fine, just let us discuss this with you...we need to get you cleaned up too, it'll be good for everyone...</span>\" He heard Celebi saying, the worry clear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">You aren't in any condition to stay here tonight, you've got bruises, cuts, and are quite dirty. Listen to reason...we're all sorry about what happened tonight, know that we didn't want this.</span>\" Zorua heard Gardevoir too, more somber sounding than he'd heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua...i'm so sorry Zorua, please just talk to us...</span>\" It was then that he felt Espurr's eyes on him, those endless pools, full of so much subtle emotion, the more he looked into them, the more he felt like he understood. His heart beat faster as he looked on and with a grunt he dropped his illusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go away girls, I ain't gonna go back with ya.\" He said, not sounding nearly as angry or confidant in that statement as when he'd just run off. Immediately 5 worried pokemon were in front of him, looking him over as he looked more stoic than anything. Espurr reached up, gingerly touching at a sticky spot on his muzzle where a fruit had popped on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua, if I had known in any way...</span>\" She said gently, he looked down, his blue eyes softening a bit before they hardened. Espurr honed in on his thoughts and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">No, i'm not trying to leverage your crush on me...let us be there for you, okay?</span>\" Espurr gently said. Zorua's eyes wavered before he blinked and pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever 'being there for me' entails, it won't entail me being small again, got it?\" His eyes drifted to his floating legendary friend and she nodded. \"Let's just...drop that detail for now then, we do need to get you cleaned up though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That night shade was a low blow Zorua.\" Braixen said, her arms crossed, the first thing she said to them, her facade cracked pretty early though as she dropped them. \"But I can't blame you for feeling the way you felt...just don't do that again.\" She said, Buneary for her part jumped to hug around Zorua's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop kid, you don't want this gunk on you too.\" Zorua said as he tried to shake her off. She was crying though, her tears mixing into the blood and sticky substances that coated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zorua, please don't go back to the way you were!\" She said. \"We're sorry about the show!\" Zorua just laid down on his paws, making Buneary touch her feet to the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're worried about me pranking you then that just isn't going to happen.\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And the rest of the village?\" Espurr said gently, '<i>Damn her mind reading...</i>' Zorua thought. \"We'll see.\" Was all he said. Buneary broke her hug as Zorua stood up again and started to walk further into his forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to talk then fine, follow me, i'm just gonna clean off in the stream near here.\" He seemed resigned to their stubborn concern, and a part of him appreciated it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-damn cold!\" Zorua said as he got in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You could use a nice, warm...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, sink?\" Zorua said wryly. Celebi, cut off, blushed as that was exactly what her plan had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua closed his eyes as he let the water wash away as much of the gunk as it could. \"Look, I won't go back to the village, that's what I was thinking okay? It might be time for me to move on.\" Zorua said simply to his friends as they looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">What do you mean by that?</span>\" Braixen asked before Espurr gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You can't do that!</span>\" She said, the outburst surprising herself as well. Zorua opened his eyes and looked at her. \"Well honestly, it's probably my best bet, I don't intend to be small again, and I recognize that i'm not gonna get the village to turn around on me, might just be best to find another place to hang, different stomping grounds.\" He said. \"And I can start things on the right paw this time.\" He said, almost emphasizing his sentence with a small splash of his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua that's...that's nuts! Come on, please!</span>\" Celebi didn't want her friend to go away. He seemed pretty calm after her outburst though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">But what about...about...</span>\" Gardevoir sounded crushed as her eyes went between Espurr and Zorua. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Zorua, I don't want you to leave.</span>\" Buneary said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it isn't that I entirely want to leave either but...\" He muttered, more to himself than anything. \"It's what I can do to make things right with everyone.\" He said before he sunk a bit more into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Girls, meeting.</span>\" Celebi said with authority, they all looked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We'll be right back Zorua, just...don't go anywhere.</span>\" Celebi said gently. He didn't say anything in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Just shrink him and bring him with us, he'll be mad at first, but he'll come around.</span>\" Braixen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Braixen that's...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I agree honestly...this isn't pranking the village, but it's a short sighted rash action nonetheless, and not...</span>\" Espurr's mind drifted to the story of his dad. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Not in his best interests.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Maybe we should just go to someone's place with him normal sized right now...he doesn't want to be small.</span>\" Buneary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Maybe Espurr's?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi bit her lip. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm worried that he might not even be receptive to that at this point...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen sighed. \"<span class=\"corange\">What to do...</span>\" She muttered.</span></div></div>",

She brought him back to Celebi, and she left him to explain what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi unsurprisingly found it a good idea, and suggested that he started training immediately while she told about the idea to Braixen, Gardevoir and Buneary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Celebi a while of discussing - Gardevoir was very excited about Zorua spending the day with Espurr - but in the end they too agreed that it was a great idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, Zorua was resting on a pillow in Celebi's room. It was nighttime, but it wasn't any normal night. No, tonight was the night when his show would take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past few days he practiced a lot. He managed to improve his illusions and made up a small scenography under Celebi's advices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls were out, telling the people of the village about the show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shivers slightly. What if no one like his show? What if the pokemon don't even give him a chance? What if they get angry and try to ki-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attention of the small fox is drawn as the door of the room opens, letting five pokemon enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi, Espurr, Braixen, Gardevoir and Buneary. All wearing bright smiles upon their faces, minus Espurr who remains deadpan as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's time, Zorua,</span>\" Celebi says, moving forward and scooping the small fox up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua backs up on her paw.<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to have second thoughts...\" he quietly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">What? You can't be serious!</span>\" Braixen states.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">You've been practicing for days Zorua!</span>\" Buneary chimes in with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">The show is perfect. You'll go just fine.</span>\" Gardevoir encourages with a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And besides, it's too late to quit now - we told everyone. And when I say everyone, I <i>do</i> mean everyone.</span>\" she says, eyes wide open for the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's eyes widened too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEVERYONE?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" he quietly muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yup. But look on the bright side - if the show goes well, we'll party here all night long!</span>\" Celebi chimes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And if it doesn't... we'll party here all night long anyway.</span>\" she adds with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gulped, but smiled a bit, slightly reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" he stutters.<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Zorua mutters from Celebi's paws. She wasn't kidding - everyone in the village was in front of a small stage the five girls made. Everyone, obviously including all the pokemon who were the unlucky victims of the fox's pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, all those Zorua pulled pranks on were smirking. Maybe they were thinking about Zorua failing, humiliating himself in front of the whole village as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gently puts Zorua on the ground, before her eyes start glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before the girls' eyes, the fox grows back to his original size.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">And the scoundrel was back,</span>\" Braixen remarks playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now, you go up there and do it, alright?</span>\" she says as she and the others start moving towards the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">We'll be cheering for you!</span>\" Buneary says with a smile. Then, the five girls disappear among the crowd, leaving Zorua alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, before starting to walk over the stage. And, with reluctance, he hopped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was staring at him. Zorua was looking at all kinds of facial expressions - disdain, anger, hate even... and five smiles from five very familiar girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox felt a lump in his throat. He forcefully swallowed it, before starting to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uhm... Hi, everyone,\" he started.<br>\r\n\"I-I know, I've been a jerk to... all of you, actually. And I'm... I'm doing this... show because... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Arceus why is it so hard...</font> I h-hope you'll all accept my apologies... and that you'll enjoy the show...\" he stutters incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one talked. Nonetheless, their expressions didn't change, save for his friends, who smiled in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed as his eyes started glowing.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Here goes nothing...</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rainbow shattered in a million tiny slivers that rained all over Zorua as the sky returned dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone from the crowd clapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... time for the grand finale...\" Zorua said as he focuses to perform the trick he's been training on for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpheres of fire encircled by electricity appeared along with a bunch of shimmering bubbles. The spheres started encircling Zorua and started moving, faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, illusionary fireworks roared behind the fox, and all the spheres fused together, taking the shape of a large dragon surrounded by electricity, which breathed fire up in the sky, before exploding in a rain of sparks and flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the night returned quiet, and Zorua gazed at the crowd, showing his brightest smile.</span></div></div>",

It had felt like stupid idea from the start as well as during its execution, but the aftermath was something else entirely. Wigglytuff had derided him. Wigglytuff! That spoiled, oily sack of crap deserved to be hung upside down-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart was pounding in his ears as he shook his head, his face flush with embarassment. What was he thinking?! He was reformed now. No more pranks. Although the whole bunch deserved to find a really nasty surprise inside their desks tomor-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"If it makes you feel any better, I feel like I got my revenge,\"</span> Braixen said with a short snicker.

Publicly humiliated. He couldn't help but snicker to himself as he recalled the stupid dragon routine he had attempted. It was the sort of thing he'd make other, weaker Pok\u00e9mon do for his own amusement. He felt that he wasn't very good at being on the other side of the laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how hard he tried to block out the thoughts, he knew there was a way to make this all right. Another show. Promising even more ridicule of the school's favorite punching bag. But what they would find, oh so far from their expectations. Traps would be in place. Illusions to turn them white with fear. Sweet, SWEET revenge; He'd be the most infamous prankster of all time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at the girls with a big smile on his face. Celebi smiled back cheerfully while Gradevoir forced a nervous smile, Braixen looked somewhat confused, Buneary had a flustered apperance and Espurr...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes locked with Espurr's. Her tears were dried up, and she was looking a bit more dangerous than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Celebi,\"</span> Espurr spoke up calmly, <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Shrink him.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Wh-What?\"</span> Celebi stammered in surprise as Zorua felt the color on his face drain away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"He is in a destabilized state of mind and will attempt something extremely dumb if you do not,\"</span> Espurr explained while never letting her terrifying eyes leave your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-That's not fair!

You have to turst me...\"</span> Espurr's voice rang from behind, sounding louder and louder with each syllable. Another Psychic joined the fray as he was held in place by the mysterious power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Yes!

All she accomplishes is another neutral stare from the little pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr suddenly moves, leaping up and snatching Zorua from Braixen.

Where, how far!?\" Celebi shouted, somewhat panicked as Espurr tried to figure it out. She shouted out. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua! Let us know where you are! I know you're trapped, we'll come find you!</span>\" He had heard her, he knew from his thoughts, but he was too angry and prideful to respond, he even thought some nasty thoughts just from hearing her and she looked awkwardly at Braixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">...you really set him off a lot worse...</span>\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Braixen...</span>\" Buneary whimpered, all Braixen did was grit her teeth and shut her eyes. \"<span class=\"corange\">Zorua, i'm sorry! Please let us know where you are so we can help. We don't want you getting hurt out here!</span>\" She shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a bit before they heard, from his reduced voice in a kinda far direction \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Piss off!</font>\" And the girls sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua, we can't do that, you're in danger right now, you're trapped, if you stay there then-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">I'll be out of the way, right? No, i'll sort my own crap from now on!</font>\" He said bitterly. He was scared, and he was sure Espurr knew it, but after what had just happened, no way was he going to go back to them, not after what he said, and not after what Braixen said. 'No, if this is it then so be it, no one has ever really wanted me around anyway, so what does it matter at this point honestly.' He thought bitterly as he struggled against what he was trapped by. A Spinarak's web. He heard pattering coming from above him and looked up. 'Oh great, the Spinarak...' He thought as it started its descent towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr read that and went into a full blown panic, darting in the direction she thought he was in. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua, shout something, please!</span>\" She said loudly as she caught the green in the corner of her eye, looking around she saw it, Zorua was trapped in a web about level with her face and the Spinarak was closing on him. He was struggling pretty hard now, she didn't even know if he noticed her before she quickly darted her hands forward and yanked him from the web, destroying the web in the process and running off, leaving a very dazed Spinarak behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espurr!?\" He shouted, somewhat dazed from her running before she met up with everyone else. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I...*huff*...got...*huff*....him...</span>\" She gasped out. 'Not the running type, that's right...why did you....?' Zorua thought before she started again. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I....*huff*....won't....*huff*....let...you...die...</span>\" She was starting to get her breath again and Zorua looked down. \"Maybe you should've...it's what everyone wants right?\" He muttered. Before Celebi glared at Braixen, she straightened herself before approaching Espurr and leaning down again, Zorua winced, expecting another flick but she gently rubbed his head. \"<span class=\"corange\">Zorua...I am so, so sorry I said what I just said, I was angry at you for the illusion and didn't fully think about how you felt at the time...I...please, we do care about you, all of us do. This whole thing...it was a mistake, a bad accident, and we don't actually want you to leave...come with us, okay? We'll talk more about it at Celebi's...</span>\" She murmured gently to the small dark Pokemon, He looked at her mouth agape before Espurr felt a wetness on one of her paws. Zorua was crying. \"Why do I screw everything up!?\" He cried out before Espurr hugged him tighter to her chest. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on Zorua, let's go home.</span>\" Celebi said gently as they all started back to her house.</span></div></div>",

No one dares to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the five girls reach the village. And Espurr abruptly stops to look at her tiny passenger.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">If someone saw you this size, they'd hunt us all down to get you...</span>\" she reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just hand me to them. What does it matter at this point? My reputation is ruined for good.\" Zorua bitterly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Don't be silly. We'll never do something like that.</span>\" Gardevoir says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Great. First he's angry, now he's depressed.</span>\" she huffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shakes her head dejectedly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's been a rough night. But we can still save it...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it.\" Zorua says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Your mind is in a state of extreme disorder. You don't even know if you should feel angry, or frustrated, or sad. Plus, you're thinking we betrayed you because Celebi shrank you again and you're thinking <i>I</i> betrayed you for suggesting it when we're only trying to prevent you doing something stupid.</span>\" Espurr chimes in. Zorua remains quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr buries him in her chest fur, attempting to comfort him - and to hide him from the eyes of the villagers, but mainly to comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the group found themselves at Celebi's house. Celebi quietly opens the front door as she and the other girls move into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Espurr moves to the bed and leaps onto it, crossing her legs and setting Zorua down on her lap. He remains still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen approached the duo, snatching Zorua from Espurr.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hey Zorua...</span>\" she mutters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'm... truly sorry over what happened earlier... I didn't really mean what I said... you don't have to... uhm...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort my crap out?\" Zorua bluntly completes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen blushes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'm... I'm sorry, alright?</span>\" she says, hugging the smaller fox to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua doesn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You still angry...?</span>\" Braixen asks. Zorua still doesn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... He is. To all of us... to the whole village actually.</span>\" Espurr clarifies in a dejected voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I told Celebi to shrink him. Celebi shrank him. Gardevoir kept him still while Celebi did so. Buneary didn't let him go. Braixen... we all know what she did.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stares at the psychic type blankly, starting to reconsider his crush on her. Espurr reads this as well and shoots a dejected stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I know. We all should have thought twice...</span>\" Celebi mumbles, before moving to Braixen, picking Zorua from her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But, try to understand, you're in a pretty weak state of mind and-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not - I know perfectly what I want!\" Zorua cut her off.<br>\r\n\"I just want my size back! Then you'll see!\" he hisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone! Everyone will find one nasty surprise next time they get out of their houses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looks around with a glare, seeing all the girls staring at him. Buneary shivers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Zorua... you're scaring me...</span>\" she meekly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looks at the small fox in her hands without saying a word. She just hugs him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room remains quiet for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally Celebi gives a slight smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on... let's have some fun... You'll feel better...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Some fun and a good night sleep will do it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night goes on with games, meek attempts to make Zorua eat something and subtle remarks about Espurr and Zorua from Celebi and Gardevoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, eventually, the girls decided it was time to hit the hay. All Zorua did was agree meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">A good night sleep...</span>\" Celebi repeats, attempting to sound cheerful, but sounding hopeful instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like last time, Gardevoir and Braixen have to sleep on the floor, while Celebi, Buneary and Espurr would share the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk from Celebi and an excited expression from Gardevoir, Zorua is handed to Espurr, who blushes. Zorua, on the other hand, remains neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the smaller pokemon climb onto the bed, sliding under the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Night everyone~</span>\" Celebi chimes, receiving answers from everyone but Espurr, who keeps gazing the small Zorua held tightly in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua...</span>\" she mutters dejectedly, before getting an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this couldn't cheer Zorua up... she doesn't know what else she could do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the giantess leans down, gently pressing her lips onto Zorua's head, before pulling off, blushing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looks up at her blushing, looking surprised... but, regardless, he says nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... Good night...</span>\" Espurr whispers, wearing a small smile on her face, before closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, every noise in the room quiets down as everyone but Zorua falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny dark type rises his head to glance at those he called his friends, sleeping soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still felt betrayed... although...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps... they're really doing this for my good...\" he mumbles to himself, before huffing.<br>\r\n\"Still, I didn't do anything yet. Celebi had no right to shrink me... Espurr had no right to even suggest that...\" he bitterly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, his mind was reduced to two mere thoughts, whether to forgive his friends or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tried to cheer me up... Celebi, Espurr... Braixen...\" he whispers, not quite knowing how should he feel. Then, he gives a yawn, leaning his head against Espurr's chest as he closes his eyes, deciding to sleep on it.</span></div></div>",

He turned around whistling to walk off the stage only to see...himself grinning back.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>Man, look at you go Zorua, you did it! Showed those villagers what is up! I was worried you were getting soft there for a moment, but the second you got your size back, wham! You let them have it!</b>\" The double grinned and Zorua felt his grin fading before the fake tilted its head.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>Oh? Are you having second thoughts...well come on, this'll clear 'em up!</b>\" The double said as it beckoned for Zorua to follow him past the backstage curtain. He followed into the darkness, the double being eerily silent as they passed contraptions that Zorua had considered for the show, when he rounded a corner...he saw it. Braixen was tied up in vines, Buneary was stuck in a syrup trap, crying, Gardevoir was hanging with her limbs tied away from her, struggling, Celebi was in a small cage covered in his pidove prank, and Espurr was being hung by her ears with her eyes stuck shut.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>Your so called 'friends' getting theirs for trying to stop us! Isn't it wonderful!?</b>\" The double spoke up excitedly as Zorua tried to back up. \"N-no, no it's not, this is...this is...\" He was about to turn and run before he was stopped by vines latching his legs. The double stepped in front of him, before it started to contort, twist, and change into...a Zoroark</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>You're finally here, you've made it! Shed your weakness and are ready to follow in my footsteps!</b>\" The Zoroark claimed as it reached out to Zorua as he started to contort and change too. \"No...No I don't want this! I don't want this!\" He cried as he started to evolve himself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua woke with a start, the world around him...soft...and dark. He looked up to see Espurr sleeping...to his sides, Celebi and Buneary sleeping...still giant to him. He gasped and thought of last night. 'Was I gonna...?' He gulped before sighing and laying back against the giantess's chest. He had time to think he supposed, after all the things he had done, he was going to revert back to it? Because others didn't forgive him? He shut his eyes thinking. His friends HAD shrunk him back down pretty quick, because...he really was gonna do it, wasn't he? He was going to seek retribution and he wouldn't stop even for them, the ones that cared about him. He tried to look at Gardevoir and Braixen on the floor...Gardevoir always so intent to try and help him with his crush...Braixen, though blunt and easy to rile up, trying to help in her own way...Celebi, who wanted to give him a roof and second chance after she had hurt him, Buneary, kind and forgiving him for what he had done, and Espurr...the one who could see inside his head and tried desperately to help him mend the bridge with everyone in the village. He sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait for them to wake up and tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua...are you sure?</span>\" Celebi was shocked by what he had said. He had calmed down and apologized for the illusion last night, and he said he knew they made the right calls, but even still, what he just said surprised them all. He was fine with being this size...</span></div></div>",

Luckily, it was oddly soft... he realizes that he just bumped into a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-Sorry...

Look at ya!

This was not something the other girls had seen before. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">No no no...</span>\" She sobbed weakly as the small form of Buneary started to appear in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Girls! Did you...did you get...Zorua...</span>\" As Buneary approached and saw them her voice got more and more crestfallen as she saw them on the ground. Braixen looking furious, Gardevoir trying to get to a crying Espurr, and Celebi doing her best to get to her feet. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Oh no, you're paralyzed! Um...um...i'll be right back! I think I saw some cheri berries a bit ago!</span>\" Buneary said as she scampered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarnivine eyed his catch as he approached his and Graveler's hideaway in the village, turning a few alleys. Zorua for his part did his best to glare back, though he couldn't deny just how scared he was right now. His muzzle was still shut tight by Carnivine, and anytime his eyes glowed blue to try and start an illusion, Carnivine broke his concentration with a painful squeeze. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">You're in some serious trouble, heh, you know that, right? Just wait until we're done with you!</span>\" He said as he ducked under a broken board to reach what appeared to be an abandoned lot with a dilapidated shed in the corner of the lot. He approached it and called out. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Graveler~ Heh, I got us a treat~</span>\" He said as he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Yeah, you steal something good then?</span>\" Graveler said, his back to Carnivine as he appeared to be reading a comic. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Oh, in a way yes.</span>\" He said, approaching Graveler and putting Zorua between the comic and Graveler's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">What, a pokedoll? Seriously Carnivine?</span>\" He said unimpressed before he unmuzzled Zorua's mouth and he continued to struggle. \"Let me go right now Carnivine!!\" He yelled, snarling and Graveler's eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Is that...the real Zorua, but small? Wow...heh, yeah, i'd say that's something good!</span>\" He said as his features went wicked and he grabbed Zorua from Carnivine's grasp. Zorua gasped out at the grip, Graveler was squeezing him tight, very tight as he lifted him up. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Do you remember when you stole from us a week and a half ago, laughed at us, and then drove us off with your cowardly illusions? Well now it's payback time!</span>\" He said as he squeezed harder and Zorua's vision started to blur. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Oh no no, can't have you black out before the fun starts!</span>\" Graveler said as he roughly dropped Zorua on the table, who gasped for air before fearfully looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Girls...please...' He thought desperately, unaware that Espurr was doing her best to keep on his thoughts. As Graveler's fingers clamped down on a front paw. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Let's make this interesting...the longer you stay conscious, the longer you live, once you pass out well...you need to make up for stealing our snacks, poor Carnivine never got to eat one before you made off with them...so you're gonna be filling.him.up!</span>\" He put emphasis on the last part as both the pokemon grinned at him, Zorua's eyes becoming pinpricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary returned with the cheri berries as promised and went to each girl to feed them. Soon enough they got steadily, shakily to their feet before Espurr wiped her eyes and did her best to get Zorua's thoughts. Gardevoir and Celebi for their part also tried to sense him but were having minimal luck. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">He's too far away...</span>\" Gardevoir seemed to slump down as Braixen kicked a rock hard. \"<span class=\"corange\">GAH! When I get ahold of that laughing walking weed i'm gonna-!</span>\" Buneary put a hand on Braixen's shoulder, tears starting to well up in her eyes. \"<span class=\"ctan\">We have to go get Zorua, please.</span>\" She said as Braixen let out a sigh. \"<span class=\"corange\">Yes I know, alright, Espurr, hop on!</span>\" She said as she approached the smaller pokemon, who was looking sad, she looked up reading Braixen's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You think that because i'm the weakest runner but have the best shot of finding him that we can cover both of our shortcomings this way, Braixen I-</span>\" She was cut off as Braixen picked her up and hoisted her onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Less talky more runny!</span>\" She said as she took off, Celebi, Gardevoir, and Buneary hastily following them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAAAAAAAH!\" Zorua cried as Graveler continued to apply pressure from his two finders onto Zorua's paw. The pain was excruciating, almost on the level of what Celebi did to him on accident before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveller laughed as he let go, Carnivine joining in as Zorua fell back, face pale almost ready to go into shock from the pain, he stumbled around before falling on his side, panting and wheezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-huh-gah...\" Zorua looked at his broken paw with silent, breathless tears as Graveler loomed over him. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Still conscious huh? Well that's a shock, but that just means we get to have more fun~</span>\" He said as his fingers reached for another paw, Zorua tried to crawl away but found no escape as the fingers clamped on a back paw. \"N-no...\" He whimpered as the pressure came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the town Espurr started to cry again, she had found his thoughts and...\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I'M GOING TO KILL THEM!</span>\" She shouted, almost making the other girls stop from sheer shock as everyone but Braixen got a good look at her face, crying and full of rage. A far cry from her deadpan expression they had gotten so accustomed to at this point. Celebi gritted her teeth. '<span class=\"clgreen\">Whatever they're doing to him...they'll pay...</span>' She thought as they continued on their path, desperate to reach Zorua before Graveler and Carnivine finished him off.</span></div></div>",

He was breathing, but barely and it was weakly. \"<span class=\"corange\">You two...</span>\" Braixen snarled, looking at them as Espurr cried before glaring at them as well.

Celebi, Buneary and Gardevoir. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Did you get him back!?</span>\" Buneary cried as she went over to Braixen to see him in her palms, relieve she looked closer to see the state he was in and gasped, before tears started to well up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Don't worry Buneary, Celebi will fix him right up.</span>\" Braixen said gently as she nodded to the small green mystic who gently took Zorua from her and looked him over, she winced. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">This is...gonna take concentration...and it won't be pleasant...</span>\" She said as the others nodded. Espurr harshly pinned Carnivine to the ground as well at this, and psychically forced their mouths shut. Carnivine looked frightened and Graveler looked miffed as all hell. The room was silent as Celebi lowered her head to Zorua. A glow surrounded him before he started to stir and his chest slowly filled back out making him scream, even still unconscious, soon his legs started to pop back, as well as his paws as his screams intensified. Through the silence Gardevoir, Espurr and Braixen just glared at the two bound pokemon across from them while Buneary silently cried, trying not to make a sound. After a bit the screaming stopped and Celebi lifted her head and sighed. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">He's stable, and healed as well as I could do at the moment...we'll need to see how he feels when he wakes up.</span>\" She said and the others sighed too. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Buneary, could you come here please?</span>\" Celebi asked as the younger pokemon complied. She went over and Celebi gave her a kind smile. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I want you to take Zorua and watch over him outside, can you do that for me?</span>\" She said and Buneary gently took the small unconscious pokemon, he looked a lot better than before, but still so fragile...she cradled him to her chest and nodded before looking back at Graveler and Carnivine. \"<span class=\"ctan\">But what about...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Buneary...you don't need to be here for this.</span>\" Braixen said, gently but firmly to the younger pokemon as she nodded. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Okay...i'll keep Zorua safe...</span>\" She said as she started towards the entrance. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good girl.</span>\" Celebi smiled and praised, but as the younger pokemon left the room the smile faded and she glowered at the two across from them. Slowly, the psychic force was released from them as Graveler and Carnivine stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">...What? You've got the little piece of crap, and you even undid my handiwork, what more do you want?</span>\" Graveler said, annoyed before he continued. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Do you really want to get back at us for that? Zorua brought it on himself you know! How much trouble has he made in the past for YOU or all of us? I know for a FACT that you hate or at least hated him Braixen! Can you say only we'd have done that to him? Hell, who made him that small in the first place? That's what I wonder!</span>\" Graveler said before Espurr spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You'd say anything to get out of this, yes, Zorua was a problem for many pokemon, but none would do what you just did to him, maliciously, callously, slowly torturing him before intending to kill him over what? An ultimately minor slight against you. I can see inside your head Graveler, I know what he did to you two...it wasn't worth what you did to him by a long shot.</span>\" She said coldly as all 4 girls took a step forward. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">W-what are you gonna...</span>\" Carnivine said before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary was sitting outside, cradling Zorua with one paw to her chest while she very gently pet him with the other. He seemed to be at peace in his sleep right now at least. \"<span class=\"ctan\">You're gonna be okay Zorua...and when you're better we'll play lots, okay? For now, you can rest...i've got you...</span>\" She said gently, knowing that he probably couldn't hear her. Soon enough the other girls stepped out, looking none the worse for wear. \"<span class=\"ctan\">W-what did you do in there?</span>\" Buneary asked. Celebi looked at her and smiled.</span></div></div>",

Hey, you doing okay?</span>\" A gentle voice called to him as he slowly opened his eyes to see Espurr and Gardevoir's giant faces looking over him, both looking relieved. \"Hey...\" He said, as he attempted to adjust himself, which proved to be a mistake as he put pressure on his back paw, making him stifle a scream and immediately collapse into a heap. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Careful! You've been through a lot and aren't healed all the way clearly...</span>\" Gardevoir said as Espurr reached out to gently get him back into a comfortable laying position. \"Yeah...clearly...what happened?\" He asked before the images of Graveler and Carnivine came flooding back into his head, and what happened to him...he suddenly felt ill, and his face paled while Espurr gently pet his back. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">You're fine now Zorua...Celebi, Braixen and Buneary went out to get some supplies and dinner, they'll be back soon. Don't worry, everything is fine...</span>\" She said, seeing his thoughts and trying to soothe him. He wanted to gag, he needed to...to...Espurr shushed him more, still petting, trying to calm him down. He tried to focus on her, and the gentle warm touch on his back. Then his mind shifted...Graveler and Carnivine...he grimaced. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">They won't bother us again, we sorted them out.</span>\" Espurr said gently before Zorua thought and said something that she can't say startled her...but she hoped he wouldn't do this. \"Can they walk?\" He said bitterly, catching Gardevoir's attention again. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Zorua...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can they still walk?\" He repeated, louder and both Espurr and Gardevoir gave him a sad look. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes, we roughed them up a bit but gave them a firm threat to stay away, we can't do more than that.</span>\" Espurr said before continuing. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">And no, I can see your thoughts, i'm not going to lecture you on them. Honestly...I can't and won't blame you for feeling how you feel right now, not this time, but all the same we can't let you act on those desires.</span>\" She said, still petting him and he just sat there angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me my size back...i'll dig a pit, sharpen some stakes...oh they'll get theirs, RIGHT UP THEIR-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">We're back~</span>\" Buneary sang as she entered the room seeing that Zorua was awake. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Zorua! Are you okay?</span>\" She got close and leaned her face in to see his dark expression. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Um...Zorua?</span>\" She asked, a bit more awkwardly this time before he shook his head and tried to smile back. \"Yeah, i'm...well, no...i'm not fine...but i'm not with those two anymore so that's a marked improvement.\" He said, trying to at least curb his thoughts around the younger pokemon. 'Get a grip...get your size back...and then take care of it discretely...' He thought, though he knew Espurr could see all of this anyway. \"<span class=\"corange\">You're an open book squirt.</span>\" Braixen said from a corner, as she and Celebi had also entered the room. \"<span class=\"corange\">Though in this case you and I are on the same page...all the same though, there are more important things to worry about now. Get some food in you and get yourself some rest before trying anything like what i'm sure you have in mind.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group ate, trying their best to put up small talk, and Zorua attempted at least to get some food in him, but the nausea and intense desire to get even were overwhelming. He managed to keep it down though at least, and was grateful to have survived at all...soon enough though, the subject came back around to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So...are you good to go Zorua?</span>\" Braixen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, how's...your chest? And your legs?</span>\" Celebi asked, almost afraid of the answer. He looked away for a second. \"My chest is fine...my front leg hurts but it's not so bad...my back one...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">He tried to put pressure on it and collapsed from the pain.</span>\" Espurr said sadly. Zorua just nodded, and Celebi looked glum. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I see...</span>\" She said sadly. She healed him up as best as she could manage, but the break on the back one must've been pretty damn serious. \"<span class=\"corange\">Well...Zorua, i'm truly happy that we got there in time. And...those guys, don't worry about 'em, okay? They won't come around again, and if they do...then you and I, we can do something about it, but until then, take it easy and try to heal and let Celebi and Espurr take care of you.</span>\" Braixen grinned as she got up. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">They come near us again and i'm making them the size of gnats.</span>\" Celebi said frankly, those were the words she had for them when they parted. Braixen nodded \"<span class=\"corange\">Buneary, I need to get you home, you have plans with your mom tomorrow, right?</span>\" She said as the younger pokemon looked at Zorua and nodded. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Okay...please get better Zorua...</span>\" The younger pokemon said, before pecking him on the cheek and taking off with Braixen. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Get better and we'll play okay?</span>\" She said cheerfully as the two exited the room. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You gonna hang around Gardevoir? Espurr?</span>\" Celebi asked and the two nodded. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">For a bit longer, yeah, I need to head out in an hour though.</span>\" Gardevoir said before Celebi got up. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">We got some sweets and tea while we were out, is that good for you Zorua?</span>\" He slowly nodded, still processing everything that was happening. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You'll be okay Zorua...right as rain, just give it time to heal.</span>\" Celebi said, trying to cheer him up. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Take it slow Zorua, you're mad, you're hurt, and you need rest. Try to focus on that.</span>\" Espurr said gently as he tried to get his mind off of Graveler and Carnivine, still...</span></div></div>",

And get well soon!</span>\" she said to Zorua before heading to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they heard it closing, the remaining three pokemon sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Seriously Zorua...</span>\" she tried, but was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi.

She feared that, if he found it even slightly amusing, he would have started pranking yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his progress would have been destroyed by a single bad choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she knew - she couldn't do anything to stop her friend and boyfriend now. He was normal-sized now and, unless Celebi was willing to shrink him down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't going to happen, at least not for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr lowered her head, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of my head.\" he said while walking closer to the psychic-type,<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Dumb girls... and that sack of crap Zorua...</span>\" Graveler grunted, feeling his stone body in so much pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Why d'you think they were protecting him...?</span>\" Carnivine wondered from beside him while repeatedly touching his scorched mouth, right where Braixen had burned him with her staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stone friend was instead slammed around by Gardevoir, only to be then psychically tortured by Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small psychic-type never looked so angry... no, angry wasn't the right word. Murderous seemed more fitting. Only when she was pulled away by her three friends she had finally stopped, though not before having warned the two about the consequences that would have occurred if they ever got close to them or Zorua again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">I dunno.</span>\" Graveler grunted.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">That little pest must have-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talkin' about me boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon looked up to see a certain fox standing on the other side of the abandoned lot where their shed was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was wearing a sadistic grin, his eyes seemed to shoot fiery sparkles, his canines shined sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had to get the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be incredibly sweet. Not only he would have gotten payback, but he would have also taken out some of his lingering, annoying frustration from the messed up show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rude to talk behind people's backs, y'know. Mommy never taught you manners, Graveler?\" he snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot caring if his body was still sore, the stone pokemon sprang on his feet, seething.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">You!</span>\" he hissed poisonously,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">I don't know how you got back to normal, but ya made the biggest mistake of your useless life! You're dead!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua faked a look of stupor, before he began snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF you can catch me, stone-head!\" he shouted in response while turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either Graveler or Carnivine could speak, Zorua bolted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarling, the stone pokemon got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Get him!

Let's go!</span>\" Carnivine agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout adding another word, both sprinted behind Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the fox was more agile than them, but he kept going at a relatively slow speed so his chasers could keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to, it was part of his grand plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran through the whole village with the two chasing him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he ran out of town and one direction of his forest, both Graveler and Carnivine barely keeping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, the dark-type stopped and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth his chasers stopped as well, panting and growling at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come at me boys! Or are you afraid of little ol' me?\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis statement only caused both his opponents to growl as they sprinted towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got closer and closer, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua flew back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Flew.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarnivine and Graveler blinked as they stepped where Zorua was shortly ago, but couldn't think about it too much, before the ground beneath them suddenly gave away, causing them to sink deep into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was released from the psychic grip that held him and rushed to the edge of the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>OW!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combined scream resounded as Graveler and Carnivine landed on their butts on broken glass and sharp rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua peered into the pit, while behind him Espurr and Celebi came out of a few bushes, the first wearing her usual deadpan, if not dejected look, the second with a triumphant smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything broken, guys?\" Zorua exclaimed, his voice echoing around the pit,<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl replied to his taunt, mixed with a scream of pain. Carnivine apparently placed his vines on the broken glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">When I get back up there Zorua, I'll-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever said that you're coming back up here?\" Zorua interrupted Graveler's threat while looking back at his two companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's eyes began glowing as a large pile of soil began hovering in mid-air and above the opening of the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shot a malicious grin to the two prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraveler and Carnivine had their jaws wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">No...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbgreen\">Grav...!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile fell straight into the pit, blocking the only exit its two captives had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua let out a howl of sadistic glee as he watched them disappear from his sight, their muffled screams ringing in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" he laughed manically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis revenge was complete!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... They'll suffocate down there, you know.</span>\" Espurr chimed in a lecturing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">A ground-type and a grass-type?

Zorua was thinking about-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi adopted a confused expression - what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stared Celebi down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going back to being small Celi. You saw what happened, and I'm not letting it happen again. Not a chance in hell!\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr felt like she was kicked in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">B-But Zorua... when you're small...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, me staying at your place, alright.\" Zorua interrupted with a blush.<br>\r\n\"But you said your dad is never home, no? It'll be fine, Espurr.\" he said, before looking elsewhere.<br>\r\n\"And if you don't want, I'll just come living right back here. I don't mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But Zorua, think about it! We're your friends, we'll protect you from... from...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything?\" the fox completed, before shaking his head,<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I appreciate that, but I'll protect myself as well if I'm big. I'm sorry, but I'm not going back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But... didn't you say...?</span>\" Celebi recalled the dark-type's previous decision, but he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... changed my mind. I'm better off like this.\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr didn't know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Celi...</span>\" she addressed her green friend for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Zorua didn't want to be small again, she couldn't force him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if he was tiny, she could protect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, Zorua seemed to read Espurr's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. But I'm not going back.\" he stated firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small psychic-type looked down wordlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, all she could do was hope Celebi managed to convince Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the fairy, she too made a decision.</span></div></div>",

He was contemplating that last look Espurr gave him before looking down then tried to get up, only to collapse again with his leg and wincing. \"Ghh....I can't let this go unabated Espurr...I need to get those two...\" He grunted, looking back at his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You are not helping him by offering his size back for the express purpose of getting revenge in this one specific instance Celebi.</span>\" Espurr said plainly as the two entered her kitchen and Celebi huffed. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">In this instance I don't think Zorua is out of his bounds to want a little payback!

I can see things you can't when it comes to this Celebi, and I know things about him that you don't. Being blunt, enabling him is the exact thing that will set him back on the path that you pulled him away from in the first place, which you did through kindness and remorse of your own actions, not getting revenge on him, which was your original intent.</span>\" Espurr stated, leaving Celebi to think for a moment before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Those two though...they deserve this, no amount of kindness would get them to stop what they do.</span>\" Celebi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Hence you threatening them and us roughing them up. I'm not thinking about what's fair here, what they did wasn't, and i'd love nothing more than to hurt them...but what's important right now is being a good friend, and a good friend wouldn't let him do what he wants to do right now, they'd keep him company, keep him healthy, and keep him safe. Even if you gave him his size back right now, he's wounded inside and out, he still has a hurt leg, and is a complete miasma of chaos, vengeance, and confusion in his mind. But ultimately, it's your call Celebi, I can't give him or take away his size, only you can.</span>\" Espurr was doing her best to keep a level voice and Celebi just looked away before sighing, and giving Espurr her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two came back in the room, Zorua figuring that Espurr was trying to talk Celebi out of giving him his size back. He couldn't read her expression though, which he was used to by now, Celebi slowly approached the bed and gave him an answer.</span></div></div>",

He didn't mind it, though he knew the younger pokemon was more eager to play than to get food, and he definitely noted that during the travel time back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">So Zorua, how long are you thinking of staying that size anyway, if you're doing it of your own volition right now?</span>\" Meloetta inquired from somewhere behind him and Buneary. He was about to respond until. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">He isn't sure yet, he thinks that right now his situation is more beneficial not only for him, but those around him.</span>\" Espurr said. \"Seriously!? Stop doing that!\" He called out, not seeing her small smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Well, it seems regardless of feelings, Espurr still enjoys messing with you~</span>\" Gardevoir sang out, immediately making Espurr fall back to her default and start blushing, Zorua flushing red as well. Buneary was giggling as well looking at the small pokemon in her paws. \"<span class=\"ctan\">That's still so cute Zorua~</span>\" She said as he tried to make himself smaller in her paws. \"Yeah yeah...\" He muttered, wanting them to change the subject, but he was in luck as Celebi's house was in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Alright, we'll grab a quick lunch and then we can enjoy the outdoors some more, alright?</span>\" Braixen said to Buneary who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I've got stuff for sandwiches and some chips as well, so feel free to help yourselves!</span>\" Celebi said smiling as the group entered the kitchen, Zorua finding himself on Celebi's table as he watched the giantesses put together the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And you Zorua, what do you want?</span>\" Celebi asked before Espurr called out from somewhere behind her. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Don't worry, i'm taking care of it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Oh, have what he wants in your mind already, that's so kind of you Espurr~</span>\" Gardevoir said, eliciting more giggles. Espurr said nothing in response and Zorua couldn't see her face before a small amount of meat, cheese, bread and a chip was placed in front of him, no veggies he noted. \"Thank you thank you!\" He grinned as he started to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">So he was a trouble maker huh? Seems hard to believe from what i've seen of him.</span>\" Meloetta noted, Espurr looking at her thoughts. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">You think he's an awkward goof with a good heart huh? That sounds about right.</span>\" She smirked making Zorua gulp a bit and give her an annoyed look. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well, that's certainly what I would say he is too, at least now...you have made a lot of progress Zorua, regardless of your own feelings on it...even that moment of weakness last night you already regret...you can seriously grow back if you want to for today.</span>\" Celebi said, trying to reassure him before he shook his head. \"No, this is fine for now...I can eat more like this.\" He joked, trying to move them off of this. 'I wish I was just an awkward goof with a good heart.' He thought sadly, as the revenge ideas briefly flitted through his head and he smirked bitterly. 'Oh well, i'll deal with that later, for now I feast!' He thought as Espurr smiled a bit sadly at him.</span></div></div>",

It's no normal song though - it is an enchanting sound, almost heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the clearing falls under Meloetta's spell as she keeps singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's mind is soon ridded from all the vengeful thoughts and is replaced by the sweet song.

Espurr's huge huge house, and not only from Zorua's point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small psychic type stops.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I actually live here...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta's face lits up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Really?</span>\" she asks with sudden excitement.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">But that means we're neighbors!</span>\" she chimes, turning around to point at a shortly distant house... if house it could be called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Espurr's house was a palace, Meloetta's house could be compared to a small royal palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was huge, with an immense yard in the front. Looking better, Zorua could see a sculpture shaped like a musical note in front of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" he mumbles, mouth wide open.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I've always wondered who could have owned that...</span>\" Espurr says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Ironic, because I've always wondered who could have owned this~</span>\" she says cheerfully while grabbing Espurr in a hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Neighbors~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an idea springs up in Meloetta's mind.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Hey, why don't you come with me? I can show you my house if you'd like~</span>\" she kindly suggests while releasing Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, let's do this, I gotta see it!\" Zorua says while fidgeting in Espurr's grasp to turn around and face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic type remains silent for a moment, seeming to be thinking, before she responds.</span></div></div>",

And extremely clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a huge bed that occupied at least half of the room, bookshelves in there as well, a personal TV and a desk with several music sheets on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr went from deadpan to amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Wow...</b>\" both Espurr and Zorua said in amazement while Meloetta giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">You like it?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes.

She just nodded as she finished peeling and took off a tiny bit of the orange and set it down for him. 'quiet...' Zorua thought but Espurr picked up on it and said. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Sorry, just a little tired myself, though I know you're far worse right now.</span>\" She said before he grinned. \"I've still got plenty of energy in the tank, I could go for hours!\" He said before she let herself give him a small smile. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">You don't need to try and impress me you know, the effort isn't necessary and I can always see in your mind anyway.</span>\" He just looked away for a sec before he started to eat his tiny bit of orange.

I imagine this whole thing is rather uneven considering the size difference.</span>\" She giggled a bit more and he flushed. \"Hey, maybe you're great at hiding, who knows...\" He said before she set him down on the bed. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Okay, okay. I suppose we can give it a shot. You can hide first then...</span>\" She said as she got up and picked him up yet again, setting him on the floor where she absolutely towered over him. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I won't read your mind, YOU won't use any illusions, and you'll hide from me until I give up or find you.</span>\" Psychically the doors on the floor they were on opened up, including her bedroom door effectively giving Zorua access to the upstairs. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Don't go near the stairs Zorua, that's the main thing, and if you're in danger of being underfoot around me holler, I don't care if it upsets the game. That's it...you've got 60 seconds.</span>\" She said deadpan as he took off, eager to find somewhere to hide. 'Heh, let's see what I can find.' He thought as he made a mad dash for another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr was starting to realize a few inconveniences afforded to her right now. One, her house was annoyingly big and full of nooks and crannies, even up here. Two, not being able to read his mind irked her due to the sheer fact that she wasn't used to being in the dark. And last, her either friend or boyfriend was tiny enough and smart enough to take full advantage of the first two inconveniences and seeing in his mind or no, she knew that he knew that too. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">This is ridiculous...</span>\" She muttered as she finished up looking in the room she was currently in and sighed, making her way to the next one. Was this a way to get back at losing the ball game for a full hour and a half? Or him just innocently wanting to play a game? She had no idea and she really WANTED to know. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Maybe a peak...</span>\" She thought, she could look in his mind and...no, he wasn't cheating with illusions, right? So why should she cheat with...wait...WAS he not cheating with illusions? \"<span class=\"cgrape\">It's possible...</span>\" She thought. Zorua was nice and truly genuinely liked her and playing with her, but he still had a conniving side to him, and she was keenly aware of that. But if he wasn't cheating and she looked in his head, how would that make her feel? Hmm...\"<span class=\"cgrape\">This is tough...</span>\" She muttered, almost whining before deciding...</span></div></div>",

If he wasn't cheating and she found out where he was hiding, he wouldn't be so pleased...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Espurr gave a sigh as she started walking around the quiet house while searching for her tiny friend, or boyfriend or whatever he was to her - she still was very unsure about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zorua, he was feeling quite proud of himself. He managed to find a truly nice hideout, nestled in between the cushions of a rather large couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr would never find him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was extremely hard to hide for the small fox. He had to climb up on top of the couch and, being a quadruped pokemon, he couldn't grip the leather properly. So, the tiny fox had to use his mouth to climb. It was particularly hard, mainly because he couldn't breathe. Plus, the leather tasted horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he eventually got to the top and dug his way in between the soft cushions, silently snickering to himself. How he managed to get up there before Espurr checked the living room, he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snuggled further into the cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before Espurr walked into the living room, causing Zorua to choke back any sigh of relief he meant to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr started walking around the big room, checking beneath a coffee table and in a bookshelf that belonged to her dad... but there was absolutely no trace of Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr sighed as she went sitting on the couch, completely unaware of Zorua. For a brief moment, she thought if Zorua could be actually hiding ON the couch... but she discarded the idea... Zorua was too small to climb onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the room dejectedly, suddenly hating the fact that she was all alone in there.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Zorua?</span>\" she called out, her voice echoing around the house.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Wherever you are, come out! I give up!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, she pretty much expected him to appear out of nowhere after an illusion was dispelled... but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">So he wasn't cheating... good.</span>\" Espurr muttered to herself as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle she did know that she was actually sitting ON Zorua's pillow, making it hard for him to climb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Espurr!\" he called from behind her as he tried to crawls his way out of the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he finally managed to surface from the leathery trap, collapsing next to a very surprised looking Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... You were there the whole time?</span>\" the giantess asked. He nodded slowly, in a proud manner.<br>\r\n\"Clever, huh?\" he self-praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smiled, gently picking him up, setting him on her lap before starting to pet slowly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yes Zorua. Admittedly, that was truly clever...</span>\" she quietly admitted as the small dark pokemon sighed from her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr then stopped.<br>\r\n\"Aw!\" Zorua complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Relax... I think you do deserve a small reward for winning this, you know...</span>\" Espurr said while suddenly blushing, gently picking the fox from her lap and lifting him up, holding him in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Espurr leaned forward, gently pecking his head for a few moments before pulling back. Zorua smiled at her, pushing his head against her furry cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I agree with you,</span>\" she said while checking his thoughts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You living here with me might actually be fun.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded.<br>\r\n\"Y'know Espurr, that was fun!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"But what do we do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr looked at the fox for a moment, before responding.</span></div></div>",

Zorua just smirked at this. \"Right right, just make it somewhere I can at least get to or make it possible for me to find you.\" Espurr looked at him. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well I know that of course.</span>\" She said as she set him down on the ground and got up, heading for the door. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Don't come after me for 60 seconds.</span>\" She said as he eagerly started counting. \"I'm gonna be two for two.\" He smirked, ready to find her.

Regardless of size! \"Man...no wonder she didn't find me, let alone me finding her...\" He muttered to himself, trying to keep from being bored looking for her. It didn't help that this much traversal was making him more tired than he already was. That bed was sounding really nice right about now...he left his musings on that behind though and tried to bury it, he couldn't quit now! His thoughts though were interrupted by his own yawn. \"Man...\" He muttered, if he didn't find her soon he just might throw in the towel. He entered a small closet in one of the rooms and tried to look around for her some more before sighing. He looked up and found...</span></div></div>",

Her huge, huge bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her eyes, the blankets are psychically lifted as she leaps onto the mattress and laying down, setting Zorua down on her chest before releasing her psychic grip on the bedsheets, which fall back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess reaches for the glass of water she left on the nightstand and takes a sip, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, reading Zorua's thoughts, she nears the glass to him. He sighs as he leans forward, taking a few sips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr smirks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I won't stop reading your thoughts...</span>\" she says, placing the glass back on the nightstand and laying her head on a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should before I think something I would regret...\" he comments, making Espurr giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well... sleep tight.</span>\" she says, her paws clasping around the dark fox.<br>\r\n\"You too...\" he responds as she leans forward, pecking his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, both dark type fox and psychic type cat relaxed, enjoying each other's company... well, Zorua enjoyed it a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr's chest was warm, smooth, and the beats of her heart crafted a sweet lullaby that soothed him. The tiny dark type yawned again, before he finally started to drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr took notice of that and smiled, her paws gripping Zorua tighter. The fox now lived with her in the big, almost deserted house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">This is gonna be... interesting...</span>\" she mumbled to herself, before she too fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't thinking of much but Espurr was back really quick as she gently picked him up and brought him to the levitating glass. Slowly he took a drink and she set him back down. \"Dreams...\" He muttered before coughing. \"So what's the plan today Espurr?\" He asked and she just gave him an incredulous look. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">The plan is that you aren't leaving this bed Zorua, that's the plan. Your mind is an incoherent jumble and your body is weak right now.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i'm a conflicted revenge seeking prankster and i'm also the size of a doll, both of those check out on that statement.\" He chuckled before having a coughing fit. She gave him a sympathetic look. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Not what I meant, look, why don't I go see if I have some medicine, just...sit tight.</span>\" She said as she got up. He leaned back against the pillow she set him next to in response as she went to check if she had any medicine he could use...which was pretty much just liquids. She wasn't gonna even try to talk about the recurring dreams with him right now. Especially since she was sure that was a fever dream. Looking in her cabinets she only found pills, which there was no way he could use. She sighed in frustration as she went to at least get him a bit of fruit to see if that'd help. She ate most of the banana she grabbed quickly before grabbing a tiny bit left to take to him. When she got back she saw that he had tried to get under her cover to warm up a bit. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Oh, sorry Zorua! You've got the shivers, right?</span>\" She said sympathetically as she helped lift it up for him to get under. \"Heh, first time something like that has slipped by you...\" He said and she bit her lip. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Like I said, you're mind is incoherent right now...i'm not in there. Here, I brought you this, potassium.</span>\" She said as she handed him the bit of banana. \"...Espurr, that's a banana, not whatever you just said.\" And she rolled her eyes. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Just eat...I need to see if I can go buy some medicine you can take.</span>\" And Zorua sat up at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espurr, you don't need to go get anything, this sort of thing happened from time to time in my forest, after a few days I bounced back on my own.\" He said as he coughed again. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Yeah, and I assume it happened often because you didn't take care of yourself. Seriously Zorua, it's not trouble, i'm just gonna head to the village real quick and grab some, okay? It's what friends are for.</span>\" She smiled at him and he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Friends? Not more?</span>\" He chuckled a bit more before going into another coughing fit. \"You're delirious, not all there, and we aren't talking about this right now.\" Espurr said as she went to get up, pulling a chair forward and stacking a few things on it with the glass of water at the top so Zorua could access it, then turning her lights off psychically and going to her door. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Try and get some rest, okay?</span>\" She said as she shut the door, leaving him in silence. He leaned back, his head still pounding as he slowly ate at his bit of banana. Soon he had finished it and found himself drifting off again, ready to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Espurr only mentioned her dad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">What did I say about the stairs, Zorua?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gave a startled cry as he turned around, noticing Espurr staring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Espurr...\" he stuttered as the giantess pointed behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... You left the door open.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr gently bent as she picked Zorua up and walked out of the room, closing the door behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Espurr... I'm sorry...\" he said from her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis call went unanswered as she simply kept walking. Espurr climbed down the stairs and walked towards her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent, deadpan, she moved up to her bed, gently putting Zorua down on top of a pillow, before turning around and leaving the room... not before having closed the door as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I don't understand.\" Zorua mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n\"It was only a painting! I mean, it's not like I knew!... But... Guess she did tell me to not go there after all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the fox's sensible ears detected the noise of water running and he assumed that Espurr was showering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense, he had her running for a while, she must have been sweating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still... I don't get why she's acting like that...\" the fox mumbled dejectedly as he looked around the huge room... it looked so empty with only an extremely tiny dark type as its current occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like even the room itself was disappointed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, fully aware that, when Espurr came out of the shower, he'd have to confront her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA terrible fear overwhelmed his mind... what if Espurr didn't want to be with him anymore after that? What if she threw him out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could he survive all alone at that size? He would have to get Celebi... but how could he make it to the village? Even if he did, he would have to slip past the villagers, who hated him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, perhaps, he could get Meloetta's help... she lived right next to Espurr...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus... why do I keep ending in these situations...? Now Espurr's mad, I know it...\" he said dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">... No, Zorua, I'm not mad.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at the door, seeing it opening to let Espurr walk inside, a towel wrapped around her small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espurr...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess sighed as she walked towards the bed and climbed on it and sat next to Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered herself to give the tiny fox a small peck on the cheek, causing him to blush.<br>\r\n\"I... uh... take it you don't want to throw me out...?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic giantess sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">No Zorua... don't know how can you even think about it...</span>\" she reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Espurr laid on the bed and kept quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence fell into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua just sat down next to the psychic giantess, who laid motionless on the bed, thinking to herself. Zorua had discovered about her mom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe DID tell him to stay away from the stairs... she wasn't sure how to feel... maybe it wasn't such a big deal... but, still, Zorua disobeyed her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was interrupted as Zorua cleared his throat, breaking the silence. Her mind quickly found his as she instantly discovered what he was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... so...\" Espurr interrupted him as she read his thoughts and responded...</span></div></div>",

He missed her already...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly shook the thought off, but Espurr was now talking without stopping, without paying any mind to his thoughts,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Mom really did it, you know. She moved to another city. She stills writes me a lot, says that if I ever get tired of being alone I can go find her... that she missed me more than anything, and also misses dad after all... she doesn't know that I'm <i>all</i> but alone.</span>\" Espurr mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess went quiet, but blushed slightly at her last sentence. Zorua blushed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed with the two laying there, Espurr wrapped up in her towel despite the fact that she was completely dry and Zorua laying against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point though, Espurr finally removed the towel from her body and unceremoniously threw it aside; before Zorua could process the action, the titaness grabbed him and laid him on top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after embracing the dark-type fox, Espurr began getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to the upper side of the bed and psychically pulled the covers, before she slid beneath them, Zorua firmly held in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelekinetically, Espurr wrapped herself in the covers again, letting the soft fabric fall all over Zorua, who was surrounded by heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Espurr,\" he broke the silence in a sorrowful tone, though he still couldn't understand why she was doing all of that when her mother was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even know his mom, and was perfectly fine with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr read this, but remained silent, finding her boyfriend's obliviousness adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're not mad?... I'm really really sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr sighed as the lights were psychically switched off.</span></div></div>",

Though something came up to Zorua. \"Wait, what about Celebi?\" Zorua ask as he knows how protective she has been to Zorua after the incident, as well as clingy since she has been treating him like a snuggle buddy for the last day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Oh I'm sure she's willingly to let you go with Espurr.</span>\" Gardevoir says with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, something tells me she's want to think about this.\" Zorua say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty mintues before Espurr, Braxien, and Buneary woke up from their sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, my tiny roommate has a crush on Espurr.</span>\" Celebi squels in joy once she heard Zorua asking if he could spend time with Espurr and hugs him to near death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....only said...could I spend time.... at Espurr's....\" Zorua struggles to say as he could feel the life coming out of him to the point he's going to evolve into a ghost pokemon if Celebi hugs him any tighter, which she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And it doesn't take a genius to figure out why.</span>\" She says with a smirk as she looks at Zorua, whose gasping for air right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Zorua and I had a nice talk a few hours ago. I figure we would want to discuss this with you while Espurr is still asleep and unable to read Zorua's thoughts.</span>\" Gardevoir says with a smile. Though she gasp a little when she realized what she just said. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">That's right, how are we going to keep Espurr from reading Zorua's mind during the duration with her?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua forgot about Espurr's habit and got nervous of the idea that she would figure out long before he could at least mention anything to Espurr. Though he also remembers that Espurr promise to try to stay out of his head. \"I don't think i have to worry about that, me and her talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">In that case,</span>\" Celebi says as she sets Zorua down. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You just need to think of how to spend your time with your crush.</span>\" Celebi says with a smirk as she looks at Zorua. The comment made the tiny fox flabbergasted amd his face flare up so much that he couldn't think of something snarky to say. Unfortunately, Celebi left before she could say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be regretting my decision a little.\" Zorua says as he felt very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Too late to turn back now.</span>\" Gardevoir says with a giggle as she is enjoying every moment of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a hour later after everyone ate, though for Zorua's case, he had to eat at Celebi's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well, see you girls later.</span>\" Braixen says to everyone as Buneary follows the tall fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">It was fun spending time with all of you. I hope we can do this again soon.</span>\" Buneary says, clearly enjoying the sleepover with the girls and Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'm sure we will, let's go</span>\". Braixen says with a smile as she and Buneary wave the group bye. The girls and Zorua wave back as the two left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Well, I must be heading home now.</span>\" Espurr says as she packs her stuff. \"<span class=\"cviolet\">It was fun sleeping over with all of you.</span>\" She says with her usual monotone voice. She looks at Zorua and she started to smile. \"<span class=\"cviolet\">See you later Zorua. Try to not get snuggle to death by Celebi.</span>\" She says, deadpan as always. She was about to leave when Celebi stops her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Actually Espurr,</span>\" Celebi says in a cheery voice, as she plucks Zorua and heads to the small psychic pokemon. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Zorua here wants to ask you something in person.</span>\" Zorua got extremely nervous once all eyes were looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr was rather curious about what Zorua wants to talk about that she was about to read Zorua's thoughts until she remember her little promise with Zorua last night. \"<span class=\"cviolet\">What do you wish to ask?\"</span> Espurr askas she leans in closely to Zorua, making him more nervous. The fluster nervous fox struggle to gather his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....can i.....spend some time....at your place...?\" Zorua struggles to blurt out the question that he thought Espurr's gaze would do him in. Speaking of Espurr, the question took a while to set in Espurr's mind that she thought she imagine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">...s-sorry, but... can you say that again.</span>\" Espurr says, clearly now nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, i want to spend some time at your place....of that's ok.\" Zorua says more clearly, but had to advert his eyes a little to say it. Though, as nervous as the fox was, he was nowhere near as nervous as Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Um...um...\"</span> Espurr, probably for the first time in her entire life, struggle to find any words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Espurr?</span>\" Celebi and Gardevoir looks at the small psychic and wonder if she is ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">GOTTOTHINKABOUTTHISBERIGHTBACK!</span>\" Espurr says so quickly that the group didn't had time to understood what she says as she bolts out the door....and the house....and a nearby tree until she was quite the distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">....</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">....I think that question broke her.</span>\" Gardevoir says as she and Celebi never seen Espurr act like that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">S-sorry about that...</span>\" Espurr says as she walks back into Celebi's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I take it you came with a decision?</span>\" Celebi ask, though nervous of asking as she has no idea if Espurr will bolt off again and break something else in the house. Espurr didn't say anything as she nods her head and extendes her arm out a little towards Zorua. Zorua sees this and jumps into Espurr's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">I...I'll glady let you stay with me for a bi</span>t.\" Espurr says with a nervous smile and a large blush across her face. Gardevoir and Celebi smiles as they are glad for Espurr. Zorua smiles as well, though he duck his head a bit as he blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving goodbye to Celebi and Gardevoir, the two small pokemon head their way out. It would be a wee bit before the two makes it to Espurr's home, the two didn't talk as they were extremely nervous. About twenty minutes of awkward silence, they finally reach Espurr's home</span></div></div>",

The fire type took the tiny dark type in her palms, making his heart skip a beat even more as he shut his eyes. 'This is it...just be brave Zorua....'

Thanks for letting us stay for the night, Celebi.</span>\" she says, starting to head to the door, stopping to give Braixen and Zorua a smirk.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">And good luck.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr disappears out of the door, leaving the two foxes blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Just what was she-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Well! I gotta go home too now! See you all around~</span>\" Gardevoir interrupts Celebi as she too walks towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives Braixen and Zorua an excited gaze while slowly bending to make eye contact with Zorua.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Let me know everything. EVERYTHING.</span>\" she says, before walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Just what was she-</span>\" Celebi desperately tries to talk, but Braixen interrupts her,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I've gotta go too - come on Buneary, I'll bring you home,</span>\" she hastily says, grabbing the bunny's paw with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh and... mind if I take Zorua for a while? I'll bring him back... uh... tomorrow,</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looks even more confused for a moment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... It's his choice to make.</span>\" she manages to blurt out in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... See ya later!\" Zorua exclaims from his perch on Braixen's paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Bye Celebi~ thanks for letting us stay!</span>\" Buneary chimes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah, thanksforeverythingbye!</span>\" Braixen hastily says before exiting the bedroom, leaving Celebi standing in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she hears the front door closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy blinks a few times, before shaking her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He's gonna have to give a LOT of explanations whenever he gets back...</span>\" she sighs, before heading for her kitchen to get something to eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blushes upon their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr and Gardevoir's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's eyes widen in shock.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">NO way...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Braixen, why is Zorua coming with us?</span>\" Buneary asks, skipping beside Braixen as they head to the bunny's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen blushes, but quickly shakes it off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">He... uh... he's coming with me... we're going... uh... shopping!</span>\" she quickly makes up an excuse... before thinking that it wasn't a bad idea. That would be a good way to bond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuneary giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence falls among the small group as Braixen and Buneary keep walking, Zorua simply sitting onto Braixen's paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, there was no one on the road to Buneary's house, so Braixen could keep her tiny passenger out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the trio arrives to the bunny's house.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Sure you don't want to get some breakfast, Braix?</span>\" she asks while hopping to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">No Buneary... I... we need to go now. Take care!</span>\" Braixen responds while kneeling to hug Buneary, careful to keep Zorua out of the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remain locked for a few moments before pulling off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">See you soon you both~</span>\" Buneary chimes while opening the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, waving goodbye, she disappears inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Where are we headed?\" Zorua asked from Braixen's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer having to hold Buneary's paw, Braixen could keep him restrained in a hug - mainly to keep him out of eyesight from the inhabitants of the village, but also because she found it extremely cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox was walking on an unknown path... unknown to Zorua anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen giggled upon hearing his question.</span></div></div>",

Sorry Zorua, but as much as i'd love to do that too, we're kinda out in the open and...I don't think you could keep up with me right now.</span>\" She finished this last part a bit wistfully, Zorua wanted to push into that, but the way she ended that made him think there was more to that statement than just him or his size. \"Yeah but...watching something?\" He said incredulously before he noted her getting a more passionate look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">It isn't just watching SOMETHING, it's the new Hitmon Hitmon Ha movie! I didn't get to catch it on the big screen and it just came out to buy yesterday! I picked it up but we had the sleepover! Come on, don't you want to see it too?</span>\" She said, surprising Zorua with her...passion for this. \"Uh...I don't know, never seen one.\" Braixen looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You've never seen any of the Hitmon Hitmon Ha movies?</span>\" She said, kinda taken aback before he shrugged. \"I've never seen any movie.\" At this Braixen looked horrified before stopping in her tracks and lifting him up to her face, looking him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Are you for real?</span>\" She asked, as if he just said something that offended her, he was starting to be confused. \"I mean...just never really had the opportunity come along, is it that big of a deal?\" He was seeing a side to Braixen that he didn't expect. She was a movie buff? Odd...at this though her face became fiercely determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I know what we're doing today Zorua, we've got some catching up to do! Don't worry, i'm going to fix this right now!</span>\" She said enthusiastically as she hugged him to her chest again and picked up her pace. \"Wha-hey!\" He said, startled a bit by the sudden movement and increase in speed. 'Oh boy...this is NOT what I had in mind...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was enraptured by the screen in front of him. It was a relatively medium to maybe smallish television for Braixen, but for him it may as well have been like watching it on the big screen. He was in Braixen's lap as she leaned back in a soft chair she had with a small bowl of popcorn kinda watching Zorua's reaction as well as the movie. She had decided to pop the first movie in the series in to get him somewhat familiar with the main characters, Hitmonchan and his young apprentice Tyrogue. Zorua watched action scene after action scene in total awe of what was before him, as Hitmonchan dodged a barrage of 100 punches from a Machamp who was the top enforcer of the villain to lay him out in a single shot, or him take on 16 Throh's to defend the young vagrant Tyrogue before taking him under his protection. The movie started to ramp up with a final challenge from the evil Mienshao and it was taking place on a stormy night at the top of his criminal headquarters. Zorua had a piece of popcorn in front of him, but he'd barely touched it. He couldn't look away. Braixen for her part was seeing something she hadn't seen in Zorua before. '<span class=\"corange\">Wow, he's really kinda innocent in his own way...</span>' She thought, seeing him react with childlike wonder to this. As the credits rolled Braixen gently picked up Zorua to look at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I want to watch the next one.\" He said after a second before mimicking a punch with his front paw. \"That was so cool! Man, the way he took out that Machamp, and how even though Tyrogue was a little punk jerk Hitmonchan still saw the need to help him! That was...\" He got quiet before grinning. \"I loved it!\" Braixen nodded enthusiastically towards him. '<span class=\"corange\">It really resonated with him huh? well okay then.</span>' She grinned before setting him down to get up. \"<span class=\"corange\">Alright, there's about 2 more before the new one, I don't mind marathoning them to get to it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day played out like this as the two pokemon watched the movies enthusiastically together, Zorua absolutely shocked by how much of a good time he was having. After the last one Braixen even started to gush more as they talked about how great it was to see Hitmonchan finally avenge his fallen brother Hitmonlee, about the emotional evolution of Tyrogue into Hitmontop and landing the final blow WITH Hitmonchan. Neither had realized that it was starting to approach dusk before the front door started opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Braixen? I'm home!</span>\" Her mother sounded from a hallway away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh hey mom! Give me a sec, i'll be right there!</span>\" Braixen then grinned at Zorua.</span></div></div>",

A nice big bed, a bookshelf in a corner and a desk. Plus, there were a few pictures of Braixen herself here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua noticed the bigger fox moving to the bed, gently placing him on it. She grinned at him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Now, you stay there and be good,</span>\" she said while gently petting the smaller fox in the head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'll be back.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay.\" by the time Zorua answered, Braixen had already gone out of the door, closing it behind herself, leaving Zorua alone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then he seemed to notice how big and empty that room looked from his point if view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, before sighing and spreading his limbs wide in the soft bed as laid down. Until Braixen was back -  preferably with something to eat - he would be bored to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be quick.\" he mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep himself entertained in the meantime, the small dark pokemon decided to just think about the movies he saw for the whole day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">So? How did the sleepover go?</span>\" Braixen's mother, Delphox, asked as she put a plate of meat in front of her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen beamed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">It was awesome, mom! We even called Buneary over!</span>\" she exclaimed as she started eating, making sure to keep Zorua out of the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have a good reputation in the village after all. And, although Delphox did mention a few times that she pitied him, she always added that she didn't approve his methods. Discovering that said fox was shrunken, in love with her daughter and in the other room would be a little too much to take in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphox giggled as she sat in front of the younger fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">And I assume today you watched that movie you were talking about since it came out?</span>\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen nodded, mouth full.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Avefome.</span>\" she responded, swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind momentarily traveled back to Zorua, and she genuinely smiled thinking about the tiny guest in her bedroom. He looked so innocent in front of that TV, it was an adorable sight to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphox noticed Braixen smiling and smirked herself.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Something's up...</span>\" she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen blushed a bit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I actually watched that movie with a friend...</span>\" she admits. Only to immediately regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Was it a male?</span>\" Delphox asked, leaning a bit closer as her motherly instinct kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen quickly pondered her choices.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... It was Espurr, mom,</span>\" she said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">And why are you blushing then?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen took another bite and shrugged.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Because she's totally weird.</span>\" she said, sounding believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Her dad is really nice,</span>\" Delphox pointed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I know,</span>\" Braixen responded, pulling her chair back, her plate empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen got up, taking a berry from a nearby bowl.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'm going to my room mom,</span>\" she said, heading to her bedroom, smiling at the thought of Zorua waiting for her in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, she wondered what he was doing all alone in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Okay, we agree - the best part was when Tyrogue evolved into Hitmontop,</span>\" Braixen stated as she sat on the bed beside Zorua, who was hungrily biting on the berry she gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Zorua said, looking up with a grin.<br>\r\n\"Hitmonchan told him he wasn't ready yet and when they less expected it, he actually evolved!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Why, that final blow together?</span>\" Braixen said, excited at the memory.<br>\r\n\"So cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen giggled, before yawning as she looked at a nearby clock.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Eight hours straight of movies and the rest of the day gushing about it...</span>\" she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually owe you one now - I never know movies could be that entertaining!\" Zorua chimed as he finished his berry with a satisfied sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen giggled in response.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You should get used to it. Y'know... the whole 'crush' thing...</span>\" she said, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua smiled as he too blushed. Braixen picked him up, gently lifting the bedsheets. The bigger fox then got up, turning off the lights.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">But for now, let's just go to bed...</span>\" she said, sliding under the blanket of her bed, still holding Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed even more.<br>\r\n\"Wait... Are we actually SLEEPING together?!\" he asked. Braixen snickered.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">What's wrong about it squirt?</span>\" she said, hugging him to her furry chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">See ya later, squirt! Sleep well!</span>\" she said cheerfully as she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, leaning his head against her chest, closing his eyes as well. His mind traveled back to the movie... and then, to this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best day ever.\" he mumbled with a grin as he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Wake up squirt!</span>\" a voice chimed, waking Zorua from his slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around drowsily, noticing and indistinct mass of colors in front of him. As his vision started to return, he noticed that it was actually Braixen, in front of the bed, smirking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Mornin' ya sleepyhead!</span>\" she said cheerfully while scooping him up to give him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin'...\" he drowsily responded as he gave a yawn, before smiling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What are we doing today?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... I'm bringing you back to Celebi, squirt, remember?</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua remembered what she was talking about and sighed.<br>\r\n\"Aw...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen smiles sympathetically.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yep. That's pretty disappointing... we were getting along so well...</span>\" she said, mentally asking herself if she could keep Zorua with her a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were going swimmingly between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, from how Celebi acted, Braixen understood that she was quite overprotective about her 'roomie'... and plus, he still had to avoid her mom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, if she got out with him, her mother wouldn't be a problem... and Celebi won't surely be angry if she kept Zorua for a bit more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Right?</span></div></div>",

Still though, we've gotta do this again another time!\" He said and Braixen nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">For sure!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back was relatively peaceful, Braixen kept Zorua concealed to her chest as she made her walk, occasionally looking down when no one was around to check on him. Soon enough though they reached their destination, and Braixen knocked on the door, holding the tiny dark pokemon in her other paw. \"<span class=\"corange\">Seriously though squirt, this was probably the best date i've been on, and that is not something I ever expected to say...definitely the most surprising and interesting one i've had too!</span>\" She grinned, surprising Zorua. Did Braixen do this a lot? He suddenly felt...awkward, though he wasn't sure why. The door was answered soon enough by Celebi, who lit up when she saw the two. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey Braixen! Zorua! So...how'd it go!?</span>\" She asked, giddy as Braixen scratched at her chin a bit with her free paw and shrugged. \"<span class=\"corange\">Went well enough, i'll be seeing you two around for sure.</span>\" She said nonchalantly as she handed Zorua back to Celebi and turned around to head off. \"<span class=\"corange\">Later Celi! Later squirt! I'm looking forward to hanging out again!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's in a hurry...\" Zorua muttered as he felt himself wrapped into a vice hug by Celebi as she hummed and shut the door. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh Zorua~</span>\" She said in a sing song voice as she fluttered to her room, prepared to interrogate him. \"Could you loosen the hug a bit please...?\" Zorua asked, afraid of what was going to happen next. He found himself set on her bed as she got on it, laying on her stomach, head propped up on her paws and gave him a teasing look. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You've got some explaining to do, don't you?</span>\" She said as he gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen was whistling to herself as she walked back down the path to her house. She was honestly kinda surprised at how well that had went. It was pretty casual, nothing like any of the other disasters she'd gone through, and it was with a guy that genuinely seemed into one of the things she really liked. He was full of energy and an enthusiasm that she shared, and it made the hours kinda melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure she could overpower the guy with a finger because of how small he was...and also, it was Zorua. Both of which she'd never have found appealing within the last 48 hours in the slightest. But...she had fun. Her thoughts were interrupted though as she felt an invisible tug on her tail, stopping her in her tracks. Her eyes immediately narrowed. \"<span class=\"corange\">Gardevoir.</span>\" She stated simply, as the psychic hold on her tail released and the pokemon stepped out of the brush to her side to greet the fire fox. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Well hello Braixen, what a coincidence running into you here~</span>\" She said, her eyes, full of sparkling energy completely betraying her ulterior motives. \"<span class=\"corange\">You're not gonna let me go until I tell you what happened, are you?</span>\" Said Braixen as Gardevoir enthusiastically nodded. \"<span class=\"corange\">Fine fine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I just can't believe it Zorua, there are some things in this world that just shock me. And this is one of them. You and Braixen. Never in a million years would I have-</span>\" Celebi was going before Zorua rolled his eyes. \"Well it's true, and honestly I did have a blast with her! One of the best days of my life, easily!\" He said and Celebi grinned. Zorua was getting wound up. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So what'd you two do together~</span>\" Celebi inquired in a teasing manner. \"Well you see, an AWESOME new movie had come out that she wanted to watch and-\" '<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh no, I see where this is going...</span>' Celebi thought as her eyes widened. Maybe Zorua and Braixen WERE strangely alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">-Completed the arc that Tyrogue had been working towards for all 4 movies while Hitmonchan finally found closure himself, it was a perfect conclusion! And so we watched all 4 of them together! It was amazing!</span>\" Braixen said enthusiastically as she accentuated her words with arm motions. Gardevoir for her part was trying hard to keep her smile. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">That's...great...and he shared your enthusiasm?</span>\" Gardevoir said, maintaining a cool voice while Braixen nodded enthusiastically. \"<span class=\"corange\">He had never seen anything like it, so I suggested it! But he adored it too! We were up for hours talking about it!</span>\" Braixen said. '<span class=\"cgreen\">Oh i'm sure...</span>' Gardevoir thought before saying. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">So when's the next date then?</span>\" Genuinely happy that it went well for them, at this Braixen scratched at the side of her head and shrugged. \"<span class=\"corange\">Dunno.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">What do you mean 'dunno!?' It went well right!?</span>\" It was Gardevoir's turn to get passionate and Braixen looked taken aback. \"<span class=\"corange\">Look, i'm not a planner or date keeper, but it'll happen again, okay Gard?</span>\" She said as the psychic pokemon huffed. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Well what are you going to do next time? Any ideas?</span>\" Braixen looked like she was thinking before shrugging again. \"<span class=\"corange\">It was a blast what we did, and I have a lot more movies I could show him!</span>\" She grinned before Gardevoir gave her a flat look. \"<span class=\"corange\">Well it isn't like we can do much together when he's not even big or strong enough to open a door!</span>\" Braixen said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Why don't you go out with him at his regular size then? It isn't like he's incapable of being bigger. It's something to consider.</span>\" Gardevoir said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen contemplated this as well before nodding. \"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah...yeah! That could work! i'll bring it up next time I see them.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then Tyrogue evolved into Hitmontop in a huge emotional climax! And then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay! Okay! I get it! Sheesh, I can definitely see why you and Braixen would hit it off.</span>\" Celebi said as Zorua nodded. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">So when are you gonna hang out with her again?</span>\" Celebi asked, curious and Zorua looked down. \"I don't know...we didn't really talk about it. She seemed in a hurry to get out of here.\" And Celebi sighed. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's just her being her, don't take it as anything more than that. But hey, i'm glad it went well Zorua, when you want to go again, who knows, I could even grow you back for a normal date with her if you want.</span>\" And Zorua fiercely shook his head, confusing Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Why not?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...Braixen likes me now, and she's super cool to be around, but if i'm normal...I dunno, it might make her think of how she felt about me before, when I actually did all of those...nasty things to other pokemon, and what happens if I get the urge to do that again? Then she'd go right back to hating me...\" Zorua said. \"I don't want that! No way!\" And Celebi's look softened. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">You won't do that and she won't feel that way, you're a lot different than the pokemon I thought you were a week ago...and she knows that too...just give it some thought, okay Zorua?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked down and sighed.</span></div></div>",

She had to spend some time alone with her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the front door and walked inside. Her mother wasn't home, so she could freely think about what to do. Surely, she was going to have another date with Zorua, but she wanted to see how it would work if he wasn't actually tiny... maybe the two would even enjoy themselves more. She was definitely bringing up Gardevoir's suggestion whenever she saw Celebi and \u2018roomie\u2019 again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy wait, she thought, she had nothing to do right now. Might as well confront Zorua and Celebi now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall purple fox turned around and exited the way she came in, closing the door behind herself and starting to walk in direction of Celebi's house where Zorua currently resided. She couldn't believe it... all this for the guy she hated the most the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua wasn't bad after all, she truly enjoyed his company yesterday... and she enjoyed the four movies she watched with him for eight hours straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, she thought, this was definitely going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Coming!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened in front of Braixen, a certain fairy appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi flashed a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, Braix, back so soon?</span>\" she asked as she gestured for the vixen to get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen nodded her head, before grinning at her friend.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Celi, where's Zorua?</span>\" she asked, causing the fairy to smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen was practically begging her to tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What? Can't stay more than half an hour without him already?</span>\" Celebi asked jokingly, causing Braixen to blush, the red shade not very unseen on the white fur of her muzzle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... Yeah yeah \u2018roomie girl\u2019,</span>\" she snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled as she guided the vixen to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Braixen spotted Zorua on top of the bed, looking exhausted. She gulped - probably Celebi had interrogated him for the whole time before she came... was she going to do the same to her?! Wasn't the near-hour with Gardevoir not enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, Celebi sat on the bed next to Zorua. Braixen picked him up and sat down where he was.<br>\r\n\"So Braix... why back so soon?\" the fox asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well... kinda had something to say...</span>\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Zorua exclaimed, looking at Celebi.<br>\r\n\"She was tormenting me with the same suggestion!\" the fairy smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen had told them about her encounter with Gardevoir and the chat they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you mean to say that you'd actually like it if I was big while we're out on a date?\" Zorua asked. Braixen nodded.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Of course Zorua! Look, no offense, but you can't do anything like this... and i think we'll do just fine with you being normal.</span>\" she said, Celebi nodding each word that came out of the vixen's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked down at the white palms of his not-actual-friend but not-his-girlfriend-either... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno Braix... what if I start thinking about pranks again? What if I pull pranks while we're on a date?\" he asked, uncertain. Braixen snickered.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'll roast you in both cases.</span>\" she simply said, before standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Now you two... I really need to go... got something to do...</span>\" she lied. This situation was becoming awkward, and she needed to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Zorua said was an actual possiblity... would she forgive him if he pulled another of his pranks? It depended on the prank, she guessed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya Braix... speaking of, when I'm actually seeing ya?\" Zorua asked, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hm...</span>\" she had to think about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow - she was going to hang out with Buneary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after?... That seemed fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire-type smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">A couple days... I'll come pick you up.</span>\" she said, before leaning forward to gently peck the small fox, whose cheeks burned hot, eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen gently put him back on the bed, snickered, waved Celebi goodbye and left the room and, eventually, the house, leaving an excited fairy and an embarrassed fox behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the day... another date with Braixen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sheesh Zorua... It's just a date... you've didn't stand still one minute today...</span>\" Celebi remarked next to him, looking away from her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a date?!\" he asked, disbelieved.<br>\r\n\"Celi-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed. Good thing her mom was at work, Zorua was overexcited. She shut her book and looked at the tiny dark-type, eyes glowing as Zorua grew to his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox snickered as he went to get the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the purple Braixen was waiting outside, smiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I see you're ready Zorua...</span> she said as he walked out. Celebi caught up with the two foxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya later Celi.\" Zorua chimed while Braixen simply smiled at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi waved a paw, silently saluting her friends, before closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked at the fire-type.<br>\r\n\"So? What's the plan?\" he asked, eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen smiled.</span></div></div>",

We were wondering if Celebi is available?</span>\" Braixen said, rubbing a paw on the back of her neck nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well she's here, yeah...Zorua, if you don't mind me asking...why are you here?</span>\" She took a look at the dark type and noted his eye...with a pack tied to it with a pink ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What happened?</span>\" She asked, more concerned now as she got a good look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a sorry story ma'am...Graveler did it.\" Zorua said and the older Celebi eyed him suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You two got into a fight?</span>\" She said in a lecturing tone and Zorua winced at the accusation, but to the Celebi's surprise Braixen interjected. \"<span class=\"corange\">No, Graveler started the fight, Zorua didn't even really attack him beyond a kick to get himself free from Graveler's grasp.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">...Hmm, I see.</span>\" The older Celebi looked at the two teens and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Come in, i'll get Celebi, would you two like some tea? I still want to talk about a few things.</span>\" And with that the two were invited in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were led to the kitchen table as they sat, Zorua having an awkward time as a quadruped, much like earlier as he sighed and Braixen looked over at him while the older Celebi went to get her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">We need to keep quiet about your living situation...</span>\" Braixen whispered and Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I know.\" He muttered. He didn't expect to be meeting with Celebi's mom so quick, and she seemed to be suspicious of him...a fair reaction considering his history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon both Celebi's entered, the younger teen looking slightly nervous as they all sat at the table, the older one preparing tea in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi saw Zorua's eye as she looked at him and gasped, though tried to keep her mother from looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, Braixen...and Zorua, what a surprise.</span>\" She said, trying to play it off and both pokemon greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hey Celi.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Zorua decided to try to keep it impersonal for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\"></span>So Zorua, I know what happened to you with the fight with Graveler, but if you don't mind me asking, why are you two here? I'm surprised to see you with him especially Braixen.\" Celebi's mother asked genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well...truth is Ms C., Zorua and I kinda made peace. He's really settled down lately.</span>\" Braixen said and Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've come to my own realization that my pranks were wrong, i'm trying to make peace.\" Zorua said and he got a genuine smile from the older Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well that's wonderful to hear! I'm happy for you Zorua!</span>\" She said and he nodded, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraixen had an idea at this and voiced it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Actually, I brought Zorua here to get him healed by Celebi, if possible.</span>\" She said and Celebi's mother seemed to have a realization, then nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh, that makes sense. Well alright then.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Celebi returned to the table with 4 cups and set them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Go ahead and have a nice drink, Celebi, do you want to heal the young man?</span>\" And Celebi nodded, trying not to make it too quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out to Zorua with her paw and a gentle glow surrounded him for a second before both pokemon sighed and Braixen helped Zorua get the ice pack off. Celebi was breathing a bit heavy, though it was a pretty minor wound to fix at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to be rid of that...\" Zorua muttered as the 4 pokemon had their tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was way too stressful.\" Zorua complained to the two girls as they stood outside Celebi's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I didn't expect her to get home so early...sorry.</span>\" Celebi said before going to the subject she wanted to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So you and Graveler...</span>\" She said in a threatening tone and Braixen shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">He tried to pick a fight with Zorua, but it was ended quick, hopefully he backs off.</span>\" She said and Celebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">If he doesn't...we can take care of it.</span>\" Celebi said in a foreboding tone and Braixen folded her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Celi, relax, it won't happen again.</span>\" She said and Celebi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Okay.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">...But we did want to ask you something.</span>\" Braixen said, but she noted that Celebi's eyes were glowing and Zorua felt a familiar sensation as the world around him grew and grew. Soon enough the two girls were towering titans to his tiny form, and he was lifted into a hug by Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey!\" Zorua complained and Celebi giggled, Braixen cracked a smile at this too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're just too adorable like this!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Anyways Celi...what we wanted to ask is, mind if Zorua stays with me tonight?</span>\" Braixen said and Celebi pulled Zorua away from the hug to look at both of the pokemon in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Really?</span>\" Celebi asked, seeming a little dejected but Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for tonight Celi! We had a great time today!\" Zorua said enthusiastically but Braixen picked up on Celebi's hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hey, if you want him to stay in tonight, that's fine too.</span>\" Braixen said and Zorua looked back at the fox giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw what...\" He said, but Celebi voiced her answer.</span></div></div>",

He sees nothing that is recognizable, all he see beside the strange land was a vast horizon of green that goes to the sky and beyond. However, Zorua does notice something else about the area, it smells delicous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a roaring thunder could be heard above as something absolutely massive was falling. Zorua looks up and sees something metallic falling down and crashing into the ground. The mere event cause the whole area to shake none stop, but that wasn't the worse. Zorua got up and look at the metallic landscape before it started to rumble and rise up, along with a big chunck of the alien land as well. Little does Zorua knows, he's on Celebi's dinner, and he's about to be part of it if he doesn't do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was thinking to herself, wondering where could Zorua be.

Zorua watch in fear as one by one, large amount of landscape went high to the sky and never return. Soon, there was only one piece of the meal left, and Zorua was on. To make matters worse, the metallic object came crushing down again and was heading to Zorua'd location. Zorua cover his eyes he watch the object ready to crush him. The object made contact, and was about to crush Zorua when it stops at a certain spot. Zorua looks around and saw that he somehow is still alive, but that just make the situation worse as he felt the land he was on rising with him on. The fox felt sick as the g-force of the land rising felt too much. It only got worse as Zorua saw something headong towards him, Celebi's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a slow motion, a strong warm air hits the fox as Celebi opens her mouth and prepare to munch on the food.

Zorua was signaling her where he actually was, and she couldn't hear what he was saying because he was too tiny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, she looked down, glad she hadn't eaten that last bit of food, given that Zorua was on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hold it!</span>\" she cried as she lowered her head into the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scanned the area around the illusionary fox's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart pounded her chest from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he was, a nanoscopic speck on her food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shaky light appeared in Celebi's eyes, causing the illusionary Zorua to open his mouth in a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe illusion faded while the tiniest pokemon that ever existed began growing, and grew until he reached the size of an extremely tiny doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, he was just a bit tinier than a Joltik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could speak though, Celebi removed her plate from under him and got up, before she left her room;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back several moments later and shut the door behind her before locking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then she made her way back to her desk and sat down to observe the tiny fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I was... you were...

It must have been another one of Zorua's victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">H-Hey... are you alright?</span>\" Mesprit with concern as she got closer to take a look at the green pokemon, who was looking quite weak...

She kept flying aimlessly, when a tree suddenly appeared in front of her... and she flew right through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie was sadly unable to stop as she hit a real tree, before falling flat on the ground, feeling extremely dizzy. Her vision blurry, she looked up... and saw a snickering Zorua walking up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, should've seen your face!\" he snickered loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit blinked, stunned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">W-Why...?</span>\" she meekly asked as the dark type lowered himself to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" he parroted back, before laughing in her face.<br>\r\n\"Because it's fun, sweetheart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he started walking away, leaving a dazed Mesprit on the ground...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Because it's fun.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words obsessed Mesprit for days after her encounter with Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe constantly heard his voice in her head telling those simple words, they haunted her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she tried too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first prank was a common one - a pit trap. She lured a pokemon into falling in it and... she surprisingly enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, laughed without stopping for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pranking princess of the village was born... although no one knew her true identity. All the villagers believed that it was Zorua. That worked to Mesprit's advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one knew about her new nature... no one but the same Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type noted Mesprit's actions, he observed her for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, Mesprit found a letter out of her door. A simple sentence was written in it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Meet me in the forest.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did. She went into the forest, following a track of illusions that lead her in a hidden clearing... Zorua was waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Be my partner! We'll be the most infamous pokemon of all time!\u2019 he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she gladly took his offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, you should have seen his face!\" Zorua snickered as Mesprit rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">They still don't know who I am Zorua... and they mustn't.</span>\" she said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And I don't think you mind the fact that I'm the one pulling you out of trouble when pokemon chase you down.</span>\" she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right - I don't.\" he said, raising a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggled as she high-fived her friend, before he walked past her... Mesprit got a devious smirk, her eyes glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, I'll - uh?\" Zorua asked as he turned around, taking notice of something odd... the world around him was growing!... No... he was shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit!\" he cried in panic as he looked at his friend... noticing her with glowing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Zorua shrunk down to the size of a small doll, the blades of grass towering above him. Those, and a certain pink headed pokemon who flew closer as she shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Zorua looked at Mesprit - she was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Cute.</span>\" she commented as she picked him up with psychic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua floated onto her gigantic paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You did this to me?!\" he cried in fear.

As much as your forest is... um... secluded, I don't think it'll do for what we're going to do,</span>\" Uxie said as she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer book was telekinetically lifted from the ground and started floating behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">My house will be a good place... although I'll have to hide you from my sisters...</span>\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the large paw covering him, Zorua perked up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sisters? I didn't know you had siblings...\" he mused, causing Uxie to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You don't know anything about me, do you?</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you know about me?\" he retorted. Uxie giggled,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You're homeless, you have a major superiority complex and yet you're full of insecurities; you try to hide your true self behind that hateful prankster. Quite a weird mix if you ask me.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's jaw hung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the trip to the house of the giantess, the fox went quiet, not finding anything to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie eventually fluttered to a very secluded house; there was a lake nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening carefully, Zorua could hear noise coming from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Your sisters?\" he asked Uxie, who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now Zorua, I'll have to hide you... you're going to collaborate, aren't you?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You know that you technically just kidnapped me, right?\" he retorted,<br>\r\n\"And why do you need to hide me anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">It isn't kidnapping, I did nothing to you so far... aside from shrinking you, I mean. And my sisters... well, it'd be quite complicated to explain this.</span>\" Uxie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nodded. He decided that, if he wanted his size and freedom back, he had to do like Uxie asked. Until the giantess didn't hurt him, it was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Also, I'm quite sure Azelf doesn't like you.</span>\" Uxie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Why?\" the fox asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">She disapproves your pranks... and now,</span>\" Uxie started to float towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua knew he had to play it safe: for a moment, Uxie looked back down, discovering that she was holding a tiny Zorua doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Good thinking.</span>\" she complimented as she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, she spotted a blue pokemon in the living room, sitting on the couch in front of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sis...</span>\" Uxie called, causing Azelf to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh, you're back... where have you been?</span>\" she asked distractedly, before eyeing the doll in Uxie's paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">... Why do you have a Zorua doll?</span>\" she asked again, contempt in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh, ehm, I bought it... it looked cute.</span>\" Uxie sheepishly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What looked cute?</span>\" Uxie's second sibling, Mesprit, chimed in after floating out of another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind his illusion, Zorua stared at the entirely blue pokemon, then at the pink and blue one. Both were similar to the giantess currently holding him, but they had different heads and colors: one was blue and had a pointy head, the other was pink and with four... things hanging from her head. For the rest, the three sisters were identical; they even had the same red jewel on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Zorua felt fear: which one was the Azelf that disliked him? What if Uxie had other sisters? She didn't mention how many siblings she had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaze of the pink-headed pixie suddenly fell on Zorua: she stared at him suspiciously. The blue pokemon noticed, and stared at Uxie in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow-headed pixie blushed, feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... I'm going to my room, I need to do something.</span>\" Uxie hastily stated as she flew out of the living room. Zorua choked back a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looked at Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">... What's wrong with her?</span>\" she asked, looking back at the TV screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I dunno.</span>\" Mesprit lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something weird with the doll Uxie held: since when toys could feel fear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... How many sisters do you have?\" Zorua asked as Uxie reached her room, closing the door behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set Zorua onto a bed with yellow covers. The fox looked around: it was a spacious room, with several bookshelves full of books, a desk and a telescope near a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything suggested what Uxie liked to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Only them. The blue one is Azelf - steer clear of her - the other is Mesprit.</span>\" Uxie explained as Zorua dispelled his illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now Zorua, you stay here while I go get something for us to eat, then we can do something together.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie,\" Zorua stopped her,<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this? When are you going to give me back my size, let me go?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie, who was turning around to float out of the room, stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Zorua, you pulled a lot of mean pranks. Consider this like a harmless punishment.</span>\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So you're basically keeping me cooped up? Like jail?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Not like that... we'll have fun, too! Don't worry, I'll send you on your way,</span>\" she said, turning around again and smirking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sooner or later.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Uxie left the room, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed: how did he end up in this situation?</span></div></div>",

And it was not hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-headed pixie quietly floated over the bed where Zorua was resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But I wonder,</span>\" she continued,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">How come my sister Uxie finds a Zorua doll cute?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA earthquake shook the soft ground under Zorua as the newcomer giantess sat down, making the tiny fox bounce a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But more importantly - how come an object can feel emotions?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua could ask himself what that was supposed to mean, he felt something jabbing his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, his brain frenetically processing the tip of Mesprit's left tail in his side and the smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the fox's eyes could widen, the tail started to swing like a whip, the tip causing  an unbearable tickling sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's cheeks puffed out and became bright red from the struggle to keep himself from laughing; pearly drops of sweat started running down his face, his tiny body started fidgeting involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like he was going to explode, and the tail gave no signs of wanting to stop anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the end, Zorua could do nothing but give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA!\" his mouth roared out a significant laughter for someone his current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled on top of the bed with Mesprit's tail still tickling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"St-Stop! P-Please!\" he stuttered pleadingly as he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his prayer was answered as the swinging tail slowed down, before it stopped completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smirked. Now in front of her was a real Zorua, not a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua kept laughing for a while more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">See? Was that so hard?</span>\" the giantess chimed as the fox finally stopped laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua got a chance to stand up, a large paw came down on him and scooped him up and brought him up to an immense field of pink, interrupted just by a red spot in the middle of two golden lakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua remembered what situation he was in and re-became visibly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh... I-I...\" he quieted down after a few, meek attempts to speak. What was he supposed to even say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I don't think we've personally met. I'm Mesprit,</span>\" the giantess introduced herself, before smirking again,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You don't know me, but I know <i>you</i>... in fact, I don't think there's anyone that doesn't know you. You're a trouble-maker, and quite a mean one too... </span>\" she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no hint of malice in her voice, Zorua noted, just playfulness. A playfulness that almost fell into mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... y-yes...\" Zorua admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let me guess: you somehow shrunk down, and my sister found you, and despite all the things you did to make everyone hate you she brought you home to help you? That's adorable.</span>\" she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But it's not how it went.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua just seemed to notice the third presence in the room; Mesprit quietly turned around to see Uxie putting down a plate of food, before closing the door and accurately locking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the yellow-headed pixie turned to her sister, arms on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Why are you here - in my room?</span>\" she inquired, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Meeting this little guy you brought home,</span>\" Mesprit replied,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Speaking of, any clue of how he shrunk?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">He owed me a favor, and I do this...</span>\" the telescope near the window was shrunken down and grown back up in a few seconds, so fast that Mesprit blinked for several times before her mind processed what she just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">So you can shrink things? Cool!</span>\" Mesprit chimed, before she grinned,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And so? What is Zorua doing here?You wanna teach him a lesson?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't. Dare.</span>\" Uxie stated,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Zorua will be staying here for some time, in which I - me alone - will try to make him understand that what he does is wrong... <i>harmlessly</i>.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Zorua sighed. But Mesprit giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You alone sis? I could help - I do know about him anyway...</span>\" she offered, her gaze again finding Zorua beside her,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hear that, cutie? We're gonna have lots of fun!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Mesprit...</span>\" her eyes hastily opened and fixed on Mesprit's... which were suddenly covered by her tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Nice try!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua wondered what was going on between the two giantesses, and looked at Uxie, catching a single glimpse of two golden eyes before those were covered by her yellow eyelids as the pixie groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head turned in direction of Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Just for you to know: don't ever look at me in the eye.</span>\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong other emotions, curiosity poked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Just don't, or you might regret it... or not.</span>\" Mesprit snickered as she removed her tails from her eyes and patted Zorua on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua could wonder what that was supposed to mean, someone knocked at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Girls? Just who are you talking to?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny fox on the bed backed up, scared. He knew that was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf.</span>\" Mesprit quietly stated, looking at Uxie,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You think we should tell her?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Are you kidding?! She hates him!</span>\" she whispered as the knocking got more insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I can fix that... and if things get too far, you can do your... y'know, <i>thing</i>. Or you could grow Zorua back in the worst of the cases...</span>\" Mesprit mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Uxie less than five seconds to ponder all the possible scenarios and reply.</span></div></div>",

He'd heard the rumors of the wish maker Jirachi, and that she slept for millennia before being awake for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also learned that that was bogus because she'd been in the village for 3 months. He'd learned that Jirachi had found the one who she wanted to grant a wish, and that she was visiting Zorua's forest today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Zorua an idea...he'd prank her with his berry plan! She'd look like a Pidove and hopefully buzz off. He had the rope in his mouth, waiting...and then he heard the cheerful humming, signaling her approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmkay...ghotta thime righ\" He muttered, with the rope in mouth, and he waited for the opportune moment and...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...When he released the bucket it hung in the air...not moving. It was being held in place by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hello!</span>\" The cheerful voice came from behind Zorua and startled him as he frantically turned to see Jirachi smiling at him with her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! H-hey Jirachi...\" Zorua said nervously and Jirachi opened her eyes and tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Boy, you must think me pretty clueless to fall for a prank like that! Ah well!</span>\" She said, no malice nor even batting an eye. She floated around the dark type as he tried to step away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well you know me, had to try!\" He said, a little less nervously as Jirachi landed and approached Zorua with an outstretched paw. Zorua looked at her confused and she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Congratulations!</span>\" She said and Zorua blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...huh?\" Zorua said, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Congratulations, i'm going to grant your wish!</span>\" She said and Zorua looked at her perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only wish I have is for an infinite supply of food and for this village to fear me. I've got the second one, you giving me the first?\" Zorua asked and Jirachi shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Maybe you don't remember your wish...but I can see it, buried deep within you...and it's a wish that SHOULD be granted...the you now though, he may not agree. But no fear! You'll understand in time!</span>\" And with that a glow seemed to envelop Zorua as he looked around confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" He asked, now nervous again, and Jirachi seemed to be growing...until he saw his surroundings getting bigger too, he was shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I need to keep you with me to help you with this...and you don't seem like you'd cooperate unless you have no choice so...</span>\" With each syllable Jirachi's bubbly voice seemed to get louder and louder to Zorua's ears.

I child could tear me to pieces right now!\" Zorua pleaded from the grasp of the giantess that was holding him, with a lurch he was lifted to her face and she smiled, a bit more gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm saying Zorua, this was your wish...or, a means in which I could grant it. Don't worry about a thing, alright? Let big sis Jirachi take care of things.</span>\" Jirachi said as she placed the tiny dark type on top of her head, his vantage point now making him quite nervous with how high up he was. He was sure he wouldn't survive the drop to the ground if he fell. Jirachi started walking again and humming, both of these simple actions raising quite a bit of hell for the shrunken pokemon. He made a meek attempt to dig his claws in and maintain his balance, without hurting or annoying the giantess that now was taking control of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step though it felt like Zorua was slipping more, Jirachi's loud humming a dizzying experience with his far more sensitive tiny ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi for her part was seriously contemplating the pokemon on her head. It was a...peculiar wish, and one that was contradictory in general to how Zorua behaved. That was part of why she wanted to grant it, her curiosity took a hold on this one...but this might also help Zorua get over his loner tendencies too, as well as his rather rude pranks. It was none of her business on that though, for now she would grant his wish to the best of her abilities. After all...there was the root of it all that she needed to find, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JIRACHI! I'M GOING TO FALL!\" Zorua cried and she snapped out of her thoughts and stopped walking to feel that...Zorua was very close to the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Whoops, sorry there little guy!</span>\" She said as he felt a psychic pull lift him up, he looked down, gulping with the fall but was gently levitated to her paws once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up with fear, but Jirachi was smiling, there was a slightly gentler demeanor to it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I guess I didn't think that part through. I'll just...carry you like this.</span>\" She said, and Zorua got as low as he could and whimpered with his ears down, truly frightened now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way...I w-would wish for this...please Jirachi...if this is b-because of the pranks i'm s-sorry...\" He managed to stammer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi saw and heard this and hugged him to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't worry, okay? I truly will protect you. And this really was your wish...I promise.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi kept on her way, Zorua feeling her warmth radiating around him, it felt nice, but he was damn scared...it had been a while since he felt like this. Not since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...he didn't like to think of that bastard though, he was far away now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua closed his eyes, almost feeling himself nod off before Jirachi spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">We're here, my home!</span>\"</span></div></div>",

It was no surprise, almost everyone did since she came to the village, but, uncovered as he was, someone could have easily seen Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, home sweet home.</span>\" the giantess chimed to her small passenger, who huffed in response, still trying to process everything that has been going on today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Why so grumpy, Zorua?</span>\" Jirachi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Maybe because I'm pathetically tiny? No, it can't be that... oh wait, it is!\" Zorua sarcastically replied, causing Jirachi to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You're funny.</span>\" she praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious! Grow me back, Jirachi, please!\" he begged, but his plead fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Nope, Zorua. This is your wish, and I shall help you with it no matter what!</span>\" the giantess replied with a determined smile as she began hovering through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what I wish for!\" Zorua insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Jirachi stopped; one paw left Zorua as she placed it over her mouth, seemingly deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave the stressed Zorua the chance to look around. The house looked much bigger from the inside than the outside: there was a small kitchen, but the living room was rather large, mostly occupied by a big, nice-looking couch, an armchair, a coffee table and two full bookshelves; a secondary door led to an equally large bathroom, while another door led to a hallway, which was occupied by a staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably Jirachi's room was upstairs. Not a single speck of dust could be seen, everything was sparkling clean. Evidently, Jirachi liked things pretty clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid wish-maker looked back down at Zorua and sighed, her smile fading for the first time as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You really don't get it, do you Zorua? I know you think this isn't your wish, you convince yourself of it, but my power goes beyond your perception. I can see the most intimate wishes of people, buried deep inside oneself,</span>\" she paused to sigh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Since I came here, I've been telling that I was going to grant the wish of someone that really <i>really</i> wanted their wish to come true.</span>\" she began moving again at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi hovered to the staircase. Her smile was back, but it didn't look like the happy smile she was wearing for the whole day, it looked much more like a forced one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua didn't relent,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I really <i>really</i> didn't wish for this Jirachi, you have to believe me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Jirachi hovered through a door and into a spacious room, which was undoubtedly her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bed with yellow sheets in the corner, two windows with yellow curtains on the wall and a desk nearby; a telescope rested near the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike downstairs, everything was extremely clean and fancy-looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping Zorua restrained against her chest, Jirachi hovered to her bed and laid down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Zorua, it is your wish, trust me. I see it, I know you want this. It may be that you may have forgotten it, or that you consider it something stupid, but I intend to help you.</span>\" she said, her sincere smile reappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type prepared himself for another verbal assault, when his mouth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jirachi,\" he started,<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me, please, what is my wish? You say I wanted this, but it's pretty... generic, don't you think? What is that I really want, according to you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Jirachi closed her eyes, while the grip that held Zorua still tightened around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hmm...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area right under Zorua began burning hot; he turned his gaze downwards (or backwards?) and choked back a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Jirachi's belly, an eye had opened. What looked like an eyelid on her belly WAS an eyelid on her belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jirachi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You wish...</span>\" she spoke, her voice adopting a deeper tone,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... To be happy, to be safe from the people who hate you... you wish a friend who detains the power to protect you, and that's why you wish to be so small, because it would make it easier for said friend to protect you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the looming eyelid closed back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi's actual eyes opened again as she looked at Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Content now?</span>\" she asked, her voice returning to its characteristic cheerful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua raised his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're officially delirious, lady.\" he stated.<br>\r\n\"This is <i>definitely not</i> what I want. Let me go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">May I ask something?</span>\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Even if this wasn't your wish, Zorua, would it be so bad? I mean, me protecting you, being your friend... would it really be so bad? You mentioned you wished for infinite food... that's pretty close to it, wouldn't you agree?</span>\" she giggled at this while Zorua blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wish-maker giantess continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Tell me Zorua, and be honest with me, and with yourself: would this be really so bad?</span>\"</span></div></div>",

For a bit.\" He said, trying to keep the crack in his voice from showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi had a gentle smile before her giant paws picked him up and lifted him to her face. He tried to avert his gaze, but two fingers gently took hold of his head and turned him to look at the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I don't know what could've happened to you in the past for this to be your wish Zorua, but just know that from now on, everything is going to work out.

Zorua realized how hungry he was and Jirachi started moving, not removing Zorua from the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now I know I have something you'll like in here somewhere...</span>\" Jirachi said, her movements being felt by the tiny pokemon, but she kept him secure in her hold as she went into the kitchen, grabbing a knife with her free hand and psychically opening her fridge door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bit of chilled beef in there, that would surely be to his taste she thought. She pulled it out with her psychic and set in on her cutting board, preparing a small slice for the pokemon in her charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all was said and done, there was a thin slice made...at least 3 times bigger than Zorua. She opened her hug and with her paw set him on the counter in front of it, her face smiling down on the tiny pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Eat to your heart's content Zorua...you haven't had a good meal in a long time, right?</span>\" She said and Zorua looked up, mouth agape before looking at the slice, and smelling it. It almost made his mouth water...he shook his head and felt the words in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you...\" he said, emotion in his voice as he approached the meat and took a bite...then two...soon enough he was eating at a rhythm as Jirachi watched, paw on her chin, smiling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Zorua was done, he sighed, then looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...why did you pick me, I suppose...\" He murmured and Jirachi giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Easy, I try not to grant terribly selfish or bad wishes, I grant something that can benefit everyone, and you like this...it benefits absolutely everyone, as far as I can tell. You're not a bad pokemon, right Zorua?

It couldn't have done it on its own, or could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarmed, Jirachi went to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hmm...</span>\" she observed the darkened sky, the sun hidden by black clouds: it was going to rain soon, she judged, and it was quite windy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jirachi...?\" Zorua called from the kitchen, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary sighed, piecing it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Relax Zorua, the wind snapped a branch and it broke the window,</span>\" she explained, before giving a sigh as she regarded the glass shards and the branch that was still resting in the middle of her living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back in direction of the tiny fox,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Go on, eat up while I clean up this mess. Then we can spend some time together and maybe we can get to know each other, okay?</span>\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua flushed red, but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to know each other meant bringing up his troubled past, and bringing up his troubled past meant humiliating himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his host, who was busily gathering the glass shards with psychic, forming a small, glass pile in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he returned to his meal and began biting into it again while trying to recollect his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that happened today was quite weird, but Jirachi assured that this was his wish... and if she really was able to see the most intimate wishes of people, who was he to question that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, living in an actual house, sleeping in an actual bed and not on the ground, eating giant food which was offered to him without him having to search for it, those all were good bonuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's train of thought was interrupted as a shadow loomed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you done?\" he asked Jirachi as he looked up from his meal, only to find the shadow didn't belong to Jirachi at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe froze up, feeling his blood freezing as well despite his heart beating like a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the kitchen counter stood a short and slim, dark-furred pokemon with clawed hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Sneasel. And the same one that held a grudge against Zorua for the last stunt too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You didn't think I didn't notice you with that weirdo Jirachi, did ya?</span>\" she snickered, her claws shining sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his perch on the kitchen counter, Zorua backed from his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What do you want?\" he asked, attempting to appear imposing. Something that resulted quite hard, given how he looked like a doll right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">What do I want?</span>\" Sneasel parroted back in a whisper, her grin gone, replaced by a glare,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You hid those eggs in front of my house! Mandibuzz hunted me down!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered, much like he had been doing when he saw the same pokemon that now towered above him running from an angry Mandibuzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was totally your fault, y'know. You stole my food when you passed by my forest!\" he retorted, before smirking smugly,<br>\r\n\"And now, you broke in the house of a legendary... how d'ya think she'll react?\" he wondered, shooting Jirachi a nervous look, but she was still gathering shards from the floor, unaware of the third presence in her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneasel grinned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Oh, but she won't know about me... she'll only know that you're gone. I don't care how you shrunk or why you're here, we gotta have a nice lil' chat, don't you agree?</span>\" she hinted as a claw rose menacingly, ready to start forward and grab Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox thought fast, there was no way he could escape or fight back. So his only hope was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JIRACHI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room, the wish-maker perked up, looking back into the kitchen, wondering the reason of such alarmed scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, she noticed the slim figure of a Sneasel inside. Next, she saw Zorua backed up in a corner on her counter, while the intruder glanced back at her, panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting time, Jirachi let go of the glass shards, which fell to the floor, breaking into even tinier shards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary rushed into the kitchen, warily staring at the Sneasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Wh-Who are you?</span>\" she asked, before hastily piecing the situation together.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... You broke my window, didn't you?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneasel put up a calmer facade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Chill out,</span>\" it was an ironic thing to say for an ice-type,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I only saw my friend Zorua like that and was wondering why he's so tiny.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi didn't looks like she bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">If that's so, why did you break in instead of knocking at my door like normal pokemon do?</span>\" she wondered, causing the Sneasel to shrug nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Um... my nature, y'know!</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true! She wanted to kidnap me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi gasped and, in the time she realized that her facade had dropped, Sneasel calculated the distance between the broken window and the kitchen, before turning around to grab Zorua...</span></div></div>",

Let me finish cleaning up this glass.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi hugged Zorua to her chest as she continued to clean the broken window, getting it all into a psychic pile in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sneasel had it coming you know...what I did to her...\" Zorua said and Jirachi hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She stole from me...I hadn't eaten for a long time when she did that too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You enjoy mischief, right?</span>\" Jirachi said and Zorua said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But the you buried deep...he didn't want to turn into that either, he doesn't like to hurt others. You need to find that Zorua again...</span>\" Jirachi gently said and Zorua sighed.</span></div></div>",

The wind did nothing to ease her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screaming dark-type drew the attention of several pokemon as she soared the street, before ungracefully landing on the ground, her head hitting a patch of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision was very blurry, but she could make out the figures of several pokemon encircling her, concerned expressions on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have the best reputation around, but it was still better than Zorua's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Hey, you alright?</span>\" a Glaceon asked as she helped the dark-type up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneasel rubbed her head with a grunt of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yeah... I'm fine...</span>\" she said, while glaring in direction of the house she was just thrown out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cplum\">Needless to say, this ain't the last you hear from me.</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for your window Jirachi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">No problem. I'm sorry for not noticing her sooner.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe still startled Zorua nestled himself into the chest of his newfound friend/host; she held him against herself with her paws while she gathered the multiplied glass shards with Psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she picked up every shard, she threw them away; next, she removed the knife she had used against Sneasel from her counter, before picking up the branch from her living room and throwing it out there way it came in. All while she hummed a familiar tune, soothing Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi looked at her window and sighed, while Zorua shivered as a gust of wind entered the house through the broken window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't worry, I'll have that fixed soon. Now, what d'you say if we sit down and talk for a bit?</span>\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, he knew this was coming sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One condition,\" he told while the giantess hovered to her couch and sat down, nestling the fox in between her arms and her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hm?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No personal questions. There are a few things I don't want to talk about, got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi giggled, her usual behavior back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Zorua, I'm your friend, and you'll be living with me for a while. You can open up with me, we can be like brothers!</span>\" she chimed, before looking at the shrunken fox with a pink shade on her cheeks,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Or better...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her two tails traveled to Zorua's chin, but he pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going too far already, lady,\" he said, causing the blushing titan to giggle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Doesn't mean it can't be~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... How about you begin?\" he said, before looking elsewhere,<br>\r\n\"... There's nothing to say about me, really. I'm a prankster, I live alone, people hate me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi smiled sympathetically, and the grip around the dark-type grew tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Zorua, I believe there's a world more about you... but I'll start if it makes you happy. As you may have already understood, I grant wishes and I can see the most intimate desires of pokemon. It's... good, y'know. To see the happy faces of a pokemon when their wish comes true...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua pointed to his face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this look like a \u2018happy face\u2019?\" he asked, causing the giantess to giggle yet again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Give it time, you'll get used to it little one,</span>\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua huffed, before continuing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, from what I knew about you, you should be sleeping for a millennia right now, you've been here three months. Why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That...</span>\" she muttered.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Y'see, that isn't false, but... look, sometimes it takes time to find someone whose wishes aren't selfish or malicious, so sometimes my kind sleeps for a bit...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a bit.\" Zorua parroted back without even blinking, choking back a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement itself was ridiculous, and the fact Jirachi was blushing didn't help at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... I know, it sounds stupid, but we can wake up sooner if... if someone that fits the requirements shows up. We can also not sleep at all, y'know... I mean, not sleep for a millennium, that is...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua began snickering at Jirachi's awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook the blush off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... But let's go back at you, Zorua!</span>\" she chimed, a smile brightening her giant face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You mentioned you had something you didn't want to talk about... but I think you should.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shot a determined look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jirachi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">No, listen, it'll make you feel better! I won't tell anybody, promise!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua made eye contact with the titaness, her deep blue eyes sparkling with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Aw come on! If we're living together, we need to know everything about each other! <i>EVERYTHING</i></span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jirachi, you're delirious again.\" Zorua declared, but the giantess didn't relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she showed an irresistible pair of puppy-dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Pretty please?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua tried to resist, but failed miserably. The power of the puppy-dog eyes was multiplied a hundredfold because Jirachi's eyes were truly gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small dark-type huffed in loud annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE!\" he cried, before looking down.<br>\r\n\"Just don't make fun of me, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi placed a paw on her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was... I had problems with my dad when I was younger okay? He was a true bi... he was really a jerk to me. He beat me up and always \u2018encouraged\u2019 me to evolve by starving me. And that's the tip of the iceberg for a thief, ain't it? Yeah, I can remember his good mood when he got caught...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Zorua paused, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi looked horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Zorua-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huge, spoiled sack of crap...\" at this point, he wasn't there anymore. He was himself right now, but facing his father years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind flashed with all sorts of violent scenarios, his tiny claws sank into Jirachi's white skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you be such monster... with your own son, man! You filthy-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Zorua!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he was suddenly snapped back to reality, back into Jirachi's paw, onto her couch and into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Did I say that all out loud?\" he wondered, looking at his host sorrowfully,<br>\r\n\"So-Sorry... It happens every time I think about him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi didn't respond, but embraced the fox even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't worry Zorua, he can't hurt you anymore... wait, can he?</span>\" she suddenly mused,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Didn't you mention you lived alone?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But then... where is your dad?</span>\" Jirachi wondered, before gasping as one of her tails traveled to her mouth.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Did you...?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, zorua grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'ya think I was just going to sit back and let him turn me into a punching bag? No way, lady, no freaking way! One night he went to steal, and when he got back, I was already far. And sayonara daddy, hope I never see you again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua breathed in deeply, before staring at the speechless Jirachi, as if daring her to laugh at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I... I had no idea...</span>\" she meekly stated, and Zorua was enveloped in an even tighter hug, which threatened to break his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... okay...\" Zorua said, feeling his breath waning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of silence, Jirachi smiled again, her cheerful behavior back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well! Now we do know everything about each other! I'm so happy!</span>\" she said cheerfully,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, wanna do something together Zorua?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by the quick change of mood (was Jirachi moody?), Zorua couldn't offer an answer different than,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like?\"</span></div></div>",

Don't you think the fact that i'm tiny and you're...well not puts you at an advantage?\" Zorua said and Jirachi mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...A word game?</span>\" She offered and he cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no.\" He said and she smiled lifting him to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well...do you have any ideas for what we could do for a game?</span>\" Zorua put a paw to his chin and mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have something of an idea I suppose.\" He smirked, this was something he was good at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jirachi, you're a powerful legendary, a wish granter, and at least a millennia old, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well...you didn't need to bring that last part into account...</span>\" Jirachi pouted, but then nodded. \"<span class=\"cyellow\">I am.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tiny, not all that powerful in general, and barely 15...but I bet I got something on you that you can't suss out.\" He grinned and Jirachi brought him closer to her eyes, now curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What is it? What is it?</span>\" She asked, almost like a child, her curiosity piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashed a genuine grin, his ego feeling sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the best there is at illusions and tricks of the eye! I even have my jerk of a dad beat on it i'd imagine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Though he never put much stock in illusions'</i> Zorua thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi tilted her head and Zorua took a deep breath before shimmering shards of glass seemed to levitate from Jirachi's trash bin. She looked at it confused before they coalesced into the full window pane that was there before the incident. It seemed to fit into place before she looked at it...it was as if her window had come back. She blinked before an image appeared on the window, almost like a way to peer into places far away as a shimmering crystal cave seemed to be right outside her house. She blinked again and it was a rainbow...blinking again, it was as if she lived in the sky on fluffy clouds. She was entranced and before she realized it was walking to her window and reaching out before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" Zorua yelled, frantic and Jirachi blinked again and gasped. She almost put her paw on some broken glass...the illusion was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you'd try that...\" Zorua said, surprised, hugged to her chest with the paw that didn't reach out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways...that's my power. I can make you see things...and this house...has something in it right now that doesn't belong.\" Zorua said and Jirachi was perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an object in this house that isn't real right now.\" Zorua said, then he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you can figure it out?\" He said, almost cocky and Jirachi grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">NOW I get it Zorua! Ah, that's a fun kind of game!</span>\" Jirachi said, lifting him to her face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is...\" Zorua smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had an idea with this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna go for some stakes?\" He asked and Jirachi put a paw to her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Uh...well I only have that beef in the kitchen...</span>\" She said and Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not the meat, a wager!\" He exclaimed and realization dawned on her. \"Though a steak does sound nice...\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">OH! Um...depends, what are they?</span>\" She asked and Zorua went for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win...i'll tell you the rest of what there is to know about me.\" Zorua said, and then gave her some extra incentive. \"And maybe try that...other thing you suggested.\" He blushed at this and Jirachi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay, and if YOU win?</span>\" Zorua nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grow me back.\" He said and Jirachi looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">No deal Zorua, sorry, I can't do that regardless of how high the wager is on your end. It goes against the foundation of your inner most wish.</span>\" She said, almost sternly and Zorua sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worth a shot...\" He said but Jirachi mused something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But say that you do win Zorua...I can give you a different kind of reward.

He was nice to be with... when he was adorably tiny and couldn't pull any pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Can I know the rest of your story anyway?</span>\" she asked hopeful, while Zorua recovered himself from the kiss he had just received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen was the last time someone kissed him? Never, since he didn't have anyone that loved him. Surely not his dad or the villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Jirachi? She seemed pretty affectionate during his short stay with her. Maybe he could really consider her like a sister... or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" he asked to dissuade himself from such line of thinking, wondering where that even came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Can I know the rest of your story anyway? Please?</span>\" Jirachi asked again, a hopeful spark in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne that the fox was sorry to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... no.\" he bluntly replied, Jirachi's expression dropping almost immediately.<br>\r\n\"... M-Maybe some other time.\" he quickly added, seeing her upset expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay Zorua, that's fine!</span>\" she chimed happily, completely forgetting she was the one losing the match with the shrunken fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But now come on! We still have lots of things to do!</span>\" she continued, leaving the fox curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi smiled.</span></div></div>",

Actually, she didn't even dislike him just like everyone else did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini was probably the only one pokemon who could say that Zorua's pranks amused her. The other pokemon of the village didn't really approve this behavior of hers, but she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to like Zorua, despite some of his pranks being sadistic and potentially lethal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, the fox always tried to stay away from the legendary; she generally acted friendly towards him, but her behavior only made Zorua feel uneasy and led him to walk away from her whenever she approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox bit the rope in his mouth harder, what was Victini doing in the forest? In <i>his</i> forest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua, grunted and looked away for a moment, briefly wondering if he could still play his prank on the fire-type; a grin spread across his muzzle - if he did, Victini was probably going to finally leave him alone... probably make him regret his choice, but ultimately leave him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered, looking back to the approaching legendary... who wasn't there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hi Zorua!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment a pair of paws connected with his back, Zorua screamed, the rope sliding out of his mouth, burning his tongue while also causing his bucket full of feathers and honey to fall from its perch and to the ground, where it dropped all of its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alerted Zorua turned around, noticing the same pokemon he was planning to prank, and the same pokemon who ruined his prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream colored legendary fixed her blue eyes on the fallen bucket and shook her head in an upset fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\"><i>Really</i>, Zorua? I've seen your greatest pranks, I gotta say that this is pretty disappointing...</span>\" she stated, before giving a playful giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha...

You're in the right place, lady,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini smiled again, though it was more of a grin than an actual smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Zorua feel even more nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Speaking of cool things, I've got something you may like, </span>\" she spoke mischievously, hovering closer to the fox,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">A prank of my own, if you like.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua gained a smirk of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never figured you were a prankster too,\" he spoke, stepping back from the approaching legendary, not really wanting to find out about what prank she was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had learned something from years of pranking, it was that a prank was only funny when he wasn't the victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I'm not, but this one thing is really cool. Wanna see?</span>\" Victini continued, her unnerving smirk striking fear into Zorua. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm really interested in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua couldn't finish his sentence, because right there, before his incredulous eyes, Victini's own blue oculars began glowing q blinding light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua stepped back again, noticing...</span></div></div>",

He looked to Victini to see that, with her smirk and glowing blue eyes, she was getting larger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled back in surprise, only to trip over his own feet as he fell over a small rock, something he wouldn't have even noted a few moments ago. \"What the hell...\" He muttered, looking around as he started to shake off the sense of weariness from his head. He took a good look to see the grass around him was...now taller than him!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-Victini!?\" He cried out in a panicked tone as immediately his ears rang from a girlish giggle above him, at a far larger volume than he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh man! You should see your face! And your voice, it's so squeaky! See Zorua, now THAT'S a prank!</span>\" He heard, the ground beneath him shuddering as Victini casually walked forward towards him. He audibly gulped as he regained his footing and looked at the looming legendary. She had to be as big as a building to him at least. A glint of mischief in her eye that he knew all too well and a smirk played across her lips as she looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Aw...you're so adorable at that size, like an iiiiiiitty bitty doll.</span>\" She said, taunting him in a cooing manner before she giggled. Zorua felt his face flash red, both from anger and embarrassment, still, he needed to play it cool...cool...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did you shrink me!?\" Zorua felt himself cry out, a bit of panic creeping into his voice, hopefully masking his anger. Victini just kept a smug look about her as she got to her knees, something that made Zorua jump about 10 steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hmm, something I picked up pretty recently. Cool, right? I gotta say Zorua, I expect better from you...you really let me one up you on this.</span>\" Victini said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Yeah, like I could ever hope to pull something like this off</i>' He thought bitterly. He swallowed, clearing his throat before he spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, maybe i'm having an off day. I gotta say, you really got the better of me on this one Victini. Good prank!\" He said, looking into her giant eyes as he praised her. \"But, you can grow me back, right?\" He asked, trying to play it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh of course I can!</span>\" She said, smiling genuinely at him. Zorua sighed with relief. Good, once he got his size back he'd drop a quick illusion and get the hell away from this weirdo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her expectantly, her smile never faltering. He was smiling too, but after about 30 seconds of this it began to waver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well what?</span>\" Victini asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna grow me back?\" Zorua asked, raising his eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hmm, I wonder...</span>\" Victini said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I said I CAN grow you back, not that I would, silly little Zorua.</span>\" Victini said, before a giant finger reached down and gave Zorua's head a noogie, threatening to push him down into the ground with the amount of power she had over him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victini! I can't stay like this! My parents would freak!\" Zorua said, dropping his cool, and letting panic take over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini then pinched Zorua's body with two of her fingers as she got to her feet. Zorua felt a great sense of vertigo take hold as he was lifted high into the sky, up to her face as she looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Look Zorua, I like you...</span>\" </span></div></div>",

He was lowered backwards down onto her hand and he scrambled up to see her large blue eyes staring at him. Interested as he was in getting fast-tracked back to his original size he was extremely worried a part of her deal would involve demeaning or embarrassing him. Then again, for Zorua spending time being small enough to sit in her paw was embarrassing enough. Victini watched him before she suddenly pressed him to her cream-furred chest. Zorua struggled for a bit until he could feel gravity push from above and his fears were confirmed when he managed to look past the long strands of fur to see the tops of the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped his struggles immediately and he let Victini take him wherever she was going, the sight of being that high up was not what he needed right now. Thankfully, the trip was short. A couple of minutes later Zorua found himself being pulled away from the warm fur of her chest so he could see where he was; just outside the local Pokemon Village. \"<span class=\"corange\">I'm willing to give you back your place of number one prankster in the forest <i>and</i> your size if you can do this one little thing for me,</span>\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" Zorua asked, almost dreading the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I just want you to pull off a prank while you're all tiny!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini began to gush as she tried to explain. \"<span class=\"corange\">Well you're so creative and smart and uh...</span>\" she paused for a moment before she composed herself. \"<span class=\"corange\">...I'm curious to see what you would come up with.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe praises from the giant legendary gave Zorua a whole slew of sudden emotions. He wasn't sure if he should be feeling gratified, embarrassed or anxious. Although, anxiousness seemed to be the most prevailing. He could be held between two fingers of Victini; a Pokemon that is comparably small among a lot of other Pokemon. Even Zorua would usually find himself looking down at her when she was hovering and flying everywhere. If she looked like the size of a building then the more larger types might look like a mountain. \"I don't know, I'm pretty sure most of the Pokemon in the village would either stomp me flat or eat me alive if they found me like this,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini giggled. \"<span class=\"corange\">Just don't get seen then!</span>\" The fire-psychic waited for Zorua to reply as he was deep in though but quickly got impatient. \"<span class=\"corange\">I'll let you choose who you want to trick and I'll take you there. Then, as promised, once you return and they've been thoroughly japed you'll get your size back.</span>\" Victini could feel the small dark-type shifting uncomfortably in her paw and his expression clearly showed hesitation. She started feeling disappointed for assuming he would do something so risky. Victini was sure he could have thought of something even with the huge disadvantage she gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I don't know...</span>\" Zorua hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Well, if you <i>really</i> don't want to do it I guess we could hang out at my place for a while.</span>\" Victini softly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides being annoyed that there was no 'just let me go' option, Zorua was honestly torn on what to do. On one hand, he could take the more dangerous option to try and get him out of this situation as fast as possible while also maintaining his reputation as the best trickster in the forest. Victini also seemed to genuinely believe in his ability to pull it off despite how small he was... On the other, he could just accept going to her place and hope she won't keep him there long and not make him do anything silly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Zorua decide to do?</span></div></div>",

He gulped down a bit of fear before he nodded to her. \"Okay then Victini, i'll do it...i'm gonna thoroughly show you just why they call me the best prankster there is. Tiny size or no, i'm gonna blow your mind and send a shiver down my victim's spine.\" He felt a familiar smirk play across his lips, he himself felt like he could pull it off with those words uttered. That's right! His size and strength might be gone, but he was not stripped of his two strongest assets. His devilish ingenuity and his convincing illusions, and with them, he'd definitely get through this with flying colors. Zorua's grin was cut off as he felt himself ascending again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what-\" He was cut off as his face and in fact entire body was pressed against Victini's furry cheek. \"<span class=\"corange\">See! That's why you're so cool Zorua!</span>\" She said, the close proximity of her voice making his ears press against his skull to try and dull the loud sound. Victini grinned as she pulled him away from the cheek to look at him, he was thoroughly dazed by this. He shook his head to regain his bearings and looked up at her, doubt creeping into his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he'd pull this off, he wasn't about to throw in the towel on this, not only for his size, but his pride as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Victini, take me into the village. I need to select my victim.\" He said calmly, the gears in his head turning as he considered exactly what he could do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Hmm, who to pick, who to pick...</span>\" Victini said as she looked at her paw to see that Zorua didn't look like he was there. She wasn't fooled though, she could still feel and hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my choice there, I need to play this one carefully. If I get caught or snatched I could end up as paste...\" Zorua shuddered a bit as Victini grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">You won't. At least...if you aren't as rusty as I fear.</span>\" She said and Zorua closed his eyes to steady himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't rusty...\" He muttered before he looked around, a few pokemon immediately caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one of the school weirdos he could do it to, and that was Gothorita. She tended to keep to herself and he had done a few pranks to her in the past, though she never gave much of a reaction to him when he did do that. He was a little creeped out by her if he was being honest, though he figured she'd be an easy enough mark. She even seemed to be coming towards Victini...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then there was Vulpix, a frequent and fun victim. A neat freak, a perfectionist, and snooty and condescending as all get out, she HATED Zorua, and he LOVED to get a rise out of her. Oh the things he could do...but getting caught, oh that was definitely not something that would be fun at all at this size. Still though, a grin played across his lips, he really could feel the satisfaction that would come from nailing her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Eevee...she was a few years younger and Zorua had pranked her in the past, causing her to cry, and he'd gotten an earful for that one. He tended to take it easy on her since then, but she would be the easiest mark here, and the quickest ticket to his size back. He could see that she was well distracted at the candy shop too.

She'll come to me, like she always does.\" he replied, continuing upon noting Victini's confused expression,<br>\r\n\"Just get me back to the forest and hide.  The rest is a surprise. I'll show ya I earned my title.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's declaration was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly for her, Vulpix had to walk across the woods where Zorua usually played his pranks to get back home. She would have never done so otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated the dark-type's guts and everything related to him since his first prank on her, in which she ended up in a puddle of water which not only hurt her, but got her fur wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, she had tried to avoid Zorua at all costs; sadly, the fox seemed to know the forest like his own fur and always managed to pull pranks on her, much to her rage. Even more sadly, she could never get a hold of him, because the prankster would use his illusions to get lost rather quickly before she had to chance to burn his tail off with a Flamethrower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was no different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix had to, like every day, walk across the woods to get home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest seemed rather quiet today, she mused, meaning that maybe Zorua wasn't up to something. Or maybe, if she was lucky, he wasn't even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Vulpix sped up, hoping to get home before the fox showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked across the thick vegetation until she noted something unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting in between two trees was a large mirror. Obviously, that didn't belong in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix stopped, confused, but her mind put two and two together quickly... and she came to the wrong conclusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Why would he have a mirror? It'd shatter reflecting Zorua.</span>\" she smugly said, nearing to the circular glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was at it, she mused, she could check on her beautiful form; Vulpix was so lost in her perfectly brushed fur that she didn't even bother to look up. If she did, she would have noticed a large pair of blue eyes looking straight at her from one of the trees. Her gaze was straight so that all she could see was her perfection... and not a certain fox that stood at short distance from the illusionary mirror, hidden by a bush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a moment more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix was still admiring herself when she noted that something was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">What the...</span>\" she muttered before noticing the reflection changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her eyes, Vulpix saw a Zorua that was staring at her from the other side of the glass, and he was right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, the vixen turned around, but no one was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to the mirror... only to notice that her reflection disappeared, fully replaced by the Zorua, who was now grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she began to understand, the image shifted once more, this time becoming a Tyranitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge pokemon roared, and the mirror exploded in a million tiny pieces, freeing the giant rock-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix screamed in terror as she tried to run, but the giant blocked her path, and began walking towards her with a ferocious expression on its face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix backed away, until the ground came missing under her paws and she fell... straight in a puddle of mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the Tyranitar faded and a loud snickering was heard. Vulpix didn't initially recognize the voice, but screamed as she saw mud clinging to her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't an illusion, not at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">ZORUA!</span>\" Vulpix screamed in rage, climbing out from the mud and looking around furiously while the laughter still raged around the forest, belonging both to Victini  and her tiny victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the tiny Zorua was, in fact, laying flat on the ground, laughing to tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, loud tremors shaking the ground caused him to look up to see the fuming giant Vulpix coming straight towards where he was, apparently seeking for him and make him regret pranking her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already too near for Zorua to craft an illusion, so, while still chuckling to himself, began walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way Vulpix would notice him while he was like this... right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was then that his grin vanished as he had a serious risk of getting discovered by her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I KNOW YOU'RE AROUND YOU PEST! SHOW YOURSELF ZORUA!</span>\" Vulpix screamed, her voice loud enough and close enough to cause Zorua to crumple to the ground.

He was going full speed ahead as Vulpix blinked before she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Oh no you don't! I don't know what's going on but you're NOT escaping me!</span>\" Vulpix nearly screamed as she leapt into the air, ahead of where Zorua was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she landed, the ground quaked hard beneath Zorua, almost as if Vulpix's leap had caused an earthquake as he once again lost his footing, and was forced to look up and up and the visage of the muddy, furious Vulpix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...hey Vulpix...you uh, look like you took a fall...heh, you okay?\" Zorua asked a bit nervously. A moment after this he felt crushing pain as Vulpix pinned Zorua down with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I don't know what happened to you, but I must say, this form fits you quite well Zorua. This is where you belong.</span>\" Vulpix said, her voice icy cold as she applied more pressure, very easily on his tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, stop! You're gonna kill me if you keep this up!\" Zorua choked out. Vulpix just smirked at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Oh? Is that fear I detect Zorua? I hardly thought one such as you was capable of that...aren't you the greatest prankster around? Surely not, I believe a Joltik would be more than a match for you now...</span>\" Vulpix let off an obnoxious laugh as she felt control of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua for his part was struggling and just hoping that Victini hadn't abandoned him at this point, if so then he didn't like his odds now, he was sure Vulpix would have no mercy for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix removed her paw as she got down on her stomach, bringing her giant head close to Zorua. She opened her maw and Zorua gulped at the cavern in front of him. He wasn't sure if she was going to eat him, or...it was then that a gale force came from her mouth as she blew on him and Zorua flew back what felt like 20 feet, rolling to a stop and groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">So pathetic...so fitting.</span>\" Vulpix cooed. This might've been worth the mud dip even, she'd clean off at least, but for now...she could do as she pleased to her hated enemy.</span></div></div>",

Certainly, she didn't want Zorua to be killed when Vulpix got tired of toying with him, but she decided against helping for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I believe in ya, Zorua,</span>\" she said with a grin, although the fox couldn't see her right now,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Show me what you've got up those famous sleeves of yours.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was part of the deal that Zorua didn't have to get seen after all, and now it was up to him to get lost before Vulpix became too vengeful, in which point Victini decided she would step in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zorua, he felt his heart pounding the walls of his chest as the shadow of his gigantic opponent eclipsed his whole form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Now Zorua, what should I do with you little filthy insect?</span>\" she asked, mostly to herself, a devilish grin similar to Zorua's spreading wide on her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">I can do everything to you! Like-</span>\" Vulpix trailed off, noticing Zorua's expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snickering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini may have forsaken him, but he could still rely on a Zorua's most famous (and infamous) ability: deceiving enemies with illusions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Vulpix, she was confused, why did the little vermin before her eyes have that expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Yeah, laugh while you still can you miserable bug, because <i>I</i> will be the one laughing when I-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think you got me?\" Zorua interrupted, his laughter dying down; Victini leaned from her branch in an attempt to hear what the two pokemon were saying,<br>\r\n\"No one will ever do that, ya drama queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words said, the vegetation around Vulpix sprang to life, trees extended their branches like arms to reach down; the fire vixen screamed as she was entangled by the thick plants of the forest and began struggling to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini watched in amusement, seeing Zorua's opponent struggling all of a sudden, as if fighting an invisible enemy. This was Zorua's doing, the legendary thought with a smirk. She leaned over so much that she fell from her perch, managing to remain in mid-air thanks to her wing-shaped tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Go Zorua.</span>\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid dark-type snickered at the face of the giantess in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're busy Vulpix, so I'll be on my way now. 'Till the next prank~\" he sang, slowly backing up before turning around and sprinting away, disappearing behind a vegetal wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Z... ZORUA!</span>\" she screamed, letting out a Flamethrower around her, burning the illusionary plants off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">GET BACK HERE!</span>\" she exclaimed, chasing after Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox felt the ground trembling beneath him and snickered again. He slipped into another bush before Vulpix could see him,  but he wasn't just going to hide, no. He had another, devious plan in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix stopped to look around, when she caught a glimpse of a black thing that looked like... Zorua's tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Found you!</span>\" she screamed,  once again chasing after the fox, not even bothering to look back to see a certain legendary following, not to lose sight of the duo. This was becoming rather fun for Victini, who was furiously pressing her paws against her mouth to keep her laughter in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as Vulpix chased the tiny Zorua right back to where they were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen was so angry that she didn't even notice that Zorua wasn't showing any signs of being tired while she was panting.  She didn't even notice where Zorua was bringing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, only when the illusionary fox faded, she noticed she was headed straight for the same puddle of mud she fell into earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe desperately tried to halt, but in the middle of her sprint she couldn't stop and ended up taking a second dip into the 'mud bath'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she was once again tricked by her hated enemy, Vulpix howled in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same moment, Victini howled too, but with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was able to pull not one, but two awesome pranks while tiny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victini! Quick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her big, <i>V</i>-shaped ears, Victni was able to hear Zorua despite his tiny size and looked down, spotting the fox on the ground underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, she hovered down and hastily got a hold of the fox before fluttering away, leaving the seething Vulpix in the mud, screaming out Zorua's name along with terrible insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Amazing! Incredible! Marvelous!</span>\" Victini loudly praised in a secluded spot of the forest, far from where Vulpix was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easily one of my best pranks ever!\" Zorua laughed while he rested on the giantess' orange palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah! I thought you were about to get caught, y'know, rusty as I thought you were, but you managed to trick her twice! You're so smart, Zorua!</span>\" the legendary exclaimed cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... now, about that deal you struck me...\" he hinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...

It wasn't like he could resist her, but that wasn't what she wanted anyway, she admired the dark type in her own way despite the vast difference in power between them and she needed to make sure that things didn't go awry. This was her chance to connect with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So here we are!</span>\" Victini declared as she touched down near her home, opening the door to a modest looking house. Zorua was struggling a bit against her grip as he was gently deposited onto a table. \"Victini, you can't back out on this deal! I gave you a double prank! Grow me back!\" Zorua demanded, glaring up at the legendary, she just gave a sheepish smile. \"<span class=\"corange\">In time, I promise. Here, let me go get you something to eat, alright?</span>\" She said, changing the topic as Zorua's stomach growled at the mention of food. He blushed and sighed before looking up at the titanic legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meat please.\" He said and she grinned. \"<span class=\"corange\">You got it!</span>\" And with that she walked off, leaving Zorua stranded on his table perch as he looked around. It was a nice place, pretty clean too...and quiet he noted. \"Hey uh, Victini?\" He felt himself calling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah Zorua?</span>\" He heard from around the corner she went as he looked towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you live alone?\" He asked as he started to walk around the table, looking at more of his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah, I do.</span>\" Was the simple reply. Zorua blinked. She was around his age right?...Eh, didn't matter. She was a legendary, who knew what went on in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, cool...\" He felt himself muttering, finding himself out of things to talk about, as well as being a bit bored now. It was moments later that Victini came back with what seemed to be a slice of ham and a thimble of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Here you go Zorua! Go ahead and dig in!</span>\" Victini said, setting the stuff down near him. The ham slice was bigger than him and there was no way he'd finish all that soda! With a grin he muttered a quick thanks and started to chow down. Victini leaned her head on her paw as she watched him before he piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Victini, what's it gonna take for you to grow me? You brought me here to discuss that, right?\" He said between mouthfuls as Victini frowned a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere goes...she thought as she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">It's, well, Zorua...ya see, it's...</span>\" Her nerves were getting the better of her, but she did manage to get it out.</span></div></div>",

Some of your pranks, like the two you pulled earlier, they're so cool!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed even more at the praising, though that didn't answer him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to the point, Victini.\" he said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">The point is: I really like you.</span>\" she admitted, feeling like she was going to explode; Zorua took notice of the temperature increasing in the room,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... I have for quite some time. Seeing all those pranks you pulled, it was so fun... but every time I tried to talk to you, you simply walked away.</span>\" the legendary paused to sigh,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">It was so frustrating. I wanted to talk to you badly, become friends with you, but you seemed uninterested.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua took a step back, uncertain how to tell the giantess that he avoided her because he considered her a weirdo. As for now, he didn't know. He guessed his opinion hadn't changed much, given that Victini had shrunken him only to see him pull a prank and escape Vulpix by pulling another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that paled to what she was asking him now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears perked as Victini kept speaking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... So when I developed the power to shrink things, I figured I could use it... to finally talk to you. I wanted to see how clever you really are when pranking, and you got past all my expectations,</span>\" she said, offering a sheepish smile,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Now you know...</span>\" Victini sighed deeply, then inhaled sharply,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">... I really like you Zorua. I see everyone hating you and I think to myself that I'm probably the only one who actually respects you for who you are... that's why the more time passed, the more grew my wish to... talk to you, connect with you... the more grew my opinion of you.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, Victini paused to look down, feeling her heart pounding her chest from within, but she ignored it. Getting her feelings out was a priority now, she had gone too far to stop. Might as well get this over with, she figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua watched the titaness in front of him, shocked by the rapidity of the events; he opened his mouth to say something, but immediately closed it again, his vocal chords having shut down because of the embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini finally raised her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I don't know what you think of me now but... I'm sure it'd work if me and you... y'know...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini trailed off all of a sudden, her large blue eyes fixed on the tiny dark-type sitting on his perch on top of her table. Her mind flashed with images of her and the fox together, causing her to smile sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zorua, he stood there in silence and disbelief, realizing that the fire-type was waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe how weird today had been so far; he was shrunken down, forced to pull to pranks on a pokemon that hated him before being asked out by the same pokemon who shrunk him in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was going too fast for the tiny dark-type, resulting in him being at a major loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victini...\" he muttered under his breath, feeling conflicted. If he agreed, he would get his size back; if he declined, would Victini still give him back his original stature? He did honor the deal after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire-type mustered enough courage to meet his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yeah?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had spoken that single word, Zorua had taken a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zorua looked up at the titanic, legendary fire type, mouth shut as he felt a blush creeping onto his face. She was kinda cute...and he did need to grow back. He looked down at his front paws as he nervously scratched at his ear with a hind paw. \"Um...I guess we could try it...right? It could be fun...\" He said, nervousness entering his voice, something incredibly foreign sounding coming from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini's eyes widened as slowly, very slowly she started to gain a hopeful smile. \"<span class=\"corange\">R-really?</span>\" She said, her chest about to burst as the butterflies in her stomach started going haywire. Zorua looked up at her face before slowly nodding. \"Yeah...\" He said, still feeling oddly shy. It was then that soft but powerful paws lifted him quite quickly from the table as he felt himself pressed against her chest in a tight but not painful hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Awesome! Thank you Zorua! Thank you thank you thank you!</span>\" The voice reverberated through the tiny dark type as he felt a bit dizzy by this relative giantess and her strong signs of gratitude. He would've said something, but he was afraid to open his mouth and bit his tongue with how much shaking was going on in his world. After about a solid minute of this he vaguely felt himself being pulled away from his warm and shaking experience as Victini held him in front of her face, a gentle smile and red blush covering it as he stared ahead at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">So uh...I mean, we can do it tomorrow after school right? It's Friday tomorrow!</span>\" Victini said and Zorua's eyes widened. That was soon! But he felt himself nodding \"Yeah, let's do it.\" He said. Victini's smile only widened as suddenly Zorua felt himself being lowered down to the floor. He looked up the the building sized Victini as her eyes took on a glow and Zorua's head felt cloudy once again. The world around him started to shrink around him as he grew bigger and bigger. He staggered back as this was going on, accidentally bumping into her table as he groaned before the process was over soon enough. He blinked as his senses became sharp again and he looked at the Victini in front of him, now smaller than he was. He felt like a giant...which itself was a disconnect since this was his original size in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh...yeah, date tomorrow...\" Zorua felt at a loss, far from the cocky prank king that he was. A blush crossed his muzzle as he looked down at the floor, anywhere but Victini's gaze right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Right! Let's um...meet at the village plaza!</span>\" Victini said excitedly and Zorua felt himself nodding. \"Yeah, it'll be f-fun. I uh...I gotta get home! It's kinda late! Reallylookingforwardtoitbye!\" Zorua said nervously as he bolted for the exit, only to run into Victini's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...\" He muttered as the door was opened by Victini, her smile never fading. \"<span class=\"corange\">Thanks for today, Zorua.</span>\" She said as she gently pecked him on the cheek while he was dazed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man she's a weirdo...right? She's pretty cool though too...really cool...cute too...what the hell am I saying!?\" Zorua was muttering to himself as he passed through the forest he'd basically claimed as his territory, as close to his and his family's house as it was. It was pretty dark now and he was sure his parents were gonna grill him about what he'd done today, assuming the worst. Well...he had done pranks...but he could leave that part out. He just made a friend and hung out with her and was going on a date with her tomorrow. Wasn't a lie. He kept musing, unaware of the vicious glare that was on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">H-W-You were tiny!</span>\" He heard the familiar haughty voice of Vulpix. He blinked, she was still out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you're nuts.\" Zorua said nonchalantly as he stifled a chuckle at the angry looking, still fairly dirty Vulpix, though she'd done what she could to clean up while looking for him. \"Go home, this is just sad.\" He said, a smirk on his muzzle as she glared at him. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">I-I was looking for you! You were supposed to be small! I was-I-STOP PRANKING ME!</span>\" Vulpix shouted, her composure clearly not there as she ran off into the forest, probably to go home. Zorua finally let a chuckle come as she was gone. Man, she was always such a fun target...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started to approach his home, a carefree whistle came to him as he started to think of the next day...he wondered what would happen with Victini. What exactly was a date like? Would it involve more pranking? Or usual couple crap he saw when his mom or sister were watching some sappy movie...or maybe more of that weirdo size thing Victini could do? Hell, she was a legendary, who knew what ELSE she could do. That was when Zorua gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What if I piss her off?\" He muttered before shaking his head. \"Nah, i'll be fine.\" He chuckled, whatever happened, he could always handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Zorua! Butt in here! Now!</span>\" He heard a familiar voice coming from the door as he approached his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go...\" He said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">What have I said about staying out this late! And on a school night too!</span>\" His mother was scolding him as he just looked on ahead, his sister was thankfully already in bed so she wasn't getting too loud, but he knew he probably wouldn't get out of this easily. \"Look, sorry mom, I lost track of time, you know how it goes...\" He said, avoiding her gaze as his dad entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">More of your pranks?</span>\" He said, sounding weary as he looked to the two Zoroark's before him. He smirked. \"Actually I made a friend, and we hung out. Doing it tomorrow too.\" He said, carefree. Both of his parents blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">...Really?</span>\" His dad asked, trying to hide that he was taken aback by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, really. They approached me actually! You'll never believe it too, it was a girl! She wants to go on a date with me tomorrow!\" Zorua figured that if he played it this way his parents MIGHT back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom at this point interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">You'd better not be planning to prank her Zorua!</span>\" She said. Her faith in him was pretty low...not that he didn't give her reason most times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" He simply said, leaving out the part that he had planned to prank her today...albeit with a pretty crummy prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to move towards the kitchen, trying to get by his parents before he felt a tug on his tail from his dad. \"Come on, let me eat then go to bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">How about homework? Just because you got home this late doesn't mean you're skipping it, we've talked about this...</span>\" His dad said before he sighed. \"Fine, fine...just let me eat...\" He muttered. Arceus above what a long day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad let go as the two parents shared a look. \"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Think he's finally growing up?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Oh I hope so...</span>\" His mother said, the weariness entering her voice now too as she felt a small smile on her face.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was laying in his bed, finding it hard to find sleep as he thought about Victini. How DID he feel about her he wondered? He frowned as he started to blush. She was kinda weird...but so was he he supposed. And giving her a chance...that should be fine, right? She liked him, and it was how he was gonna grow, it wasn't like he was the one that wanted to do it at first so he shouldn't feel pressured about messing it up...it was her idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why was he nervous?</span></div></div>",

This was way out of his depths...he went to open the door before, as if out of nowhere a paw shoved him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I'm sorry sir, do you have a reservation?</span>\" Zorua blinked at the Furfrou with a star trim that was blocking his way before he shook his head. \"Uh...n-no? I'm here to meet my date.\" Zorua said before the Furfrou chuckled as two arms grabbed Zorua from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">No need to lie like that, you just want ta cause some havok in there, right?</span>\" The rough voice of Pangoro from the village informed Zorua of who had grabbed him as he was shoved back. He looked at Pangoro and glared, showing his canines before he shook his head and tried to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, i'm here for a date...just let me through...\" Zorua said. Both Pangoro and Furfrou moved out of his way as he smirked. Only to be grabbed by an invisible force and shoved into a mud pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! WHAT GIVES!?\" Zorua cried out as he looked to see who the two had moved for, as two fancy looking Ninetales were entering the restaurant...with Vulpix looking as smarmy as ever. She looked over to him with a smirk as she walked in as Zorua grew more and more irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST LET ME DO THIS STUPID DATE!\" Zorua yelled before he felt his surroundings start to melt around him, the mud dripping into oblivion as he looked around at the dark space he was in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Stupid date...? Is that what you think? I poured my heart out for you and it's a stupid date?</span>\" The voice was from all around him, as the ground quaked. The surroundings started to coalesce into a home...his home. But it was giant. Was he tiny again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Wow bro, that's callous, even for you.</span>\" He looked up to see a Zorua with a bow around her neck...his sis, but she was a towering giant! \"A-Abby!?\" He cried out in alarm as he turned to run, only to crash into a cream colored paw. He looked up to see Victini glaring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victini! D-did you shrink me again?\" He asked as her glare grew more narrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">I liked you, and this is how you treat me! You'll pay Zorua!</span>\" Victini said as tears started to well up in her eyes as her foot lifted into the air...over Zorua. He went to run, only to find that he couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, his parents in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">This is for the best, right dear?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Of course it is, Zorua just couldn't behave himself...he'll never learn.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Bye bro! I'll take good care of your room!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the voices sounded around him, the foot was getting closer and closer as he looked up, shutting his eyes before the inevitable...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua opened his eyes to see himself in his own room, his heart beating fast as he looked around. He threw his covers off of him as he went to look around...it was quiet, normal. '<i>A dream? Holy crap!</i>' He was breathing harder than normal as he calmed himself down and sighed. He looked at his bedside digital clock and groaned. His alarm was gonna go off in 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...school.\" He muttered before his mind drifted to after. A date, right? With Victini...he didn't know why he was so damn nervous about this. He blinked some sleep back as he looked at his clock and reluctantly shut the alarm off. No point in trying to go back to sleep now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Come onnn, tell me what you did yesterday!</span>\" His sister pouted next to him as they walked to school, passing through the forest as Zorua tried to ignore her. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Tell me tell me tell me tell me!</span>\" Zorua's eye twitched as he looked at his annoying younger sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I always do! Pranks! Now shut up! I had a rough night...\" Zorua muttered as his sister pouted...followed by a grin. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Rough night? So it wouldn't be annoying if I did...</span>\" Zorua groaned as he looked around to see that his sister was nowhere around him. She was learning to use illusions really damn well and this was one of her new favorite things to do...he tried to mentally prepare himself for whatever was about to happen before she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">THIS!</span>\" It sounded off loudly in his left ear as she yelled into it. Zorua glaring at his now visible sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You know you'll pay for that later, right?\" He said, deadpan in tone as she grinned. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">As if, you know mom and dad would ground you~</span>\" His sister said as she playfully skipped ahead. Zorua sighed as he followed her into town, towards the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua was sitting bored in his class as he considered what was coming up after...he looked around, but Victini wasn't in his class...he wasn't sure what class she was in, now that he thought about it. Why had he only tried to get to know her yesterday? He supposed it was because she forced it but...she did seem pretty cool right? Why even think this much about it...he was just pretty much hanging out with her right? It was called a 'date' but what was it really gonna be? Probably pranking right? That's why she liked him...or maybe it would be going to get some food, that'd be fun too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Zorua! Stop staring out the window!</span>\" The teacher's voice snapped him to attention as he looked to the Miltank at the head of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stammered a bit before nodding, the class either giggling at him, or giving him looks more likely than not related to pranks he may or may not have pulled on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't keeping his mind straight right now...he knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini for her part was antsy in her seat as she looked around, thinking about what was coming up later...she couldn't wait to finally get to go on a date with Zorua! She couldn't believe she'd finally worked up the courage! She hoped he hadn't just said yes to get away from her shrinking him...but this was finally her chance to win him over for real. She giggled a little, not realizing that eyes in her class were on her, seeing her blushing and giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">What's up with her...?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cindigo\">Who knows...I don't wanna get burned though so I ain't askin'</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini was unaware of the murmuring around her as she thought about later, and how she was going to approach the date...</span></div></div>",

She couldn't care less about class right now, the only thing that occupied her mind entirely was the incoming date with Zorua. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach second that passed made her heart beat slightly faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, the legendary smirked to herself as a devious plan came to her mind. Now she was sure how she was going to spend the evening with Zorua; if the fox never went on a date, she decided, he was gonna go on the biggest date of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, school ended and let an annoyed Zorua walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type prankster stopped in front of the building, waiting for his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf his parents knew he had let her wander through the woods alone to get home, he'd be eaten alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the younger Zorua really had it coming at her sometimes... like himself. That was practically the whole reason Victini shrunk him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shook his head and sighed, the thought of Victini strong enough to enter his other thoughts about his annoying little sister as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I gotten myself into...?\" he murmured to himself, before noting a familiar pair of orange ears among the crowd of pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Zorua cloaked himself in an illusion as Victini came out and fluttered inches away from him, going right past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she didn't even sense him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invisible Zorua waited for her to be gone and sighed before becoming visible again; he wasn't sure why he avoided Victini, but he guessed it would have been weird to see her publicly talking to (and possibly kissing) him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua flushed red, why couldn't he stop thinking about-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hi bro!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Zorua screamed and jumped in place, before turning around to glare at his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abby quit that!\" he growled in annoyance, causing his sister to snicker; her snicker was much similar to his, he mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Why? You do pranks all the time!</span>\" she retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sighed, guessing that it was his fault if he was setting the wrong example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... A prank is only fun if you're not the one receiving it, remember that.\" he scolded, before starting to walk, his sister skipping beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Which is great, 'cause I know you're never gonna prank me!</span>\" his sister snickered, before adopting a look of false innocence, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I mean, unless you want mom and dad to...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, one more word, I don't care whatever mom and dad will do to me, and I'll leave you to find your way through the woods to get home.\" Zorua warned, exasperated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already tense because of his incoming date, he didn't want to deal with his annoying sister right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Zorua snickered again, but then went quiet, internally wondering if her big brother was capable of turning his threat into a reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided that he was, given what other pokemon in her class told her about him: last time she had pushed her luck, her favorite bow disappeared to never come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch and a good rest at home, the time came for Zorua to get to the place where his date was gonna meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just hoped everything went fine, unlike it had in his dream; feeling uneasy, the dark-type left home around 6 P.M. to get to the village plaza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually got there and waited, ignoring the suspicions or hateful stares from the passing pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, without Victini showing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she?\" he murmured to himself, already regretting this. What if she already came and didn't find him and assumed he wasn't going to show up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua shuddered, had he already messed up before even starting? Had he-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">What are you doing, Zorua!?</span>\" someone yelled real loudly, causing Zorua to jump a foot in the air before coming down to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ABBY!\" he screamed, ignoring the stares other pokemon shot him,<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's younger sister pointed her paw at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You've been acting too weird, bro, I wanna know what's going on!</span>\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's none of your business.\" Zorua replied, nervously glancing around to check if Victini was anywhere near them,<br>\r\n\"Now go home, I've got something important to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You're so planning to pull a prank, aren't you?

He groaned as he looked up at the titanic legendary. \"Was shrinking me again really necessary?\" He asked as she smiled down at him. \"<span class=\"corange\">Not really, but don't you worry, this'll be great! You'll have a great time and that's a Victini guarantee!</span>\" She said with enthusiasm as Zorua looked out and about at the passing giants. If some of them could get a hold of him right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hey lady! What'd you do to my brother!?</span>\" A familiar voice chimed from close by and Victini looked to and fro to see...no one. Zorua for his part only groaned. As if he needed this right now...of all the things to deal with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini looked to where she had thought she heard the voice, only to find nothing. When she looked down at her own paw for Zorua, she also saw...nothing!? Where had he gone, where was he!? She looked around frantically before his faint voice called to her side. \"I'm over here Victini...\" The voice sounded like a mix of agitated, defeated, and tired, but it was Zorua. When Victini looked over, she saw the younger sister of Zorua, Abby...pawing at her older, now much smaller brother as he was trying to dodge her paws. Victini blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">How did she...?</span>\" She shook her head before heading over as Zorua dove away from his titanic sister as quick as he could. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Whoa...</span>\" Her breath wafted over the tiny dark type as he glared at his sister, and she giggled. She then looked to Victini. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Wow, this is so cool! Did he prank you? Is that why you did this?</span>\" Victini gave a small smile to the younger pokemon as she shook her head. \"<span class=\"corange\">Actually no, I did this preeeetty much for the fun of it.</span>\" She said as she bent down, picking Zorua up and pulling him close to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">We're actually about to go have a fun evening together. I thought this would spice it up, for the both of us. Just a bit of a harmless prank on our favorite prankster.</span>\" Victini said kindly as Abby blinked, before looking at the tiny ball of fluff she was holding that was supposed to be her big brother. She gave a smirk to her brother as her eyes narrowed smugly. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Wow, gotta say, I think you might've been right about pranks being fun when they aren't pulled on you, right <i>little</i> bro?</span>\" She said as she giggled at this. She turned her attention to Victini and held out a paw. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Hi, i'm Abby!</span>\" She said. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Zorua's <i>big</i> sister!</span>\" She giggled at this before Victini used her free paw to shake. \"<span class=\"corange\">And i'm Victini, Zorua's um...date.</span>\" She said, blushing and smiling to herself as she said those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">A date? Really Zorua? Wooow, that is crazy! Well, I suppose when mom and dad told you to grow up you might've taken the words to heart...oh, wait.</span>\" She said as she gave another smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked unimpressed as he was about ready to pull his trump card on Abby, when push comes to shove...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Maybe he could stay like this for a while? It'd be great to play dolls, right Zorua?</span>\" Abby said as Zorua gave a nonchalant smile, no teeth at all, it almost looked...kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wouldn't that be fun Abby? One last play session with Zoey before I make sure she disappears, eh?\" Zorua was referring to Abby's favorite doll, a, admittedly pretty expensive Zorua doll that she'd gotten. Zorua had never messed with it and never intended to really, and he knew that Abby hid and guarded that thing pretty hard from him. Victini watched this exchange with amusement, it was pretty obvious these two were siblings, cut from the same cloth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Ha, as if you know...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you hide Zoey under the 5th floorboard under your bed where your snack stash is that mom and dad don't know about and that I could easily rat out? As if i'd know that...now I do believe it's time for good <i>little</i> sisters to go and maybe catch a movie until her <i>big</i> brother picks her up after his date and we can go home where <i>no one will find out how big her brother really was that night?</i>\" Zorua finished in as kind and warm a tone as he could currently muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby's mouth hung agape as she quickly closed it, blushing before giving a nervous smile. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Um...okay Zorua. Have fun on your date...</span>\" She said as she walked off, Victini waved at her. \"<span class=\"corange\">Don't worry, i'll bring him back here in a few hours! Have a good night, it was good meeting you Abby!</span>\" Abby looked back with a smile as she waved her paw, leaving the two in silence as they looked around. No pokemon seemed to really pay any attention to them...though they were pretty far from any others at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua let out a sigh as he looked up at his date, who only had a grin. \"<span class=\"corange\">Wow, power play.</span>\" Victini said impressed as Zorua smirked. \"I love my little sister to pieces, but I don't take challenges well.\" Zorua said smugly as he looked around. Though he knew he'd need to get new leverage now. That hiding spot was probably about to change within a week or so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini started to flutter away again as Zorua opted to look at the giant buildings around him. Being this size really was a trip...and something he guessed he could try to enjoy. Victini was taking the wheel of this date it seemed anyway so he might as well go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked down at the dark type in her paw she almost felt like her chest was going to explode. This was really happening...Zorua was with her on a date...and she was going to make the most of it. She soon approached the destination of their date, the place that she'd win him over for good.</span></div></div>",

Elaborating possibilities... it is better if they do not know about your current situation, expected bad reaction in the contrary case.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for sure.\" Zorua flatly said while Magearna went to sit at the table, placing her tiny 'guest' down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a white sheet and a pen from the same table and began writing rather fastly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Elaborating correct choice of words...</span>\" she mumbled every once in awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she wrote, Zorua had the chance to look around again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to him that the house was completely deserted aside from him and his giant host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Magearna, do you live alone?\" he questioned, causing the metal giantess to look up from her sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Affirmative.</span>\" she replied, before her eyes got half lidded in what Zorua judged to be a sad expression, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">I do not know who my creator was or about his actual conditions.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt an idiot for bringing up such subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, uh... I'm sorry.\" he muttered an apology while Magearna returned to writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while though, she looked up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Letter 100% written. Results satisfying.</span>\" she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua took a look at the written sheet, which announced, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">'Dear Mr. and Mrs.,<br>\r\nYour son, Zorua, will be staying at my house for a school assignment which requires the cooperation of both and that will last a few days. In said time, Zorua will be fine and taken care of flawlessly. You'll be informed if anything negative happens.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Magearna.'</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds rather menacing.\" Zorua commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Negative.</span>\" Magearna replied, looking at the tiny fox. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Now, Zorua the prankster, can you tell me about the subject I already mentioned?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua blushed, but shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only an event where you ask someone to be your partner to dance at school, really. It's supposed to be fun, but I've personally never gone. Kind of annoying to me.\" he explained, before looking at the giantess before him,<br>\r\n\"Are you... going?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know why, but he couldn't imagine Magearna joining such occurrence; when he tried picturing her dancing, he couldn't help but feel weirded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Affirmative.</span>\" the metal titaness replied,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">I will be joining the 'dance', though I currently lack a 'partner'... elaborating... Zorua the prankster?</span>\" she asked then, causing Zorua to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">I have decided that, in exchange for my help to grow you back to your previous and original size, you are going to do something for me.</span>\" Magearna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua perked up, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\" he asked,<br>\r\n\"... What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small cloud of steam exited through Magearna's long ears, leading Zorua to believe she was embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she spoke.</span></div></div>",

I don't dance well!\" Zorua said, trying to come up with an adequate excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">I am able to assist Zorua the prankster in learning 'dancing'.</span>\" Magearna said.

But as he thought about it, he realized that if he kept saying no he might be with this weirdo pokemon for a long time...at this size...with no freedom...no pranking! He gulped as he steeled his resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If, I agree...IF I agree!

This artificial pokemon had him over a barrel...he never expected her to be capable of blackmail of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" He said, still through gritted teeth. \"I will accompany you to the freaking school dance.\" Magearna at this allowed herself a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Consent has been received. Proceeding to plan for event 'school dance'.</span>\" She said as she gently picked Zorua up, bringing him level with her red eyes.

Luckily, it stayed in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Zorua decided it was good his prank didn't fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, it was never a good idea to mess with a legendary, and one with <i>her</i> power, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta was fluttering towards his prank, blissfully unaware, looking around nonchalantly. Was she looking for him? Odd, since, all the times the two met, they didn't exchange a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause, unlike most Pokemon in school, Zorua wasn't really interested in the admittedly pretty legendary, but didn't try to prank her either. The two simply ignored each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why was Meloetta in HIS forest right now? Pokemon just avoided it, knowing what awaited them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Meloetta, Zorua only really knew about her legendary status, which made her a dangerous target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever,  she was also supposedly nice from what the prankster had heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, risk or not, it all paled when Zorua thought about how high his reputation was going to be when he told he had managed to prank a legendary and get away with it. In fact, only few Pokemon ever caught Zorua after getting pranked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, they paid him back harshly, but he was sure he could get away from Meloetta, as he was with all of his previous victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making up his mind, the fox waited and, as the green-headed legendary fluttered towards the branch the bucket was resting on, he pulled the rope, causing it to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to slow down and, for a moment, Zorua's mind saw his bucket falling on Meloetta, spluttering its contents onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was just a mirage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the very last second the legendary looked up and, noting that she was about to be hit by the bucket, did what everyone would do in a situation like that: she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, hers was no normal scream, because it sent out of her mouth a wave of sound so sharp that the bucket was blown away and unceremoniously fell to the ground while Zorua was forced to cower in his hiding spot, deafened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his ears ringing for several moments, until the pain started to loosen its grip, allowing him to open his eyes, only to discover that things were way different than he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest now looked like an endless jungle, while the same Pokemon that had screamed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt his blood growing colder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen did Meloetta become so tall!? She was impossibly huge to him now! As a matter of fact, everything around Zorua was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt meant... that he had shrunken down! But... how? Why? What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be an explanation to this, and the only one he could think of was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua looked in Meloetta's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs questions raged inside of the dark-type's head, Meloetta was busy looking around, trying to figure out who had tried to 'attack' her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Who's there?</span>\" she called, sounding upset now that she had realized that the 'ambush' was nothing more than a prank,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">This is not funny! Come on out!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, Zorua took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Meloetta, seeing as she wasn't receiving any response, she warily called out again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Stay away from me!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the legendary resumed flying, though at a faster pace than before. Evidently, the prank startled her enough to make her enter an agitated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the giantess fluttered near him, Zorua's mind quickly put two and two together, and he snapped out of a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, he couldn't stay like this and be left on his own by the very Pokemon that shrank him in the first place without her even knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get her attention, or she was going to leave without even knowing what she did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, the diminutive fox stumbled to his feet and sprinted behind the green headed giantess, trying to keep up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy, given her bigger stature and the gift of flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua had to get her attention fast, or she was going to just leave him behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Meloetta!\" the fox cried at the top of his lungs as he sped towards the singing legendary, desperately hoping she'd hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, Meloetta thought she heard someone calling her name and stopped in mid-air, looking curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Huh?</span>\" she wondered,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Did someone call me?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua finally arrived right beneath her hovering form and stood underneath her toeless white feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" he screamed, cheering since Meloetta could apparently still hear him. He guessed he wasn't that tiny, after all, but he still didn't want to be the size he was now.<br>\r\n\"Meloetta! Down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess seemed to hear him perfectly, because her blue eyes suddenly looked down, scanning the forest floor for a couple moments before they finally set onto Zorua and widened as they recognized the poor fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Meloetta was speechless. However, Zorua wasn't,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meloetta! You've got to help me!\" he cried, jumping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary recovered from the surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Zo-Zorua?</span>\" she stuttered as her slender form began lowering and she brought her face closer to Zorua to better see him,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Is that you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me!\" the fox replied, somewhat relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute, Meloetta just stared at him in disbelief, wondering why Zorua was tiny and calling for her. Then, the giantess found her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua nervously stared back as he noted Meloetta staring at him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You, being a Absol of course, were deep in thought as you stared at the job posting board in front of you. Being apart of a one man, or in this case, one Pokemon rescue team and all meant that missions had to be completed. Missions ranged from rescuing Pokemon lost in dungeons, retrieving a item, or sometimes even defeating a Pokemon outlaw. However you were a solo team, comprising of you...and no one else. You could say that you were above average in doing missions. There are some missions that you can handle by yourself, and you have pretty good strength. However, there were still quite a bit that gave you trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you look away from the board and step back. Some of the jobs were just way too difficult, and others were too simple and offered little reward. You were friends and on good terms with a lot of the guild members in your guild. You could possibly ask one of your fellow guild members to come along with you on a more difficult mission, it would make things a lot easier, plus you wouldn't get as bored, since you would have some company to tag along with you. Plus missions are always fun and exhilarating, giving you a sense of adventure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other paw, you could just use this as a day off and head into town. The town was always bustling with Pokemon and shops, so it could keep you busy for the day. You had some poke stored away in the bank that you've wanted to spend for a while now. A day of shopping could be fun, and you would get new items to help you out on missions. And after you did shopping you would have a few hours to just chill and relax for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave it some thought, tapping a paw against your head, thinking of what to do to for today. You thought of the pros and cons of both options. After thinking over it you decided that you wanted to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After some thought you decided that you were feeling too restless to spend a day relaxing and the idea of getting more money from missions was always nice. You figured it wouldn't hurt to do tougher assignment so you made your way down to the guild to find yourself a partner to do them with you. A quick walk later and you were pushing open the door to the guild main hall. Already you could see some potential candidates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one you noticed was Floatzel. She was a newcomer to the town and rose through the ranks quickly. Much like you, she did most of her missions solo but right now she was looking quite bored. A cute yawn emphasized her boredom as she leaned against the wall with her arms crossed, her eyes just staring at the middle distance. From the looks of things she had nothing to do and might enjoy the suggestion of going on a mission to give her something to do. A few times now you've chatted with her and she seemed easy-going so it shouldn't be a problem. You were also curious about a special ability she was rumored to have but that was just gossip you've heard a few times... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Pokemon that you can see that may join you was Quilava. As soon as you looked at him your eyes met and he gave you an enthusiastic wave with his stubby paw. You've never gone on a mission with him either but from what you've seen from him around the village he's very energetic and passionate. There were only a select few you can recall that actively go on missions with him and besides that small friend group of his, most other Pokemon avoided him. Perhaps he was overbearing or had some other personality trait you didn't know about, not that you would know. Regardless, he would definitely come along if you asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could just check out the mess hall. Judging from the racket coming from it there were a bunch of different Pokemon currently finishing their lunch.</span></div></div>",

Yes there are plenty of pokemon size related interaction, but let's somewhat make things interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The pokemon has to be a pokemon, no anthro or furry, its not because i don't like them but rather its too easy to make to turn them into anthro and go from there. So as said, i'm strictly not going to allow anthro for this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, no worshipping, disgusting interaction like pee or scat or anything like that. I will delete any chapters like that without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird, you can either play as the pokemon that is changing the size of other or themself, or you can be someone else that is watching the size changing pokemon, be it a pokemon or human. Another thing, please make the pokemon either a boy or a girl, including legendary pokemons. I normally prefer giantess interaction, but this time i will allow giants as well, just to see how this goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForth, please only one size changing pokemon. They can shrink or grow other as they like, but only one pokemon is allow to change size. There is no limit to how big or small everyone gets, so go nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast rule for now, please put effort into at least making a paragraph with proper grammar. If its to make options for choosing a pokemon then i don't mind a short sentence or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther then that, you're free to do whatever you want, from making the pokemon playful and destroy cities to even shrink pokemon or humans and do whatever they want, go wild...just not too wild. I'll be changing rules later, but only in for something i forgot to add in. Other than that, please enjoy and please add in more chapters.</td>",
