With the knowledge that she doesn't want to hurt you, you find it easy to be comfortable, and just look around at the now much bigger world as the Jaggia carries you along with her pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the relative peacefulness can't last forever. Soon, the pack stops by a river. The Great Jaggi leading the pack stands tall and looks around for threats. Letting the smaller members of its pack drink from the river. The friendly Jaggia does so along with the others, but as she crouches down and dips her head towards the water, still clutching you tightly to her chest, you notice some of the other pack members eying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat the friendly Jaggia's claws, hoping to ger her attention, and she stops drinking to glance at you. You point at the pack members staring at you, and the Jaggia, somewhat surprisingly, is smart enough to understand your gesture's meaning. She looks over at the pack members looking at you, and lets out a quiet growl as she realizes that they might want to take you from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're nervous now. This Jaggia, as you noticed before, is smaller than her fellows. She wouldn't be able to protect you if any other pack members attacked her. As the friendly Jaggia stares down the other ones, and you glance back and forth between both sides, the stare-down is broken when...</span></div></div>",

The Jaggia holding you helps and backpedals, but it hit by a slash of the other Jaggia's claws. In pain and surprise, she accidentally drops you, and you t the ground hard. Getting up slowly, you barely avoid getting stepped on as the two Jaggia clash. You get up and run as fast as you can to escape, noticing that the other pack members are intently watching the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one Jaggia notices you. She bares her fangs, and you stop moving. She walks towards you, glaring down at you with an expression much less gentle than the Jaggia who first picked you up. You look up at her, hoping she won't try to steal you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the Jaggia crouches and reaches down with both hands, clamping them together around you. Your arms are pinned and you grunt as the Jaggia picks you up, raising you up to her face and glaring at you. You're afraid that she's going to eat you, using the confusion of the fight to take you for herself, but to your surprise, she simply growls at you and lowers you to her chest, holding you tightly as she watches the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume that she just wants to hold you until the two Jaggia finish their fight, so that you can't escape. And so, held in her slightly painfully tight grip, you watch as the two Jaggia fight, seemingly over who gets to keep you.</span></div></div>",

The Jaggia holding you growls slightly whenever you speak up, apparently annoyed by your noises, but she doesn't hurt you. You're thankful for that--she seems to have taken it upon herself to keep you unharmed so that the winner of the fight over you will not receive a damaged prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight drags on... And then suddenly the friendly Jaggia lands a powerful hit with her tail onto the side of the bigger Jaggia, making her for collapse with a roar. The friendly one rears her head back and roars triumphantly, and the other assembled monsters growl and grunt as they all turn and walk away. The fallen Jaggia gets up soon, and with a low growl to the friendly Jaggia, walks away as well. Apparently, the friendly one won the fight somehow, and has won the right to keep you for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're surprised as you feel yourself descending, and look around to see that the Jaggia holding you is lowering you to the ground before releasing her grip and stepping back so that the winner can claim you. You watch as the friendly Jaggia turns towards you and roars happily, running forwards and sliding to a stop inches away from you. You look up, standing underneath her head as she looks down at you and growls happily before reaching down with both hands. You let her pick you up, raising your arms so they will not be pinned as her giant hands clamp around you on either side and grasp you tightly, and she raises you to her face. You gaze into her eyes as she stares at you in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then suddenly, her tongue slips out and gives you a quick lick. You're surprised by it, and shake your head, trying to get some of the drool off, but you find that thankfully the lick was fast enough to leave little saliva on you. You're a little scared about what the lick means, but since the Jaggia just proceeds to lower you to her chest and hold you there as she walks back to her pack, you assume it was but a show of affection, a reminder that for whatever reason she refuses to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, safe in the friendly monster's grasp again, you are carried back to the pack, and along with them as they proceed their trip.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story is based on the video game called Monster Hunter, but with a little twist. Instead of being a hunter, you are a tiny human who is struggling to survive. You can decide which place based on the game where you can go to, pick which gender are you, and then choose whether you survive or get eaten by a monster. There will be a few rules in the story however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are the only human in the story. You cannot place other people in it.<br>\r\nSmall animals in real-life can appear in the story (Weasel, Squirrel for example) but make sure they don't eat your main character!<br>\r\nSome monsters will be able to talk when you are small, just make sure there's no vulgarity or anthros(excluding Lynians).<br>\r\nHard and Soft Oral Vore must be common, you can add other vore stuff too, but Oral must be more common.<br>\r\nSome Elder Dragons and other monsters may not appear in the story (Ashen Lao-Shan Lung, Lao-Shan Lung, Black/Crimson/White Fatalis, Yama Tsukami, Akantor, Ukanlos, Regular/Goldbeard Ceadeus, Regular/Hallowed Jhen Mohran, Alatreon, Rusted Kushala Daora, Dire Miralis, Lucent Nargacuga, Abyssal Lagiacrus) but if you want them to appear that's fine by me. ;)<br>\r\nAlso make sure no Lynians (Felyne, Melynx, Shakalaka, and King Shakalaka) eat your main character!<br>\r\nThe age for your character will be between 13 and 30 in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope you enjoy this and have a good reading!</td>",
