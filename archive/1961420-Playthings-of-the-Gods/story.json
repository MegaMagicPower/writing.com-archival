He only has enough bread for the morning, but after he sells some of his goat cheese and extra grain, he might get something more palatable for dinner. He enters the kitchen and pulls off some crusts of yesterday's bread. As he nibbles on the hardened crusts, he hears only the faint sound of his goats. They should be louder because the pen is outside of the kitchen, but the bleating is fainter than usual. He looks out the window. He can't see much of anything besides bright glowing fog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, half of the kitchen collapses to the right of Derrick. Shocked he turns around to see a massive giant foot, sole facing towards him. Derrick looks up through the hole to see five massive toes, the big one has a shining gold ring around it. He looks from behind it to see whoever owns this foot is swallowing his goats alive one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he doesn't know is he's before one of the giant gods:</span></div></div>",

He doesn't seem to notice as he rests his left hand on his six-pack, letting his rings glimmer in the bright light. With his other hand, he lowers another bleating goat towards his open mouth. He sets it down on his tongue before closing his lips. He smiles, feeling the tiny beast being rolled around on his tongue. Then with a loud gulp, Derrick sees no more sign of his goats except a bulge sliding down the giant's throat and into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant licks his lips, satisfied at his meal despite the work Derrick did to maintain the flock, now residing in his belly.

A loud thumping echoed throughout the chamber. Rex was patting his stomach, satisfied from his meal. Derrick felt anger build in his thoughts as he sloshed through the fluid to a wall and begun pounding against the side. \"You giant asshole!\" He shouted, \"I'm not food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls rumbled, and a loud belched echoes far above Derrick. There was a moment of pseudo-silence; where the gastric noises around Derrick were the only sounds he could here, before the chamber tilted and tossed Derrick and the goats around.

Maybe he can take advantage while he's not being digested - but to get out he needs to wake up Rex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stomps around in anger, he kicks something against the stomach wall. Whatever it was, it caused the muscular surface to contract and the entire stomach to shake. It's hard to tell for Derrick if this is just a normal reaction or if Rex has awakened. The deep heavy breathing resumes, giving him the answer. His foot touches something else, which out of curiosity he reaches to pick up. It feels round and smooth, though deeply pitted from Rex's digestive work. It must've been here for a while. In fact it feels like...a bone! Random bones litter the base of the stomach acid lake - a remnant of a big meal the giant swallowed recently. It's hard to tell what it belongs to, either animal or human. One end is blunt like a leg bone, the other has been badly corroded to a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he can use this bone as a tool to wake Rex up and get him out of his stomach. Swinging it like a hammer, he strikes the stomach wall with the blunt end again and again. The muscle wall recoils from each strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does it wake Rex?</span></div></div>",

In the middle of it is a gold cage, human-sized. It doesn't take much to figure out what Rex does with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flips the door open, \"Step inside, my tiny pet.\" The disowned farmer has no other option. From the reopened palm he steps off into the cage. The door slams behind him and the lock fastens magically. He is trapped as the giant slips the chain over his head and down his neck.

The other gladiator reaches for his sword as he struggles  through his bindings but as soon as he tries to give a mock blow to his friend's throat, he sees him stand petrified.

This grip does not crush their bones, but it is enough to press their armor to their skin and make the ordeal very uncomfortable. Smiling, the giant carries both to a velvet-cushioned couch made of gold built into the marble wall. He puts one foot on it and swings around, sitting down before reclining on a large pillow. Both hands open and the gladiators tumble onto the mountainous flesh of his muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight and amuse me!\" he says as he folds his arms back. Derrick holds the bars of his cage as it finds its resting place in the furrow of Rex's pecs. All he can do now is watch the duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRufus starts first with a rapid sword sweep. Dueling on a giant's muscles however is very different than the sand and dirt of the coliseum. His foot lands uneven on a low point of flesh and he leans forwards. Angelo sees his chance and hits him with the back of his trident. Rufus retaliates as his partner dashes aside, only for him to trip and land on one of Rex's abs. The uneasy duel amuses their new master more and more, as he smiles down and tries to mirror their moves despite his arms beneath his pillow under his head. Instead, it rattles his pecs, creating an earthquake on the battlefield near his navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremor shakes Rufus. As he struggles to stay upright and prepare to parry, Angelo dashes towards him with his trident. He rolls out of the way, but the trident strikes true...but not to the other gladiator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Rex yells as he unfurls his arms and turns down at his attacker.\"How dare you hurt me...\" he growls between his teeth. Angelo frees his trident from the skin, releasing a puddle of blood from the wounds. \"I'm sorry master,\" he gets on his knees and Rufus follows suit. \"But it's really hard to fight a duel on your godly body without hurting you...\" \"SHUT UP!\" Rex growls and grabs with two fingers the trident and Angelo, carrying them to his face. \"You have betrayed your master and now must be punished!\" He smiles, \"As an apt punishment for harming my flesh, you shall become part of it. Think of it - a great specimen of you puny mortals being digested and incorporated into my godly body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...please don't do this...\" Angelo begs for dear life as he hangs from his trident, now held high above Rex's face. His mouth opens and tongue folds down. If he lets go, his journey from mouth to stomach would be without wait. One hand fatigues and slides off the handle, while the other struggles to hold all of his weight. In the end, both hands release the trident and screaming, he lands onto Rex's tongue and slides directly down his throat. Mouth closed and a swallow, he sends him on his way to begin a slow digestion in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRufus stares in horror. He has known Angelo for a long time and now he just watched him being eaten alive. Rex uses the discarded trident and flicks it against his lower lip, staring down at the remaining gladiator...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately gods like Rex never seem to be very understanding when it comes to things like this. They were frantic to please him but Rex's patience wore thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women had been furiously working the giant's massive member. It smelled a bit funky but they kicked and rubbed at the warm flesh to try to appease the giant. Suddenly the huge hand of the giant moved towards his penis. The women screamed as it wrapped around his shaft and he moved it down his semi erect penis to stroke it. The women around the base of his cock were crushed as his hand reached the bottom before moving back up. For the women on the tip of his cock, some were thrown off and plummeted to their deaths screaming, while a few others held on near his silt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex sighed as he had to do this himself now. He was a god and should be pleasured, not forced to pleasure himself. He pumped his cock until he felt himself near climax. He sat up onto his knees and spotted a crowd of people rather close still attempting to flee. He grinned as he stroked himself twice more and aimed for the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex groaned as he came. The two remaining women on his tip holding on to his silt were obliterated by the massive burst of cum. The crowd was covered in Rex's spunk and the terrified people tried desperately to claw their way out of it. Some were crushed immediately by the force of it while others became trapped and drowned in it. A few managed to pull themselves from the sticky substance but it stuck to their clothes and skin. Rex grinned as he saw the mess he had made. He wiped himself off and stood up, picking up his silken sash and replacing it around his loins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex started to walk through the town, crushing house and people under his huge smooth feet.

Pugna laughs as Derrick groans knowing that now there is no way to warn the fortress of the imminent danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was suddenly booms, growing louder and louder. Derrick turned to see another massive being approaching. It was a huge woman who was wearing a fur animal print bra and loincloth. She was beautiful and had bronzed skin and Derrick watched as she stepped right over him. The giantess looked athletic with a toned physique. He saw her huge sole pass over him which was slightly dirty from walking around barefoot. He watched the huge foot sink into the ground, the toes planting themselves before her huge foot lifted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun are we?\" The giantess boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyria! So nice of you to join me. I was just about to wipe this eye sore of a puny outpost off the face of the land. Can you believe they call this an army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria stopped right outside the wooden wall of the outpost. She looked over the soldiers who were now even more terrified at the appearance of a second giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an army of ants! They are no match for you Pugna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you Kyria! Come, help me show these insects their place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria was a bold goddess and loved the idea of destroying an army of tiny mortals. She moved her foot straight through the wooden wall of the outpost giggling as it splintered from her huge foot. Pugna raised his foot over some soldiers who screamed before the huge foot crushed them. He then knocked over a tower and dragged his foot through another one of the wooden walls. A few archers in a tower began to shoot arrows at Kyria's massive toned leg to no effect. She moved her other foot back before she kicked the tower causing wooden splinters to fly everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick watched in horror as Kyria and Pugna stomped all over the outpost. They crushed numerous soldiers beneath their huge feet, laughing while they did so. The few buildings of the outpost offered no resistance as Pugna and Kyria stomped those as well. Derrick watched as Pugna began to pick up soldiers and toss them into the air only to catch them in his mouth and swallow them alive. Kyria soon joined him, plucking terrified soldiers from the ground and dangling them over her huge mouth before releasing them into her open mouth or tossing them into the air and catching them in her mouth. The small outpost had probably been destroyed in a matter of minutes with no survivors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick watched as the giantess toyed with a tiny man, lowering him towards her mouth and then raising him while she snapped her jaw and licked her lips. She finally dropped the tiny man into her mouth swallowing him whole.<br>\r\nDerrick realized in horror that Pugna and Kyria were unstoppable as they knocked down the rest of walls and buildings while they looked for anyone who may have survived their attack.</span></div></div>",

There were two massive Giants approaching the fortress. One was a massive woman with perfect bronzed skin who looked athletic and was wearing a fur animal print bra and loincloth. The other was a giant man wearing a tunic and he looked muscular. Both of the giants were barefoot and approaching the fortress alarmingly fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria and Pugna grinned as they stomped towards the fortress. They stopped just short of the fortress and towered over it. Derrick watched from the treeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are the mighty warriors who are going to put a stop to my conquering. I would love to see you all try!\" Pugna boomed as the soldiers prepared for battle. Kyria stood with her hands on her hips and grinned at the tiny soldiers and said, \"So are these the \"mighty warriors\" who will stop us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archers had manned the walls and began to shoot arrows at the giants. The arrows just bounced off the thick skin of the giants. Kyria lifted her huge bronzed foot up and slammed it down on the wall which cracked in response as well as crushing anyone on that section beneath her. She then swept her foot along the top of the wall sweeping tons of archers off the wall or crushing them beneath her huge foot while she grinned. She then moved her foot forward off the wall so she now had one foot inside the fortress and the other outside it. The athletic giantess than brought her other foot over the wall so she now was standing inside the fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers began to ready the trebuchets to fire at the giants. They watched the giantess attack the wall and she was now standing inside the fortress. \"FIRE!\" Yelled the officer and the trebuchets released their rocks. The rocks flew through the air and hit Pugna and Kyria. Neither giant was even left with a scratch as the rocks were like tiny pebbles to the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPugna meanwhile ripped a section of the wall from the ground and tossed it into the fortress crushing part of the barracks. When he ripped the wall up, he caused the part Kyria had stepped onto to collapse. Kyria then grabbed another chunk of the wall up and expertly threw it straight at the trebuchets launching those annoying rocks and demolished one with her throw she grinned at the results of her good throw. Pugna ripped another section of wall up and hurled it at the trebuchets crushing most of them. Kyria then ripped off another small chunk of wall and hurled it at the trebuchets crushing two. Pugna walked through the large hole in the wall he had made to stand next to Kyria. Kyria threw one last chunk of wall to destroy the last trebuchet and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great throw. Come now, let's destroy this puny fortress!\" Pugna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glady.\" Kyria responded as she crushed some fleeing soldiers under the ball of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPugna and Kyria began to stomp around the fortress. They crushed tons of soldiers beneath their huge feet. They ripped apart buildings or stomped on them as they came across them. They also would toss soldiers up in the air and catch them in their mouths as they ravaged the fortress. Kyria was stomping on soldiers who had fled to what was left of the barracks while Pugna was eating soldiers near the main hall. The soldiers screamed before being crushed beneath the balls of Kyria's feet or the heels. When Kyria finished destroying the barracks she joined Pugna by the main hall. Numerous soldiers had been crushed beneath the massive feet of the Giants or were being digested in their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giants chased the soldiers into the massive main hall. Then, using chunks of the wall and using the earth around the main hall, they blocked all the doors and windows to trap the soldiers inside the main hall. Pugna then tore the roof from the hall and grinned. Kyria towered over the hall and placed her hands on her hips. The trapped soldiers looked up in horror at the muscular giant wearing a tunic and the athletic bronzed giantess wearing a fur animal print bra and loincloth towering over the hall. The giants grinned down at the soldiers who desperately were trying to escape.</span></div></div>",

She chased on around with her index finger, hovering it over him before becoming bored and slamming it down upon him. Kyria then decided to just stomp the hall and few remaining men and stood up. The soldiers stared up at the huge athletic giantess in a fur animal print bra and loincloth. The bronzed giantess lifted her huge foot over the hall. The soldiers saw the huge sole of the giantess which was slightly dirty and she brought it down with a loud crash.

My legs were called as the hammer of the earth. My mouth as the gate of doom. My bowel as 'the last battlefield'. Even the army of the Gaman Empire is not enough to satisfy me\"<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"interrupted by Derrick\"You destroyed the Ancient Gaman Empire?\"<br>\r\nPugna shows his broadly smile. Derrick remain in silent. Gaman Empire is a strong empire that conquered this continent for 4000 years ago. Their army is the best. Never left a defeat record in the history. Until it fall mysterious. Some historian say their are destroyed by the god of war.<br>\r\n\"They are nearly impressive. The million of soldiers charge against me. But they can't made me fun enough. I need just three days to wiped their empire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick stay silent. He still don't believe the giant's tale.<br>\r\n\"No, that can't be. You're lie. If you try to scare me just try again.\"<br>\r\nPugna let out a loudy laugh.\"So you don't believe me. then I'll show you.\"</span></div></div>",

The five fingers of the giant collapse together, turning Derrick's house into rubble. The hand shakes before it descends on Derrick before he can make a run for it. Momentarily he gets pressed by the palm before getting scooped by the fingers along with the dust that was once his house. He gets carried by the enclosed fist to meet the giant himself. \"I am Solas,\" he says in a low voice, which sounds like thunder to his captive. \"Why did you eat my sheep and destroy my house?\" you shout back.

He seems not to care where he goes as beneath him, Derrick catches a glimpse of something small and moving, but from his present height he can not see it well. It could be a cow or a tiny man who escaped from the table, maybe somebody he knew. It doesn't matter though as the figure disappeared beneath Solas' foot and his little captive can only hear a faint crunch of bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolas carries his tiny toy to a great balmy ocean, at least one to Derrick. He never really swam in his life but as the fist around him loosens, he finds himself plummeting towards the water and landing with a great splash. He kicks and flails frantically as he breaks the surface. The water looks deep, so much so that he would probably drown before he reaches the bottom. All the while, Solas adjusts the thong and slips it off his waist. The first foot touches the surface, sending a tsunami wave towards the newfound swimmer. The ocean fits him fairly well, resting his back on one side and his feet on the other as the rest of his body submerges. Suddenly a massive hand descends behind Derrick and sends a tidal wave towards the shore formed by his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wash me!\" Solas demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick remarks. \"Sir, I have nothing to wash you with. How will I ever get this done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low growl echoes from up and down Solas wet chest. \"WASH ME!\" He flicks him down onto the surface of his skin close to the water. \"I won't order you a third time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmitting defeat, the tiny man gets onto his hands and knees and moistens them in the bathwater. Then he uses them like a sponge, running them up and down each hill of muscle on Solas' perfect chest. A slight grumble echoes from below, possibly his bowels. It is painful for him to realize that inside Solas, his goats are getting digested alive slowly and their flesh would be used by his body to build up the perfect muscle hills that he now must bend over to and worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only washed two of Solas' abs when the giant yawns. He can not look up lest he be punished, but he guesses that his new and cruel master is getting bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that...</span></div></div>",

With full force the splash was a tsunami of water and cruel winds that elevated pieces of the land and relocated beaches instantly. After the devastation, Solas had made a new set of islands and wet earth that had squashed out the small fishing villages along the oceanside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolas felt disappointment that he might've gotten rid of his new toy so quickly but to his delight, he found that his thong had made a safe wet tarp on one of the shores.

You will finish washing and worshipping me later as I grow bored of it now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Derrick was dropped into Solas's thong. Derrick screamed as he plummeted into the thong. Solas laughed as he felt Derrick squirming against his penis. Derrick was trapped between the thong and the giant's member which was a bit warm. He just prayed Solas would free him from his situation soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolas began to walk inland, his huge feet shaking the ground. Solas was simply walking, his feet snapping trees like twigs as he did. Solas came across a small house and simply stepped on grinning as it was crushed beneath him like nothing. The tiny people inside had no time to even react before the massive foot crushed the house. At one moment the house was shaking, the next the massive smooth foot of the God was crushing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolas continued walking across the land.

It was a giant woman who was laying with her right leg stretched out and her left bent while resting on her side and left arm and tossing goats into mouth with her right hand. Derrick watched as her massive bronzed hand closed around a goat, lifted the terrified goat over her mouth, and dropped it in. She swallowed the goat whole and then padded her firm muscular belly before reaching to grab another goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick had never seen a woman so huge before. She was beautiful wearing a fur animal print bra and loincloth and looked athletic. Derrick was terrified of her but at the same time very angry. Those goats were part of his livelihood and this giantess was eating them. He grabbed his pitchfork and walked towards the goat pen. For some reason he felt particularly brave today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! Stop eating my goats!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess tossed another goat into her mouth and swallowed before turning towards Derrick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say bug?\" The giantess said as she tossed another goat into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said stop eating my goats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess laughed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do we have here? A tiny mortal who thinks he can order ME around? I'll eat all of your goats and you can't do anything about it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she grabbed another goat and threw it up in the air, catching it in her mouth. She swallowed the goat and grinned at Derrick showing off her large pearly white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed the tiny pitchfork in Derrick's hand and gave him a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that little toothpick scares me? I am a goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick trembled as he watched her grab his last goat and toss it into the air, catching it in her mouth and swallowing it alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your goats were quite tasty,\" she said as she patted her toned bronzed stomach, \"so I'll spare you for so rudely interrupting me but you're mine now mortal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick heard a rumble as the giantess shifted her huge right foot, leveling the rest of Derrick's house. She then sat up and began to reach for him. He immediately dropped his pitchfork as soon as he saw her reaching for him and turned to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, you can't run from me!\" The giantess roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a massive hand was closing around Derrick.

She continued to tighten her grip on Derrick. What was at first a minor discomfort for Derrick was now almost unbearable. He was having trouble breathing and could feel his ribs compressing as Kyria squeezed him slowly. He began to gasp for breath as Kyria grinned. Right as Derrick though he was going to pass out, Kyria loosened her grip to allow him to breath. Derrick gasped loudly and sucked in air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You truly are a pathetic mortal.\" Kyria boomed as she put Derrick on the ground. She brought her large hand down towards him and he saw her middle finger was pressed against her thumb. Before he could even react, Derrick was smashed by her finger as she flicked him. It felt like he had been hit by a massive boulder. He flew through the air and bounced several times. Derrick groaned in pain while Kyria giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up. I barely even flicked you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick groaned again. If that was \"barely even,\" Derrick didn't want to feel actually being flicked. Kyria stood up and took a single step which shook the ground. She then brought her other foot next to her first foot so Derrick was between her massive bronzed feet. He noticed the shiny large gold toe ring on the second toe of her right foot. It was more gold than he had ever seen before and she was wearing it on her foot. It must've been worth a fortune! Derrick looked at the athletic bronzed legs before suddenly the big toe of her huge right foot barreled into him and knocked him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick heard a booming girlish giggle as he tried to collect his thoughts after being blindsided by the huge toe. Kyria hit him with her big toe again and giggled as Derrick was knocked flat once again. Kyria lifted her big toe and placed it on Derricks legs and lower body trapping him. Derrick pounded his fists against the bronzed toe but this did nothing but amuse Kyria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you put a little more effort in to that pounding? Then maybe I feel you better massaging my big toe!\" Kyria said before laughing. She increased the pressure on her big toe which made Derrick scream as pain shot through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I crush your little legs? Hmmm?\" Kyria taunted. \"Kiss my big toe if you don't want me to turn your legs to paste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick pulled himself up and planted a kiss on Kyria's big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say stop. And I barely even felt that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick kissed her toe once again, more passionately this time and planted kiss after kiss on Kyria's big toe. Kyria grinned as she watched him kiss her big toe. Kyria lifted her toe off Derrick after he kissed her foot numerous times. Derricks legs were in pain but at least they weren't crushed. He slowly sat up as Kyria's gaze rested upon him. He wanted as she leaned over and reached for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria's massive thumb and index finger pinched Derrick by the back of his shirt and lifted him up so he was dangling in front of her face. Kyria grinned at him as she mulled over what to do with him.</span></div></div>",

What was he thinking trying to stand up to such a monster? As Derrick stared at Kyria he couldn\u2019t help but feel that Kyria, although very tall, was quite a beauty. Kyria only wearing a fur loincloth and a fur bra, showed a lot of skin, Derrick couldn\u2019t help but feel a little turned on by this self proclaimed goddess, this was quite evident as he felt his nether regions becoming hard. Kyria had long brown hair tied up in a pony tail that came down to her wide hips. Kyria was truly a beauty in your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria holds Derrick by the back of the shirt with nothing but her thumb and index finger. Kyria stands in the middle of the empty Fields, fields that were once filled with a myriad of sheep, sheep that were now being digested inside Kyrias stomach. Kyria says nothing to you as she dangles you in front of her face, staring at you with her gigantic green eyes. She was obviously thinking, and Derrick knew better than to interrupt her thoughts, even if those thoughts where about how to torture him further. Kyria looking at Derrick sees something stirring from inside his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, and what do we have here?\u201d Kyria says with a smile, giving Derrick a front row seat to her house size teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBug are getting aroused, while staring at my divine visage?\u201d Kyria asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick says nothing out of fear but also embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBug I asked you a question.\u201d Kyria said with a deadly tone, her smile disappearing completely, and her grip growing tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Derrick shouts, not being able to stand the ever increasing pressure that Kyrias hand produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I can\u2019t help but feel attracted to you.\u201d Derrick says not being able to look Kyria in her gigantic eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why wouldn\u2019t you, I\u2019m a goddess, is it not instinctive for you mortals to find power and divinity attractive?\u201d Kyria says with a smirk on her giant face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut understand this mortal, you may find me attractive, you may want me somewhere in the minuscule brain of your, but I will never be yours, for I am beyond your reach, as you are beyond the reach of a ant.\u201d Kyria says, her smirk growing bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick could tell that Kyria loved to boast about her power, and she loved to lord her self over others, Derrick hated that kind of attitude and yet still he found himself attracted to her. Derrick hated his own weakness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am beyond your reach, for I am Kyria Goddess of the wild, and the great beasts. You do well to remember this mortal.\u201d Kyria says with authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria flowed with a golden light as she shouted her name to the heavens. Derrick never once believed in gods or goddesses, but seeing Kyria made him a believer, but god or goddess, it didn\u2019t change Derricks rage. This women had eaten his sheep, and therefore had set him back for months, when it came to making his quota. The more he thought about it the more he grew angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t love you, I don\u2019t want you.\u201d Derrick said in a low serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Kyria says raising a eyebrow <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to leave, leave me to my farm, my work, you, you have already caused enough damage, eating my sheep, making all of my work meaningless, I will not forgive!\u201d Derrick shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing derricks response Kyria lets out a loud laugh, almost bursting derricks eardrums. Q<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do have a little backbone, I like that.\u201d Kyria says holding Derrick closer to her face, so close that Derrick could feel her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say I\u2019ve caused enough damage.\u201d Kyria says looking around at her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell trust me mortal you haven\u2019t seen damage yet.\u201d Kyria says stepping on, and completely crushing derricks barn with her right foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t forgive me?\u201d Kyria asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell bug I do not need your forgiveness.\u201d Kyria says with a series tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to leave, very well.\u201d Kyria says with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are coming with me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore derrick could react, before he could say anything he felt himself descending at amazing speeds, speeds that almost took his breath away. Derrick found Himself free from Kyrias grip and felt something soft beneath him. It didn\u2019t take Derrick long for him to figure out where he was, all Derrick could do was let out a huge gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be honored mortal, to be able to pleasure me in such a way.\u201d Kyria says looking down at Derrick who was currently inside her loincloth, looking at the biggest pussy he had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy the ride bug.\u201d Kyria closes the loincloth concealing Derrick in darkness. Before closing the loincloth all the way Kyria could hear Derrick begging. She did nothing but giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might finally have a good toy to play with this time. \ud83d\udc3b<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kyria\u2019s loincloth was tight, therefore Derrick was shoved up against the fabric and Kyria\u2019s mountain sized pussy. Derricks lower body was being shoved inside Kyria\u2019s outer lips, while his upper body was outside still squirming, still trying to find away to free himself from his fleshy prison. Derricks surroundings where getting hotter and hotter, he knew the reason why, how could he not? The cause of this heat was because Kyria was getting turned on, she made that quite evident, as Derrick heard her moan in pleasure as he struggled to free himself. Well if their was good news, it was that derricks boner was at least gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I got to say for someone so small, you feel so good down their mortal.\u201d Derrick heard Kyria say as she continued to moan loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step Kyria took derricks surroundings would vibrate violently, shaking him to his core, while also pushing him further and further inside Kyria\u2019s private\u2019s. Derrick was out of options, his meager strength was not enough to free him, and in a few more minutes he would be completely inside Kyria\u2019s pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis does not look good.\u201d Derrick says terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the shaking stops, Derrick knew for certain that Kyria had stopped walking, but the question is why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick could hear Kyria talking to someone, he came to the conclusion that Kyria was talking to another god or goddess because she was actually happy to see whoever it was. Derrick barley being able to move, could only listen in to Kyria\u2019s conversation with the mysterious stranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you old friend.\u201d Derrick hears Kyria happily say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m good, but been better.\u201d Derrick hears the voice of another women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Kyria asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been human hunting for hours now, and every human I have come across has disappointed me one way or the other.\u201d The other goddess says with a disappointed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick didn\u2019t like the way the other goddess had said how she was hunting humans, what were they animals? Derrick thought as he continued to struggle, his strength renewed from his righteous anger. After a few minutes of fighting his prison, Derrick once again hears Kyria moan out in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you Kyria?\u201d Derrick hears the other goddess ask through the loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick bears Kyria go silent for a while, for a moment he thought that she was not going to reveal his presence, which he hoped Kyria wouldn\u2019t. Derrick was already dealing with one gigantic goddess right now, he didn\u2019t want to deal with another. To bad he was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might not have found a good mortal Puella, but i have.\u201d Kyria says naming the other goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPuella, so that\u2019s her name. Great.\u201d Derrick says with a huge sigh \ud83d\ude14.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you have one right now?\u201d Derrick hears Puella ask with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I have one, and I got to say, he is a pretty good one, you wouldn\u2019t believe what he did to me when I first saw him.\u201d Kyria says with a little giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yea? What did he do, by the gods tell me.\u201d Puella says with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe little bug dared to make demands of me.\u201d Kyria says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, I didn\u2019t think a mere mortal would be so brazen to make demands on a goddess.\u201d Puella says with a small giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I got to say, the little thing is brave, that is the reason I didn\u2019t kill it.\u201d Derrick hears Kyria say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have the mortal with you?\u201d Puella asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes the mortal is with me.\u201d Kyria answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the gods I have to see him, where is he.\u201d Derrick hears Puella ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my loincloth.\u201d Kyria says simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your loincloth well I got to say, you are giving the little bug a treat.\u201d Puella says with another giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow doe he feel?\u201d Puella asks truly curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe feels quite good, not perfect but almost enough to get my juices flowing.\u201d Kyria says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea right. You could have fooled me.\u201d Derrick says feeling Kyria getting wet, as he struggle against her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must see the little thing, even more after hearing that.\u201d Puella says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh alright.\u201d Derrick hears Kyria say with a tiny bit annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flooded inside the loincloth temporarily blinding Derricks eyes. Derrick with his eyes closed could feel the fresh air brush up against his cheek and run through his brown hair, the sweat on derricks skin making the cool air feel all the better. Derrick opening his eyes sees a building sized hand descend from the heavens. The giant hand with its index finger and thumb carefully grabs derricks right arm, and with great ease frees Derrick from Kyria pussy. Derrick is soon lifted up and out of Kyria a loincloth and is soon confronted by Kyria humongous face at she stared at him with her giant green eyes. Kyria soon drops Derrick in the middle of her right palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell bug I\u2019m afraid we are going to have to put a hold on you pleasuring me.\u201d Kyria says with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick hated that smirk on Kyria face. It was the kind of smirk that was designed to let people know that she knew she was better than them, it was a smirk filled with cockiness and pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a friend for you to meet.\u201d Kyria says reverting her gaze on something or someone behind Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick slowly turns around and sees a women who\u2019s beauty rivaled if not surpassed Kyria\u2019s. The women had long black hair that came down to her waist, she had black eyes that seemed to be as deep as a black hole as they sucked derrick in as he looked into them. The women had the same bronze skin as Kyria, and wore only a silken bra and bikini. The women unlike Kyria wore different types of jewelry. She wore two silver bracelets around her wrist, and a silver neckless with a small diamond that twinkled like a star around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY, you, you must be Puella.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Derrick didn\u2019t know what would transpired from this meeting, but he knew one thing, compared to the two towering goddess, Derrick had never seen anyone so beautiful in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is the brave little mortal.\u201d The goddess Puella said with a voice that seemed to vibrate derricks surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a little cute.\u201d Puella said leaning in ever closer to Derrick to get a closer look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast Puella he\u2019s mine!\u201d Kyria yelled almost bursting Derricks ear drums while wrapping you up in the fleshy prison which was her massive hand \ud83d\udd90.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick at that moment felt a myriad of emotions. Emotions such as fear, fear that these gigantic beings would grow bored of him and finally end his life, he felt anger, anger that was spawned from the fact that these so called goddess didn\u2019t even treat him like a human being, and yet he also felt flattered, flattered that these beautiful goddesses seemed to be fighting over him, girls fighting over him, that would be a first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry \ud83d\ude09 Kyria I know better than to still from you.\u201d Puella said with a small giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell mortal.\u201d Puella said as she stared down at Derrick with a devilish smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c My name is Puella goddess of praise and Beauty, who might you be little one.\u201d Puella asked as she looked at Derrick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM, my name I, is Derrick. Derrick Collins ma\u2019am.\u201d Derrick says trying with all of his strength to get the words out of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDerrick...\u201d Puella said sounding out derricks name as if she found it entrusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to remember that.\u201d Puella said still focusing on derricks form which was still being held in Kyria\u2019s grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome Puella, I am taking this little insect back to my chambers for a little fun, come and join me.\u201d Kyria asks putting her hand on Puella\u2019s right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I would like nothing more than to join you but I have a prior engagement, so I\u2019ll have to meet you later old friend.\u201d Puella said walking away from Kyria with earthshaking foot steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope to see you again Mortal, that is if you live long enough.\u201d Puella said as she stopped walking and stared at Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick didn't know what to think of the goddess Puella, it had already looked like she had already forgotten his name, seeing as to how she had called him mortal, but so far he already liked her more that Kyria. Derrick especially liked Puebla\u2019s outfit, for she only wore a silk bikini that left little to the imagination. Derrick feeling the gaze of a stranger turns around to see the giant face of Kyria staring at him with a big smile on her face, which made him feel more uncomfortable than he already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like what you see mortal?\u201d Kyria asks while giggling, bringing Derrick closer to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mortals, you men in particular never change, slaves to the feminine form, well understand this as a goddess Puella is so far beyond you.\u201d Kyria says while looking at Derrick as if he were a ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gracing Derrick with her words Kyria with Derrick in hand walks to her chambers. Both Kyria and Derrick refused to make a sound. After a few minutes of walking Derrick soon sees a gigantic structure that stood on top of a grassy hill. The structure was made out of beautiful stone marble and was surrounded by tall trees \ud83c\udf33 which had fruit covered in glittering \u2728 gold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to my temporary home mortal.\u201d Kyria said looking down at Derrick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A lighter yawn follows. \"Whew, that walk really did tire me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick's gets jostled in Kyria's hand as the giant goddess leans back until she sits down in the emerald grass.

Derrick was pinned against the bottom large toe with his back passed against the ring and his face buried in her toe flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria giggled as she felt Derrick's weak squirms. Derrick was pressed face first against Kyria's warm toe flesh. He struggled to breath slightly as he was pressed up against the toe.

Two scantily clad gods are outside waiting to receive her and laugh at her.

She is nestled in between his giant balls, rocking forth with the liquid inside them as the giant disposes of the army that had been sent to rescue his prize. It's a complete massacre for them. The giant's thick skin repels all thrown weapons, and even the fiery catapults just make the giant more annoyed, instead of stopping his rampage.<br>\r\nBy the end of the battle, the queen's army has retreated, having lost countless soldiers underneath the ball of a giant foot, or tossed into the air and consumed like a light snack. Solas is satisfied, he shakes his crotch happily, and looks at his new prisoners of war. Six of them, alive and looking strong enough to withstand the tasks of being his slaves. \"I am King Solas,\" he proudly announces. \"Queen Catherine is safe with me, fulfilling her duties as my wife. Now the rest of you must prove your loyalty to me as well.\" The soldiers cast their weapons down and huddle at the giant's feet, ready to do whatever he asks. It's bad enough for the Queen to be in such a strong smelling spot and the news of her army's surrender makes her even angrier. <br>\r\n\"Four of you will tend to my feet.

Even distant giants pause from their torturing of little people to hear the lusty breaths. But Puella's humping is interrupted when a faint bell rings from within the tower top. A war sound, she realizes when over the hill by the tower, a crowd of tinies is approaching. Their little swords and shields and catapults look like toys but together, they could definitely be annoying enough to pierce her with their small sharp weapons.

Hahaha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella began to walk towards the army who became terrified as the giantess approached. They soldiers watched the grinning giantess, in a skimpy silk bikini stomp towards them shaking the ground. They were still attempting to get into position and didn't expect her to advance on them so quickly. In a matter of steps, Puella was on top of the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first step landed on a mass of soldiers who were smashed beneath her massive tan foot. Soldiers screamed as Puella's other equally massive foot slammed down as she took another step into the army. The commanders desperately tried to rally the terrified troops to attack the giantess. Puella simply laughed as she saw the terror in the tiny men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared? I haven't even done anything yet but simply take a few steps!\" Puella roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers began to attack her massive tan feet, swinging their swords and stabbing with their spears. They had no effect on the goddess as her tan skin was too thick to be penetrated by such tiny weapons. Puella laughed as she saw the soldiers fruitlessly attacking her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're weapons are pathetic. This army is more like an army of ants!\" She said as she raised her foot up and brought it down upon more soldiers crushing them. In the footprint she left from first stepping into the army, there were mangled bodies that were flattened which terrified the tiny soldiers. Puella had now lifted her other foot up an stomped it down upon the army while laughing. She wiggled her mighty toes knocking down soldiers and crushing others who were unlucky enough to fall under or between the the thick tan digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine watched in horror from her tower as the giantess had attacked her army. Puella reached down and grabbed a group of soldiers up before tossing them up in the air. She caught most of them in her mouth but a few she missed and they plummeted to the ground, splattering on impact. Puella was stepping on numerous soldiers and picking up others. The others she would pick up she would either eat them or drop them to their deaths while laughing. All the while brave soldiers attacked her feet hoping to get lucky and penetrate the thick skin of the goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella spotted the tiny catapults at the rear of the army and took a few steps, crushing even more soldiers, so could destroy them. The catapults hadn't been set up yet so they were unable to even fire at the goddess. She stomped one and then another one, kicked a couple and then either picked them up and threw them or crushed them as well as stepping on the last few. Now that the catapults were destroyed, Puella turned her attention back to the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella was having a ton of fun playing with the army. She would pluck helpless screaming soldiers up and grin before popping them into her mouth. Some she chewed up and others she swallowed alive. Some soldiers she picked up she would throw or drop, laughing as they screamed as they flew or fell through the air. Puella paid no attention to the soldiers attacking her feet. It amused her that they were still trying to attack her despite their obvious lack of results. Many were crushed when she moved her massive feet or took a step or stomped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was horrified as Puella destroyed her glorious army. They hadn't even managed to scratch the giantess. Catherine watched as Puella drew her foot back and then brought it forward it a kicking motion, sending a group of soldiers flying and splattering. Puella was toying with the tiny army. Catherine watched Puella drop a handful of tiny soldiers into her mouth and then stomp on another group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella grinned as she saw the destruction she had caused. There were many footprints on the field which were filled with flattened soldiers and splatters of soldiers who had been dropped by the goddess. Puella then spotted a man in some fancy armor and moved towards him. In a single step she was upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander had been horrified watching his army massacred by the giantess. She was unstoppable he thought and now she was upon him. Her might step shook the ground as she towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're in charge of these ants? Haha a pathetic man in charge of a pathetic army!\" She sneered as she raised her huge foot over him giving him a view of her dirty sole before she brought it down upon him. He could see some crushed, flattened soldiers stuck to her massive sole. The commander screamed before he was completely crushed like a big beneath Puella's massive tan foot. She grinned as she twisted her huge foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella then spotted some tiny soldiers still alive attempting to flee from the massacre. She immediately stomped after them crushing several beneath her her huge feet before scooping the remainder up. She grinned at them as they were trapped in her massive fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll keep you all for later to play with. Don't go anywhere my new little toys.\" Puella said with a grin as the soldiers screamed in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella lifted them up to her silk bikini top and dumped them into the cups of her bra and then looked over the carnage she had caused. Catherine meanwhile retreated from the window of her tower after surveying the destruction of her army. She could feel the tower shake as Puella began to stomp towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh princessssssss. Come out come out wherever you are!\" Puella sang.</span></div></div>",

I know you're in there cowering thinking you are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was curled into a ball and just prayed Puella would go away. The entire tower shook as Puella tapped it a few times causing everything to be knocked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have 5 seconds to come out princess or I'm taking this tower down. 5...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was too terrified to move. She heard the giantess countdown the 5 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...1. Not coming out? Well then here I come bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine heard the tower groan. Outside, Puella had leaned over and wrapped a massive hand around the tower. She pulled and simply ripped the tower in half with almost no effort. Puella then stood up and grinned. Catherine looked up to see the grinning giantess. In one hand she held the top part of tower and her other was on her hip. Puella simply dropped the tower with a loud crash and reached for Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me that tiny crown bug.\" Puella said as her huge fingers extended. Puella managed to, albeit rather clumsily as her fingers were so large, pluck the tiny golden crown from Catherine's head. Catherine screamed as Puella reached for her. Catherine had expected much worse though as the large tan fingers had yanked the crown roughly from her head. Puella then stood up to her full height to examine the crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your crown is now mine. I think I shall see how a true queen such as myself can wear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella then tucked away the tiny crown into her silken bikini top. She then turned her attention back towards Catherine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what shall I do with you tiny princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine couldn't even move she was so terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella reached down grabbed Catherine by her arm lifting her up to her face. Catherine screamed as Puella did so. She dangled by her arm in front of Puella's massive pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Now that I have your crown, I think I am going to take your subjects as my playthings. What do you think about that princess? You should've just given me your crown when I had asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine whimpered in response to goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you have no crown or subjects, I think you are no longer a princess which means no more tower for you little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine looked down at what was left of the tower before the top of Puella's tanned foot blocked the tower from her view. Puella then brought her foot down upon the tower. Catherine could hear it collapse under Puella's foot and watched as she then twisted her foot on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella laughed as she finished destroying the tower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what shall I do?\" Puella said as she tapped her chin with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could eat you.\" Puella said with a grin before tilting her head back and lifting Catherine over her open mouth. Catherine screamed and cried as Puella did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me! Please don't! Please, please, please, please!\" Catherine wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down princess.\" Puella said mockingly. Puella closed her mouth and tilted her head back down and held Catherine in front of her face again. \"I'm not going to eat you...yet.\"  She said tauntingly as she was smiling wickedly at Catherine who began to cry again. This made Puella laugh. The booming laughter shook Catherine. Puella began to think about what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella was still horny from earlier but the tower had been destroyed. She grinned as she thought of pleasuring herself as well as using the tiny princess. It would be fun for her and quite humiliating for the tiny girl not to mention terrifying. Puella also wanted to play with her new toys though and terrorize the tiny girl even more. Puella weighed her options as she dangled the princess in front of her face. Either way Puella was going to have herself some fun.</span></div></div>",

The wooden buildings splintered beneath her feet. It into took her a few steps to reach the center of town and the town square although she stepped on many houses and people to reach it. She leaned over and placed Catherine in the town square. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up bugs!\" Puella boomed. \"I want everyone in this city to come to the town square now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella watched as people began to trickle into the town square. Puella was a little annoyed by how slow the people were moving. Others still seemed to be hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said NOW!\" Puella roared as she stomped her foot on several houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople screamed and she smiled as she watched people hustle into the square. There were many people Puella noted. The people stared up at the beautiful tan giantess in the silken bikini who towered over them. As the last few people entered the square Puella spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the goddess Puella, your new queen! You are now all mine! You are my playthings to do as I wish! I have destroyed your pathetic army and brought your princess to heel! Kiss my foot princess!\" Puella boomed while using saying princess mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine did not want to kiss the goddess's feet but knew if she didn't Puella would likely kill her people. She didn't want a repeat of what happened to her army to occur. She began to walk towards Puella's massive feet. People gasped and murmured as Catherine walked up to the massive big toe and planted kiss after kiss against the slightly sweaty skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella laughed. \"Now I wish to be praised and worshipped like the goddess I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Puella began to sit down. Her massive butt came crashing down upon the town and obliterated anything beneath it. She stretched her long toned legs out, which crushed more buildings, so the soles of her massive feet towered over the tiny people. The people gasped as they saw her dirty soles which still had crushed soldiers stuck to them. Puella then grabbed a handful of people in each hand and laid down crushing more buildings beneath her as she placed the tiny people at either side of her head so she could hear their praises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will praise and worship me. The ones at my feet will worship my feet as the soles of my perfect feet are above you!\" She then sat up and plucked Catherine up and then laid back down placing Catherine on her tight toned stomach. Catherine could feel the muscles of Puella's abs under her as she tried to keep her balance on Puella's stomach. She couldn't see past Puella's large perfect beasts and her silken bikini top but Catherine knew the giantess was probably enjoying this. Puella grinned as she heard the tinies on with side of her head praise her and could start to feel the tiny kisses on her massive heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can barely feel my feet getting worshipped! You tinies at my feet better give a little more effort or I'll crush you all beneath my goddess feet!\" Puella boomed as she wiggled her toes high above the tinies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies began to kiss her feet with a bit more enthusiasm as Puella could now feel the tiny kisses a bit better. Puella was still horny and decided to do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine watched as Puella's massive right hand came over her and begin to enter the silken bikini bottom. She watched the huge tan hand begin move about and knew that the giantess was fingering heralds as a low moan erupted from the goddess. Puella was in total bliss. She thought of how she had completely massacred the tiny army and enslaved a whole city, not to a mention a princess and they were now praising and worshipping her. She was a goddess and humans were her playthings. She thought of all this as she fingered herself, moaning loudly as she played with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud moans terrified the tinies but they knew better than to stop worshipping the giantess. Puella's beastial moans of pleasure grew. Catherine watched the hand beneath the silken bikini bottom furiously work. Puella's other hand was dug into the ground as she played with herself. Puella begin to shimmy her silken bikini bottom down her hips and continued fingering herself. Catherine could see very neatly trimmed pubic hair and watched as Puella pleasures herself. As the giantess grew close to climax, the moans became louder. Finally Puella groaned, her massive toes curling in pleasure as she came. Catherine could hear Puella panting and stomach raised and lowered as Catherine felt the might muscles below her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella placed the one hand behind her head before moving her other. Catherine saw two of Puella's massive tan fingers withdraw from her womanhood. They looked slick with cum and vaginal fluid. Puella bought the fingers towards Catherine and playfully pressed her into her stomach where Catherine could feel the muscles contracting to provide a hard surface. The rumbling laughter of Puella also sook Catherine. The cum from the fingers soaked Catherine's dress and matted her hair as Puella playfully pushed her around and into her tan toned belly while laughing as she relaxed with her hand behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel much better now. I think I shall relax a bit here in the sun with my little worshippers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella began to think of how to further relax and play with her toys while toying with the tiny princess on her stomach.</span></div></div>",

She cleaned herself off rubbing the tent between her legs and wiping off her fingers. and then tossed the large cloth tent away. He then wiped off her stomach from where she had pushed Catherine around. She threw away the tent and pulled her silken bikini bottom back up. She began to feel the soldiers who she had dumped into her silken bikini top start to squirm about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella dug her hand into the ground next to her and created a pit in the ground. She then began to take the soldiers out of her bra and dump them into the pit she had made. Once they were all in the pit, she plucked a soldier out. She dangled him over her mouth by his leg and grinned as he screamed before opening her mouth and dropping him in. She played with in her mouth using her tongue to play oath him before swallowing him alive. Puella then grabbed another soldier up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella ate the soldiers into her mouth one by one as she sunned herself and relaxed. Some soldiers she goosed into the air and caught them in her mouth while others she angled over her mouth and dropped in. She would play with them in her mouth, sucking on them and using her tongue to bat them around. She swallowed some alive and chewed others. Catherine couldn't see everything but could see the soldiers flying through the air or being dangled over the hills that were Puella's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella was enjoying herself immensely. She had tiny humans praising her while others were worshipping her feet while she ate more humans. To top it all off, she was even working on her tan, not that it needed much work as her skin was already a rich tan color. Catherine just trembled on Puella's stomach in her cum. Puella tossed the last soldier in her mouth and sucked on him. She played with a bit with her tongue and sucked on him even more before swallowing him alive. She then reached for Catherine on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was snatched up in Puella's large tan fingers and dangled over her face by the leg. \"Well princess aren't you looking happy?\" Puella mocked. Catherine squirmed as she was dangled. \"What shall I do with you now? Perhaps you want to worship me some more?\" Puella sat up and then began to stand. The people at her feet began to scatter as they saw Puella shifting but some were unlucky and were crushed beneath the massive tan feet of the giantess as she stood. Puella held open her silken bikini bottom and lowered Catherine. Catherine was dangling before Puella's toned stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In you go bug.\" Puella said as she released Catherine. Catherine fell into the soft silken bikini bottom and stared up at the grinning goddess. It smelled of her sex as Catherine was right up against the massive womanhood go Puella. Puella then released the bikini bottom which left her in the dark in Puella's bikini bottom pressed against Puella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella patted her crotch and grinned. A girlish giggle escaped her lips as she felt Catherine squirm and brush against the lips of her vagina which excited her. She knew the princess was terrified which excited her even more. Puella smiled as she considered her next move. </span></div></div>",

Puella bit her lip as she grinned and stared at the slaves who had been worshipping her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people screamed as they were cast in the shadow of Puella's huge foot, staring up at a dirty sole they had kissed despite the awful taste. Puella's huge foot crushed many of them. After several more stomps, which shook Catherine about, all the tiny foot worshippers were crushed. Puella walked through the destroyed city, her feet crushing many buildings that hadn't been crushed already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella walked through the farm land surrounding the city. She wasn't done playing with the mortals yet. Puella decided she wanted to terrorize the tiny princess some more. She stopped walking and plunged her hand into her silken bikini bottoms and felt around for Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was miserable. She was covered in dried cum and pressed against Puella's massive womanhood. It smelled musky and she did her best not to squirm as she did not want to excite the goddess.

As Catherine gets carried from her palace against her will, she meets  her captors face-to-face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant holding her smiles. \"She looks pretty for a little ant mortal.\" The giantess in the bikini looks down at him. \"Nobody's prettier than me, and no miserable little mortal will...OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recoiled in horror as she glances down at her nail. Blood gets drawn from what to her looks like a sliver but close to the eye, it is metal-tipped. She turns towards where her hand rested and found a swarm of tiny soldiers gather in the castle's courtyard. The best of the princess' personal army resemble small shiny insects to the giants, clad in bright armor and waving small but sharp weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snarls. \"I hate it when toys don't play nice!\" Looking through the army, she finds one soldier with a broken spear handle, as the rest found its way into her finger. This one feels her wrath first as he gets smashed into the ground with her thumb. \"They need to be taught their manners...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the giant agrees. With princess in one hand, he reaches with the other towards the glittering miniature army. With a smile, he flicks the commander - a small act for him that sent the tiny soldier flying into his comrades and sending them sprawling on the ground. The giantess enacts her justice as she smashes the center of the mass with her fist. Both watch the remaining ones scatter in terror. \"I think they learned their lesson,\" says the giantess. \"They'll be good toys now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth gather up the remains of the once valiant army and divide the spoils amongst themselves. \"I'll keep them here to play with later...\" The giantess slides her share into the cups of her bra, letting them hang face up to her beauty and tucked in place with her breasts. The giant lowers his share towards the strap of his thong. There they get pressed against his member while they resume their games with Catherine.

Maybe if she's successful in their game, she might live a little longer. But the threat looms over her head. At least if she hides well enough, she could escape their gaze. They will then get bored of their game and do something else. From there, she can find some way to get out of this horrible place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer search takes her into a tangle of green. She treks forwards through this, brave but uncertain of this strange new world. From all sides are tall moss-covered trees. A forest? The canopy looks sparse as bright heavenly light pours through the mesh of leaves. A bright clearing stands far from her forest tunnel vision. If the two giants are still looking for her, they might be on the other side. Nevertheless, it is wise to see the lay of the land to ease her escape. She steps towards the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peers out the clearing, clinging to the blanketing moss of the nearest tree. But the clearing is only the beginning. The forest she now finds a refuge is just like any other one she's heard about - but it is the only oddity here. Around it are flowers and shrubs of unimaginable height. One of the drooping lilies is as big as her entire throne room! The giants must have picked the trees from her world and grew them here with their massive garden plants, which look almost like moss to them. Between the patches of foliage are miles of gold tiles. The great distance gives her a good view of great fountains and statues far bigger than anything her servants can carve from stone - whole mountains must have been used for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shadow appears as a massive foot slams against the gold tile.

The goddess was lean with lines of muscles from all the racing, jumping jacks, stretching, and lifting that she performed on a daily visit. In the hot sun she worked out her body, even loosening and eventually removing her skimpy loincloth when the fur was too irritating in the hot sun.<br>\r\nTired from her exercises, Kyria lays upon a bench, shifting her feet to lay upside. Her long body is stretched on the bench with her feet sole-side up, Kyria has no idea that caught by her feet is a member of the royal family, fighting to not be suffocated by the enormous middle toes. Kyria quickly falls asleep and stretches out her sweaty feet.</span></div></div>",

Its not unpleasant, thinks the Princess.

Water surrounds her, holding her in place. Soaked to her skin, her robe now clamps heavy against her skin.

But first she wanted to stretch and bask in the warm sun. Kyria placed her fur animal print bra and loincloth back on before she began to stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was carried along between the sweaty toes of the giantess. Thankfully the goddess had come to a stop which meant Catherine's world stopped shaking so violently. Catherine managed to look up but before she could scream, the giantess bent over to touch her toes. The huge toes had also wiggled though causing Catherine to be engulfed by sweaty flesh which prevented her from screaming or even really being seen as only the top of her head and eyes weren't engulfed in sweaty toe flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria bent over first to touch her toes. After holding this position for a few seconds she lifted her leg. Catherine's world was turned upside down as Kyria stretched her quads, bending her leg and holding her toes. Kyria stretched her calves as well. Kyria had stretched her legs well before she spread her legs. Kyria leaned to each side and swivel her torso. Kyria brought her legs back together and sat down with her long legs stretched out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine meanwhile was trapped between the sweaty toes forced to smell their sweaty odor and taste the sweaty flesh that gagged her. She watched as Kyria reached for her feet, leaning forward and grabbed the tops of her toes as she stretched. This caused the pressure on Catherine to increase as the toes were pressed together. Kyria soon released the stretch and leaned back bringing one leg over the other and laying it to the side and stretching before doing the same with the other. This stretch thoroughly disoriented Catherine as the foot she was trapped on flew through the air. Kyria stretched her legs thoroughly and then stood back up increasing the pressure on Catherine between her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine watched as Kyria stretched her arms before she bent over and quickly touched her toes again several times squeezing Catherine between them. She then bounced up and down on her toes and balls of her feet several times which resulted in sweaty toe flesh to engulf Catherine once again with some of the foul sweat entering Catherine's mouth and making her gag. Kyria stood up to her full height and smiled. It was a beautiful day with the sun shining and she was about to begin the second half of her workout. Kyria decided to begin with a nice jog through the garden. She lifted her foot as she took her first stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine's whole world shook violently as she felt weightless momentarily before there was a loud booming noise and the toes painfully squeezed her. There was the another loud boom followed by a feeling of weightlessness followed by an even louder boom, much like the first, as her world shook violently and she was painfully squeezed again between the sweaty toes. She realized in horror as this cycle repeated over and over that the goddess was running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria ran at a brisk pace through the beautiful garden. She was becoming even more sweaty as the Heat beat down on her. Catherine between Kyria's massive toes began to get soaked in sweat all over again. The sweaty odor increased in pungency as the whole world seemed to move and shake as Kyria ran. Kyria did feel something something between her toes but figured it was probably just a stray pebble that had been caught as she had run and stuck to her foot. Kyria pushed it from mind as she continued at her brisk pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria's huge feet pounded the ground as ran. The rhythmic booming of Kyria's feet as she ran made Catherine's ears ring. Kyria was beginning to sweat even more now as she ran in the sun. Catherine gagged as she was forced to swallow foot sweat so she didn't drown between the huge toes. The sweat tasted disgusting. She just prayed the goddess would grow tired of running soon. Catherine was so dazed and disoriented from her entire world shaking and pounding of the huge feet. The smell of the perfume from earlier was almost non existent as Kyria sweat in the hot sun as she ran. The only positive was she was wedged between the sweaty toes so she didn't have to worry of falling from between them and being trampled on as the goddess ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria ran for what seemed liked forever. Catherine was once again soaked in the sweat of the goddess. Kyria finally stopped running which have Catherine time to recuperate. Kyria panted as she stood in the sun. Catherine glanced up from between the sweaty toes and saw sweat glistening on the massive toned legs of the bronzed skin goddess. As Kyria stood there, sweaty and panting she felt that thing between her toes again. Kyria scrunched her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was engulfed in sweaty toe flesh as Kyria scrunched her massive toes. Catherine was forced to swallow more foot sweat before Kyria wiggled her massive toes. Catherine was shaken about by the wiggling of Kyria's toes. Kyria stopped wiggling her toes and could still feel the thing between her toes. Kyria began to walk over to the bench to see what was between her toes.</span></div></div>",

Kyria sat down brought her leg up, bending it slightly and placing her foot flat on the bench that Catherine was stuck on while the other foot was on the ground. She wiped some sweat from her brow and readjusted her fur bra. She spread her massive sweaty toes to see what was between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria expected to just find a tiny pebble that had become wedged between her toes so she was quite surprised when she saw it was a tiny human. Kyria grinned as scrunched her huge toes engulfing the tiny in her sweaty toe flesh. Kyria scrunched and wiggled her toes, drowning Catherine in the sweaty toe flesh. Kyria giggled as she watched the tiny struggle between her huge bronzed toes. Catherine stared up at the giantess as she was engulfed in the sweaty toe flesh as the beautiful giantess giggled. Catherine was helpless as the giantess played with her tiny catch, amusing herself by wiggling her sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine had been wedged between the massive sweaty toes. Soaked in sweat and forced to inhale the sweaty odor, Catherine was miserable. The sweaty toes parted and Catherine glanced up as the massive thumb and index finger of Kyria came down. The huge fingers grabbed Catherine up and lifted her to her face. She couldn't help but laugh as she thought how this puny mortal had been trapped between her toes as she ran the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well. What do we have here? A puny human who was stuck between my sweaty toes like a piece of toejam. You look like you're soaked in my sweat! Hahaha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine trembled in between the massive fingers. She was relieved at least to be able to take in fresh air not the sweaty odor of the giantess's feet. Kyria just grinned as she examined Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you like being between my toes? Smelling my goddess feet like the pathetic mortal you are.\" Kyria taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine watched as Kyria bought her closer to her face and inhaled through her nose loudly causing the air to be sucked toward her which Catherine could feel. Kyria's nose crinkles a bit as she moves Catherine away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If smelling you is any indication, my feet sure do stink.\" Kyria said with a grin. \"But to a mortal like you I'm sure they smell wonderful.\" This was followed by Kyria's thunderous laughter which shook Catherine. Kyria then smiled at the terrified princess while she decided what to do with her. </span></div></div>",

She stretched her long toned bronzed legs out and her massive feet rested on their heels as they towered over Catherine. Catherine stared up at the reddened sweaty soles of the giantess which were a bit dirty from her running barefoot in the garden. Kyria wiggled her massive toes and smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will clean the sweat from my feet bug. I want my feet nice and clean.\" Kyria thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine gulped as she looked at the massive soles in front of her. A sweaty odor washed over her as she approached them and it grew stronger the closer she got to the massive feet of the giantess. Kyria meanwhile placed an arm over her eyes to block the sun from her face as she relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine timidly stuck her tongue out and licked the giantess's heel. It was repulsive! She got a taste of sweaty feet with and earthy taste as well. She wanted to vomit! The flesh on the bottom of the the giantess's foot was rather warm which only made it worse. A drop of foot sweat ran down the massive sole of the giantess and Catherine was forced to lick it up to remoisten her dry mouth. She licked again and again as she was forced to swallow foot sweat and bits of dirt that the giantess had trod on. She wasn't able to even lick that far up as she was rather small compared to the massive feet of the giantess<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Catherine forever just to lick one heel. Kyria had just been lounging on the bench enjoying the sun. She moved to the other heel and began to lick at it. It tasted just as bad as the other. Catherine lapped away at the dirty sweaty heel of the giantess for some time. She was still not use to the sweaty earthy taste of the massive feet but it was getting a little more bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria suddenly sat up and spread her feet so she could look at Catharine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How silly of me. You probably can't even lick past the bottom of my heels since you're an insect.\"  Kyria giggled. \"This should be better for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria suddenly turned over to lay on the bench so her feet were sole side up as she lay on the bench. The huge toes were right in front of Catherine and she shuddered as she remembered being between them a bit ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep licking slave. I want my feet spotless or else I'll give you a much part look of them.\" Kyria boomed as Catherine scrambled to the massive toes and struggled to climb on top of them to lick. Kyria reached back and undid the strap of her bra so it do not leave an awkward tan line on bronzed body as she sunned herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Catherine this was much worse. Before with Kyria's feet towering over her she had been afforded some shade, but now she was slaving away on the hot sun with it beating down on her and warming the already got sweaty soles of the goddess. Catherine licked at each toe as best she could before moving on. There was no way she could actually clean this giantess's feet by herself. The feet were absolutely massive as she gazed up the mighty sole which now was slightly wrinkled from the giantess laying. She would just like as best she could. It took her forever to finish the bottoms of the sweaty toes of the giantess. Thankfully she didn't seem to want the space between her toes cleaned. Catherine trudged up the foot to begin to lick near the ball of the massive sweaty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria could barely even feel the tiny licking her foot but knew she was down there doing it. Kyria also thought of what to do with the tiny. She could continue to torture the tiny with her feet as the tiny was trapped down there. Kyria grinned as she knew there was no way that the little insect would lick both her feet entirely but that didn't mean Kyria couldn't punish her for not doing so. The living was a slight tickle to Kyria who could just barely feel it. This was more of a novel act of cruelty on Kyria's part than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine licked and licked at the sweaty soles. The beating sun had warmed the flesh and tiny droplets of sweat had formed and were now present on the soles of the giantess. Catherine felt sick as she had swallowed tons of foot sweat and dirt from the foot she was on. She hadn't even made a dent. The huge foot seemed to be never ending. She just licked foot filth off the massive sole of a goddess. This goddess just wanted humiliate her Catherine thought. She was already soaked in her foot sweat, her hair matted and dress reeking of this giantess's sweaty odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had moved well across the sky and Catherine felt hot and overworked. She had made little progress as the huge hot foot rested. Her dress was encumbering her but she didn't want to remove it. It was the last thing she had to hold on to her humanity. She glanced up the sole once again and groaned. So much of the foot was left. She began to feel light headed and her dress seemed to be even more constricting than usual. She felt incredibly hot and sweaty and light headed. She turned and suddenly could feel her self going weak as she passed out from a combination of being overworked and heat exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria noticed the tickling on her right foot had stopped. There was no way that tiny mortal was dumb enough to try to run away. Kyria turned her head and lifted it a bit toward her feet. She shifted her foot a tiny bit and felt something hit her toes. She wiggled the massive sweaty digits and could feel the tiny lump still there. She curled her massive toes around the lump, trapping it in a sweaty toe embrace. She scrunched her toes several times on Catherine's motionless body before tilting her feet so Catherine tumbled from the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria put her fur bra back before turning over and sitting up. She placed her feet on the ground and slid forward on the bench. She noticed the tiny laying on the bench unmoving. Kyria poked her with her massive finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong slave? We're my feet too much?\" Kyria grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine remained motionless as Kyria plucked her up. It brought a smile to Kyria's face knowing the torment she had put this little mortal through. Kyria pondered what to do with the passed out  girl.</span></div></div>",

But she is also quite high off the surface of the bench and as soon as her body loosens from her unaware grasp, she slides down the sole and onto the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall itself didn't hurt her so much, but she has never been used to falling from so high before. Still, her dress reeks of sweaty feet and something sweet-smelling - foot lotion or fragrant oil perhaps. She finds herself between Kyria's legs. The muscular legs go up towards hips covered slightly by the fur loincloth, but it isn't enough coverage for her divine body. Remembering that Solas and Puella are searching for her, maybe she can find somewhere to hide on Kyria or in the garden. After all, she doesn't know she's there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud yawn signals the goddess coming to life. As she blinks the sleepiness from her eyes, she splays her feet further off the bench as she straightens her flowing hair.

As the details of the article of clothing get more and more distinct to her eyes, Catherine makes an attempt to reach towards a large clump of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria gets off the bench and stretches, fully unaware that as she stands she carries on her a minuscule passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine's upper body burns with fatigue as she now has to put all her energy to grab hold of the tangled fur. She turns downwards to see the trees and titan-sized foliage alongside Kyria's feet. She shudders, the fear of her vertigo now claims her. One hand loses its grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the goddess' thighs play their role as Kyria starts to do a brisk walk. The flap bounces between the legs and hitting her crotch. Shaken, Catherine attempts to regain her hold once more before hauling herself further up the cloth closer to Kyria's body. The movement is weaker her for the tiny body, but escalates as Kyria's walk along the gold-tiled paths in the giant garden turns to a jog. The tiny princess holds for dear life, gritting her teeth as her palms sweat from fatigue and the heat coming from the giantess' exercising body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jogging stops, much to Catherine's relief; but a shadow cast over her chills her spine.

Motionless, she turns to look up at the new figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is a man, more muscular that Solas with dark curly hair and a black-stubbled chin. Behind his tunic, Catherine can make out the dark contours of his muscles and flesh valleys. His arms are crossed and, fortunate for the princess, his eyes are directed to Kyria's face rather than the puny human hiding in desperation in her loincloth flap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Kyria,\" his voice is like thunder. \"Care to race me today?

At the other end might be his front, probably his balls resting on the bottom part of the sash and the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex leans back, forcing the ravine of his ass to flatten out above Catherine.

I think I'm going to have some fun with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine watched as the giant grinned at her before he took another sip of his wine and she heard screams again which led her to believe there were probably some unfortunate people in his chalice treading wine. The huge giant then stood up. She started to scream as he began to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop your screaming bug or I'll squeeze you until you stop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine immediately shut up while the giant walked inside. Suddenly a voice interrupted his walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rex! I didn't realize you were back.\" Catherine became fearful as she recognized the voice of Solas, one of the Giants looking to stomp her. Rex turned around and she could see the massive god Solas in his thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Solas I have returned. Hello Puella.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine then saw the beautiful giantess from before wearing the skimpy silken bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Rex. What's in your hand?\" Puella said as her and Solas walked closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this bug and was taking her with me to have some fun with.\" Rex said lifting Catherine up to show them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's the bug WE are playing with! No wonder we couldn't find her, Rex had her.\" Puella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Playing? She was sitting on a bench.\" Rex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you did. We were playing hide and stomp but now it looks like we have to start over since you interfered.\" Puella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide and stomp? What a fun game. I'm surprised she made it for so long. You two are pretty good at that game.\" Rex said while Solas and Puella grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we could have her back since we're the ones who found the little bug, it would be most appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's only fair Rex.\" Puella added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine became terrified of the thought of being returned to Solas and Puella who would no doubt force her to play another game which probably ended with her being terrorized and crushed.

Rex dropped Catherine into Solas's out stretched open hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Rex. As you for you, you're in big trouble.\" Puella boomed as she looked at Catherine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolas's huge hand closed around Catherine trapping her in darkness. She could hear muffled voices and was shaken as Solas walked. Solas huge fist opened and Catherine was staring up into the face angry faces of Puella and Solas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We told you to try not to escape and what do you? Try to escape!\" Solas thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid mortals. They never listen.\" Puella sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain! I was trying-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it bug! I don't care!\" Solas boomed cutting off Catherine. He then bent over and dropped her on the ground before them. Catherine stared up at the two huge gods. The beautiful Puella with her perfect tan skin and Solas with his muscular, toned physique. Catherine's attention was drawn back to the floor by a booming tap of Puella's massive tan foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to crush her. Get on with it Solas.\" Puella said while examining her fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We warned you what would happen if you tried to escape. Now it's time to pay!\" Solas said as he raised his smooth foot over Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any last words bug?\" Solas said as Puella stood next to him with her hands on her hips and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine stared up at the huge foot. This couldn't be how it ended? Her, a princess, crushed like a big beneath a god's foot? Catherine had to think quickly. She came up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine prostrated herself on the ground and began to grovel. \"Please spare me mighty god and goddess! I am a bug yet I humbly throw myself at your feet to beg for your mercy and forgiveness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cute. I love when they grovel.\" Puella said giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think begging will help you?\" Solas said with his foot held over her still. \"We can crush you and get another mortal to play with. You're nothing special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am something special! I am a princess! There are many of us humans but not many of us are princesses! Surely having me, someone who is held in high regard by mere mortals, groveling at your mighty feet is something that does not happen very often!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Solas. The bug does have a point. We have a mortal royal at our feet. Surely we can think of something better than crushing her like a common bug even if she did disobey us.\" Puella said gazing at Catherine harshly with the last few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolas place his foot back down with a mighty crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is nothing special but does have a point. Princesses aren't exactly common and it would be a waste to simply crush her without having proper fun. I'm sure we can think of a punishment fitting of disobeying us.\" He said as a grin grew on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine remained prostrate but smiled grimly. Her plan had worked. She had saved herself but was now at the mercy of Puella and Solas all over again. She looked up slightly to see their huge feet. Puella's feet had perfect skin and were a rich tan color. Solas's godly feet were smooth looking. Her gaze lingered on his massive feet, thinking of she just barely avoided a very grisly end beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do with her then?\" Solas said snapping Catherine out of her trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I have a few ideas.\" Puella said happily.</span></div></div>",

Catherine turns around and BOOM a huge barefoot lands several feet before her, knocking her off her feet. The huge foot almost just ended her life. Catherine's notices that it appears to be a feminine foot. The foot is massive and has perfect skin which is bronzed. Catherine watched the huge foot lift and fly over her giving her a view of the sole of the foot. Catherine turns to see who the massive giantess is who almost crushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria had just returned from ravaging a town and had collected many of the people which now sat on her plate along with some fruit and a large piece of meat. She also had a cup filled with wine which she had dropped numerous townspeople in. She had walked into the dinning room and went to take her seat to begin her meal, smirking as she heard the tinies screaming and begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine follows the long bronzed legs up which are quite toned to a fur animal print loincloth and sees that the giantess is wearing a matching bra. The giantess looks athletic and her body is toned and lean. The giantess is holding a huge golden plate and a large golden cup. She watches as the giantess places the plate and cup on the table and sits in one of the massive chairs on the opposite side of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine can't go through the door she came in as she knows Puella and Solas are probably searching that around that hallway now. The only choice is to make out it of the door on the other side of the dining room. She realizes in horror that she must go past the giantess. Catherine begins her trek towards the table. Catherine sees the giantess is now eating. She watches her lift something to her mouth and toss it in. If Catherine had to guess it was a tiny person the giantess had just ate! Catherine watched the giantess toss another tiny in her mouth before lifting a huge piece of meat to her mouth and taking alarms bite before watching it down with whatever was in her cup. Catherine soon reaches a point where she could now only see the massive feet of the giantess and bronzed toned legs and her fur animal print loincloth as the rest of her is obscured by the table. Catherine ran under the table as quickly as she could. She was nearing the the halfway point of the table and could see the giantess's large bronzed feet which were flat on the floor when she heard her speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your screaming and begging is rather amusing, but I shall still eat you all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine hears tiny screams before the giantess's booming laughter drowns them out. She is eating people Catherine thinks in horror. Suddenly the giantess stretches her long toned legs out and crosses her legs at the ankles so her left leg is crossed over her right. Catherine is given a view of the giantess's massive slightly dirty soles as she draws near. She glances up at the huge toes of the giantess which she sees wiggle and scrunch as the massive giantess reclines. Catherine continues running as now she had to alter her path to avoid the huge feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine did want to get any closer to the absolutely massive feet. But Catherine was a bit curious of the huge feet and wanted a closer look. She decided she would just go a little bit closer, what's the worst that could happen? Catherine unfortunately had ventured too close to the huge feet of the giantess. She watched as the giantess uncrosses her legs and her heels hit the ground making a loud booming noise. Suddenly, the huge feet of the giantess come down from the heels to rest flat and the right foot of the giantess came down upon Catherine who screamed. She was trapped beneath the toes of the giantess, a slight sweaty odor permeating the air. The giantess then dragged her massive feet back to the sitting position she had been in before as she had finished her meal of meat, fruit and tiny people. Before Kyria went to stand up though, she felt something under the toes of her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine screamed as she was dragged across the cold floor by the giant toes. The foot had come to a stop but then the massive toes curled and trapped her in their embrace. The foot lifts up as Kyria places her foot in her lap, sole side up. Kyria spots something caught in her toes between the middle ones. She uncurls her toes which releases Catherine from their warm embrace. Kyria spots the tiny girl amongst her large toes and plucks her from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria lifts Catherine up to her face and grins. \"And how did you get into the palace little one?\" Kyria booms while laughing as Catherine looks at the huge pretty face of the giantess in terror. </span></div></div>",

If you offer me an alternative and I like it, I may consider sparing you from my stomach... for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine had to think quickly as she dangled from the giantess's fingers. She knew her time was running out. Catherine watched as the giantess rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting bored. I think you're just stalling for time. Accept your fate like your fellow mortals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold on! I have something you'll like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine had to work quickly. It was now or never.

You're the goddess, why don't you choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria grinned at this. \"You know your place mortal. Good, I like that. I have a few games I like to play with tiny humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria was an athletic goddess and very bold. She was quite competitive and loved to play games with her fellow gods and goddesses and even with tiny mortals.

Still, once she gets set on the floor in front of Kyria's foot, she felt the need to reconsider her offer, now realizing the folly of her supposed means of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria towers over her like the marble statues devoted to her in Catherine's kingdom - but far beyond any human scale. \"We will play 'Dodge the Foot.'

This was it, this is how her life was going to end. She was a princess, and now she had reduced to nothing and was to be squashed like an ant between the toes of a mighty, merciless goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how much pressure you can take before you pop between my toes.\" Kyria boomed, gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the toes of the goddess slowly closed in on her, Catherine could feel the ground beginning to shake. The goddess though continued slowly squeezing the tiny princess. The shaking would be unfelt by the towering goddess but to a tiny, the giant shaking could be felt on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toes of the goddess were overwhelming, dwarfing the tiny princess between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaking of the ground continued, and Catherine despite her pitiful struggles between the tightening toes realized that shaking was becoming more and more pronounced. Catherine then heard voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot believe you allowed her to escape.\" A loud, annoyed sounding feminine voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I? If I remember correctly we were playing together Puella. She has not escaped, she's just good. How long has it since we had a mortal who has given us such an entertaining game of hide and stomp?\" A deep, manly voiced replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices sounded as if they were in the hall outside the room but still Catherine recognized those voices. They belonged to the giant and giantess who had destroyed her tower, killed and captured her guards and kidnapped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shaking increased before suddenly stopping and Catherine heard Puella's voice once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyria! Greetings! How are you? I did not realize anyone had returned to the palace yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria chuckled. \"I returned only for a brief rest and to enjoy a meal.

I could go for some fine meat and mortals.\" Solas replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella giggled before Kyria spoke. Catherine meanwhile remained trapped between the tan toes of the goddess, slowly being squeezed between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing back in the palace so soon? I thought for sure you would be out terrorizing the mortals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella and Solas both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had actually captured a rather unique mortal. One who we hoped would provide us with quite a bit of entertainment.\" Solas replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we were playing a game of hide and stomp but Solas here has allowed our little plaything to escape.\" Puella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not allow the mortal to escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria laughed. \"Hide and stomp, one if my favorite games. So a mere mortal has managed to elude the mighty Solas in a game of hide and stomp?\" Kyria teased as Puella giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolas offered no response to the giggling goddesses. After a brief pause he instead opted to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you doing now Kyria? I see you have finished your meal. Will you be returning to the mortal lands to continue your rampage?\" Solas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fine idea. I will eventually but first I need to first up my game own game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was given a sharp squeeze by the goddess's mighty toes as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what game is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodge the foot.\" Kyria replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella laughed. \"I love dodge the foot! Such a fun game! We should have played dodge the foot, Solas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine continued to weep between the toes of Kyria. The squeezing had at least stopped and now she was just uncomfortably smushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I was enjoying my meal, a tiny mortal was running about at my feet. I plucked her up and was going to eat her as well but she convinced me otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found a mortal? And why did you spare said mortal from a voyage to your stomach?\" Solas said. Puella giggled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyria chucked. \"She offered to play a game with me. You know how I love to play games with the tiny mortals, Solas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this tiny, can I see her?\" Solas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was suddenly painfully squeezed between Kyria's toes.

Where is the tiny?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between my toes. I've been debating on whether or not to play another game with her or simply crush her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella laughed. Catherine felt the pressure subside and the toes of the goddess retreated. Catherine gasped for breath and thanked the gods she had been spared at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed up and saw the smiling faces of Kyria and Puella high above her while Solas's looked to be in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolas bent down, lowering his face towards Catherine who lay sprawled on the floor, still trying to recover from being nearly mashed between a giantess's toes. His face was massive as it grew bigger and bigger as he looked closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solas, why the sudden interest in an ant I had between my toes?\" Kyria boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolas's face suddenly retreated and he stood up to his full height once, towering above Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I suspected. This tiny is our missing mort. No wonder we could not find her, for Kyria here had her prisoner.\" Solas boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuella laughed loudly before she too peered down at Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is! It's our tiny princess!\" She laughed.</span></div></div>",

The tiles themselves are like crystal and the walls almost golden. They are adorned with columns with silk curtains between them. On one side one such curtain stretched between columns leads to a balcony of sorts, but shocking to the tiny princess, the outside is almost a featureless cloudy white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle breeze causes the curtains to dance. Catherine can find some giant-sized benches, chests, and other random personal items to elude Solas and Puella, but she finds something larger and more interesting. A large canopy bed stands in the very middle of the room. Hopefully she can have enough cover behind the canopy curtain and the bed's shadow. She dashes over a tangled almost woolly carpet and dives beneath the curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing the canopy curtain, she spots two tiny humans like her. They cower beneath one of the legs of the bed like a towering tree ready to fall. Why are they here? Are they being chased or tortured like her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shouted to get their attention. In unison, both of them gestured \"hush\" enough to be audible between them and Catherine. One covered his mouth while the other points up to the top of the bed with a pale blood-less sweaty face. A low groaning echoes from the top of the bed. Frightened of being caught by the giant gods she hoped to escape, she couldn't help but back away towards the inside of the curtain to see the half-sleeping body of another giant...</span></div></div>",

His cronies can be trusted as they put his enemies in place, but only so far. What if one of them robs and murders him one night? As he goes into bed, he listens to the wind blowing through the trees, hoping a creak in the floor would betray a thief. He lights his only candle by his bed stand and curls into a reluctant sleep. If he can stop the world from taking everything from him, he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, he wakes with a chill. He feels cold. His blankets are gone. His bed and bed stand are gone. Everything's gone. Damian curls into a ball frightened. Nothing exists besides a blinding light and strange heavenly haze. He hears a low wind before him and he forces himself out of his infant pose to look up. There before him sits a massive manly god, dressed in a silk cloth and sitting back on some throne obscured by the haze. \"You're awake, finally...\" he addresses with a thunderous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? What happened to my home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamian's questions mean nothing as the god leans back and laughs like a thunderstorm. \"YOUR wealth? You greedy insect, we have watched you this whole time. We have seen your wickedness towards the rich men of the village. We have seen your means to gather their gold - murder, extortion. We have seen the sins you've made on earth and we wish to punish you for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" Damian turns his head and sees around him five gods, two giants and three giantesses. The one in front of him leans forward so his face is level with him. \"As your punishment, you will be the slave for one of them.\" \"What about you?\" he asks. The god smiles. \"I, Rex, have already taken what is yours to punish personally.\" Stretching his arms back he reveals a golden chain around his neck with little men dangling from the links. Damian knows the faint faces. They were his mob, his cronies suspended by their arms in front of the giant's pecs. \"Take him...\" Rex points to one of the five...</span></div></div>",

Something that has never ever happened before. The runes glow brightly, a flame compared to the usual, barely visible hues. The entire temple rumbles slightly, followed by a series of larger quakes.

Please Gods, I believe and I will serve!\" screams the priestess with a newfound faith. When the shaking of her entire world stops, and the entire temple is in shambles with blocks missing from the sound walls and the sacred arrangement spread out everywhere.

One is a handsome well-built giant and the other, a bronze-skinned goddess in a fur bra. \"They look so cute,\" she says. The giant god reaches down and grabs Rachel's legs. She screams.

Know this, little one, Solas the vain is an arrogant vessal with no content whose self aggrandising words and feeble mind bring disgrace to the houses of the gods. His disgusting use of mortal women... bothers me. His attire is that of a slave with a blind master. His words are vomit from the mouth of a diseased goat.
