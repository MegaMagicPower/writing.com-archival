You said bluntly. There is a brief silence until she speaks. Well.....yes. She said depressed. There are so many people i don't know on this planet. She said. Y...You must know some people. You said trying to comfort her. Besides small talk or selling scrap, i don't know anyone. She said. Hearing the giant girl's problem, you feel a little bad for being blunt about her loneliness. I guess....i can live with you. You said. You will?! She said stunned by your answer. Yeah. Not like anyone else is going to be hospitable like you. With a smile, she hugs you tightly. Thank you! You won't regret the decision! She said. Can't....breathe... You said. Oops. Sorry! She said. Rey let's go of you and takes you into her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was a wreck, she considered it a home.

How about making them feel better? She said. Uh....Sure. You said. Knowing that she's been walking all day, you ready yourself to be assaulted by a putrid smell. You start to massage her feet. As you massage her feet, you aren't assaulted by a horrible stench. Her feet were hot and sweaty, but they didn't smell as bad as you were expecting. Ahhh. That feels good. She said. Working as best as you can, you rub Rey's feet for ten minutes until you're exhausted. I need....a few minutes. You said. Oh come on. You only did one foot. She said. Just...a minute. You said. Ok, but you'll have to work twice as long. She said. Or i could start now....and die from exhaustion later. You said. Going to Rey's other foot, you start massaging. While rubbing her foot, Rey pins you between her big and second toe. Hey, what gives?! I'm doing what you said. You said stunned. Kiss my foot. Rey said. What?! You said. Now! She demanded.Not wanting to anger her, you start kissing. After a few kisses, Rey takes her foot off you. Good boy. Now climb onto my hand. She said. You're hesitant to do so after she made you kiss her sweaty feet. Come on. I was playing. She said. Every part of your body is telling you to not believe her, but that warm and comforting smile makes you step onto her hand and she lifts you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't think you'd actually kiss my feet. I was just teasing. She said. You sounded so serious about it. I thought you meant it. You said. I'd be lying to myself if i said i didn't like that, but i thought you wouldn't because of how sweaty and smelly they were. She said. Still have the taste in my mouth..... You mumble. Rey brings you close to her lips and kisses you for a minute then breaks it. Does that make up for it? She said. If i say no, do i get more? You said. We'll just have to see where we go in our little relationship. She said. Relationship? You said. Yeah. I told you we were friends. But that doesn't mean i'm not looking for something more.....personal. She said with a wink. O...Oh...You said. But we can discuss that later because right now....</span></div></div>",

Now all that needs is your mode of transport. She said. There's no room in the speeder? You said. I'm not risking you flying out and being stranded in the middle of the desert while i drive to the Niima outpost. She said. So then that would mean i'd have to be on your person. You said. Is that a problem? What's wrong with being on me? She said in a playful tone. Rey is beautiful. And nice on top of that. Anyone else would just be downright mean. Nothing. Just stating the obvious. You said. Heh. Well, captain obvious. You're going to have to be on me while i drive. She said. Seems like i don't have a choice. But where am i going to be? Your scavenger outfit looks like it doesn't have any pockets. You said. It doesn't. So that only leaves a few options. Hmm. I'm not putting you in my boot. Too dangerous and you'll probably smell bad too. She said. Then that leaves only two options. You said. Might be a tight squeeze, but i think i might be able to fit you in between them. Or if you want to......you know. She said while blushing. Go in your panties. You said. Rey blushes even further. If you don't mind being face to face with it.....I don't. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo either in your cleavage or in your panties are my choice? You said. Neither are really that bad of a choice. She said. I'm not complaining. Best of both worlds. You said.

You can hear Rey giggle when you started to move around. Ok. That's enough squirming. We're burning daylight. She said. Rey hops into her speeder, starts it up and head to Niima outpost. Every so often, Rey would feel around for you to make sure you were still there. After a seven minute drive, the speeder comes to a stop. Rey hops out and unload and her valuable salvage. As Rey negotiates her salvage, you move around from being uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t count for the heat. Combined with her body heat, it\u2019s getting a little unpleasant. You said. Unbeknown to Rey, you\u2019re erratic moving caused her nipples to erect. Seems like Rey likes having her breast. Well, Rey said we had a relationship. She\u2019d understand this. You said. You move over to her right breast and scale up to her hard nipple. Let\u2019s see what happens when I do this. You said. You grab it with both hands and rub it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile selling items, Rey is suddenly flushed with arousal. W\u2026why do I feel hot and bothered? This isn\u2019t from the heat. She said. Rey was aroused, but she hid it well enough to sell all her scrap. When all her scrap was gone, Rey quickly jumps into her speeder and heads back. When she gets back, Rey gets out of her speeder, activates her traps to keep out raiders and heads into the AT-AT where her bed is. She takes off her shirt and sees you on her nipple. Uh\u2026.I can explain. You said. Later! For now, keep going! She said. Understanding the situation, you keep rubbing. Rey begins moaning as you rub. Yes! Don\u2019t stop!

Rey was so aroused that she moves her hand into her pants and starts to finger herself. Wow\u2026\u2026 She\u2019s in the zone right now. You say as you watch. After a few minutes, Rey lets out a loud moan as she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey takes a minute to regain her herself and grabs you. I don\u2019t know whether to hate you or love you right now. She said. Which one doesn\u2019t get me eaten alive? You said. You are so lucky that I do love you. Or I would eat you. And I\u2019d chew you into gory mess. She said with a pout. You can tell she\u2019s teasing you. (Two can play this game.) Well you were enjoying yourself back there. You said. I couldn\u2019t help it. I was caught off guard. She said. *Cough* Twice. *cough* You said. Th....that first time was a fluke! She said. Are you trying to convince me or yourself? You said. I\u2026..You\u2026\u2026! She said. Words, Rey. It\u2019s how we communicate. You said. Rey doesn\u2019t know where all this boldness came from but she gets an idea. What I said earlier still stands. She said. You wouldn\u2019t\u2026.. You wouldn\u2019t even dream of it. You said. You don\u2019t think I won\u2019t eat you? She said with a cocky smile. N\u2026.No. I don\u2019t! You said. Rey opens her mouth and dangles you dangerously close and chomps her teeth together. Still think I won\u2019t? She said. Y\u2026.Yeah! You can\u2019t and won\u2019t! You said. Ok. Let\u2019s see. She said. As Rey brings you closer and closer to her maw, you stare into her gaping maw with her tongue sticking out like a red carpet. You look at Rey\u2019s pearly, white teeth and imagine them covered in your blood and guts. (Just a little more. He\u2019s about give in.) Rey thought. She licks you with her tongue. Mmmm. Tasty. She said. You know she is teasing, but at this point, you can\u2019t be sure anymore.</span></div></div>",

Rey lets go of you and you plummet into her mouth onto her tongue. (A minute or two in my mouth will shake him up.) Rey thought. Rey tosses you around with her tongue. And I thought jumping to light speed was a rough. You said. You are thrown around for a few more seconds until Rey stops. (That should do it. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019s bold now.) Rey thought. Rey spits you out into her hands. Did you enjoy yourself in there? Rey said. You don\u2019t responded. Come on. I was never going to eat you. You know that. She said. You still don\u2019t responded, which worries Rey. She pokes you a few times and you suddenly jump up. Taken back by this, Rey drops you onto the ground. You land in a soft mound of sand. I\u2026..ow\u2026..think I went too far. So much\u2026ow\u2026.pain. Nice, soft lifesaving sand. You said. You feel the ground shake through the sand mound and you see fingers dig through. You are risen up in a pair of soft hands. As you regain your equilibrium, you are suddenly pressed against Rey\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou idiot! Rey said. Harsh. You said. Do you have any idea what was going through my mind? I thought I killed you! I almost lost the one person I care for! She said. Too far of a joke? You said. Way too far! I thought I killed you. Then you jump up at me and I dropped you into the sand. She said. Which, somewhat, broke my fall. Ouch. \u2026..Uh, Rey? You said. Yes? She said. Even though I loved being held against your chest, I hurt all over and your\u2026\u2026tight embrace\u2026..is making my body hurt even more. You said. Oh! Sorry! She said. Rey lets go of you. You know, this is just like how we meet. She said. I wasn\u2019t in so much pain back then. You said. Rey brings you to her lips and kisses you lovingly. Feel better? She said. I\u2026uh\u2026. No. I\u2019m in even more pain. You said. You don\u2019t have to fake. If you want another, all you have to do is ask. She said. Another. You quickly said. With a smile, Rey kisses you again. Better now? She said. Lots. (In fact, I feel like I wasn\u2019t in pain to begin with.) You thought. Rey holds you gently against her chest. You can hear the sound of her rhythmic heartbeat. The slow, rhythmic beat of her heart brings you a sense of comfort and safety. Rey lays back on her bed. Let\u2019s just lay here. You and me. In each other\u2019s embrace. She said. I\u2019d\u2026.like that. You say. </span></div></div>",

She\u2019s no longer alone and by herself anymore. She must be having good thoughts to have a smile like that. You said. You look through the opening of the metal to see the sun is going down some. By the position of the sun. It\u2019s either afternoon or going evening. You said. With a little bit of movement, you free yourself from Rey\u2019s hand. As you walk across the soft pillow, a shadow is cast over you. You turn around to see a hand wrap around you and bring you back. After getting over the scare, you smile at her. I don\u2019t know how she knew I escaped or knew which direction I was headed. But if there\u2019s one thing I am, it\u2019s determined. You said. You get out again and this time you, you jump and roll away from her hand. Heh heh. Tyne: 1. Giant hand: 1. You said. You eye Rey\u2019s body and get an idea. She\u2019s going to ask me to do it anyway. Might as well do it now. You said. You go to Rey, but stop when she turns on back. You continue until you get to her and climb up onto her stomach. You go to the center of her stomach and rub the area. Almost went in there. I don\u2019t know if stomach acid is strong enough to break down human flesh, but I\u2019m not going to find out. You said. You continue down until you make it to her feet. As much as she walks, her feet don\u2019t smell bad at all. You said. You put your hand on her feet and move your hand across the soft flesh. You hear a light moan from her. Hmm. I think this is a good way to repay her for her kindness. You said. You move your hand all around her feet. As you massage her feet, you can hear moans and giggles coming from her. I\u2019m doing good so far, but I can make this better for her. You said. You use your whole body to make the massage more efficient. You hear a sigh from her. That\u2019s more like it. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey could feel something at her feet. It wasn\u2019t an annoyance, but pleasurable. She sees you not in her arms and puts two and two together. Mmmm. Even though he\u2019s small, he gives a good massage. She said. Rey let\u2019s out a delighted sigh. Keep going. She mutters. After a few minutes, you end the massage with a kiss to her foot. D\u2026.did he just\u2026.! Rey said surprised. You make your way to her other foot and start doing the same thing. Rey must take good care of her feet or they are like this naturally. No bad smells, no cuts or blemishes. Just soft as cotton and smooth. And sexy. But let\u2019s keep that part in check. You said. You grind your body against her soft, smooth foot until you unexpectedly explode your hot seed all over her sole. What the?! You say. You look to see that all that grinding and rubbing had made you stiff as a board. Oh no! I thought I had it under control! Her feet were soft, smooth, and beautiful, but I didn\u2019t want to perv on her feet like that. I\u2019m so dead! The things she will do to me! You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was in bliss, Rey had felt a wet sensation on her foot. Is he\u2026.licking my feet? She said. Rey sits up and sees you at her feet. She smiles at first, then sees the mess you left on her foot. Is\u2026.is that what I think it is?! She said. Rey! I swear on everything good, I did not mean for that to happen. I didn\u2019t even know I was\u2026..turned on at the time. I was just so focus on making- Shhhh. It\u2019s perfectly ok. She interrupts. I\u2026.Y\u2026.you\u2019re not mad? You said. Not. At. All. She said. Rey brought her finger to her sole, swiped the juice that was there, and brought it to her mouth, sucking on her finger with enjoyment. Mmmm. So that\u2019s what it tastes like. Delicious. She said. Rey picks you up and gives you a few kisses which calms you down. I know you\u2019d never do that unless I tell you to. She said. So you believe me? You said. I do, but if you\u2019re going to\u2026..release yourself on my feet, just tell me in advance. She said. O\u2026.ok. You said. Good. Even though the massage was heavenly and we both enjoyed ourselves. One of us more than the other. She said. It was an accident! I might have a kink for feet, but I wouldn\u2019t act without your say so. You said. I know. I\u2019m just poking fun at you. Now stay in my arms this time. All I want is to just hold you for the rest of the day. She said as she lays back down with you.</span></div></div>",

As day turns to night and night turns to day, Rey still has you in her embrace. Wow. She was not kidding about just holding me. You said. You worm your way out of her grip and climb up to her face. Rey was lightly snoring in her sleep. She\u2019s like an angel. You said. You rub her cheek and a smile forms. The rubbing sensation Rey felt made her open her eyes and she sees you. And what have we here? A little perv? She said. Ha ha ha. Very cute. Your teasing is most appreciated. You said a little annoyed. Aww, don\u2019t be like that. You\u2019re just so cute! She said as she rubs you. Yeah. I\u2019ll remember that perv part when you want me to fondle your breast. You said. Ok. Ok. You don\u2019t have to play hardball. She said. Rey picks you up and puts on her clothes. We are we going? You said. Well, I thought we could spend the day together looking for more things to sell. She said. Does that list of things involve me? You said. And let some ungrateful, uncaring and evil lady have her way with you? Someone who wouldn\u2019t know love or care even if it hit them? Not for all the credits in the world. She said. Well as long as she is great in the chest department, I\u2019d have no problem with that. You said. That\u2019s not funny. Rey said. I\u2019m joking. Just like you were joking with me. You said. Yeah, but it\u2019s more fun when i do it to you. She said. Rey grabs her things and two water bottles and head to her speeder. Ok. Water, check. Blaster, check. Staff for close, check. Cute as a button little man, double check. Ok. All set. She said. Rey hops into her speeder and places you within her clothes and drives off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a ten minute drive, Rey comes to a stop at a wrecked site of a few x wings and tie fighters. Should be something worth getting. She said. Rey pulls you out. I think you might have hit pay dirt. You said. Hope so. \u2026..Can I trust you not to get lost or in danger? She said. Yeah. I might learn how to scavenger as well. You said. Rey puts you down gently onto the sand. Don\u2019t exert yourself too much. I want my little love in one piece. She said. Relax. I got this. You said. With a smile, Rey walks off to a downed x wing. Ok. What secrets do you hold tie fighter? You said. You walk along the side panel up to the cockpit. Hmm. I wonder if the targeting matrix works. You said. You walk around the when you find a switch. With enough force, you flip it and hear the engine. Ok. The engine in this one runs. What does this button do? You said. You jump on the button next to throttle and a ion torpedo shoots out and hits a giant rock and explodes. Wow. The weapons work as well. You said. Having fun? Rey said. I am. The engines and weapons still work. You? You said. I got a working targeting matrix and some undamaged armor. She said. Rey examines the tie fighter. It\u2019ll take a while, but I could get them. Nice work. She said. I am to please. You said. And pleased I am. She said. Rey picks you up and takes you over to x wing. You think you can turn off the engines without becoming crispy? She said. No problem. You said before jumping down into the inner workings of the x wing. Ok. One of these wires have to go to the engines. You said. You pulled the blue wire. Nothing. You said. You pull the red wire and hear a rumble. Bingo. You said. You pull out more red wires until the humming died down. Ok. Engines should be offline. You said. You crawl back out into the heat. Good job. Might make a scavenger out of you. Rey said. Doing pretty well for my first time. You said. Rey dislodges the four engines and loads them into her speeder. Ok. I don\u2019t want to leave you by yourself, but I\u2019d really want to get all this home. She said. Just go. I\u2019ll be fine here. You said. You sure? You\u2019re more valuable to me than anything. She said. I\u2019ll be good, Rey. You said. Rey gives you a quick kiss and hops into her speeder. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can. She said before driving off. Don\u2019t rush on my account. You said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the soft sand and wait for a few minutes until you hear a speeder come by. That was\u2026. Wait. That\u2019s not Rey\u2019s speeder! You said as you hide. You peek out to see a covered up person. Given the body, I think it\u2019s a female. You said. The person pulls off her cover on her head to reveal she\u2019s a twilik. A twilik? Out here? Must be out for a master or possibly a bounty hunter. You said. As she walks around, you stay hidden. You wanted to keep an eye on her, so you watch her until she looks into your direction and you duck down. I hope she didn\u2019t see me. You said. </span></div></div>",

Show yourself. She said. Can\u2019t let her see me. You said. Taking a chance, you go into the deep parts of the x wing. She looks at where you were hiding, but sees no one. Where are you? She said. Ok. I just need to stay hidden until Rey comes back. You said. You work your way out of the x wing and land on the soft sand. I know I saw a small human around here. She said. Great. You said lowly. You hide behind a severed wing. After searching and coming up empty, the twilik calls out to you. I know your still here, human. I\u2019ll find you. She said. Sounds like won\u2019t let me go if she does. You said. You see that you could get away into the open desert, but you\u2019d have to run quickly. If I could make that run, I\u2019m home free. But what if Rey comes back? Who knows what this twilik will do? You said. While thinking about running, you see a giant eye looing right at you. Found you! She said. Shit! You said. You back up and run from her before she could grab you. Hey! Get back here! She said. You make your way to a tie fighter wing, but she grabs you before you could get behind it. Gotcha! She said. Her grip on you was tight. You could barely breath or speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t think I find a tiny human all the way out here. She said. Look\u2026..i\u2019m sure\u2026..we can talk this out. You said. About what? You\u2019re tiny, I caught you, and by scavenging law, you\u2019re mine. She said. T\u2026That scavenging law isn\u2019t a thing! You made that up! You said. Are you getting an attitude with someone who can easily turn you to mush? She said. Her grip tightens on you. You feel like your body is going to explode. Feel that? All that pressure? A little more and you\u2019ll pop. She said. She eases her grip on you. Now should I keep you or sell you off? A tiny human must be worth a fortune. She said. Y\u2026..You can\u2019t just sell me! I\u2019m a person! Not an object! You said. Her grip tightens again. You\u2019re whatever I decided. Person, object, whatever. You got that? She said. L\u2026.Loud\u2026..and c\u2026.clear. You said. Now who would-ugh! She said as she\u2019s hit over the head with a blunt object. You suddenly find yourself freefalling to the ground, but are caught in a pair of soft hands. Rey! You said happily. Sorry for taking so long. I rushed over as soon as I was done unloading everything we got. She said. I say we call it a day. You said. Did she hurt you? Rey said concerned. She squeezed me pretty good, but nothing broken. You said. All I need to hear. She said. Rey pulls out her blaster and hold it against the twilik\u2019s head. Come near him again and I\u2019ll splatter your brains all over the desert! She said. Rey, holding you close to her, gets in her speeder and drives away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey arrives back at her home and looks over you. Are you still hurting? She said. My\u2026.bones will heal. The thought of being sold is what\u2019s getting me. You said. Sold?! Rey said. Yeah. Whereas you were joking, she was thinking of either keeping or selling me. You said. Rey gently rubs you on your back to comfort you. It\u2019s ok. She\u2019ll have to go through me first. And I won\u2019t let her take you from me. Rey said. Thanks\u2026.. That brings me some sense of safety. You said. Can you move at least? She said. I can, but if you\u2019re expecting me to climb you any time soon, it\u2019s going to take a while before I can. You said. I guess no more scavenging until you\u2019re ok again. She said. I\u2019ll just stay here. Don\u2019t let me stop you from your payday. I can nurse myself. You said. No. You\u2019re under my care and supervision. Like I said before, you\u2019re more important to me than anything. Scrap, credits, all of it combined. If it means keeping you safe, I\u2019ll give it all up. She said. I don\u2019t think you need to go that far just for me\u2026\u2026but thanks anyway. So are you going to the outpost or going back out there? You said. I want to stay and make sure you\u2019re ok. She said. Rey. I don\u2019t want to stop you from doing what you\u2019re good at. You\u2019ve been doing all this before you meet me. I don\u2019t want you to just drop everything because of my stature. It\u2019s good you care, but don\u2019t make me the center of everything. You said. I\u2026..just want to make sure nothing happens to my little love. She said. With you, nothing will. As much as you care for me, i don't think even a Sith lord will try anything. But don\u2019t let it me be the center of your world. So what are you going to do? You said. *Sigh* Ok. Ok. You talked me into it. I\u2019ll do what i usually do. She said defeated.

I\u2019ll be back in a few hours. It\u2019ll be the longest hours of my life. She said. You\u2019re exaggerating. I\u2019ll be fine by myself. You said. Rey hops into her speeder and drives away. Ok. Let\u2019s see if I can find something to occupy my time. You said. You jump into the soft sand. I might want to explore a little. See what Rey\u2019s home is like. You said. You explore Rey\u2019s home. Hm. A stove and a small refrigerator. This is her kitchen. I wonder what she eats for a living? Since she didn\u2019t take a liking to me, I guess tiny people aren\u2019t it. You joke. You explore more and come across a shower. A shower? For this to work, she must have to hook this up to a water source. Think I see why she wants to keep me close. She\u2019s been out here for a long time. Too long. You said. You continue your exploration. Not only does she have a refrigerator and shower, but a makeshift laundry room, a place for her gear, and she's redesigned the AT-AT's power core as a heater for cold nights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's made a nice home out of this wrecked AT-AT. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d mind living here if she had a companion. I guess that\u2019s where I come in. All these years out here all alone. No friends, no parents, not even a pet. Just herself. At least I had my mother. We had it rough, but we had each other. Rey had nobody. I wouldn't be surprised if she has kept count of how long she's been her by herself.You said. As the minutes ticked by, you wait for Rey to come back. You wait and wait until you hear the sounds of a speeder coming to a halt. So soon? I thought that would\u2026\u2026 Oh no! You said. You look to see it\u2019s that Twelik from before. This lady can\u2019t take a hint. You said. She comes inside the AT-AT. So this is where she lives? Pitiful. Just like those so called traps she has. She said. Just wait you green skinned bitch\u2026. When Rey gets back, she\u2019ll show you who\u2019s really pitiful. You said with anger in your voice and eyes. If it wasn\u2019t for your small size, you\u2019d take on this twelik for bad mouthing Rey. Now. Where would I keep a small human if I was a lonely, desperate human girl? She said. This twelik is asking for it. You said. She stops right in front of you. Where are you, tiny? I know she left you here. She mutters. Looking down would help. I\u2019m not that small. You said. As if she heard you, she looks right down at you. There you are. Come here. She said. She grabs you roughly and hoist you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just don\u2019t know when to quit. You said. Not after what she pulled. Attacking me unprovoked. She said. You deserved it. I\u2019d hit you more than once. You said. You talk a big game for such a small guy. She said. Trust me. If I wasn\u2019t this small, you\u2019d be dead in a sandstorm right now. You said. Maybe. But you are this small. Now how should I go about this? Should I just kill you? Or wait for her and kill you in front of her? Or maybe I should kill her in front of you? She said. You wouldn\u2019t dare!! You said. Yeah. The last thing she sees is me taking the one thing she cares about away from her. She said. You leave her out of this! You shout. Ohhh. Someone\u2019s fired up. You care for this human? She said. What\u2019s it to you? You said. You know what? I won\u2019t kill her or you. She said. You\u2019re going to leave us alone? You said. No. I have an even better idea. I\u2019ll make you fall out of love with her. She said. You\u2019ll have an easier time killing a sith lord than that. You said. We\u2019ll see. I have enough time to change your mind. She said. She drops you into her cleavage and presses them together. I know you like this. Being pressed against by two orbs. Must excite you, doesn\u2019t it? She said. You must think I\u2019m that desperate. You might have a bigger chest, but that means nothing to me. You\u2019ll never have what Rey has! I will not leave her for you! You said. You say that now, but let\u2019s see who\u2019s name you\u2019re saying at the end of the day. She said. </span></div></div>",

Fully naked? Great idea. She said. She places you on the table and slowly, but seductively takes off each piece of clothing until she\u2019s bare naked in front of you. Enjoy the show? She said. Would not recommend seeing. You said. No need to be mean. I\u2019m about to make all your dreams come true. She said. You wouldn\u2019t like what I\u2019m dreaming right now. You said. She picks you up. Now, let\u2019s see if you really are loyal to this human. She said. I am. Now and forever. You said. Hmm. Let\u2019s go ahead and get straight to it. She said. She lowers you to her womanhood. You could feel the intense heat coming form it as you got closer and are shoved inside. She pushes you further inside her. You desperately crawl your way out, all the while sending her into pure bliss. Ahhhhh. More! Not just yet! She said. She pushes you back in, but deeper this time. I\u2019m not going to be your plaything! You said. You crawl all the way back and squirm your way out of her just just as she climaxes. Damnit! Covered in her fluids. Who knows where she's been. You said. So. Did you\u2026.enjoy yourself in there? She said. Not in the slightest. I'd enjoy a shower right now. And before you ask, still in love with Rey. You said. For now. Just means I need to try something else. She said. She brings to her lips and starts kissing you. You try to push her lips away, but she continues to barrage you with kisses. Mwah. Kisses sweeter than candy. She said. Those were not sweet. Poison is more like it. You said. Well then, let\u2019s see take it to another level. She said. She drops you on her left breast. Go on. Have as much fun as you want. She said. No. You said. Come on. How can you say that? They are twice as bigger than hers.How do you not want to play with them? She said. It might be a shocker to you, but size doesn\u2019t matter. You said. Let\u2019s see if you really believe that. She said. She moves you between them and press them together. Feel how soft they are? This is everyman\u2019s dream right here. She said. For two minutes, she playfully mashes them together. You can\u2019t say you don\u2019t like this. Some men would kill to be in the position you\u2019re in. She said. Then go-wait. If I keep denying her, she\u2019ll keep at this. She\u2019ll exhaust me to death. Literally. If I just say what she wants to hear, she\u2019ll drop this nonsense and Rey can kick her green ass to where she came from. You said. Maybe a second journey inside. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! No. You win. You said. Really? Then say it. She said. I\u2026.. love you. You said. Are you just saying that to stop all this? She said. What\u2019s the point? You said. One: you actually mean it. Two: You\u2019re just saying it to make me stop. She said. So what do you want me to do then? You said. If you\u2019re being serious, then I want you to break her heart. Right in front of me. She said. You\u2026.want to watch? You said. Yeah. If you say you love me now, then you\u2019d have no problem doing it. She said. You didn\u2019t think she\u2019d pull this. To tell Rey straight to her face. You don\u2019t know if Rey will understand what you\u2019re doing. Well? Are you? She said. \u2026\u2026.Fine. I\u2019ll tell her. You said. Straight to her face? She said. Straight to her face. You said. After putting her clothes back on, you both wait until Rey comes back. I just hope Rey will give me the time to explain. You mumble. After waiting two hours, you hear a speeder. Showtime. The twilik said. She goes to hide. You wait until Rey comes inside. Tyne? You in here? I got us some food we could share. She said. Rey! Over here! You shout. Rey looks to see you on the counter. (That smile of hers\u2026.. Couldn\u2019t be anymore perfect.) You thought. As Rey comes closer, the twilik jams a blaster to her head. Drop. Now. Slowly. She said. Surprised, Rey slowly drops to her knees. The weapons. Get rid of them. One wrong move and I\u2019ll blast that that tiny human. She said. You leave him out of this! Rey said. Get rid of the weapons. I won't ask again. She said. Rey tosses away her weapons and her staff. Look\u2026\u2026just take what you want\u2026..and leave. Rey said. Nothing of value in this dump. Except one thing. Tell her. She said. Rey\u2026.. I\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t. Not like this. You said. Tell her or she get one in the back of her head. She said. \u2026..Fine. You said. You look Rey in the eyes. You find it difficult to talk when you stared her in the eyes. Rey\u2026.. I\u2026.. I don\u2019t\u2026\u2026love you anymore. You said. What?!? TYNE!?! Rey said with tears forming in her eyes. Keep going. The twilik said. I\u2026.. I\u2019ve fallen for\u2026..Valeria. You said. After everything we\u2019ve been through?!? After what I\u2019ve told you about me!?! She said. You steel your heart for what you\u2019re about to say. I\u2026.i know. And\u2026..i don\u2019t care. You coldly. Hearing you say that so coldly, Rey breaks down in tears. There. You happy?! Done exactly as you said! Now let her go! You said. Not yet. She\u2019s still has her life. And as she is now, I think she\u2019d rather be dead. So I\u2019m doing her a favor. She said. NO!!!!!! You shout. You hold out your hand and she is pushed against the cold metal wall with a few other things and knocked out. What the? How did I\u2026.nevermind. Rey! You said. You jump down on the metal floor, not even caring about your twisted ankle. You just make your way to comfort a sobbing Rey. </span></div></div>",

When Rey holds her head up, you can see her eyes are red from crying hard. Rey. Listen I never-ack!!! You said as she grabs you tightly and stands up. Rey\u2026\u2026are you\u2026..trying to kill\u2026..me?! You said. Shut up!!! After everything, EVERYTHING, I did for you. I told you about how I had nobody. You were the one and only person in this world I thought who wouldn\u2019t leave me! She said. I wasn\u2019t\u2026\u2026. I would never\u2026\u2026. You said through breaths. Then why?!? Why did you say all that to me?!? And so mean?!? For her!?Did you even care about me to begin with?! She said. You can feel her grip on you getting tighter to the point where you can\u2019t breath. (If she\u2026..doesn\u2019t crush me\u2026\u2026. she\u2019ll suffocate me.) You thought. Rey\u2026..let me\u2026\u2026explain\u2026.. You said. Explain what?! That you never gave a care about me?! Just stay with me because I\u2019m so lonely, depressed girl?! Someone to toss away when you find someone better?!? She said. Rey\u2026\u2026if\u2026..you don\u2019t loosen\u2026\u2026your hold\u2026..you\u2019re\u2026..killing me. You said. And? Maybe that\u2019s what I want to do. It\u2019d be one less horrible person in the world. Maybe killing you will make me happy again. She said. You\u2026..don\u2019t mean\u2026\u2026that\u2026\u2026 Please\u2026\u2026you\u2019ll regret it\u2026\u2026.if you kill\u2026..me. You said with your last breath of air. You try to breath in, but can\u2019t with Rey\u2019s tight grip. Your lung start to shrivel and your chest starts to burn. Just when you thought you\u2019d pass out, Rey opens her hand. You gasp in air. Thank *gasps* you\u2026\u2026. You said. After a few seconds of heaving, Rey close her hand around you and places her thumb under your chin to make you look her in the eyes. The only reason I didn\u2019t crush you in my hand or suffocate you was to hear what you have to say. And it better be the truth, Tyne. I\u2019m not in the mood for lies right now. She said. I promised you that. You\u2019ll get nothing but the truth. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would never say those things to, Rey. I only said them because she threaten to kill you if I didn\u2019t. She tried to make me fall out of love with you. She tried to every trick in the book, but I was, and still am, in love with you. I just said those things so she\u2019d quit. You said. What did she do? Rey said. She pushed me inside her, squeezed me between her breast, kissed me, and all that. But I didn\u2019t like it. I have eyes for one lady. And that\u2019s you. You said. Then tell me. Person to person. Would you leave me? She said. Really? You\u2019re asking me that? If I wanted to leave you, I would have left by now. I\u2019d taken my chances in the hot, unkind desert. If I wanted nothing to do with you, I\u2019d run from you the second I first saw you. Do you want to know why I\u2019m still with you? The real reason why I stay with you? You said. I do. Rey said bracing for the worse. I stay with you not because you\u2019re a giant keeping me against my will or some lonely girl in need of companionship. I stay with you because I love you. From sunrise to the cold nights, I love you. Everything about you, I love. The small giggles in your sleep, the animal like yawn in the morning, even your tough attitude. Everything that makes you you, I love. I don\u2019t love that harlot over there, I love the scavenging, tough as they come, yet sweet girl right in front of me. You said. So you wouldn\u2019t leave me for that over there? Even if we have a very bad day with each other? Even if we start to become a nuisance to each other? You\u2019d still stay in love with me? Rey said. Yes. I said what I said so she\u2019d buy it. It had to sound genuine. It had to feel like I did fall out of love with you. Look, if I lost your trust over this, just tell me. I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do to prove that. I don\u2019t care how demanding or demeaning it is. If I can regain your trust in me, I\u2019ll do it. You said. You\u2019ll go to the ends of Jakku for me? She said. Yes. You said. Rob a powerful hutt? She said. Yes. I said anything. I want you to know that my feeling haven\u2019t change just because of her. So if you want me to prove it, just say so and I\u2019ll do it. You said. Ok. Give me a few minutes. She said.  Rey puts you down and ties up Valera.  Rey then walks back in and and picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you\u2019ll do anything? She said. Whatever you want. Just name it. You said. Ok. I want you to....</span></div></div>",

Even though she\u2019s not showing it, you can tell she\u2019s still angry. But you know she wouldn\u2019t hurt you intentionally and you\u2019ve already been inside her mouth once already, so it won\u2019t be as scary as last time. So you walk right into her mouth and Rey starts to toss you around. After a few seconds, you land in the center of her tongue a little exhausted and start to slide to her throat, but Rey forces you back to the center of her tongue and pushes you up against the roof of her mouth. Rey moves her tongue off you and you fall onto the soft muscle. She moves you over to her teeth and plants them firmly on you. You wait for her to just grind you down a thick paste, but it never comes. All she does is sigh heavily, opens her mouth and you roll out into her hands. As you slowly stand up, Rey rubs your back with her finger. You ok? She said. Yeah\u2026.. You said. I didn\u2019t\u2026.hurt or anything? Or scare you? She said. My equilibrium is all over, but it will come back. Feel better now? You said. A little. Did you think I would gulp you down even with you so close in there? She said. I told you I trusted you. I knew you were mad, but not that mad enough to treat me like food. I felt more like a punching bag in there. Seems more like what you wanted me to be at the start. You said. Did you mind that? She said. No. You need to work off some steam. Not healthy to let it stay bottled up. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListen. I\u2019m sorry for the way I acted earlier. I wasn\u2019t thinking. I was listening to my emotions and everything got out of hand. Deep down, I knew you were just saying that for her, but it hit me a lot harder than I thought. She said. Soo\u2026\u2026I\u2019m forgiven? You said. I should be asking that. I was so close to killing you. The one person who gives me love and attention. The one person who gives a damn about me. Best girlfriend in the world. She said before crying. Rey, It\u2019s ok. I know you were just acting out of anger. I don\u2019t blame you for doing what you did. If I could have come up with something better, I would have. Do you want to know what I really wanted to say in front of her? You said. *Sniff* What? She said as she brings her head up. That Rey is the most beautiful girl in the galaxy. That I wouldn\u2019t leave her for a harem of twiliks like you. That she has you beat in everything. A fool would only leave her and I\u2019m no fool. I\u2019m not leaving her alone here. You said. Hearing your kind and heartfelt words, Rey hugs you tightly. Thank you, Tyne. Just\u2026..Thank you. Can you forgive me for hurting you? She said. I\u2019ve been forgiven you. Even if you did kill me, I\u2019d still forgive you. You said. Thank you. I really\u2026..really don\u2019t deserve a good guy like you. She said. Well, you got me. And I\u2019m staying with you until the end of time. You said. *Laughs* That\u2019s a long time. You\u2019ll still be interested in me? I\u2019ll be old and grey. She said. Then we\u2019ll be old and grey together. Just you, me, and the endless horde of Tusken raiders. You said. *Laughs* I needed to laugh after all this. Rey said. I prefer to see a smiling Rey than a crying Rey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what are we going to do with\u2026..her over there? You said. She doesn\u2019t have the lives for the things I want to do with her. I think we should kill her. Her kind are a dime a dozen, so no one will miss her anyway. She said. You\u2019d normally agree with Rey, but something lingered in the back of your mind. You held out your arm and she hit the like a strong gust of hit her. (I heard stories about force. Old stories about how the jedi and sith would use it. Since the fall of the jedi temple and the empire, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d met a force user. Let alone be one. The jedi could mind trick anyone weak minded and the sith could shoot lightning from their fingertips. Maybe I can as well. Or would it be better to just let Rey kill this twilik?) You thought.</span></div></div>",

While you crying your eyes out, something happened. You said. Like what? She said. Just do it. I need to know something. You said. Ok\u2026.. This better not be some joke. She said. Rey brought you to her. Ok.... let\u2019s try this out. You said. You wave your hand. Valera. Listen to me. You don\u2019t want to be here. You want to go back to where you came from and never come back to Jakku again. You said. As soon as you said that, her eyes shoot open and she stands up. Rey was ready with her staff, but Valera shows no hostile intent to her. I\u2026.can\u2019t remember what I was doing here. But I do know I don\u2019t want to come back. She said She quickly ran out and drove away in her speeder. T\u2026T\u2026.Tyne\u2026\u2026what did you just do?! She said stunned. So\u2026.i was right after all. You said. Tyne!? Rey said. Rey. I suggest you take a seat before I tell you. You said. Rey sits next to her counter and places you on it. Ok. What\u2019s going on? She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you ever hear any stories about the force? You said. Not really. I heard stories about the republic before it became the empire. But not anything about the force. She said. Well, my mother always told me about force users when I was younger. How there was good ones and bad ones who could do incredible feats. She said. Feats? As in? She said. Shoot lightning from their fingers, choke, mind wipe people, push, pull, and all that. You said. So\u2026. Can you do any of that? She said. I\u2026..don\u2019t know. I was surprised when it happened. She was close to shooting you, I just held out my hand hoping she wouldn\u2019t. Next thing I know, she\u2019s hitting that steel wall. You said. That was you? I thought I blacked out from anger and did that. Can you do it again? She said. I\u2019ll\u2026.try to. You said. You hold up your arm and pick up a small metal pipe. Whoa. Tyne! Rey said. You drop the pipe. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m in love with a force user! She said. So it this going to affect our relationship in any way? You said. Not in the slightest! I\u2019ve loved you before this, I love you now. So what would you classify yourself as? She said. I\u2019m not callous enough to be a sith, but I\u2019m not virtuous enough to be a jedi. I guess we\u2019ll find out where I stand sooner or later. You said. Sith or Jedi, I\u2019ll stay by you. She said. Thanks. That makes this road a little easier. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo is there a special type of training or something you need to go through? She said. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d fit for training. I don\u2019t know if my body can handle it. But it would be awesome to have a lightsaber. You said. Well, you can\u2019t just let all that just sit inside you. It\u2019d be a waste. She said. I don\u2019t even know how to use the force properly. And all the temptations that come with it. The sith seem at home with it. They aren\u2019t afraid to use the force for their own, but to be so cold hearted and manipulative. I don\u2019t think I can do that. The jedi are the keepers of peace and all, but I always thought they were hindering themselves by not using the full extent of the force. And they always wait to the last second to help. For once in my life, I don\u2019t know what to do. You said. Well\u2026. How about you get a feel of it first? She said. Like use it as I see fit? You said. Yeah. Use it how you want and see if you want to be either. And whatever you choose, I\u2019ll be right there beside you. She said. I guess so\u2026.. You said. Come on. Don\u2019t be so down. This is a good thing. Nothing will change between us. She said as she places you in her hand. It\u2019s just\u2026\u2026a lot to take in. You sure nothing will change? You said. Tyne, look at me. She said. You look up at her. I love you, Ok. Nothing will change between the two of us. Just as you said to me, I\u2019m not leaving you. Ever! I loved you before this, I\u2019ll love you after this. I\u2019ll be by your side if you help the galaxy, I\u2019ll be by your side if you turn your back on the galaxy. We\u2019ll be good or evil together. She said. Even if I become a heartless menace or a righteous protector? You said. Yes. Whatever you become, I\u2019ll be right there with you. Helping or hurting people. She said. \u2026\u2026We really don\u2019t deserve each other. You said. But we\u2019re together until the end of time! She said as she embraced you. Which\u2026.will be\u2026\u2026sooner than\u2026..expected\u2026..if you don\u2019t\u2026\u2026ease up. You said through breaths. Sorry! She said. Rey lets go of you. You\u2019re stronger than you look. You said. I\u2026.got carried away. She said. It\u2019s\u2026..ok. Just remember. Small body equals delicate. You said. </span></div></div>",

Says\u201d Feed me first.\u201d You said. I had some food packs I bought for the two of us, but I dropped them. She said. I got it. You said. You hold out your hand and lift up one of the packs. Ok. Now to bring it in. You said. You bring the pack to the counter in front of Rey. Are you showing off now? She said. Maybe. You said as you picked up the second pack. You bring it in and set it down. I think you\u2019re getting the hang of this. She said. I think this is just the first step of many. You said. *Loud grumble* Someone isn\u2019t happy with you. You said. Ugh\u2026.. You\u2019re right. I need to eat. Like right now. She said as her eyes fall on you. Rey. Come on. We\u2019ve done this before. You said. Those were different. Listen. She said as she puts you against her stomach. You hear a loud grumble sound. See? I need to eat something. She said. Why does that something have to be me? You said worried. You\u2019re the quickest and closest something. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll be over in a few minutes and it won\u2019t hurt. She said. Rey. Please tell me you\u2019re playing. You said. Hehehehe. Not this time. Maybe i\u2019ll get force powers once you dissolve away. She said. Rey! You said as she brought you closer to her mouth. When she brought you closer, she pressed you against her lips. Fooled you\u2026.. She said. You open your eyes to see you\u2019re against Rey\u2019s lips. She kisses you a few more times then stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with force powers, you\u2019re still gullible. She said. Well, with the angry stomach and that hungry look in your eye\u2026.. You said. *Sigh* If I haven\u2019t eaten you by now, then I\u2019m not going to. She said. I guess you\u2019re right\u2026\u2026 I hope. You said. Rey sets you down and heats up one of the packs. She gives you a few pieces that fill you up. Satisfied now? You said. Aw, don\u2019t be upset. You weren\u2019t in any danger. She said. Guess you got to have fun too, I guess. I thought of something before you decided to scare the ghost out of me. You said. And that was? She said. I think I\u2019ve found the perfect way to practice. Let\u2019s go look for your parents. You said. What?! My parents!? She said surprised. Yeah. Remember the night I couldn\u2019t sleep? So we talked about each other until we both could sleep? You told me you never even seen them or know what they look like. I thought we could go out and find them. You said. I\u2026..well\u2026. She said. Don\u2019t you want to find them? You said. I do\u2026.. But what if they aren\u2019t alive? Or want nothing to do with me? And like you said, I don\u2019t even know what they look like. She said. Well, your skin isn\u2019t green, you don\u2019t have huge, bulbous black eyes, you don\u2019t have twin tails on the back of your head, and you don\u2019t have tentacles on your face. So It\u2019s only one conclusion: You\u2019re human. I know that. I know my parents are human. I just don\u2019t know any distinctions about them. Besides, would they even want anything to do with me? She said. You\u2019ll never know if you don\u2019t try. Wouldn\u2019t you like to know why they left you here? You said. Something I\u2019ve wondered for years now. She said. If we do find them and they do give you what you want, you might not like it, but it would give you closure and if you want anything to do with them. You said. \u2026\u2026..Would it be worth it? She said. That\u2019s something you need to ask yourself if\u2026..when we find them. You said. \u2026\u2026.It won\u2019t be easy. The galaxy\u2019s a big place. Not to mention dangerous. She said. Not everybody has a force user backing them. You said. Heh. You\u2019re right about that. She said. So.... Do you want to go find them? You said. Rey waits a few seconds before answering.</span></div></div>",

Someone must have a good one for sale. You said. Even if they were selling, I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford one. She said. Who said anything about spending your hard earn credits? You work too hard for those. You said. Then how are we going to get off this planet? She said. We\u2019ll just take it. You said. You mean steal?! She said. No! We\u2019re not that petty! We\u2019re going to take it free of charge. You said. How? She said. Hello? Force powers. You said. Oh. She said. This journey is also about finding who I am as well. Sith, Jedi, or neither. You said. Then\u2026..we leave Jakku tomorrow morning. She said. You can see the contemplation on her face. She\u2019s spent years on Jakku and now she\u2019s planning on leaving to find her parents. Rey? You said. I\u2019m\u2026\u2026fine, Tyne. Just thinking. She said. Do you want to be alone? You said. No. \u2026..It\u2019s late. And I need a shower. She said. Ok. I\u2019ll be here. You said. You\u2019re coming with me. You\u2019re filthy as I am. She said. You\u2026.want me\u2026..to join you? You said. \u2026\u2026Yeah. I just\u2026\u2026need you right now, Tyne. Now more than anything. She said. (She\u2019s going through a lot right now. The look on her face tells it all.) \u2026\u2026.Ok then. You said. Rey walks to her shower and starts to undress and so do you. She steps in and turns on the hot water. You look at her glistening body as she cleans herself.  \u2026.Enjoying the show? She said with a smile. Do I walk out of here alive if I say yes? You said. Heh. Anyone else would be on the receiving end of my staff. But you\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t mind. She said. Rey cleans herself slowly to give you a good show of her body. After she thoroughly cleaned herself, she started cleaning you. How does someone so small get so dirty? She said. Walking around like this will do that. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey takes her time not to hurt you while cleaning you. After cleaning you, she turns off the water and dresses for bed. She lays down with you in her hand and kiss you on the forehead. You had no problem falling asleep, but Rey couldn\u2019t fall asleep just yet. She was wondering all sorts of things about her parents. (Would they even want me? Did they even love me? Did they even try to keep me?) She though. All sorts of things about her parents kept her up. She looked over at you. You were sleeping peacefully with Rey\u2019s hand over you like a blanket. Rey brings you closer to her chest. You don\u2019t wake up, but can hear a soft, rhythmic beating. Don\u2019t leave me\u2026.. She said with a tear streaming down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. The necessities are loaded. \u2026\u2026Let go before I lose my nerve. She said. Rey hops into her speeder. Rey. Are you sure about this? You look like you don\u2019t want to go through with this. You said. No. I do. I\u2019ve dreamed about finding my parents. She said. Then why do you look so disheartened? You said. I\u2019m\u2026.. *Sigh.* \u2026..What would I say to them when we find them? \u201cSorry for showing up on your doorstep, but I\u2019m you abandoned daughter.\u201d? They left me here and I thought of a lot of things as to what happened to me. What if they left me for my own good? Or if they just didn\u2019t want me? She said. Rey, breathe for starters. You said. Rey takes a few deep breaths. Second, you\u2019re going for yourself, not them. They should be proud to have a tough daughter like you. And if they don\u2019t want anything to do with you, then you don\u2019t need them in your life. You said. \u2026\u2026Thanks. Let\u2019s go. She said. Rey tucks you into her shirt and drives to the outpost. After a few minutes, rey stops. Ok. Someone around here should be selling a ship. She said. Rey walks around for a few minutes until she finds a good ship. Rey pulls you out. Look. It seems in good condition. She said. The old lady doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019ll sell it. You said. That\u2019s where you come in. She said. Rey hides you away before approaching the lady. Hey miss. How much for the ship? Rey said. No less than 8,000. She said. Hmmm. Does it run well? You said. It\u2019ll get you where you need to go. And safely too. She said. Do you have that much? You said. Nowhere near. She mutters. Knowing what to do, you wave your hand. You want to give up this ship for free. You said. Actually\u2026.. I want to give it to you for free. She said. Nice. Rey said. Rey loads up the ship. The engine is good, thrusters are working, and the hull is sturdy. Rey said. And she only wanted 8,000 for it? I was expecting it to need fixing after getting it. Have you flown before? You said. \u2026\u2026.First time for anything. She said as she starts the engine. Rey gets the ship off the ground. So far, so good. She said. Rey flips a few switches and the ship flies into space. Well, that was good for a first time fly. Where to, captain? You said. I heard of a place call Naboo. Maybe we can try there first. She said. Works for me. You know where to go? You said. Luckily, this ship has a navmap of all the planets. Naboo, Korriban, Coruscant, Tatooine. Hopefully we\u2019ll get lucky. She said. Setting the course, You and Rey head off to find her parents.</span></div></div>",

From just looking from here, you\u2019re either rich or royalty to be here. Maybe your parents are one of them. You said. I just want to find them. I don\u2019t care about their social standing. Now I just need to find a spot to land. She said. Rey lands on an clear landing pad. Ready? You said. Yeah\u2026. She said. Rey picks you up and steps out of the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Rey was getting a lot of smiles from people and a few bows here and there when she talked to someone. Everyone\u2019s so friendly here. Not like back home. She said. Not use to warmth and open arms? You said. Not unless a blaster was involved in the meeting. She said. People here seem to be living the high life. Want to look the part? You said. No. I don\u2019t think I can pass for what these people represent. She said. Ahhh, you\u2019re selling yourself short. You could pass for a queen. You said. I\u2026.could? She said. Sure. Young, beautiful, smart. Need I go on? You said. You\u2026..really think I could be a queen? She said. You\u2019re the queen of my heart. You said. Rey blush madly when you said that and gives you a quick kiss. Keep the sweet talk for later. She said. Rey tucks you away and starts asking around about her parents. Rey had gotten some leads, but they turned out to be wrong. When evening comes, Rey pulls you out and sits on the ledge of a bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo luck? You said. Nothing. It was just people who look like they could be my parents. Were they? You said. No. They would have remembered having a daughter. She said. Don\u2019t be down. We came up empty this time, but we\u2019re bound to get a good lead soon. You said. I hope. She said. Rey looks at the sun as it sets. The sun on this planet is beautiful in the evening. She said. Not as beautiful as you. You said. Stop it\u2026.. I\u2019m not use to being complimented. She said with a smile. I find that hard to believe. A cute girl like you not being complimented at least once? Not even by some sleaze? You said. Well, there was this one guy, but he got a concussion. She said. What did he say? You said. He said I should use my assets for something provocative. She said. Wow. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t bury him alive. You said. Trust me, I had a hole ready for him. She said. Well, if he was nicer guy, he would see how lucky he was. You said. Even if he was, he wasn\u2019t my type. I prefer a small, easily manageable person. She said. And who would that-Oh. You said. Who else is tiny like you? She said. Heh. I don\u2019t know the people you meet while scavenging. You said. I can tell you they aren\u2019t small like you. She said. Ha. Ha. Ha. You said. Oh come on. Have to poke fun at you every now and then. Keeps me from worrying about you. She said. Yeah. Poke fun at the guy who can push you into the freezing water below. You said. Point taken. She said as she picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on. It\u2019s getting dark. She said. Rey goes to her apartment she got for \u201cfree\u201d. This place is fancy. She said. Yeah. A room for a person with credits to burn. You said. You jump onto the comfy bed while Rey undresses. You stare up at her as she becomes bare naked. Heh heh. Enjoyed the show? She said. I wasn\u2019t watching! You said. Uh-huh. She said. Rey climbs onto the bed and you jump up onto her hand. So\u2026. You called me a queen earlier. She said. Well, you did, and still, look like one. You said. Got anymore compliments? She said. Well, I don\u2019t know if I can top dreams come true, beauty incarnate, or a goddess among us humans, but I\u2019ll think of something. You said. Rey laughs at how cheesy your compliments are. You\u2019re laughing, so they must be decent compliments. You said. Pretty decent. She said. Rey picks you up and starts kissing you. Between each kiss, she would tell you she loved you. After a few minutes of this, she placed you against her chest where you could hear each beat of her heart. Tyne\u2026. She said. Yes? You said. I need you to promise me something. She said. Anything. You said. If we don\u2019t find my parents.... Promise to never leave me. You\u2019re the only one who wanted anything to do with me. The only person I could call friend, then lover. She said. Rey\u2026.. You said. Just promise me that, Tyne..... I don\u2019t want to be alone again. She said. You can tell her voice is breaking and she\u2019s tearing up. Rey. I promise I won\u2019t leave you. You said. Ever? She said. Ever. I won\u2019t let you be alone again. Until we either die or the whole galaxy comes to an end, I will not leave you. You said. Touched by your promise, tears stream down her face. *Sniff* T\u2026Thank you\u2026. She said. You both embrace each other and slowly drift off to sleep in each other\u2019s embrace. </span></div></div>",

You said. Rey hugs you tighter. Heh heh. Ok. Time to wake up. You said. You worm your way free. Now. How do I wake up a giant girl? You said. That\u2019s when you get an idea. You make your way to her lips and kiss her. Mmm. She said. She must think it\u2019s a dream. You said. You kiss her again. Tyne\u2026.. Again. She said. Is she really asleep or faking? You said. You kiss her again. Tyne\u2026..  Don\u2019t stop. She said. Ok. This is getting nowhere. She\u2019s too deep into her fantasy. She needs a jolt. Something to shock her out. You said. Then you get another idea. You make your way to her breast and climb up her left one. This should do it. You said as you rub her nipple. The sudden arousal and movement of her makes you fall in between her breast as she wakes up with a blushed face. T\u2026.Tyne?! She said. Uh\u2026. Down here. You said. Rey looks down to see you in between her breasts. Heh heh. If you wanted there, all you had to do was ask. She said. It\u2026.was to wake you up. You said. You drop down on her hand. Well, I was in a good dream. But I had to wake up sooner or later. She said. Rey puts you down, washes, and get dress. So the usual plan today? You said. Yeah. Let\u2019s go. She said. Rey picks you up and drops you down her top. Can\u2019t have anyone seeing you. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey walks around and ask a few people for information. While she was probing for information, she had moved you back into her cleavage and kept you there. You had no problem with it, but it would become hot rather quick combined with her body heat. As time went on, you could tell Rey was getting down in her voice. She was getting disheartened with all the dead ends and wrong people she was getting. When Rey sits at a bench, she puts her head in her hands and looks back up. Seeing her depressed, you scurry up and hug her cheek. \u2026Tyne? She said. You look down in the dump, so I thought a hug might help. You said. It does a little. I knew we weren\u2019t going to find them on the first planet we went, but for every lead to be dead\u2026.. She said. We\u2019ll find them. They have to be somewhere. If they are anything like you, then they must be alive. You said. I hope. I want to know what it\u2019s like to have someone care about you. She said. Ahem! You said. Oh! I know you care, Tyne! But me and you are lovers. I meant care as in a father, mother, and daughter thing. She said. Can you at least be specific next time? You said. For you? Sure. She said. Rey places you back between her breast and continues her search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day goes on, Rey continues her search until nighttime hits. She heads back to her apartment and takes you out. Learn anything new? You said. Actually, I did. An old man said he saw two people who looked like my parents years ago. She said. And where are they? You said. Off world. He said they came here and stayed here for a few days and left on a shuttle to Nar Shaddaa. She said. The smuggler\u2019s moon? What could your parents want from there? You said. Won\u2019t know until I get there, but I want to have one more night on this planet before we leave. She said. As you say. You said. As Rey gets undress, she eyes you. You know I don\u2019t like that look in your eye. You want something? You said. Maybe I do, maybe I don\u2019t. She said coy. Way to play it off. You said. Rey picks you up and climbs on the bed. I want our last day on this planet to be memorable. She said. How? You said. I want you to\u2026.. You know\u2026.. Go inside me\u2026.. She said. Are\u2026.you sure about this? You said. Yes. We might not get another chance. Who knows what will happen out there. She said. If you\u2026.want this. You said. Rey places you between her legs and you are face to face with her pussy. You could feel the heat emanating from it. You shove your arm in and Rey lightly shudders. You take a deep breath and force yourself inside. Ah! Rey said. You crawl through her as Rey moans with pure bliss. As you crawl through giving her pleasure, you find the sweet spot and agitate it. This sends Rey over the moon. Rey closes her eyes in ecstasy. After a few minutes, reaches climax and you are pushed out in a flow of her juices. Man\u2026. Like I took a shower. I\u2019m drenched. You said. You are suddenly plucked up, dried off, and are held close to Rey\u2019s chest. You know\u2026.this makes you my plaything now. She said. Plaything!? You said. Kidding! She said as she hugs you tighter. Heh. You said.</span></div></div>",

You look over to see her smiling in her sleep. At least you\u2019re have sweet dreams, Rey. All that matters to me. You say. M\u2026\u2026mom\u2026..Dad......Why? She said. Dreaming about her parents. You said. You place your hand on her head. We\u2019ll find them. Then you can really ask them why. You said. After a few minutes, you hear talking outside the room. That\u2019s too much noise for a stumbling drunk. You said. You go against your better judgment and head to the door. You crawl through the door crack and see a lady dressed in yellow and green clothing and talking on an holocom. I\u2019m telling you. She\u2019s either one or knows someone who is. The girl has been getting food, accommodation, and a few other things and has paid a single credit for any of it. She said. Has this lady been tailing us? You said. How else can she get all that without being a jedi? Too many coincidences. She said. Keep your conspiracies to yourself\u2026.. You said. Don\u2019t worry, if she is a jedi, I won\u2019t break her too bad. Well, maybe a finger or two. Then ship her to Nar Shaddaa. Let our exchange deal with her. She said with an evil smile. Not if I can do anything about it! You said. You extend your arm and push her into wall and she hits it with a loud thud. Ow! Who\u2026.? She said. You jump onto her belly and make yourself known. Hey! You said. The lady looks around until she sees a little figure standing on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in the?! How\u2019d you\u2026. Shut it! I\u2019m asking the questions! You interrupt. At your current size, I don\u2019t think so. Let me show you who\u2019s really in charge. She said. When her hand was coming for you, you stopped it. What the?! How are you doing this?! She said. You wave your hand. Who are you working for? I\u2026.I\u2026\u2026.work for\u2026..Nezro. A big time crime boss. She said. Who is the girl you were referring to? You said. A\u2026..girl who is going around getting stuff for free. She said. (Rey\u2026.) What is your purpose for her? You said. S\u2026.Ship her to the smuggler\u2019s moon. She said. Why? You said. Bounty\u2026.. There is a bounty on any jedi. Enough to buy out a planet. She said. (If all the rumors mom told me about the exchange is true, then it\u2019d be good to avoid them.) You thought. You jump off her. Ugh\u2026.. My head hurts\u2026.. She said. You reach out towards her and she starts to choke. You thugs have always sicken me. W\u2026.Wait! We can\u2026..talk about this\u2026.. She said. What\u2019s there to talk about? You said. N\u2026.name your\u2026.terms\u2026. She said.  Why would I even deal with an exchange thug? I\u2019d be doing the galaxy a favor. You said as you drop your arm. I *gasp* talk to my boss\u2026\u2026 You\u2019ll never hear from us again\u2026.. She said. How do I know you\u2019re not lying? You said. I have my holo right here. I\u2019ll just call him right now and say it was a hoax. She said. Do it. Pull a fast one and snap. You said. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m being strong armed by someone no bigger than my thumb\u2026. She said. She presses a few buttons and a holo of a human woman with  cybernetic implants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was quick, Nina. She said. Hey, Seva. Is the boss there? Nina said. He\u2019s with a dealer. Did you get the girl? Seva said. Turns out she wasn\u2019t a jedi. Just a girl with really rich parents. Nina said. So she\u2019s just a spoiled brat using her dad or mom\u2019s name. Better if she was a jedi, then she could be tortured to an inch of her life. I\u2019ll tell the boss the lead was bad. Seva said before closing. I don\u2019t like your friend and how that conversation went. You said. Seva has issues with jedi. Had to be fixed with cybernetics from a close encounter with a jedi. But I did like I said. So I can go now, right? You won\u2019t see or hear from us again. She said. She did what she promised. They won\u2019t be out for Rey. But she knows of your force powers. She could go talk them into hunting you. You know Rey can handle them, but the exchange doesn\u2019t quit until they get their mark. She\u2019s the only one who knows. With her gone, there would be no way the exchange finds to find out.</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds of struggling, you hear a crack and she slumps onto the ground. You turn around and crawl back under the door. You make your way back to the bed and jump back onto the bed. At this point, you\u2019re no longer surprised by the things you can do now with your force powers. You head back over to Rey\u2019s head and sit down. You don\u2019t even go back to sleep. You just sit there until the sun comes up. When it does, you don\u2019t even feel tired. You barely react to Rey waking up when the sun light over her eyes. \u2026\u2026You\u2019re awake early. What\u2019s the occasion? You said. Do I need one to wake up next to you? She said with a smile. \u2026..Guess not. You said. Did you sleep well? You weren\u2019t in my hand. She said. \u2026\u2026I went to sleep later than you did. You said. You didn\u2019t do anything while I was asleep, did you? She said. What kind of trouble could I get into at this size? You said. Not much\u2026.. She said. \u2026\u2026Don\u2019t worry about me. I can handle myself. You said. Rey could see you weren\u2019t acting your usual happy self. Tyne\u2026.. Are you ok? She asked concerned. \u2026..I\u2019m fine. Like I said, don\u2019t worry about me. You said. Saying that makes me worry even more. She said. I\u2019m good. Go and take your shower or whatever. I\u2019m not going anywhere. You said. Ok. Now I know something is wrong. She said. I\u2019m fine. Do I look wrong to you? You said. Something is wrong, but not physically. She said. I\u2019m fine. Just\u2026. *Sigh* Do whatever you want. You said. Your attitude was getting to Rey. Your attitude going from happy to nonchalant overnight? Rey was going to find out what happened overnight. After taking her shower and getting dressed, she sits on the bed and places you in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAren\u2019t we leaving? You said. Not until you talk to me. She said. \u2026..Didn\u2019t you want to find your parents? You said. They can wait. I\u2019m focusing on the one I\u2019m in love with right now. She said. The things we do for love\u2026. You mutter. Overnight, you go from jovial to offhand? No way. What happened last night? She said. Nothing happened. I just stayed up later than you did. You said. Doesn\u2019t mean something still happened. She said. Nothing happened. Besides the giggling and talking in your sleep, nothing went on that night. You said. You\u2019re lying. She said. How do you know? Are you a mind reader? Or can you see the past? Or do you not trust the word of the one you said you love? You said. No, and I do trust you. But I know when something isn\u2019t right. You\u2019re not this nonchalant about anything. If something happened to you\u2026. I\u2026.don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. Tyne\u2026\u2026please. Just tell me what happened. I won\u2019t be mad at you, I promise. She said. (You sure do know how to pick \u2018em, Tyne. Guess this is true love at work. I\u2019d do the same in her shoes.) You thought. Rey gentle rubs your back as she waits for you to answer. \u2026..Do you really want to know? You said. I do. She said. \u2026..Fine. Look outside the door. You said. Rey puts you down and opens the door to see the body of a woman. What in the!? Is she\u2026. Rey said. Dead? As a doorknob. We should leave. Someone will discover her body and suspect you. You said. Rey quickly grabs you and heads for the ship and takes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe should be long gone before they find the body. You said. \u2026..How did it happen? She said. How\u2019d what happen? You said. What did you do last night!? She said. \u2026\u2026.I heard a noise last night, so I went to check. The lady we saw was a thug for a powerful crime boss. She wanted you. You said. Me? What for? Rey said. All the stuff you got for free back there. She thought you were a jedi. Her plan was to get you, take you to her boss, then sell you to the exchange on Nar Shaddaa for a lump sum of credits. I confronted her. Told her she was wrong and had her tell her boss it was a hoax. You said. And what else? Rey said. I couldn\u2019t have them keep coming after us. She was the only one who knew I had the force powers. So I\u2026..silenced her. You said. Rey remains quiet for a few seconds. I haven\u2019t changed. I just didn\u2019t want people hounding us. The last thing we need is someone hunting us down. You said. I know\u2026.. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight to Nar Shaddaa was quiet until you spoke. Rey. You said. Yeah\u2026.? She said. I want to ask you something. You said. Go on. She said. You\u2019ve killed before. How do you cope? You said. What makes you think I\u2019ve killed before? She said. Back on Jakku, I saw tally marks on the wall next to your bench. There were a lot of them. More than I could count. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm? This wall has marks on them. Tally marks. So many of them. Are these her kill count? You said. You do see a little blood on above the marks. Best not to know. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of flashback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n How do you do it? You said. \u2026\u2026Those marks don\u2019t represent kills. They are the days I\u2019ve spent on Jakku. She said. And the blood? You said. I punched the wall out of anger and scrapped my knuckles. She said. That long, huh? You said. Longer than you know. But I have killed before. Only if I had to. In the life of a scavenger, I had to get use to it. She said. So how often was it? You said. Every now and then, I\u2019d blast someone. I\u2019ve only done it if it\u2019s the last option. She said. What about me? Would you? You said. If I wanted you dead, I would have killed you by now. She said. Many ways to and opportunities. Maybe you\u2019re just waiting for the right moment. You said. Are you serious right now? After all the time we spent, I could have. Eaten, stomped, suffocate, and all. But I didn\u2019t because one: you aren\u2019t a threat to me. Two: I\u2019m not a psychopath. Three: I wanted to\u2026.keep you around. She said. Relax, Rey. Just pulling your leg. Trying to find a way to cope. Guess that means we\u2019re both killers. First time I\u2019ve taken a life. You said. Rey puts on the autopilot and places her hand next to you. You jump onto her hand and she brings you up. Look, I\u2019m happy you were protecting me and all, but no more killing, ok? Leave that to me. She said. Even if to protect you? You said. \u2026\u2026If the situation is dire, then yeah, but outside of that, don\u2019t. She said. So\u2026.you\u2019re not upset at me? You said. I wasn\u2019t upset. Just\u2026.taking in the fact you killed someone. She said. At my current size, hard to believe if it wasn\u2019t for the force. I won\u2019t go that far again unless you are in physical trouble. You said. \u2026..Thanks. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, can I see a smile on that face? You said. Rey smiles for you. That\u2019s better. Just one more thing, you said you\u2019d be by my side no matter what. If I happen to walk down some dark paths, would you still be there? You said. Right by you. Sith, jedi, or criminals\u2026. I\u2019m right next to you. Whatever we become. She said. Just needed the reassurance. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going anywhere or doing anything drastic. I\u2019m still not leaving you. You said. Thank you. She said as she pulled in in for a hug. Unless someone with two bigger orbs comes in. You said. Ha. Ha. Ha. I wonder if the airlock works while flying. She said. Joking! Joking! You said. </span></div></div>",

This is a place to get lost in. Hey, with any luck, your parents might be powerful people with their own syndicate. You said. Oh, great. I\u2019m part of a crime family. She said. If it\u2019s true, you\u2019d get anything you want and people will run from you when they see you. You said. I\u2026.don\u2019t think i would like it that much. She said. Well, just in case\u2026. You said. You bow your head to Rey. What was that for? She said. Just in case you are a crime lord\u2019s daughter, I don\u2019t have to worry about being killed. She said. Well it was a nice gesture, but I doubt I\u2019m part of a crime family. She said. Only one way to find out. You said. I know. Just keep your head down. You might get sold here. She said. I\u2019ll try not to stand out any more than I do now. You said. You tuck yourself away and Rey starts her search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of hustle and bustle here. Should feel right at home for you. You said. Except I\u2019m not selling anything this time. She said. Speaking of selling, how many customers did you usually get? You said. On a good day, I\u2019d get at least 7 people. Mostly smugglers and mercenaries, the occasional hutt, and a few off-world people. She said. You didn\u2019t ask for an arm and leg, did you? You said. No lower than 50 credits. Girl\u2019s got to make a living. She said. Rey starts to ask around about her parents; which starts to bring unwanted attention. I think we caught a trail. A Rodian said he overheard two people talked about their daughter they left on Jakku years ago. She said. Are they still here? You said. No. It happened long before we came here. They were in a hurry when they left. She said. We can use that. If we\u2019re lucky, they left something behind that we can use. You said. Rey heads to the refugee sector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of people down here. You said. Let\u2019s find where they were staying. She said. Rey looks into each one until she comes across one that is locked. This one won\u2019t open. She said. Hang on. You said. You use the force to move the mechanism around to open the door. Presto. You said. You have your uses after all. She said. Heh. Cute. I\u2019ll remember that one. You said. Rey looks around until she finds an old holocom. She plays it and a man in robes with a woman in robes start talking. You sure it was the right thing to do? Leaving her? She said. Not like we had a choice. She\u2019s better off. He said. But just because- Keep quiet! They could be listening. He interrupts. The holo ends there. Not particularly crime syndicate looking. Rey? She said. You see Rey is silent with a serious look. Are you ok? You said. Rey says nothing as she picks you and leave the sector. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your help, Rey was able to acquire a nice apartment with a view the lower parts of Nar Shaadda. A room with a view. Nice. You said. Rey plays the holo over and over. R\u2026. No. I shouldn\u2019t say anything. You said. \u2026..All these years of wondering. Now, I\u2019m looking for them and I\u2019m still wondering. She said. You keep looking outside. The tone in my father\u2019s voice\u2026\u2026 Did they care? They just left me. They didn\u2019t leave anything to tell me why. They just did. \u2026\u2026What do you think, tyne? You think they had a reason for leaving me? She said. You were a kid. What could you have done to make them leave you all alone? You said. Nothing. Maybe they owed someone, were on the run, or just didn\u2019t want me. She said. Hey, let\u2019s not jump to conclusions. We don\u2019t know until we hear it from them. Let\u2019s hear it from them before you decide anything. You said. \u2026..You\u2019re right. If\u2026.. When we find them, I\u2019ll get what I want. She said. Hopefully, they will be answers you like. You said. Hopefully\u2026. But after looking at this, I\u2019m preparing for the worst. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look out at the bustling city, Rey calms down some. She walks over, picks you up and kiss you. What\u2019s this all about? You said. Thanks for being with me through this. She said. No need. You deserve to know them at least. You said. If they don\u2019t want me, then fine. It\u2019ll be just you and me. She said. Under the twin suns\u2026. You said. You, me, and the endless Sandpeople. She said. Or we could go back to Naboo. A few wiped minds and we can live in the palace and the throne is yours. Wherever you like. You said. As long as you\u2019re there with me, I\u2019m fine. She said. Well, let\u2019s leave the talk for a home after we find your parents. You said. You know, just holding you close to me, I forget about my parents and problems and feel I have everything I need. She said. That\u2019s deep. You said. It\u2019s true. Everything just disappears when I\u2019m with you. I feel\u2026.wanted. She said. If that\u2019s bad, I can up and leave like your parents did. You said. Rey laughs at your joke, which makes you happy. No. I like this feeling. I wanted just one person to care for me and you do just that without even being scared into it. She said. The first few minutes I was, but you were kind to me, so I could feel relax around you. You said. I didn\u2019t want to run you off into the vast desert. She said. Heh. Made the right choice in staying with a lovely lady. You said. Lovely, huh? So what do you love about me? She said with a smirk. In general or specific? You said. Just name something. She said. Your kind attitude, toughness, put others first, the giggles in your sleep, the bear like yawn, and your passion. You said. So you do accept me for me. She said. Now what do you love about me? You said. Your thoughtfulness, putting yourself in harm\u2019s way, caring, the talking in your sleep, and your\u2026..underlying fetish. She said. Heh heh\u2026. Again, sorry. That wasn\u2019t suppose to happen during the massage. You said. But it did. And I don\u2019t mind. I have my kinks, you have yours. She said. Well then, next time we have some time, we\u2019ll have to explore each other\u2019s kinks together. Mmm. I can\u2019t wait. She said. </span></div></div>",

She said. If they lie, do you want me to\u2026. You know. You said. No. I want the truth willingly. If they lie to me, that shows they weren\u2019t thinking about me. She said. They\u2019ll have a chance to gain or lose a daughter. They better take it. You said. If they don\u2019t, just me and you. She said. Wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Had enough of this place? You said. No need to stay. Unless you want to gamble. She said. I\u2019d take the chance, but there\u2019s not enough room on the ship for the credit haul. You said. With you in her hand, Rey heads back to the ship and flies into space.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey had the ship on autopilot as she was just constantly watching the holo. (She\u2019s watching that thing again. It must be eating her up inside.) You thought. Worried about her, you lift the holo out of her hands and place it next to you. I know. Stop watching. But I can\u2019t. I just never seen them and this is all I have so far of them. She said. I get it, but watching this till your eyes fall out won\u2019t making finding them quicker. You said. I just want to know so badly. \u2026..What\u2019s it like having a parent, Tyne? She said. There are the good times and bad. Someone who has your best interest at heart, unconditional love, there for you when you\u2019re hurt. You said. Is it really as good as you\u2019re making it? She said. Like I said, good times and bad. Some days you want to be close to them, other days, you want to be far away from them. Same with my mother. We had our good times, but we also had our bad. But we loved each other in the end. You said. I hope my parents at least loved me. Excuse me. She said. Rey gets out of her seat and goes through the sliding door. I\u2026. No. Best to leave her alone for now. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey had left the ship on autopilot for now. She wanted to be alone to gather her thoughts. You were looking out into space. Never thought I\u2019d see space flight. Thought I had to join a military or become a pirate to see this. As you watch, Rey comes back. You ok? You said. Yeah. I just needed some to be alone for a while. She said. You still want to search? I won\u2019t hold it against you if you want to stop. You said. No. Watching that holo made me want to find them even more. She said. Then I\u2019ll be right here with you. I\u2019ve got a few questions of my own to ask. Once you\u2019re done with them. So where to now, captain? You said as you give a soldier salute. Before she could tell you, the ship is rocked violently. What was that?! You said. Power to the engines is gone! I think the ship was hit with an ion missile! She said. That means we\u2019re dead in space. You said. Then you hear the clanking of metal against the ship. We\u2019re being boarded! She said. Rey hides you under the flight control console. Whatever happens, stay here. She said. But- No buts! I won\u2019t let something bad happens to you! Stay here. She interrupts. Rey hides to the side of the sliding metal doors. You can hear heavy footsteps. When the doors open, you see a heavily armored Mandalorian with a black-market pistol. The person was average height, but they were wearing a helmet and bulky armor. So you couldn\u2019t tell if it was a man or woman unless they spoke. The person walks forward and Rey attacks them with her staff. The person staggers and Rey hits them a few more times. But the person dodged one swing and punch Rey in the face. The person then slams Rey into the cold, steel wall. When they held her there, Rey kicks with all her might to make them let go of her. When she\u2019s drop, Rey picks up her staff, but is shoot in the knee by a pistol. Rey! You said as she hits the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Rey drags herself to the flight console. Her hope was blocking you from view. Ugh\u2026. W\u2026what\u2026.do you want with me? She said. The person shows Rey a holo recording. The female human jedi has been spotted. We can\u2019t take chances with her. Capture or kill her. The holo recording said. Do I look like a jedi to you? Where\u2019s my lightsaber? She said. The person put the pistol to her skull, showing that they weren\u2019t up for games. NO!!! You said as you run out from behind her and force push the person from Rey. The person hits the wall with a loud thud. Tyne! I said stay hidden. She said. I\u2019m not standing by and watching! You said. You concentrate the force around Rey to heal her when the bounty hunter gets back up. Rey covers you with her hand, which makes you stop. With pistol in aimed, the bounty hunter comes close to Rey. You lift Rey\u2019s hand up and make yourself known. Hey! Bounty hunter! Down here! You shout. Hearing a voice, the person looks down to see a small figure. Tyne, don\u2019t! Rey said. I\u2019m the force user you want! Me! Not her! You said. You prove it by pulling off a panel on the wall. Stop! Rey said. Let her go and I\u2019ll do whatever you want. You said. Don\u2019t even think about it! Rey said. Disregarding her, the bounty hunter grabs you roughly. You look up at the imposing person. If you hurt him.....! Rey said. The bounty hunter walks away with you in hand and hyperspace away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyne\u2026..! Rey said as she gets up. Rey gets to the flight control. I\u2019m not abandoning you. She said. Rey was able to track the coordinates of the bounty hunter\u2019s flight path. I\u2019m coming, Tyne. She said. </span></div></div>",

She turns back to the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was keeping a watchful eye on you. I\u2019m a person of my word. I\u2019m not going to try anything. You\u2019d kill me anyway. You said. That still didn\u2019t stop her from watching you every now and then. (Escaping isn\u2019t possible. She wouldn\u2019t kill me. She\u2019ll be out of a cashcow. I\u2019m too good to her. How am I going to get out of this?) You thought. As you were thinking of a way out, you are grabbed by her. You stand on her open hand as she stares down at you. Take a picture. It\u2019ll last longer. A small human isn\u2019t something you see everyday. You said. She pokes and prods you. Then she stops. You do this to all your bounties? You said. She drops you on the console before she looks at her datapad. (I can\u2019t last against a bounty hunter. Even with force powers. Rey\u2026.) You thought. T\u2026.Tyne!? Rey said. (R...Rey?!) You said. Tyne! Where are you? She said. (Being held hostage by this bounty hunter. How are you hearing me?) You thought. I just heard my name being called. She said. (So I\u2019m speaking to you\u2026..telepathically?) You thought. I guess\u2026.. Where are you? She said. (Still flying. I have no idea where she\u2019s taking me. I\u2019m a little scared.) You thought. I\u2019m following close behind. I\u2019m coming for you. Don\u2019t worry. She said. (As much as I joked about it\u2026. I don\u2019t want to be sold off. ) You thought. I won\u2019t let that happen. I promise. She said. The conversation is interrupted by the bounty hunter picking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? You said. She looks at you and pokes you. Is that all you\u2019re going to do to me? I\u2019m not a doll. You said. Her finger traces all over you. As she was doing this, the ship comes to a huge exchange frigate. Didn\u2019t think ships could get that big. The thing could start and end a war. You said. When the ship docks on the frigate, she puts her helmet back on and closes her hand around you. She leaves her ship and takes you to the bridge of the ship where a female human was waiting. Just from her looking at her, you could tell she was a high up in the exchange. Hunter. Where is the jedi? She said. The bounty hunter shows you to her. What?! A tiny human!? She said. The bounty hunter nudges you and you get the idea. You lift her pistol from her waist. Wait\u2026.. This guy is the one we heard about? T\u2026.This changes everything\u2026.. In a good way. She said. She snatches you from the bounty hunter. The credits are being transferred to your account now. Plus a bonus for this discovery. She said. The bounty hunters turns and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what\u2019s going to happen to me? You said. What makes you say that? She said. I know you exchange type. You want something from everyone you come in contact with. So might as well come clean. You said. Let\u2019s just say we have plans for you. But first, why don\u2019t you tell me how you got like this. She said. \u2026\u2026Like I have a choice in the matter. You said. You tell her how you got like this. Hm. Interesting story. She said. No need to act interested. You\u2019re just going to get rid of me anyway. You said. Jeez. For a jedi, you are a downer. She said. Who said I was a jedi? You said. Wait. You\u2019re not a jedi? She said. Am I dressed like one? Do you see a lightsaber on me? You said. So you\u2019re a jedi? Then there will be no question of morality then. Everything just got easier. She said. Morality, huh. Guess I\u2019ll be doing questionable things. You said. (Not like it matters anyway. I\u2019ve already killed. Can\u2019t get any worse than that.) You thought. Then there is a loud blaring of the alarm. An intruder? Now? Security teams! Deal with it! She said over comms. After a few minutes, a exchange thug comes on comms. Madam! We lost three squads to the intruder. She cutting through our forces like an angry rancor! He said. Activate the defense turrets! Deploy the HK-47 droids! I want this person stopped! She said. Just as she said that, there are some blaster shots heard outside. After a few seconds past, you see Rey come in and the exchange lady pulls out her pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve got some nerve. Come onto my ship, killing my men, destroying my droids, and interrupting my business. She said. You think I care? I\u2019m here to get back what\u2019s mine. Rey said. The only thing you\u2019ll get is a blaster shot in the eye! She said. Before she could shoot, Rey smacks the pistol from her hand and knocks her legs out from under her. Damn. Better not make Rey angry. You said. Rey takes the pistol and puts her boot on the lady\u2019s chest. Whoa, whoa! Let\u2019s not\u2026do anything we might regret. She said. You are in no position to bargain. She said. Wait! I can give you whatever you want. Just name it. She said. I want nothing from you! Except one thing\u2026.. She said. Rey\u2019s finger was about to squeeze the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was seriously not happy with this lady. You did want to see her pay, but was this it? She\u2019s probably done horrible things to people. No more horrible than what she was going to make you do. She\u2019s exchange, so of course she has. But does that warrant a death sentence? You and Rey were better than this. Better than the exchange. Neither of you were like them, but you know the exchange won\u2019t quit unless the risk too great. Should you let Rey kill her?</span></div></div>",

You said. If they know what\u2019s good for them, they will let this be a lesson. She said. She picks you up and holds you close. Let\u2019s get out of here. She said. Rey makes her way back to the ship. She places you in the other seat. Hold on! She said. Rey starts up the engine, flies out the hanger and hyperdrives away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you ok? She asked. I should be asking you that. You braved mercenaries and droids to get to me. You said. I\u2019ll be fine. I want to know about you. She said. A wounded ego over being exchanged so easily, but nothing physical. You said. She didn\u2019t do anything to you? Hurt you in anyway? She said as she picks you up gently. (Went from cold hearted to caring so fast. Yeah, I\u2019m not making her mad. But she really does care for me). No. Before anything could be done, A \u201cangry rancor\u201d started to slaughter people on the ship. With nothing but a staff. You said. I took a mercenary\u2019s blaster and fought my way to you. I wasn\u2019t going to lose the one person who cares for me to thugs and gangsters. She said. Heh heh. Guess we both can\u2019t stand to see the other in a horrible situation. You said as you hug her check. I owe you\u2026.well, basically everything. You said. Your love is enough for me. She said. Which will make this next part easy. You said. What do you mean? She said. I want to say this\u2026.just in case I don\u2019t get another chance. I know we have interest in each other, but what you did for me back there proves we aren\u2019t just meant to be two people with a crush. No one has gone that far for me besides my mother. You said. What are saying? She said. You work up the courage to look her in the eyes. What I\u2019m saying is that\u2026.. I don\u2019t want to be just your lover. I want to be your significant other. You said. Rey\u2019s heart skipped a beat hearing that. T\u2026.T\u2026.Tyne\u2026. Are you\u2026.. She said. Yes. After what you did for me, no doubt. Would you do me the honor, Rey? You said. Rey\u2019s heart was beating quickly. She\u2019d never think something like this would happen to her. From the overwhelming feeling, she started to cry, but they were tears of joy. Yes\u2026. Yes! I\u2026.would be happy to! She said. Rey hugs you tightly. Despite the pain, you just let her hold you tightly. After a few seconds, she knows she\u2019s holding you tightly and lets go. So I guess we need to get you a ring. You said. I don\u2019t want one. I have everything I want in you. As long as you know, that\u2019s enough. She said. Rey gives you a long kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So where to now? You said. Coruscant. She said. Home of the jedi order. Corescant\u2019s a big place. We might not get as lucky like Nar Shadda. You said. We\u2019re bound to find something. If not, it\u2019s a great place to live. She said. If you have the credits. Luckily, you don\u2019t need them. You said. I prefer a room with a view. She said. Is that an inclination of our future home? You said. Maybe. We\u2019ll have to see where we settle first. She said. Whatever you want. You said. Rey flies the ship to Coruscant. The ship enter Coruscant\u2019s atmosphere. Tall buildings, hustle of the city\u2026. Try not to be overwhelmed. You said. I\u2019ll be fine. She said as she lands the ship. Hmm. Looks like we landed in the upper parts. Good place to start. Ready? You said. Yeah. Come on. She said. She puts you down her chest. Rey exits the ship and starts walking and asking around. After an hour or so, Rey steps down an ally and pulls you out. Found out anything? You said. Nothing concreate. She said. We\u2019ll find out something. You said. Rey tucks you back in and continues her search. When nighttime comes, You and Rey are look out at the jedi temple from her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoom with a view. Like you said. You said. Love it. She said. So anything new you found out? You said. I got a lead that the jedi temple has what I\u2019m looking for. She said. The temple? Nobody\u2019s been there since order 66. But I don\u2019t think that will stop you. You said. It won\u2019t. I\u2019m not scared of any ghost or disembodied voices. She said. You think your parents might be jedi? You said. I have no idea. Won\u2019t know till we get there. She said. If nothing, you could snag a lightsaber. It\u2019d be better than the staff. You said. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be any good with it. She said. You\u2019re selling yourself short. From how I\u2019ve seen you wield that staff, a lightsaber is a piece of cake. You said. .....A lightsaber does get someone\u2019s attention. She said. You don\u2019t need all that training. Just remember point it towards the enemy. Not you. You said. Ha. Ha. Ha. I\u2019m going to take a shower. Try not to kill anyone while I do. She said. I won\u2019t. You said. Rey heads into the bathroom. You stare out at the jedi temple. A jedi\u2026. There\u2019s so many contradictions in their philosophy. Yet they never questioned it. The sith are honest about themselves. But to constantly look over your shoulder isn\u2019t something I like. Then again, who said I had to be either? I can just be some guy who can use the force and use it when I see fit. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile deep in thought, Rey comes out from her shower. Tyne? Are you ok? She said. Yeah\u2026.. Just thinking\u2026.about some things. You said. She notices you staring at the jedi temple. Look. I don\u2019t care who you ally with. Jedi or sith. I mean what I say. I\u2019ll be there no matter who you become. She said. \u2026\u2026I know, it\u2019s just\u2026.. What would you do if you had the force? You said. I\u2019d do what I feel is right. She said. I just don\u2019t want to regret the decision I made later. You said. Rey picks you up and place you in her hand. Tyne. Do what you think is right. I don\u2019t care who you pick. I\u2019ll be there with you and by your side. End of story. She said. \u2026\u2026What I think is right\u2026.. Ok. Thanks, Rey. You said. Don\u2019t mention it. She said as she hugs you. She walks to the bed and gives you a few kisses. I love you. She said. I love you as well. You said.</span></div></div>",

This time, when you try to get from under her, her hand closes around you and a smile forms on her face. This girl is getting smart. You said. She brings you to her lips and start kissing you. Ok. Are you really asleep? You said. Maybe.... She said as she open her eyes. Didn\u2019t you want to go to the jedi temple? You said. I\u2019m in no rush. I\u2019m on cloud nine right now. She said as she pulls you to her chest and hold you there. So this is true happiness? I don\u2019t want it to end. She said. Hearing her slow, rhythmic heartbeat makes you feel at ease. So does that mean the search is off? You said. I\u2019m so tempted. I have someone who actually cares for me. Enough to consider me his wife. But we already started. Might as well keep going. She said. Rey gets up and places you on the bed. She takes some time getting dressed and undo her ponytails to lets her hair down. Ready? She said. Waiting on you. You said. Rey picks you up and tucks you away. She heads to the nearest taxi speeder and flies to the jedi temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speeder gets to the jedi temple and Rey hops out. So this is the jedi temple\u2026.. Seen better days. She said. Rey walks up the steps and enters the temple. The inside\u2019s no better. Destroyed pillars, staircases, lightsaber marks, blaster bolts. It was warzone. She said. Rey pulls you out. Just as bad as I thought it would be. Order 66 was no joke. You said. This place is massive. It could take a while to search this place. She said. I think we should split up to cover more ground. You said. What? She said. I know what you\u2019re thinking, but this place drives people away. Nothing bad will happen here. Plus\u2026. I want to see for myself how the jedi lived. You said. Is it even safe for you to walk around here? She said. I\u2019ll be fine. Trust me. You said. \u2026\u2026I better see you again. I didn\u2019t lose you to the exchange, I\u2019m not going to lose you to this temple. She said. I don\u2019t plan on dying in this temple. You said. Rey gives you a quick kiss for good luck and places you on the ground. I\u2019ll go this way. You said. I\u2019ll head upstairs. She said. You leave each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze through the small gap in the wall. This looks like a training room. So this is where they spar at. You said. You see some weapons that are old and rusted. I\u2019ve seen these before. Force pikes. Usually seen among riot troops. Guess the jedi used them for the newcomers to practice with. You said. You move onto another part of the temple. Hmmm. This looks like where the member of the jedi council sat. All of them masters and very proficient. You said. As you look around, you hear a voice. Tyne\u2026.. It said. The voice sounded raspy, but powerful. Huh? Rey? Is that you? You said. No answer. I swear I just heard my name called. You said. You look around, but see nothing of interest and leave. You come into a big room with statues of jedi. These must past jedi. Like from the old days from the Galactic republic. You said. You look at each statue. Fine detail and craftsman work. Too bad it\u2019s all crumbling down. If there is anything of value, then it wouldn\u2019t be here. You said. Tyne\u2026.. The voice said. What the hell, Rey? You said. No response. If you\u2019re playing a game on me, it\u2019s not funny! You said. You look around and see nothing, until you hear footsteps. You turn around to see Rey, but she looks\u2026.different. Rey. You said. She\u2019s wearing the same clothes, but they\u2019re black and her facial expression\u2026. It\u2019s hard. Like she can\u2019t smile even if she tried. Something\u2019s\u2026.not right here. Rey. What happened to you? You said. She reaches for something on her side and you know what it is. She activates a lightsaber. You found one that works, but why is it red? You said. She says nothing as she starts running to you. You jump out of the way as slams her lightsaber into the ground. Hey! What\u2019s wrong with you?! Why are you- Wait. This feeling\u2026. A feeling of anger and hate. And those yellow eyes. You said. Rey pulls her lightsaber out from the ground. You\u2026. You\u2019re not the Rey I know! You said. She runs at you again, but you force push her away. (What\u2019s going on?) You thought. Rey starts an imposing walk to you. (I can\u2019t physically fight her. She\u2019d slaughter me. Wait. Her lightsaber. I can use that.) You thought. You jump back when she tries to stomp you. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into you, but I\u2019m not going to make this easy for you. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs at you and you force push her back. She lands on her feet and holds out her hand. Your head feels hazy. Can\u2019t\u2026.think straight. You said. Everything starts to spin around. (Calm\u2026.yourself.) You thought. You calm your mind and the woozy feeling goes away just in time for you to see Rey is in the air with her lightsaber pointed down. You throw a piece of a statue at her and hit her. She hits the ground hard, but gets back up with an angry look. Not easy as you thought? You said. Your feet leave the ground and you are pulled into her hand. Not good. You said. She tightens her grip on you. (Just like last time, she\u2019s trying to pop me like a grape. If this keeps up, she will.) You thought. She puts her thumb under your chin and starts pushing upward. (Sh\u2026.She\u2019s trying to pop my head off!) You thought. You had to think of something, but there was nothing you could do. You couldn\u2019t get your arms free. As you were racking your brain to form some plan, you felt a tingling in your hand. Like lightning. Acting quickly, You send a jolt through her and the shock makes her drop you on the ground. Seeing the lightning raging in your hands, you electrocute her. She stumbles backwards. (If she just throws her lightsaber\u2026.) You thought. To stop you, Rey throws her lightsaber at you. Yes! You said.  You use the force to stop it and throw it right back at her. She was ready to catch it, but you electrocute her to stop her. While stunned, the saber hits her right in the heart. She looks at you with an intense hateful look before she falls over and disappears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take in some deep breaths. I\u2026won. But what was that? Was that a vision of her in the future? An alternate timeline? You said. You look at your hands to see small sparks of lightning move between your fingers. Force lightning\u2026. I always dreamed of doing that, but now\u2026. You said. With your new force power, you continue moving through the temple.</span></div></div>",

You look at some pages on the ground, but most of them are unreadable from years of dust. As you walk around, you take in the battle damage. This library was completely trashed. I\u2019m surprised the floor is still holding. You said. You try to find some readable pages or books, but they are all destroyed or unreadable. Not getting anything from here. You said. You leave. You walk the beaten halls of the temple. Nothing of use. I wonder if Rey had an easier time? You said. From your exploration of the temple, you get a good feel for the jedi. I guess with all the books, training, and force use, I can see why the jedi acted all high and mighty. Some even looked down their noses on common people. You said. You stop to look at the sprawling city. This place wouldn\u2019t be bad to live. You said. You then hear footsteps. You look to see Rey walking the halls. She has a lightsaber on her waist. \u2026..Lucky. ( Rey.) You said telepathically. Tyne! You\u2019re not going to believe what a found. She said.(A lightsaber?) You said. Yes! I found it hidden in a crevice in the wall. It works too. Where are you? She said. (You just walked pass me. I\u2019m on a ledge.) You said. Rey doubles back and comes to you. So this lightsaber\u2026. You said. Rey pulls out the lightsaber and activates it. A blue one. You said. Yeah. Watch. She said. Rey takes a few swings with it. And is surprisingly great with it. Good, right? She said. Yeah. You moved like you used one before. You said. I think that\u2019s years of using a staff. Hey, if I was a jedi, what kind do you think I\u2019d be? She said. Well, I heard the color of the lightsaber represented what kind of jedi. Yellow meant sentential, green meant consular, and blue meant guardian. Given how you\u2019re protective of me and others, I\u2019d say a guardian. You seek out the evil and take it out. You said. I guess I would. She said as she holsters her lightsaber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, did you find anything? She said. Nothing, but some unreadable books and statues of old jedi. You? You said. The archives were heavily damage, but I manage to find some records of people. She said. And? You said. I used the holoterminal in the archives and there was one jedi who stood out. Her name was Kerrryn Nel. She was a jedi knight who left the order to marry a man named Vessker Deabenk. The two meet when she was on a diplomatic mission. He was an adviser to the king of that planet. She said. Hmm. Maybe they named you Rey because you where there \"Rey\" of sunshine or something. You said. Very funny. The last known record of them was on Dantooine. She said. Do they keep records on all of the jedi? You said. Apparently. The archives were huge. It would take an analyst years to sort through it all. She said. So our next stop is Dantooine? You said. Yeah. She said. You and Rey leave the jedi temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ride back, you process what you saw back in the temple. That\u2026.thing back at the temple it was Rey\u2026. But it was like her filled with anger and rage. The kind you\u2019d only see in a sith lord. Red lightsaber, force, anger, and death grip. You said. You look up at Rey. Rey\u2026. A sith lord? She\u2019s too nice and caring for that, but\u2026.. What happened back on that cruiser. She did that with a straight face. Yet I didn\u2019t stop her. So I guess I\u2019m to blame for that. You said. The intense look flashes in your eyes. Did the temple showed me that to warn me? Rey\u2019s going down a dark path? You said. You feel Rey\u2019s finger poke you to make sure you are still in her cleavage. (Should I tell her? Everyone has a choice, including me. I don\u2019t want to stop her from doing what she wants, but\u2026. If the Rey I saw in the temple is an indication of what\u2019s to come, then what pushed her to it?) You thought. As you were thinking, the speeder come to a stop. Rey gets out and heads to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo city life\u2026.. Think you could adjust? You said. I think I\u2019ll do just fine. We\u2019re just missing the endless hoard of sandpeople. But this place is beautiful. A lot of things happened because of you. I never thought of getting out of Jakku and living in a deluxe apartment on Coruscant in the upper parts. She said. I didn\u2019t plan on any of this happening. You said. Well planned or not, I\u2019m happy we meet. And since we tied the knot, we\u2019ll be happy together. She said. She kisses you, but this time she licks you with her tongue during the kiss. When she breaks it, all you could do was give a smile. I want to thank you for being here with me through all this. She said. Well, it was either that or stay on Jakku in an empty, destroyed AT-AT. Ah, I couldn\u2019t let you do this alone. Not after all you\u2019ve done for me. Plus\u2026..i had a soft spot for sad girls. Can\u2019t stand to see a girl sad. You said. And that\u2019s the thing. You\u2019re always thinking of me. Making me happy and all and not asking one thing in return. Ever since we first meet, you thought of me. She said. I\u2019m not fishing for favors or anything. I\u2019m just being me. And\u2026.you have a cute smile. You said. Stop it. She said with a red face. As long as you\u2019re happy, I\u2019m fine. I get your love and compassion. More than enough for me. I don\u2019t want you jumping through hoops for me just because I\u2019m no bigger than your thumb. You care for me, I care for you. You said. I know. She said as you jump onto her hand. Don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m happy to be with you. And whatever makes you smile makes me happy. You said. You know, I couldn\u2019t ask for a better person. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, we aren\u2019t leaving just yet. Why don\u2019t we enjoy ourselves while we\u2019re here, and find you a place that serves food. You must be starved. You said just as her stomach rumbles. Wow, that timing. You said. I\u2019m up for it. Let\u2019s go. She said. Rey places you in her cleavage and pats you down. Comfy? She said. You give a thumbs up and with a smile, she leaves.</span></div></div>",

(You sure about this place? It doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019d be accepted.) You said telepathically. Yeah. Let\u2019s see how the 1% of this planet indulge. Just do your thing, and anyone says anything out of line, I\u2019ll deal with them. She said. (Ok.) You said. Rey walks up to the door and the usher lets her in after you \u201cpersuade\u201d him. Rey is seated at one of the tables. She quickly pulls you out and covers you with her hand. So this is how rich people dine? She said. More or less. It\u2019s all about who you know. If you\u2019re friends with a influential politician, all door open for you on this planet. Or if you have the credits, you can buy in. You said. That simple, huh? She said. In theory, it is. Credits come and go on this planet like the wind. And as for politicians, they wouldn\u2019t be caught dead with common people. Why do you think they stay on the top level of Coruscant. You said. Rey tucks you away just as a waiter comes up. I\u2019ll try\u2026..this. She said. The waiter nods and leaves and Rey pulls you back out. So how\u2019s fine dining? You said. I feel\u2026.out of place. A club or cantina, yeah. But a high-class place like this, not even in my dreams. She said. Try to enjoy yourself. If someone gives you a hard time, let me know. I\u2019ll make them treat you with the utmost. You said. After a few minutes, the waiter gives Rey her food. Hey. I\u2019ve seen this on Naboo. Must be imported. You said. Whatever it is, it\u2019s good! She said. Don\u2019t forget to breath. You said. Rey hands you a few pieces as she eats. Damn. You want seconds? You said. No. I\u2019m stuffed. She said.  Rey gets up and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both explore Coruscant and its beauties until nighttime. Ok. I got one. Would you have sold me the minute you saw me? You said. That depends. How much? She said. Credits to buy out a planet and still enough to for generations. You said. Yes. She said. Wow. You said that quickly. You said. Come on. Wouldn\u2019t you want to help out a down on her luck scavenger? She said. Don\u2019t you use those puppy eyes on me. You said. Rey giggles at you being worked up. I\u2019m just joking. You\u2019re a person, not a thing. She said. So you wouldn\u2019t? You said. Not at first. She said. Rey! You said. Hahaha. Kidding, kidding! She said. Rey kisses you. Better? She said. I\u2019m not so sure\u2026. She said. Rey gives you a more passionate kiss. Now? She said. You\u2019re forgiven. You said quickly. Now. Let\u2019s enjoy the nightlife. She said. Rey hops into her speeder and drives it to the Uscru Entertainment District. Rey walks until she comes to the Outlander\u2019s club. They rebuilt it after the CIS\u2019s bold attack. You said. Rey walks in and sits at the bar. Keep \u2018em coming till I say enough. She said. Rey gets her drink and downs it in one go. Rey had multiple drinks and was still able to see and talk straight. Rey, what\u2019s your tolerance? You said. Let\u2019s just say this isn\u2019t my first-time drinking. She said. Drown your sorrows? You said. More than you know. She said. Rey eventually goes to do some gambling and comes out on top with seven thousand credits. I can\u2019t believe it. You were up against high rollers and professionals and still came out with the winning. You said. With a little help from a certain someone. She said as she pats your head. I thought they knew you were cheating and were going to start shooting. You said. But they didn\u2019t. And we\u2019re walking away with their credits. She said. You and Rey spend more time in the club until Rey calls it a night and heads back to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey walks into her apartment with you in her hand. So you wouldn\u2019t become a dancer? You said. I have dignity. Dancing half naked with my butt out in front of strangers? Let the twiliks do that. She said. There\u2019s a lot of credits.  More there than scavenging. You said. I\u2019ll live in my AT-AT for eternity before someone sees me swinging my body like that. She said. I see you like that. You said. That\u2019s different. You know how I feel about you. She said before kissing you. What was that for? You said. For an excellent night. I\u2019ve never lived like that before. She said. Anytime. If it\u2019s ok with you, I\u2019m going to hit the sack. I\u2019ll see you in the morning. You said. You jump from her hand onto the soft bed and head to the pillow and go to sleep. While you were sleeping, Rey stepped out on the balcony to practice with her lightsaber. After some time passed, Rey come back in, takes a shower and lays right next to you. He looks so cute. She said. Rey gives you a kiss on the head. I know I thanked him, but I don\u2019t think I can thank him enough. I know I sort of pushed him, but he didn\u2019t hold it against me. I just wanted a friend and he did just that. He didn\u2019t see me as some threatening giant or some lonely scavenger. He saw me just as a friend. So much so that he asked me to\u2026..be his. We might have bad times together, but we\u2019ll pull through. She said. Rey was rubbing you with her finger gently and gave you a soft kiss. I wish I could return you to normal size. But I love you any size you are. I know you have force powers, but I\u2019ll still protect you. I won\u2019t let anything or anyone hurt you. She said. Rey\u2026.. Like this? You said in your sleep. Heh heh. And what is that, I wonder? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dreaming of you and Rey collecting scrap together. You were at your normal height and Rey was showing you how to strip an AT-ST. Like this? You said. You pull off a piece of the head armor. Just like that. You\u2019re doing great. She said. I have the perfect teacher. You said before kissing her. Rey was watching you talk in your sleep, causing her to laugh. Must be a very good dream. She said. Rey brings you closer to snuggle you against her check. Rey then feels you hugging her check. Your hug made Rey smile. Sweet dreams, Tyne. She said. </span></div></div>",

Tyne, wake up. She said. T\u2026.ten more\u2026.minutes, mom\u2026.. The\u2026.empire can\u2026.wait. You said. So cute. But we can\u2019t stay anymore. She said. Rey licks you with her tongue and you jump up. What!? Who!? Oh\u2026. Rey. D\u2026Did you just lick me? You said. Mmmmaybe. She said. I\u2019m covered in saliva and only one person can do that to me. You said. Ok, you got me. I need to wake you up. She said. Well, I\u2019m up now. You said. Rey gets dressed and head to her ship. Ready to see if you\u2019re the daughter of a jedi? You said. I guess\u2026. If I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m more than happy with you. She said. So you\u2019re calling it off? You said. \u2026\u2026No. I want to know why. What were they doing that required them to leave their daughter alone on an inhospitable planet? She said. You can sense a bit of anger in her. Then you remember what you saw in the temple. Tyne? Tyne! Rey said. Huh, what? You said. You spaced out on me? Something wrong? She said. No. I\u2019m good. Let\u2019s go. You said. Rey sits in the pilot set, starts the ship and flies it into space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rey was flying the ship, you are in thought. (Should I tell her what I saw in the temple? Would she even believe me? She has a right to know, but\u2026.) You thought. (Stop her\u2026.) a voice said. (The voice\u2026. It\u2019s back. But I\u2019m not in the jedi temple.) You thought. (Don\u2019t let her find them\u2026. Too great\u2026. )It said. (Them? Her parents? And too great what?) You said. No response. (Damn voice\u2026.) You thought. In serious thought, you didn\u2019t notice Rey was looking at you. Tyne. Tyne! She said. What? You said. You look troubled. What\u2019s wrong? She said. N\u2026..Nothing. You said. Rey puts the ship on autopilot, picks you up and holds you at eye level. Talk. She said. I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s nothing. You said. I can tell when you\u2019re troubled. You go silent and don\u2019t look at me. What is it? She said. It\u2019s nothing to worry about. You said. When there\u2019s something wrong with you, then it is something to worry about. Do I get mad or annoyed when you tell me something? She said. No. You said. Then just tell me. I won\u2019t be mad or anything. If there is a problem, I want to help. She said as she rubs your head. \u2026..When we were in the jedi temple, something was in there with me. You said. What was it? What happened? She said. There was a voice that called me, but there was nobody around. Not until I saw\u2026. I can\u2019t say. You said. Tyne, I won\u2019t be angry. You are my husband. I don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to you. I don\u2019t like it when something happens to you. I want to know so I can help. Just\u2026. Please Tyne. What is it that has you like this? She said with a concern look. (Mom\u2026\u2026 You\u2019d be proud of me for having Rey as my wife.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I saw was\u2026..you. You said. Me?! She said. I don\u2019t know what, but you were in there with me, but your whole persona was just dark and angry. You had the force and a red lightsaber and you\u2026.. You said. What? What did \u201cI\u201d do? She said. You\u2026..tried to kill me. You said. WHAT!? She said stunned. You just came at me. You were almost successful except..... You said. You show Rey the lightning. Tyne. When did you learn that? She said. Back in the temple. If it wasn\u2019t for this\u2026. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be here right now. You said. T\u2026.Tyne. She said. I still trust you, but I don\u2019t know why that you was shown to me. You were just\u2026.full of anger. Like you became a sith lord. You said. Me\u2026. A sith lord!? She said. That\u2019s what got me in deep thought. You said. Rey remains silent for a few seconds. Why didn\u2019t you tell me this then? She said. I\u2026.didn\u2019t know if it was a trick or actual. But given how you were before we left\u2026. You said. I know I\u2019m not perfect, but being how you describe\u2026. She said. Like I said, I don\u2019t know. It could have been just a trick or it could be reality. You said. Do you think it will be me? She said. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never experience something like this. I wanted to wait and see. You said. Rey sits you down in the co-pilot seat. Tyne. We\u2019re in this together. So next time something happens when I\u2019m not around, I want to know. Ok? She said. Got it. You\u2019ll be the first. You said. Rey gets up and leaves. Don\u2019t know if I made this better or worse. You said. You were waiting for Rey to come back when the ship arrives at Dantooine. We\u2019re here, but Rey is still gone. Did I upset her that much? You said. You sit there for a few minutes and Rey still hasn\u2019t come back. You jump down and go through the ship and find her in the cargo hold and sitting on a metal box. She looks downtrodden. I need to make this right. You said. You go to her and jump onto her boot. You start climbing up her leg and make it to her knee. You jump onto her arm, walk up her arm and jump up on her shoulder. You head to her face and touch her cheek. Tyne? When did you get in here? She said. A few minutes ago. You said. How\u2019d you get right there? She said. I climbed you. You said you always wanted me to. I wanted to set this straight before we land. You said. Rey smiles, but she gets a serious look after a few seconds. You jump onto her hand and she strokes your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, if I came on a little too strong back there, I\u2019m sorry. What you said sort of shocked me to the core. She said. I didn\u2019t want to say anything until I found out if that was really going to be you. You said. I know, I know. Your heart was in the right place. But I\u2019m here as well. No need to shoulder all the weight. She said. I didn\u2019t want to jump to conclusions and stopping you from what you want. You said. What I want is you and me to be happy together. That\u2019s what all I truly want. She said. So you don\u2019t hold it against me? You said. I never did. You were just thinking about me as usual. She said. It\u2019s what I do best. You said. Rey smiles and gives you a kiss. I can handle myself, but having someone watching out for me is alright. She said. She gives you another kiss. You and me, Tyne. She said. Wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. The ship landed on Dantooine. You want to go now, or brood some more? You said. I\u2019ve done enough of that. She said. Rey gets up from the box. Let\u2019s go find Kerrryn. She said. </span></div></div>",

We could ask them. You said. Got to start somewhere. She said. Rey walks up to the door and knocks. After a few seconds, a middle-aged woman opens the door the door. Yes? She said. Sorry to bother you, but do you know a Kerrryn Nel? Rey said. That\u2019s me. She said. I have something to ask you. You married a man named Deabenk, didn\u2019t you? Rey said. I did. Except he died a few years ago. She said. And did you have a child? Rey said. I did. Her name was\u2026. Rey? She said surprised. (Jackpot.) You thought. Hello, mother. Rey said. The last time I saw you was Jakku. And you were just a toddler. But that was years ago. Kerrryn said. Yeah. Being left alone for years, you tend to grow. You and dad left me all alone on a desert planet. Rey said as she walks in. You didn\u2019t even leave me a holocom as to why. She said. Rey. It\u2019s not what it seems. She said. Then explains this! She said. Rey shows Kerrryn the holo. You sure it was the right thing to do? Leaving her? Kerrryn said. Not like we had a choice. She\u2019s better off. Deabenk said. But just because- Keep quiet! They could be listening. Deabenk said. I\u2019ve wondered for years why I was left alone. Not even a holocom to let me know why. What was so damn serious that it required me to be left alone!? Rey said. It\u2019s not like\u2026..we wanted to leave you. We\u2026just didn\u2019t have a choice. Kerrryn said. Everybody has a choice. Answer my question. Rey said. Jedi aren\u2019t allowed to have children. After order 66, we thought Palpatine\u2019s assassins would come for us. Even after his death, they would still come after us. She said. That was long before you had me. Don\u2019t you dare give me lies! Rey said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, ok.... I'll tell you. Kerrryn said.

We knew what that meant. Bounty hunters from all over would pour into Jakku. We knew what to do. We had to leave Jakku. Kerrryn said. And why didn\u2019t you take me? Rey said. We wanted to. We really did, but\u2026.. She said. But what!? What kept you from taking your only child with you!? Rey said. We didn\u2019t have enough credits for a third. She said. So that\u2019s why? You left me on that planet because of some credits?! You couldn\u2019t have mind trick the person? You are a jedi, aren\u2019t you? Rey said. Your father thought that was a good idea. You\u2019d have a chance to live your own life. No fear of someone wanting to shoot you. She said. Did you ever think how that would affect me? Years alone. Growing up in a gutted AT-AT, no one caring for you, having to live by the skin of your teeth. Did that ever cross your mind?! Rey said. We didn\u2019t think we\u2019d hide long. At most, 4 years. But the bounty hunters kept finding us. She said. You had me think not a single soul cared for me. I was alone for so long until someone came into my life and was my friend. Now, we\u2019re married. She said. Married?! Where is he? She said. Rey pulls you out and shows you to her mother. I\u2026Is that a\u2026.. Kerrryn said. Yeah, I\u2019m thumb sized, but my heart is bigger than yours will ever be. You said. His name is Tyne. He\u2019s showed me what love and care really is. Rey said. How\u2019d he\u2026.get so small? Kerrryn said. I\u2019m not the one who needs to be questioned here. I heard everything. Credits, bounty hunters, all of it. You\u2019re a mother. You\u2019re suppose to care and protect your child. Being a jedi, that should be easy. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not\u2026..as easy as you think. She said. Really? I can be carried in someone\u2019s pocket, but multiple times I\u2019ve put myself in danger to protect Rey. You said. Even when I protect him, he comes to protect me. Something you are supposed  to do. Rey said. We were thinking about you. This was just the best way we could. Kerryn said. Leaving a child on a desert planet by herself with no relatives or no guardian is the best!? I think Rey would have taken her chances on the bounty hunters.  I would have. Were you that scared? Rey said. We didn\u2019t want you killed over a bounty on me. Kerrryn said. A jedi can\u2019t take down some 2 bit bounty hunter? You said. You don\u2019t understand. These are people who- You cut her off by eletrocuting at her. Don\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t understand! I know what it\u2019s like to be hunted! I didn\u2019t leave Rey high and dry like you did! You said. Tyne, there\u2019s no need for- Kerrryn extends her arm and you are pushed out of Rey\u2019s hand and into the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyne! Rey said worried. I\u2019m\u2026.ow. You said. You\u2019re married to a sith? Kerrryn said. I\u2019m no sith, but I\u2019m far from being one of you cowardly, hypocritical jedi. You said. I did what was right. If I didn\u2019t, Rey wouldn\u2019t even made it to her 13th birthday! She said. You don\u2019t know that. The only thing you know is how to abandon your child. I bet you didn\u2019t even love Rey in the first place. You said. If I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have her. I thought of my baby for years. You have no right to- Rey cuts her off by holding her lightsaber to Kerrryn\u2019s neck. R\u2026Rey? She said. Not another step forward. Rey said. Rey\u2026. Just put it down. No need for something hasty. She said. Let me tell you something. Anyone who touches him, deals with me. I will not let anyone, not even you, hurt him. Rey said. Ok. I won\u2019t. Just put the lightsaber away. Kerrryn said. You get to your feet. You alright? Rey said as you jump onto her hand. I\u2019m fine. What do you want to do about this excuse for a mother? You said. I don\u2019t have a mother. No mother does this to her child. Especially a mother who is a jedi. Why didn\u2019t you get rid of me on day one? She said. All life is sacred to a jedi. She said. More hypocrisy. You said. Apparently, my life wasn\u2019t sacred enough to you to be in it. Hope running was worth losing a daughter. Rey said before storming out.</span></div></div>",

All came flowing out. She said. If I knew you were going to be like this, I wouldn\u2019t have pushed this. You said. No. It\u2019s not your fault. For years i\u2019ve wondered why. I had the chance to find them and I took it. Now I know why. She said. You know. The worst thing about looking for something is finding it. You said. It really is. I mean. Over a small amount credits, my parents left me alone on Jakku for years. And for what? Assassins? Bounty hunters? I would have respected her a lot more if she said they just abandon me. She said. As Rey was ranting, you notice a few things start lifting off the ground. And it\u2019s not you doing it. Uh\u2026.Rey? You said. Leaving me by myself was the best protection they could thing of? Who thinks that? She said. Rey\u2026. You said. I learned how to fight and handle a blaster, but still. Aren\u2019t parents suppose to think of their kids first?! Rey said. You see more things start getting lifted into the air. Rey. You said. How do you come to the decision \u201cLeaving my only child on a desert planet by herself is the best way.\u201d ? How!? She said. Rey! You shout. Huh? She said as the things drop. Rey looks to see some things out of place. Tyne. Where you doing that? She said. No. You were. You said. Me? She said. As you were venting, things started floating. You said. How? Unless\u2026. She said. You\u2019re force sensitive. You said. Force\u2026.sensitive? Like you? She said. One way to find out. Try using the force on me. You said. You said. You sure about that? She said. Yeah. Go on. You said. Rey holds out her hand and you are pulled into her hand. So you are force sensitive. You said. I\u2026I can\u2019t believe it. But\u2026.. why now? She said. I guess your pent up emotions pushed them into the open. You said. Well at least one good thing came out of this? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. We found your mother. A can of worms, if I have my say. Where do we go from here? For starters, let\u2019s get of this damn rock. She said. Rey powers up the ship and flies into space. Rey puts on the autopilot and puts her head in her hands. Do you want to be alone for a while? You said. \u2026..I like to. Nothing against you. I just want to process this on my own for now. She said. As you say. You said. You jump from the co-pilot seat and go through the sliding doors. You head to the cargo hold and sit against a metal box. So Rey\u2019s a force user as well. And I thought me being a force user was shocking. You said. You sit there counting the minutes go by until Rey walks in. Tyne? She said. Over here. You said. Rey sees you and sits by you. You jump onto her leg then into her open hand. So how was your brooding? You said. As good as any other time. I don\u2019t want to be like mother. If that\u2019s what being a jedi is, then they can have it. She said. Can\u2019t say I blame you. You said. You were right. The sith are bad, but they are at least honest with themselves. She said. Can\u2019t take that away from them. Horrible, but truthful people. You said. What about you? You came to a decision? She said. After what I learned about the jedi, that\u2019s out the window. I\u2019m not giving up my emotion, feelings, and passion just because they don't like them. You said. Becoming a husk? I\u2019ll pass too. She said. And sith? You said. The lesser evil is still evil. She said. It is\u2026. Maybe we don\u2019t have to be either. Just two people living their lives. Not associated with either. You said. I don\u2019t know. I feel\u2026.like I can be something more than just that. She said. Like? You said. I don\u2019t know. I just\u2026.feel it deep down. She said. Well, you said you don\u2019t want to be a jedi or sith. What do you want to be? You said. I never said I didn\u2019t want to be a sith. I just said the lesser evil is still evil. She said. I\u2019m\u2026..not following here. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sith are bad, but like we said, they\u2019re honest about themselves. They don\u2019t hide their feeling or anything. They use it as fuel. And with how we feel for each other, I think I can be just that. She said. \u2026\u2026I won\u2019t stop you if you want to, but are you positive about becoming a sith? You\u2019d be throwing everything you stood for away. You said. I gave it a lot of thought. I want to be able to protect and love you with everything I have. If I did become a jedi, I\u2019d fall of the path sooner or later. Turning off and hiding my emotions isn\u2019t something I can do. She said. I can hold my own, but if you\u2019re absolute about this, then i won\u2019t say anything. You said. I know what you\u2019re doing. If you don\u2019t want me too. Just say so. She said. I don\u2019t want to stop you from doing what you want. You have a choice like everybody else. Plus, You\u2019re headstrong. So you\u2019d do it anyway. Rey laughs a little. I have been called that before. And it\u2019s true. But I still want your two credits worth. She said. I just don\u2019t think being sith suits us. You said. Electrocuting my mother? That\u2019s pretty sith. She said. I\u2019ll admit. I got angry at her. You said. You killed that woman after she did what you said. Rey said. I don\u2019t like chances. You said. And I killed that exchange lady in anger. We\u2019re pretty much on the path of sith. She said. But there\u2019s a lot more to being sith than just anger. Technique, knowledge, fighting, mental work, and all that. You want to commit to that? You said. I don\u2019t want you to do anything you\u2019re uncomfortable with. She said. Is that why you haven\u2019t used me the way you really want? You said. Good thing you\u2019re cute, or I would. She said. And don\u2019t you forget it. You said. Well since you so cute and all\u2026.. Rey said. She gives you a prolong kiss. Couldn\u2019t help myself! She said. No arguments here. You said. Rey walks back to the pilot seat and takes off the autopilot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026.. If you\u2019re serious about being sith, then there\u2019s one last place we need to go to. You said. I know what you\u2019re thinking. Plotting a course now. Strap in. She said.</span></div></div>",

The only thing on that planet are tombs of sith lords and vicious animals waiting to kill. You said. Basically, like home. Nice to know. She said. Rey flies the ship to an old landing pad. Rey picks you up. I don\u2019t think there is a need to hide you while we\u2019re here. Is my shoulder alright with you? She said. Well, I\u2019ll miss my companions, but a change of scenery is good. You said. Rey puts you on her shoulder and heads out to the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. It is a dead planet. She said. But there is a lot of darkness here. And creatures. You said. This landing pad looks like it hasn\u2019t been used in years. Surprised it didn\u2019t cave in. She said. Rey starts her trek. She walks for a long time until coming across the sith academy. We\u2019re here. Finally. Rey said. Rey sits on one of the steps to rest for a bit. You ok? You said. I\u2019m fine. And I thought walking through the desert was horrible. She said. You walked through the desert of Jakku? You said. Got lost on my way to the outpost. Six hours in blistering heat. Good thing I had overtook on water. She said. Rey starts to take off her boot and massage her feet. The terrain here is killer. At least it isn\u2019t hot. She said. As she was doing that, you were looking at the academy. A state of disrepair. The sith build their stuff to last. You said. Tyne, could you give me a hand, please? She said. Alright. She said. Rey lifts you up and plants you in front of her feet. From her sole down was your part and Rey did the upper part. Sorry if they smell. She said. The smell wasn\u2019t something to hurl over, but it was noticeable. It took a few minutes, but you finish helping Rey ease the tension in her feet. Thanks, Tyne. I owe you. She said. Don\u2019t mention it. Anything to make you feel better. You said. Could you\u2026.do what you did last time? She said while blushing. What? Kiss them? You said. Just this once? I won\u2019t ask again. She said. I\u2019ll do it. All you have to do is ask. You said. You start planting a few kisses on her feet. Mmm. Thanks. She said. You do this for a minute until Rey lifts you into her hands. Again, Thanks, Tyne. She said. No problem. Anything for you. You said. Give me some time. I\u2019ll repay you somehow. She said. You don\u2019t need to. You said. But I want to. She said. If you insist. You said. Rey kisses you and puts you back on her shoulder. She puts her boots back on and heads inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot better on the outside. You said. It\u2019s like a war erupted in here. Did they turn on each other? She said. Common among them. You said. Rey walks through the academy and comes across a meditation chamber. Looks like a room to meditate. You said. Sith meditate? Rey said. It deepens your connection to the force. Or so I heard. Give it a try. You said. Rey gets on both her knees and sets you down on the ground. Don\u2019t leave my side. She said. Rey closes her eyes and meditates. After a few second, you feel something. I\u2026.is that\u2026.Rey? I can\u2026feel her through the force. You said. Then you feel something powerful. N\u2026.No way. H\u2026.Her connection to the force is exceptionally. There\u2019s something\u2026..deep. Deep inside her. And it\u2019s strong. You said. You see her lips move, but no words are coming out. Then there is a huge repulse from Rey that cracks the ground and sends you into the wall. You manage to get up, but slowly from the pain soaring through your body. Rey gets up and sees you in hunched over. She pulls you onto her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurt? She asked concern. I\u2019m\u2026.fine. You said. Liar. She said. Rey covers you with her hand and uses the force to heal you. A soothing feeling washes over you. Ahhh. You said. Rey removes her hand. Better? She said. Yeah. Thanks for that. Guess I owe you one too. You said. Your love is more than enough for me. She said. Not enough in my eyes. I\u2019ll figure something out. You said. Tyne\u2026. Alright. Just make sure it doesn\u2019t strain you. She said. It won\u2019t but\u2026.. What was all that about? You said. While I was meditating, I heard this voice. It told me the sith code. She said. The sith have a code? You said. Yeah. I said it over and over. I feel\u2026..liberated. Like I can do anything I want. She said. Anything? Uh\u2026.Sure. You said. Rey still senses your nervousness. Tyne. I don\u2019t want you scared of me. Nothing will change between us. I protected you before, I\u2019ll protect now. I promise. I love you more than anything. She said. Back at you. You said. Rey holds you gently against her chest. You\u2019re the only one who stayed by me. Only one to care for me. Which is all I wanted. You took it a step further and asked for my hand in marriage. You\u2019re\u2026..precious to me. I won\u2019t let anyone or anything take you from me. I\u2019ll see this galaxy burn before that happens. She said. That sounds like a nice anniversary gift. You said. She gives you a kiss and put you back on her shoulder. Now let\u2019s see what else this place has to offer. She said.</span></div></div>",

If I\u2019m right, these holocrons are stored with the knowledge of past powerful sith lords. You said. All of these? She said. Pretty much. You said. Rey grabs a red, triangular holocron. How do these things work? She said. Rey\u2019s eyes shoot open as the holocron starts to glow bright and she goes stiff. Rey? You said. She doesn\u2019t say anything as she stares at it. After a few seconds, she comes back to and drops the holocron. T\u2026.Tyne? She said. Right here. What happen? You said. I\u2026it showed me\u2026.. everything about the sith. She said. It did? What did it show? You said. The truth of the Sith. The hypocrisy of the jedi. She said. From just those few seconds, you learned the entire history of the sith from one holocron? You said. I\u2019m shocked as you. I didn\u2019t think so either. Who knows what all the other ones have in them? You try. She said. Rey picks up the holocron and brings you closer and you touch it and see the what Rey saw. After a few seconds, you let go of it. Well? She said. You were right. Everything is clear now. The sith are the way to go. You said. So I guess we chose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows what else are on these holocrons. Rey said. She grabs a green, rectangle holocron. It glows for a few seconds and then stop. What was on that one? You said. You are suddenly frozen in place. You can\u2019t move, but are aware of your surroundings. (What in the?) You thought. (It\u2019s alright. Don\u2019t be scared.) Rey said telepathically. (Rey? What did you do?) You said. (I just froze you in place. She said. (The holocron taught you this?) You said. (A whole lot of things. Let me unfreeze you, but first\u2026.) She said. Rey brought you closer to her lips and kiss you multiple times, and even licks you. (You\u2019re just so adorable like this!) She said. Rey holds up her hand and unfreezes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did it feel like? She said. I was aware of everything, but couldn\u2019t do anything. The holocron just showed you how to do that? You said. It\u2019s does. You get the knowledge of how to do it, but it takes practice to use it right. She said. And I was the test subject? You said. Sorry\u2026.. She said. Rey hugs you tightly. But now I can effectively keep you safe. She said. Rey\u2026. Ease up! You said. Oops! She said. Rey lets go. Let me try it. You said. Rey places you next to the holocron. You touch it and feel a surge of knowledge flow through you. You let go after a few seconds. Well? Rey said. Lightning rages in your hands and you shoot a bolt that chains from one holocron to the next. Nice. You said. With all these holocrons, you could be full fledge sith in no time. Just need to get you a red lightsaber. You said. Rey takes a few of the holocrons and heads back to the ship and flies into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Korriban was a nice. Where to now? You said. I\u2026.don\u2019t know. Kprriban was the last place I had in mind. She said. How about you take a look at those holocrons. I\u2019ll keep everything under control. You said. You sure? She said. Yeah. I\u2019ll call if something happens. You said. Rey puts the ship on auto and leaves with the holocrons. While she\u2019s gone, you monitor for any activity. Nothing but empty space. You said. You look at all the readings on the console. Fuel is at 60%. Efficient for being to a lot of places. Some weapon systems wouldn\u2019t be bad. I\u2019ll talk to Rey about it. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 30 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou monitor the readings when a blue light starts blinking on the console. An incoming holotransmission? From who? You said. You don\u2019t want to wake Rey up, so you decide to play it. On it, it\u2019s her mother. Rey\u2026.. I know I\u2019m the last person you want to see or hear from, but I want you to know that i still love you. If I could change how things were handled, I would. This wasn\u2019t the life I saw you would have. If you ever forgive me and want to talk, you know where to find me. She said. A little late for damage control, Kerrryn. You said. You continue your monitoring until you hear the sliding doors open. How are things up here? Rey said. Nothing happened. Did you fall asleep? You said. Processing all that information at once tires a person. She said as she sits in the pilot seat. Rey. A transmission came in from your mother. You said. Rey says nothing for a few seconds. She then deletes the message. She said all she had to. I don\u2019t want to hear any lies from her. I only have one person in this life I care for. She said. She\u2019s not worth the time. You weren\u2019t to her. You said. She had her chance. Now I only have one person in the galaxy I care about. She said. Rey lifts you up and places you in her hand. I know I\u2019ve said this before, but thank you for being with me. She said. I may not be related to you, but I keep my promises. I\u2019m not leaving you. Like you told me, I\u2019ll stay with you no matter what. And since we\u2019re husband and wife, that\u2019s eternal. You said. I love you so much right now. She said as she embraces you. You're important to me, Tyne. You're the only one who gave me the time of day. Actually showed me true love instead of what my mom showed me. I promise to you, the same promise you made to me on Naboo, I will not leave you. Ever. Until we either die or the whole galaxy comes to an end, I will not leave you. I will not let anyone harm you or take you from me. Death awaits those who touch you in a harmful way. A slow, agonizing death. She said. That promise..... It's double for me. My size doesn't matter to me. Anyone who harms you, dies by my hand. You said. Rey brings you to her lips and kiss you passionately. I love you. You both said. </span></div></div>",

She places you on the bed and slowly takes off each piece of clothing until she\u2019s bare naked. Like what you see, little guy? She said. Very. You said. Rey then starts to move her hips and does a sensual dance that would be seen done by Twelik dancers. Her movements are smooth and very coordinated. I thought you said you wouldn\u2019t do that. You said. I wouldn\u2019t. But for you, I\u2019ll do anything you want. She said. Rey crawls onto the bed and starts to undress and kisses you. My body wants you. She said. Rey lies down and places you on her right nipple. You know what to do. She said. You start to rub her nipple and Rey moans. As you were rubbing, Rey starts to finger herself and rub her other nipple; making her breath faster. Between your rubbing and her fingering, Rey is in ecstasy. Just as she climaxes, her eyes roll into the back of her head. Rey lays there panting and in bliss as you kiss her nipple until she picks you up. Now\u2026.it\u2019s my turn to please you.

Rey rubs her foot all over you, making you more excited. That\u2019s what I want. She said. With her toes, Rey sends you over the moon. Just when you were going to blow, Rey holds her foot over you. Not yet. I want to play more. She said. Rey then grabs you with her toes and sandwiches you between her feet. Hehehe! I got you! She said. Rey could feel little peaks being planted on both her feet. Ohhh! Someone is loving this more than me. She said. Rey rubs her feet together. There\u2019s only one way out, but I doubt you want out. She said. She does this for a few minutes until she feels something wet hit her foot multiple times. Heh heh. Somebody couldn\u2019t hold it. She said. Rey pulls her feet back to see the mess you made. So much for a small guy. She said. Rey takes her finger swipes up all you load of her foot and licks it off her finger clean. Delicious! She said. Rey then picks you up and licks you clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019re not done yet\u2026. I need you inside me right now! She said. Rey shoves you inside her pussy. You know what she wants, so you head deeper in; giving her more pleasure than herself. Rey\u2019s breathing became more and more rapid. You come to the sweet spot and agitate it. This causes Rey to a surge of arousal. AHHHHH! YES! I LOVE YOU! TYYYYYNE! She said as she climaxes. As you were listening to her shout your name, you are washed away and pushed out by her juices. Rey takes a minute to catch her breath before picking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2026.was\u2026.wonderful. I felt everything you did down there. You even came inside me. I\u2019m so full of your love. She said as she rubs her stomach. She dries you off and kisses you multiple times. She then holds you against her chest. I love you\u2026.. I will always love you.

Using the love between the two of you, you both strengthen your connection to the force, and deepening your love for each other. Rey had ditched her blue lightsaber for a red one. Using the anger she had over her parents just leaving her and how hypocritical the jedi are, Rey uses her anger to become a devastating force. Her talent with a lightsaber were unrivaled and her anger was infinite. Rey changed her clothes to light sith warrior clothes. She preferred to use her physical attacks over using her force powers, but if you were around her, she use them to keep you safe and heal you and herself. The only way you could hurt anybody was using the force, so you learned all the force powers you could. You honed your force powers to the max for great effect. You could mind trick an entire room of people at once and read their minds. You learned how to electrocute some just enough to shut down a person\u2019s nervous system without killing them. Your lightning was also intense enough to shut down lightsabers. Together, you both had nothing to fear and the galaxy to explore, but there was one thing you had to do first\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was your and Rey\u2019s anniversary. And you had something really special planned. Ok. Keep walking. And keep those eyes closed. You said. You guide Rey to the spot. You know how I feel about surprises, Tyne. She said. I know, but you\u2019re going to love this. I promise. You said. You don't have to do this, you know. I'm perfectly fine with you just remember our marriage. She said. That's not enough for you. You deserve to treated well. Ok. Now turn around and sit down. You said. Rey sits down on what feels like a throne. Ok. You can open them. You said. Rey opens her eyes to see she\u2019s in the palace on Naboo. Tyne? What are we doing in the palace? She said. It\u2019s you\u2019re anniversary gift. You\u2019re queen of Naboo now. You said. Wait. I\u2019m queen!?! She said. Yeah. You said. T\u2026..Tyne. How\u2019d you make this possible? She said. A few wiped minds and dead politicians. I made sure you won\u2019t be bothered. You said. What about the day to day stuff of the queen? She said. Taken care of. Don\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t be bother by all that political nonsense. So you subverted an entire planet\u2019s government so that I can be queen for a day or so? She said. I knew you were smart enough to be queen. You said. Rey grabs you and starts kissing you multiple times. Best! Anniversary! Ever! She said between kisses. Better than our one on Coruscant? You said. Blows it out of the water. Matching rings are one thing, but this is on another level. She said. So what\u2019s the first thing you\u2019re going to do? You said. Keep kissing you. I\u2019m nowhere near done yet. She said. Rey continues to barrage you with kisses. It was enjoyable at first, but you started to get short on breath. Rey\u2026.. Can\u2019t breath\u2026.. You said. Awwww. But I\u2019m still not done yet. She pouted. I know, but my lungs need air. You said. Rey kisses you a few more times. So. What are you going to do now that you\u2019re queen? You said. Spend every minute with you. And use the perks. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to mind trick people, but there where a lot you had to do it to. What you did to the queen was made her think she was a commoner and \u201cease\u201d the minds of the politicians. Rey had gotten up and went out into streets. Everywhere she went, you mind trick the people to think Rey is queen. Rey was having a grand time. Since people thought she was queen, she had gotten things free. Food, clothes, and even some jewelry. It all had put a smile on her face, which is what you wanted. Rey was sitting on a bench in the plaza, giving you more kisses. I love you. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/kiss.png\" alt=\"*Kiss*\" title=\"Kiss\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">  I love you. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/kiss.png\" alt=\"*Kiss*\" title=\"Kiss\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> I love you. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/kiss.png\" alt=\"*Kiss*\" title=\"Kiss\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> She said. After doing so for 2 minutes, she stops. You are the best husband ever! She said. You only deserve the best. You said. And I got it. She said. Rey hugs you tightly. Ugh. Rey. Remember you're stronger than me.... You said. Rey loosens her hold, but doesn't let go. That's better. You said.  She finally lets go after a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo did you ever see yourself like this? You said. Not even in my dreams. Not until you came along. None of this would be possible without you. And I\u2019ve never been so happy! She said. She starts kissing you again. Rey\u2026. You\u2019re going to\u2026. Waste time\u2026. Kissing me\u2026. Instead of\u2026. Enjoying your time as queen. You said between kisses. What\u2019s the point of queen if I can\u2019t love my little king? She said. K\u2026King? You said blushing. You heard me. Remember when you said I was the queen of your heart? She said. T\u2026.that was years ago. You said. And I\u2019ve remember it since. If I\u2019m queen of your heart, then you\u2019re the king of mine. She said. Rey gives you a long, passionate kiss. She breaks it after a minute. Till death or the end of the galaxy. She said. Till death or the end of the galaxy. You said. Now. Let's enjoy our anniversary, my little king. Rey said. She gives you one last long kiss before standing up and walking away from the plaza.</span></div></div>",

When Rey got back to her throne, she continued her kissing fest on you. I love you. You\u2019ve made me the happiest wife in the world! She said. I aim to please. You said. Rey holds you to her chest. All these years we\u2019ve been together\u2026.. I still can\u2019t thank you enough. From scavenging on Jakku to spending a wonderful anniversary on Naboo. You are the best thing to happen to me, Tyne! She said. Just giving you a better life, dear. You said. You subverted an entire planet for me. Now I have to rethink your gift. She said. You had something planned for me? You said. Yeah, but it won\u2019t be as good as what you did. She said. I\u2019ll like it! I promise! You said. You sure? It\u2019s not as grand as what you did. She said. I\u2019ll love it. Whatever it is. You said. Ok. Close your eyes first. She said. You do as she said. Rey moved you down to her waist and opened up her pants. Hope you enjoy! She said. Rey then shoves you into herself. Ah! That feels so good. She said. From being thrust quickly, you open your eyes. I\u2026I\u2019m in her\u2026.. You said. (This was my gift to you. An entire day inside me.) Rey said telepathically. (So we can both enjoy ourselves.) You said. (Have as much fun as you want. My gift to you.) She said. You started to crawl and Rey moaned. (Don\u2019t go too deep. I don\u2019t want to lose you.) She said. (I\u2019ll be fine, Rey. You just enjoy yourself.) You said. (I-AH! Will.) She said. With you inside her, Rey kept enjoying her time as queen. There were a few close moments, but she managed to play them off. Rey had gotten everything she wanted, to the point where she almost forgot about how her parents left her. Almost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen night came, Rey was laying in her bed, and breathing very quickly. (Tyne\u2026.. Make my eyes roll into my head\u2026.) She said. (You got it.) You said. You crawl to her sweet spot and give it a small shock. YES!!! Rey said. You agitate it more and more until Rey reaches her climax. I LOVE YOU!!!! She said as she climaxed. You are pushed out in a wave of her juice. Man. I\u2019ll never get use to that. You said. You are suddenly lifted up and placed in Rey\u2019s hand. She cleans you off before she gives you a passionate kiss. You\u2026.are\u2026.amazing! She said between breaths. Rey takes a few seconds to catch her breath. So I take it you liked your anniversary gift? You said. Like it? I loved it! Being queen with none of the nonsense of it. She said. I made sure you weren\u2019t going to be bothered by all that political stuff. You were going to do what every you want. And I was going to make sure of it. You said. You\u2019re the best husband ever. She said. And you\u2019re the best wife ever. You said. Rey gives you another kiss before you both fall asleep in each other\u2019s embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Rey had woken up early. Waking up to see your smiling face. Wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. You said. With you so close to me, I feel nothing but happiness and want. The only things I wanted in life. She said. I\u2019ll keep providing that to you. You said. I want this to last forever, but we have to go before the real queen comes back. She said. We could get rid of her. Then you\u2019ll actually be queen. You said. But then I\u2019d have to get involved in politics, and I won\u2019t have any time for you. I won\u2019t have that happen. She said. Well, ok. But if you change your mind\u2026.. You said with lightning raging in your hand. *Laugh* Calm down, my little homicidal manic. She said. No lightning? Ok. A completely erased memory. She will be your personal servant. You said. As enticing as that sounds, I only have time for one person. She said, rubbing your head with her finger. Fine\u2026.. But that gives me an idea for our next anniversary. You said. Rey gets up and sways her hips as she gets her clothes. She smiles and laughs when she caught you staring. She puts her clothes on and picks you up. I can\u2019t wait until our next anniversary. She said. Rey heads to her ships and flies into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. The best anniversary? You said. The best. I\u2019ll never forget it. She said. So where to now, dear? The galaxy is at our fingertips. You said. I don\u2019t know. I kinda want to get into some trouble. She said. Remember last time you went looking for trouble? You said. I still remember the fireworks of that capital ship. She said. I\u2019m talking about on that ship. You went crazy. You said. You told me you were in danger. She said. Actually\u2026. That was a lie. I wanted to see you angry. And boy were you angry. You were hatred incarnate. You said. How could I not be? You said that you were caught and going to be made a toy. Nobody uses you as a toy but me. She said. Hey! You said. Oh, stop it. You know I wouldn\u2019t treat you like that. She said. But you treated those soldiers like toys. 3 decapitations, 4 cut in half, and 7 with missing arms or legs. You said. All that is getting off easy. I wanted their deaths to be slow, and watch the light in their eyes go out, but you were priority one. She said. Heh heh. That\u2019s my giant sith warrior wife. You said. And you\u2019re my tiny sith husband. She said. Rey force lifts you to her lips and kisses you a few times before putting you back in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you still want trouble, the Resistance and First Order are still around. Lost that bet badly\u2026.. You said. What? You didn\u2019t like treating me as a goddess? Rey said stunned. I love it, but I can\u2019t believe the Resistance lasted longer than I thought\u2026\u2026 Anyway. Who do you want mess with? You said. I want to mess with the....</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re my little sith maniac. She said. And don\u2019t forget it. You said. You jump form her hand to her shoulder and kiss her check. Rey blushes a little and pulls you back to her hand. I see I have to watch you from now on. She said. Rey turns on the warp drive and warps to the nearest Resistance base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s this planet called? You said. Crait. It used to be an outpost used by the Rebels. Rey said. And the Resistance took it, but didn\u2019t they evacuated when the First Order attacked? You said. Barely. From what I\u2019ve heard, an old jedi held back the First Order while the Resistance escaped. She said. That was a long time ago. You think anyone is still there? You said. They came back. After they ran, and found their courage, they retook the base. It\u2019s now acts as a Forward operating base. She said. This far out? It\u2019s too far out for the main force. Maybe special forces? Like commandos or something? You said. If so, I hope they put up a decent fight. She said. Rey flies the ship to the planet\u2019s surface and lands the ship. Ready to cause some mayhem? You said. Let\u2019s see what these guys can do. Rey said. With you on her shoulder, Rey walks out to the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarren except for the outpost. You said. Rey walks up to the giant, heavy metal doors. Those doors look sturdy. If only we had an AT-AT or\u2026\u2026 What do the First Order call them now? You said. ATM6. But we don\u2019t need those oversized gorilla machines. She said. You have an idea? You said. \u2026..Can I trust you not to get hurt? She said. Of course. What needs to be done? You said. These cracked opening in the ground are connected to the outpost. If you can navigated them to get inside and open these doors, we can have of funfest. She said. Sneak in and open the door. Got it. You said. Rey gives you a kiss for good luck and dropped you in one of the cracks. Ok. I think\u2026..it\u2019s to my left. You said. You head left. You take a few turns and finally are inside the outpost. (Tyne. How goes it?) Rey said telepathically. (I\u2019m in. Now I\u2019ll need to find the button that opens those doors.) You said. (How many troopers?) She said. (A good number. But they are special forces.) You said. (If only that jedi was around as well\u2026.. Be careful in there.) She said. You quickly ran from cover to cover, avoiding eyes and people walking. Ok. The console is in that booth, but there\u2019s too much foot traffic to get there. I\u2019m sure one of them would be overjoyed to help me. You said. Seeing a commando pass by, you shout up to her. Hey! You shout. Huh? Kel? Is that you? She said. Down here! Look down! You shout. She looks around and sees no one until she looks down and sees something small. What\u2026.is that? She said. She gets closer, her boots landing in front of you. She bends over a little and is shocked by her discovery. A\u2026.. A\u2026.a small human!? She nearly shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm. Burnette, near hourglass figure, blue eyes, round rear, and chest that would make a Twilek dancer jealous. Too bad I\u2019m happily married. You said. She crouches down to get a better look at you. H\u2026..How\u2019d you get like this? She said. You want to help me. You said, waving your hand. I\u2026.want to help you. She said. She lowers her hand down and you jump on. She lifts you up to her face. You\u2019re going to open the blast doors. You said. I\u2019m going to open the blast doors. She said. She places you on her shoulder and heads to the booth. (I\u2019m bored out here, Tyne. And I\u2019m starting to worry about you. What\u2019s going on?) Rey said. (I hitched a ride. Moving a lot faster now.) You said. (Are you trying to give me a heart attack?!) She said. (Don\u2019t worry, dear. I\u2019ll be fine. Just have your lightsaber ready.) You said. (Whenever you say \u201cDon\u2019t worry, dear.\u201d I worry even more.) She said. The girl gets to the booth and press the button. The heavy blast doors slowly open as the soldiers look on confused. When they opened enough, Rey walked in with her saber drawn. A few start shooting at her and Rey blocks the bolts. She freezes them in place and slashes their heads off. You\u2019re all going to suffer! She said with an evil smile. That\u2019s my wife. You said. You watch as Rey choked, throw, and slashed at the commandos. Front row seat to a slaughter fest. Oh. She really loves decapitation. You said. As Rey kills most of the commandos, a few of them run deeper into the mine. Running won\u2019t save you! She said. Rey freezes them before they got away. Rey walks slowly over to them, savoring the fear in their eyes. One by one, she stabs them through the heart; her smile getting bigger with each one she kills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear in their eyes\u2026. Priceless! Now. Where is my little sith manic? She said. Over here. You said, sitting on a rock. Where you watching me the whole time? She said. I give the performance an A. Missing limbs, cut in half, sliced right down the middle, and lots of rolling heads. You said. Why didn\u2019t you join? It would have been double the fun. She said. You were having so much fun, I didn\u2019t want to barge in. You said. I was having so much fun. So. Where is this person you rode with? I know it was a woman. Is she prettier than me!? She said with a little anger. First: She\u2019s over there in the booth. And second, she\u2019s not. I\u2019m married to a powerful, yellow eyed sith goddess who won my heart. And her name is Rey. You said. You are so cheesy. She said while blushing. Come on. You know you like it when I compliment you. You said. \u2026..Call me goddess again. She said. Yes, goddess. You said. Rey smiles as her blush gets deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do you want to do with her? She\u2019s the last one. You said. Did she try to hurt you? Rey said. No, but I mind tricked her. My two credit worth, I say we let her go. You said. I have a better idea. Rey said. Rey starts to choke her until a snap was heard. Nobody holds you except me. She said. I love it when you act ruthless. You said. Rey lifts you up and places you in her hands and heads back into the ship. She sits down in the pilot seat and flies the ship into space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now? You said. Over the years, I had a wonderful time traveling to planets, learning the ways of the sith, killing anyone who got in our way. She said. We had some crazy times. Remember when you thought I was cheating on you? You said. Don\u2019t remind me. I didn\u2019t know you were setting up for my birthday. I just saw you in another girl\u2019s hands and went crazy. Again, so sorry for choking you. She said. It\u2019s fine. I like that emotional side of you. You said. We\u2019ve been through a lot as we\u2019ve traveled through the galaxy, but now\u2026.. I want to go home and spend the rest of my life with you. She said. Jakku? You said. No. Our home on Coruscant. She said. It was bound to happen soon. But taking our feet off the gas, and just enjoy life with each other, sounds\u2026.good to me. You said. With a smile, Rey sets the course and flies to Coruscant.</span></div></div>",

Home sweet home. You said. Tell me again how\u2019d you get this ambassador house. She said. You love that story. You said. I do. Tell me. She said. Ok. Near Our first anniversary and we decided to live on Coruscant. Had enough to afford a decent place, but I wasn\u2019t going to let my wife live \u201cdecent\u201d. So while we were still looking, I looked over to see an ambassador\u2019s house with a personal landing pad and all the things for an easy life. More suited for my wife than him. So I snuck away, found the ambassador, wiped his mind, and had him leave the key. The look on your face was priceless when the day came. You said. My husband sure does love me. Our first anniversary and got me a house. She said. If you\u2019re going to live, it\u2019s going to be in the lap of luxury. You said.  And luxury it is. Fine eating, drinking, the softest bed I\u2019ve ever laid on. She said. Only the best for you. You said. You\u2019ve done so much for me. You go all out for me, and I feel like I\u2019m not doing the same. She said. I don\u2019t want you to. I\u2019m paying you back for all your kindness you gave me. You said. I told you that it was unnecessary. All I want is you to love me forever. She said. And I will, but after all you\u2019ve done for, and to me, I wanted to return the favor. You said. Tyne. There is no favor. You\u2019re not my friend, you\u2019re my husband. I want you to do things for me out of love. Not because of a favor. Ok? She said. Are you sure? You said. Positive. What matters most to me is your wellbeing and love. Everything else doesn't matter to me. She said. That makes two of us. So what does my wife want to do? You said. A nice meal at home with you. She said. You want me to make that fancy restaurant deliver? You said. Not this time. I\u2019ll cook. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey gets all the ingredients, meat, and spices she needs and makes an exact copy of the dish from that restaurant. Didn\u2019t know you could make an exact copy of your favorite food from there. You said. Well it is my favorite. So of course, I\u2019d learn how to make it. She said. Rey starts eating and gives you some pieces. Wow. You liked to season. You said. Too much seasoning? She said. No. It taste better. You said. Are you just saying that? She said, eyeing you. Now that just hurts me, Rey. Would I lie to my wife? You said, faking being offended. Don\u2019t make me recount the times. She said, smiling. How many times have I lied to you? You said. First lie: You said you \u201cforgot\u201d my birthday. She said. And surprised you with a wedding ring. You said. Second lie: \u201cForgot\u201d our anniversary. She said. Surprised you with a ambassador\u2019s house. You said. Third lie: Said you were hurt. She said. You\u2019re cute when you\u2019re angry. You said. Do I need to go on? She said. The common theme of my lies is to surprise you. You said. You know how I feel about surprises. She said. You hate them. But you love my surprises. You said. You do have a way of doing it. A wedding ring, house, that brand new speeder, a day as queen. And I know you\u2019re planning on getting me servants. She said. Man. Now I have to find something else to give you. You said. I didn\u2019t say no to the servants. I\u2019ll just act surprised when you get them. She said. You and Rey finish eating. When she puts the dish away, she lifts you up and kiss you. You kiss her back and she lightly licks you. Mmmm. Dessert. She said. Rey pushes you into her mouth and toss you around a little. When she tosses you onto her teeth, she puts them on you lightly. (I could chew you up right now if I want to.) She teases. (You wouldn't.) You said. (Beg me, and I won't.) She said. (You know i don't beg, dear.) You said. You lift her teeth off you and roll onto her tongue. (No fair! That was cheating!) She said. (And?) You taunt. Rey tilts her head forward and you fall onto her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re no fun. She pouts. Oh, come on. You expect me to beg? You said, grinning. Yes! I\u2019m your wife. You\u2019re not suppose to resist me! She said. Well, that part is right. I can\u2019t. You said, eyeing her chest. Rey saw where you were looking and smiled. You can\u2019t, huh? She said. How can I when those clothes you wear do you no justice? You said. Then how about I remove them? She said. Rey places you on the bed and undresses herself. Over the years, as she got older, her figure got better. Her rear got rounder, her waist slimmed, and her breast got bigger. When she was bare naked, she giggles at your intent staring. Like what you see? She said, playing with her breast. A lot. You said, smiling. Rey crawls onto the bed, pushes you over, and freeze you. You\u2019re all mine\u2026. She said. Rey kisses you a few times before stripping you down. Oh! Someone is ready to play! She said. Rey gently rubs you and starts kissing you. She moves lower and lower and starts sucking. You\u2019d moan, but can\u2019t speak. (How does it feel? Being sucked off by a giant?) She said telepathically. (Not\u2026how I expected.) You said. (I\u2019m going to drain you dry.) She said. Rey picked up the pace and swirls her tongue around your member. (You\u2019ve\u2026.been taking lessons?) You said. (No. I just know how to please my little husband.) She said. Rey kept going until she felt something wet hit her tongue. Rey brings her head up, tilts her head back and swallows all of it. Mmmm! Delicious! She said, rubbing her stomach. Rey unfreezes you and starts kissing you. I love you. *Kiss* I love you. *Kiss* I will always and forever love you. *Kiss* She said. You kiss her back and give her a small shock that stuns her. Oh! She said surprised. You got up and quickly ran inside her pussy. That-AH! That little weasel! She said. (Turnabout is fair play.) You said. (I\u2019ll-Ohhhh! I\u2019ll get you!) She said. You move deeper and deeper inside her and Rey\u2019s moans got louder. You shocked her sweet spot and her eyes rolled back into her head as she went into pure ecstasy. YES! YES!!! She said as she climaxes. In a rush of fluids, you\u2019re pushed out back onto the bed. Rey takes a few deep breaths to compose herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to your feet, but are pushed back down. What did you say about turnabout? Fair play, right? I\u2019m going to leave you gasping for air. She said. Rey lifts you and sandwiches you between her feet. As she rubs her feet together, she felt the pricks of kisses being given to her feet. Heh heh! Kiss all you want. Won\u2019t help you. She said. She kept rubbing until she felt something warm on her feet. I\u2019m not done with you. She said. Rey froze you against her right foot and, using her left big toe, she rubs up and down. Seeing you shiver made her giggle. Feeling her soft toe gently stroking you, you climax within a few minutes. Heh heh! Such a good boy. She said. You were breathing hard from the experience. I know you don\u2019t want me to stop, but I think you suffered enough. She said. Rey lifts you up and places you on her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad fun, little one? She said. Y\u2026yeah\u2026. You said. Rey rubs your head and giggles. Told you I\u2019d leave you gasping for air. She said. With her hand open, she lifts you up to her hand and kiss you. I love you. She said. I love you too. You said. Rey gives you a few more kisses and sighs happily. I\u2019ve never been so happy before. You\u2019ve brought me something I thought I never have. Thank you, Tyne. Thank you for everything. She said. You\u2019re welcome. You said. Rey hands you your clothes and you both put your clothes back on. Rey then walks, with you in hand, to the terrace. All this\u2026. Because of you. I can\u2019t thank you enough. She said. Rey hugs you for a few seconds and lets go. You said. You remember the promise you made me years ago? She said. Never forgot it. Till death or the end of the galaxy\u2026.. No. Even if we both die or the galaxy does end, I will never leave you. In life and in death, I will be with you. Always. You said. Hearing your new promise to her, tears stream down Rey\u2019s face. But they were tears of happiness. Thank you\u2026.. Just\u2026.. Thank you\u2026.. She said. Rey pulls you close and gives you a long, passion filled kiss as the sunlight from the sunset beams on you both.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up a few minutes before Rey. The red-orange glow of the sunset pours in through the cracks of the AT-AT. <br>\r\nYou're still laying on Rey's upper belly/lower chest, her hands blanketed over you like smooth, warm blankets, which would've been even better had he not been hot all day. <br>\r\nBoth of you are completely naked at this point and soaked with sweat at this point. You can still hear the soft rhythmic beating of her heart in her chest and the soft sound off air entering and escaping her nose. At one point you swear you could have heard her whisper something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll things considered, you're grateful for your current circumstances. Things could've turned out much worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the white noise coming from your new friend/lover, couldn't drown out the worrisome thoughts that echoed in your mind. The teleportation device took you across space, but you weren't sure about time. You left in 40 ABY and measuring time on a planet like Jakku would prove difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nABY: After the Battle of Yavin.<br>\r\nIt was weird to you that such a system of measuring time rose to prominence. From your home town, the rise and fall of The Empire was just a series of newscasts and the series of increasingly complicated tax reforms which disappeared after the Senate took over and loosened their grip on the galaxy. You never saw even a picture of the boogeyman known as \"Darth Vader,\" and if not for the insistence of numerous credible journalists, you would have thought the whole thing was an urban myth. Perhaps it was. <br>\r\nWhat definitely didn't happen was the Luke Skywalker thing. A farm boy blowing up the Empire's planet sized super weapon with one torpedo? Even if something like that were possible, you can't see why it would be worth changing a calender that stretched out over millions of years. It's not even the first time that the rebels blew up a super weapon. You recalled two other times that the rebels blew up death stars, the last one even larger then the prior two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, your mother was back in 40 ABY and you were here. The machine would've been able to track your path, but if you were in a different year there's not much that you could do. You worried about her funding being cut off right after you teleported. Or worse yet, what if she followed me? <br>\r\nWhat if she was out in the desert, at one inch tall, at night, all alone. There's no point in torturing yourself with the thought much longer, you couldn't do about it anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're so helpless, so useless.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, perhaps less useless than where Rey found you. Earlier today, her steps in the sand launched you and engulfed the air around you with sand. When she grabbed you and cuddled up with you the second time, the width of her hand extended from just below your knees up to your collarbone. If you had to guess, you'd have to be between 6 and 7 inches tall. At this rate, you expected to be as tall as two to three feet by the time you woke up, but you remained 6 to 7 inches tall. <br>\r\nWhy would you grow that much over the day, but stop at this size? What if this was your size forever? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were getting a headache from all this thinking and even the nude body of Rey could only be so comfortable for so long. You look up at the peaceful face of your sleeping friend. She almost are me, you thought. She's kind, she's helpful, she's adorable, but the instant you tried to treat her like a normal human being she popped you into her mouth like a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She wants you to fear her.<br>\r\nShe wants you to know that she can kill you any second<br>\r\nShe's completely drunk off of power</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just got carried away, you assure yourself. This is a weird situation and who would have thought that she could actually have her impossible fantasy fulfilled. She knows you're a person and you're the only person she has. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, this nap had gone on for too long. Time to get up. You start wiggling violently and start tickling her belly with her feet. A smile emerged on her face, but instead of waking up she rolled over onto her side. You let out a yelp as you fall off of her and onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she's probably going to be there for a while. Might as well explore her place while there's still daylight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room and decide to hike towards....</span></div></div>",

Obviously the walk is shorter now that you're six to seven inches tall, but you suspect that this place must be a lot more cramped for your larger companion. Poor Rey, this place must really suck for a normal sized person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I doing back there earlier?,\" you think to yourself, randomly. The feet thing, you thought it was your idea at the time but... in hindsight something didn't feel right. You were never really into feet before, let alone licking feet, but Rey said she had unusual fantasies. You were sure that the idea came from her, but that makes no sense. Unless.... There were stories about what force users could do. Children's stories, about the Jedi's ability to make do what they wanted. Was Rey one of those-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough. You had a messed up childhood, you're into some weird stuff yourself. It's entirely possible that all this \"that wasn't my idea\" stuff is garbage. Rey has been more than a great host and all the setbacks have been worth it. <br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\nYou walk along the counter, finally able to view the scratches. For one fearful moment, you wonder if Rey has a pet that she didn't tell you about. You really didn't want to think of some kind of desert creature waiting in the shadows to eat you. To your relief, you begin to notice a pattern to it. They're deliberate, they're organized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're counting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounting what though? Days? Weeks? Months? Year's?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr what if it's not a calendar. <br>\r\n<i>What if it's counting her victims? What if it's counting all the people she's killed? What if it's counting all the tiny victims she's eaten?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop that, you scold yourself. Stop that right now. Rey is clearly as caught off guard by your present circumstances as you are. She's not a killer, she's just a girl living in the desert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she seemed pretty eager to put you in your place. Pretty eager to bite you in half and swallow you whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers cut into the wall disappeared at a certain point. There was space available for future marks, but there were also markings that were just beyond your sightline. You estimated that there were several thousand markings on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope it was measuring time. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most stormtroopers carry a moisture deterioration radar for emergency situations. From there it's just a matter of digging and streamlining pipes.

You needed to know about the markings, the feet thing, if she was actually going to eat you. If you let her sex appeal distract you, you might as well just be a slave to her forever.

Go on. Finish it. Say what we both know you were going to say \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey turns back around, but can't look at him. \"I'm sorry Tyne.I didn't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course you meant it! Why wouldn't you? We already were halfway there a few hours ago. Why don't you just finish me off right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyne please,\" Rey quietly begged as tears spilled down her face. But Tyne would have none of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't have that threat hanging over me. My existence is already hell as is. So if you're going to kill me, just do it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just finish me off now.

So when you were messing with me and you shrugged it off so easily, I was absolutely terrified by the sheer number of ways that you could accidentally kill me. I didn't just want you to know that I was scared and angry, I wanted you to feel it. I wanted to hurt you Rey. You've been mostly good to me and I have no other friends for light years, but I wanted to hurt you because I didn't know what else I could do.

The two are silent for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really aren't good people,\" Rey mused finally. \"I mean deep down, what kind of creatures are we? I took advantage of you and then you turned around and took advantage of me. We're both crazy. We might just be the kind of crazy that gets each other killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean at least we're aware of it now,\" Tyne commented, walking over towards Rey and laying on her arm so that he can look her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure,\" Rey chuckled, \"can be as openly crazy as we want now, there's no nuthouses in the desert.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. My mother always used to sat that identifying a problem was half the battle. It was the easier half, but it's still half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first of all you don't eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know, I might be a bit tempted there,\" Rey said playfully, \"I mean look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My succulent thighs aside,\" Tyne began to say, which immediately sent Rey into a fit of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of that aside,\" he continued, \"I need you to try and be a bit more considerate on how things are from my perspective. And if you continue to help take care of me and help me fine my way back, I swear I won't leave you lonely. Rey, I swear by the force that if I find my family I won't rest until I find yours. Do we have a deal-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyne could barely get that last sentence out as Rey dragged Tyne in for a massive hug and all 75 emotions building up in her poured out at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,\" she wept on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a bit of work to be done, but hey Tyne was across the galaxy, possibly in a different time, hugging his new giant naked girlfriend. Weirder stuff had happened to this point, why couldn't this whole thing work out?</span></div></div>",

Once Tyne and Rey were both undressed, she grabbed him and entered the shower. <br>\r\nAs the warm water was falling gently onto both Rey and Tyne, she brought him to her face. \"You know I'm your friend, right? I wouldn't ever hurt you.\"<br>\r\nAt that point, Tyne was mostly convinced. \"I know\", he said, blushing.<br>\r\nRey let out a small giggle. \"Just think how easy it would be, though. To swallow you right now...\" her friendly smile slowly turned into a smirk.<br>\r\nNow Tyne was worried. Was she really this crazy?? \"Ha. Ha. Don't joke about that, please...\"<br>\r\n\"Who said I was joking?\", she replied.<br>\r\nTyne's face went white. What was going to happen? <br>\r\nRey brought Tyne to her lips, and just before placing him in her mouth, hesitated. \"You know what? I'll give you a choice. Either you can be my... 'secret', or I can swallow you. Here and now.\"<br>\r\nHe gulped. Hard. \"S-secret?\"<br>\r\n\"You know... as a toy\". Her smirk had turned into a huge grin.<br>\r\n\"So... I WAS right... you're a psychopath... I won't be your toy. I refuse to take any part in your life. Now let me out. Now.\"<br>\r\nRey mocked him, making a sad face, extending her lower lip. \"Well... option 2 it is. That's a shame. We could have had so much fun...\" She opened her mouth and gently placed him on her tongue. He tried to struggle but couldn't stand because of the salivation. <br>\r\nShe played with him for less than a minute, before gently swallowing. His screaming slowly faded as he realised the inevitable was to come. All of his life, to end up here. <br>\r\nJust another number on the sink.</span></div></div>",

Any last bit of light was gone, consumed into her utter darkness. You couldn't see, but oh how you knew what was going on around you. Her tight walls pressed themselves against you, as if they were automatically trying to push you somewhere comfortable...not for you, of course. The smell was hellish, highly intensified by the lack of air in comparison to your last position within her crack, which is saying a lot. \"Ah~ that's waaaay better!\" Rey reacted. Her voice was muffled, and you could hear the echo of her own body better than her voice travelling outside. Maybe feeling your body slide inside pleased her after all...but is it enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clenched her buttocks, forcing her rectum to push you deeper to her pleasure.

Y\u2026.You\u2019re not a bug\u2026.. Y\u2026.You\u2019re human! She said. You\u2019re somewhat thankful for her realization, but the pain shooting through your body makes you pass out. The last thing you saw was her giant hands reaching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 day later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes. I\u2026. I\u2019m not dead. You said with relief. You look to see your left arm in a makeshift sling made out of cloth. How did this get around me? You said.  As you sit up, your body is sore from pain. You get to your feet to see you\u2019re on a counter. You get a look at your surroundings. Looks like I\u2019m inside a gutted AT-AT. Wait. This was\u2026..where I was heading to before that girl stomped me. Speaking of, where is she anyway? You said. You hear an engine come to a stop. Wait. I know that sound. The sound I heard last time. You said. After waiting a few seconds, you see that same girl walk in with a worried look and something in her hand. S\u2026She\u2019s the one who\u2026.. You said. The image of her boot slowly descending on you and grinding you into the sand plays through your mind. She walks over to the counter you\u2019re on. As she gets closer, you realize just how big she is to you. When she gets to the counter, she sees you\u2019re up. You\u2019re up! Thank gosh! Here. Hold out your arm. She said. You were hesitant to even speak, let alone do what she said. It ok. I won\u2019t hurt you. Just\u2026.stick out your good arm. What I have will make you feel better. She said. Everything inside you was telling you not to. To just run into the deep desert away from this girl who tried to turn you into a red stain. But with the pain your body is feeling, you won\u2019t make it far. Let alone, out of the AT-AT. So you did as she said. Ok. Hold still. She said. Very gently, the girl injects you with a stim. She was hoping it would make you feel better. Ok. Better? She said. Your body doesn\u2019t feel in pain as much, so you nod your head. That\u2019s a relief. She said. She was going to pick you up, but she stops when she sees you bracing I\u2026..guess it\u2019s too soon for that. She said. You look the girl up and down to see she\u2019s a scavenger. A pretty one to say the least.  From all the stuff you see in the AT-AT, she\u2019s good at it. If she\u2019s anything like how she was with you, she\u2019s probably the only scavenger on this planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2026wanted to say sorry. I couldn\u2019t see you so well with the sun so bright. If I saw you for what you were, I wouldn\u2019t have done that. She said. Her words are sincere. You can tell she feels bad over her action. I was just so mad at getting half the credits i was initially promised. I wanted to take my anger out on something and....well....here we are. She said. You finally work up the nerve to speak. \u2026\u2026How long was I out for? You said. Two days. You didn\u2019t move at all. I thought I killed you. I made a sling for your left arm. It was dislodged, and I had to move it back in place. She said. \u2026.I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d go as far as getting me a stim. You said. It\u2019s the least I could do after what I've done. She said. I\u2026.didn\u2019t mean to make you waste your credits on me. You said. Don\u2019t worry. I have plenty. It was my fault anyway. She said. So you spend credits on any guy you come across in the desert? You said. Only the really cute ones. She said. So I\u2019m cute, huh? You said. For a shorty. She teases. You both laugh, which makes the situation easier and lighter for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you have a name, or will shorty work? She said. Tyne. You? You said. Rey. She said. She extends her pinky finger and you shake it, making her giggle. Then she reaches for you, but stops. May i? She said. You nod. She picks you and places you in her hand. (Jeez. I\u2019m only half the size of her thumb. Hope I grow a little bit more.) You thought. I think we\u2019ll get along well. She said. Guess that means I'm staying with you. You said. Well, I can't have you wandering around in the desert. You're with me now. She said. The smile on her face puts you off a little. Is....that a good thing? You said. Awww. Are you scared of me? She teases. A....little after you said that. You said. Rey's index finger strokes your back. You brace at first, but ease up after a few rubs. Better? She said. Y....Yeah. You said. Good. We're off to a good start here. So tell me.....</span></div></div>",

Get ready to have your mind blown. My mother worked for a group of scientist working on to develop some sort of teleportation device. It looked good so far, until it was deemed to dangerous for human testing. The project was pulled, and my mother was going to lose her job. So I tested it myself. Turns out it did work, but had a side effect. You said. Making someone small? She said. I guess\u2026. They never gave a reason why it was too dangerous for human testing. They just said it was. \u2026..So, crazy right? You said. It\u2019s not as farfetched as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s still shocking. She said. What about you? What\u2019s your back story?

I\u2019ve been here on Jakku all my life, wondering if my parents are coming back. She said. All your life? You said. Here. Let me show you. She said. Rey walks over to a wall of metal with a long row of tally marks. Wow\u2026.. You say stunned. I\u2019ve been keeping count ever since I could count. I had to take care of myself. Scavenging was the only way. And this AT-AT was the only home I could have. Days turned to months, and months turned to years. They haven\u2019t come back yet. She said. Not even a holo call? You said. Nothing. No call, no messages. It\u2019s as if they just- Abandoned you. You interrupt. Y\u2026Yeah. She said. Rey slides down the wall to sit on the ground. At least you had someone to worry about. I don\u2019t even know if my parents are alive so I can worry about. She said. Man\u2026.. That blows mine out of the water. You said. So. Now you know about me. She said. You see she\u2019s sad from talking about her past. Rey. Can I tell you something? You said. What? She said as she looks at you. If your parents just left you here, then screw them. You said. What\u2026.do you mean? She said taken aback. To just leave their daughter by herself on this planet. Those aren\u2019t parents. No parent would leave their child alone by themselves. You don\u2019t need people like that in your life. You\u2019re way better off without them. You said. I am? She said. Yeah. Make your own credits, have your own place, you have all the necessities. I say you\u2019ve done well for yourself. You said. Rey remains quiet for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re right\u2026. I am better off. If they haven\u2019t come back by now, then they aren\u2019t. Wherever they are, I hope they are happy. I have almost everything I need here. She said. Almost? What are you missing? You said. A tiny friend. She said. M\u2026Me? You said. Anyone else thumb size? She said. I\u2026.don\u2019t know what or how I can contribute. You said. You don\u2019t have to contribute anything. Just don\u2019t push yourself. She said as she got up. We\u2019re going scavenging already? You said. Not with that arm you aren\u2019t. Besides, no need to rush things. I say we loosen up a bit. She said. Like a few drinks at the cantina? You said. I think that teleporter gave you mind reading powers. She said as she pats your head. Rey walks to her speeder and hops in. Now.

While she drives, you consider your luck. You wanted to touch them, but you don\u2019t want to anger her. It took a few minutes before she stops at the cantina. Rey gets out and walks in. Rey takes a seat at one of the empty tables and pulls you out. Did you enjoy the ride here? She said with a smile. It was\u2026.unexpected. You said. That was the whole point of me doing it. She said. Rey orders a drink and takes a sip. Whoa! Taste stronger than last time. She said. Rey holds you to the rim of the cup and you take a sip. Wow! That\u2019s spiked with something. This would send you home drunk. You said. Perfect. Rey said as she downs it in one. Are you\u2026.going to be fit to drive? You said. I can handle my drinks. Bartender! Keep \u2018em coming! Rey said. The bartender gives a thumbs up. You and Rey both enjoy yourselves inside the cantina; making jokes, faces, and seeing who would reach their limit first. You had to bow out after just 2 of those drinks. You both were having a good time until nighttime rolls in and Rey walks out with you in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you can handle your drinks. You're walking in a straight line.You said. I\u2019m a little shocked that you can handle drinking at your size. She said. I can hold my own, but whatever those drinks were, took me out. I\u2019m seeing double. You said. Rey gets into her speeder and drives back home. When Rey walks inside, she puts you on the counter. So do you feel comfortable around me now? Yeah. I *Hiccup* don't know if it's the drinks talking or me. You said. See? I\u2019m not a bad person. She said. Rey pokes you and you fall over, making her laugh. Ok\u2026. I\u2019m just going to sleep here. I can\u2019t make it to my bed. You said. Are you sure you want a hard, cold counter for a bed? She said. What\u2026.are you getting at? You said. Why don\u2019t you come sleep with me? She said. \u2026\u2026How drunk are you right now? You said. I\u2019m not drunk. I was\u2026.just making a suggestion. It\u2019s going to be colder than normal tonight, and I thought you might want a proper place to sleep tonight. And....someone to share body heat with. She said. I *hic* think the drinks will keep me warm. You said. O\u2026.oh. Ok. She said disheartened. Rey heads to bed and you go to sleep where you are. The night was calm, and cold was just as Rey said it was, but your body was warm from the strong drinks. As you were sleeping, you start to have a dream.</span></div></div>",

When your senses come to, you see Rey standing over you. Found you. She picks you up roughly and dangles you in front of her. Does that arm still hurt? Let me take care of that. She said. Rey rips the sling off and tug on your arm. The pain is excruciating until she rips your arm off. You howl in pain as she laughs. Don\u2019t die on me just yet. We\u2019re just getting started. She said. I\u2026.thought you said\u2026we were friends? You said. Ha! Why would I be friends with someone who I can pick up like nothing? She said. She then drops you and you land hard on the sand. You hold your hand over your missing arm to try to stop the blood flow. A shadow is cast over you and you look to see Rey\u2019s boot coming down on you. She twist her foot, which grinds you into the sand. She lifts her foot off you and sees you are alive, but barely. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d brake so easily. You look like your in pain. Let me\u2026.end your suffering. She said. You watch helplessly as Rey lifts her foot over you and comes down with tremendous force. You wake up sweating just as her foot made contact with you. You look at your left arm and see it\u2019s still in place and in the sling. You walk over to the edge to see Rey is sleeping soundly. You move your hand down your face. \u2026\u2026Goddamn. You said. You stayed up for a while before finally heading back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up early in the morning. That dream\u2026. You said. The image of your arm being rip off with such ease sent a chill down your spine. You get up and wait for Rey. You see Rey get up with a yawn. (She sleeps naked?) You thought. You still had that dream on your mind, that you didn\u2019t pay that much attention to Rey being fully naked in front of you. Rey goes to her shower and comes out a few minutes later and gets dressed. She walks over to the counter you slept on. You\u2019re up early. I thought you\u2019d sleep in. She said. \u2026\u2026Maybe next time. You said. Are you alright? You look shaken. She said. When she reached for you, you took a step back. Tyne. Is something wrong? She said. You don\u2019t say anything. Tyne. We were doing so good with each other. You were starting to trust me. She said. Rey could tell something was wrong with you. Did something happen last night? She said. \u2026..No. You said. Rey\u2019s bends down lower and you flinch when you saw her hands are placed next to you. Tyne, why are you so afraid of me now? She said. You can\u2019t even look at her, which makes her even more concern. Tyne. I don\u2019t want you scared of me. She said. I\u2019m not\u2026.scared of you. You said. Then look at me and say that. She said. Slowly, you look up at her and see her concern face. Alright. Now tell me why are you so scared of me. She said. I\u2026. You said. Tyne. Don\u2019t you trust me? I kept you safe, nurse you back to health, treat you well. Why? Why are you acting like this? She said. You wanted to tell, you really did, but the dream left you shell-shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey knew how you felt about being picked up, but she wanted to know why you were like this, so she picks you up. H\u2026.Hey! Put me down! You said. You guard your hurt arm out of fear, but Rey just puts you down in her hand. Your head was drenched in sweat from fear of your nightmare coming true. Rey could see the sweat dripping form your head. She knew you didn\u2019t like it, but this was a new level. You weren\u2019t just scared, you were terrified. Rey needed to calm you down if you were going to talk. You saw her index finger coming to you. You back up from her finger and protect your left arm. When you felt her finger touch you, you brace yourself. After a few seconds pass, you open your eyes to see her rubbing your back. The soothing feeling of her finger ease your nerves and slows your heart rate down a little. Seeing you calm down a little, Rey speaks. Tyne. You\u2019re my friend. I don\u2019t want you afraid of me. Whatever has you like this, just tell me. Please. I want to help ease your nerves. The way you\u2019re acting makes me think you don\u2019t want to be my friend anymore. She said.</span></div></div>",

You said. A dream about me? She said. Don\u2019t let your heart flutter just yet. It was\u2026.far from pleasant. You\u2026. You said. I what? She said. You rip of my hurt arm and killed me. You said. WHAT!? Why would I do that?! She said. I guess a part of me still doesn\u2019t fully trust you. You said. Why not? What have I done to make you not trust me? She said. Nothing. You done a lot for me. I guess it\u2019s just a lingering suspicion. You said. Well, we\u2019re just going have to get rid of that then. She said. What do you mean? You said. I\u2019m going to help you trust me. You said. How? You said. Watch. She said. Rey walks to her speeder and drives to an area with downed starfighters and destroyed walkers. What are we doing here? You said. Scavenging. Plus, I want to show you how much I trust you. She said. Don\u2019t know how you plan on accomplishing that out here, but if you say so. How can I help? You said. Walk around and see if anything here still works. She said. Ok. I think I can do that\u2026. You said. Rey sets you down on the ground and you walk around looking for anything to salvage. You look to the side to see the open desert. A possible escape. Freedom. You look to see Rey is taking parts out of a Tie fighter. \u2026..No. She doesn\u2019t deserve that. You said. You go back to looking for parts. Hm. This A wing could have something valuable.You said. Before you could start, a shadow is cast over you. What the? You said before being pushed to the ground. You feel the hard material against your back. A boot? But who- Rey. What is she doing!? Is she really going to\u2026. You said. There is no pressure being exerted on your body or anything. It\u2019s just keeping you in place. At first, you were scared, but that feeling went away when you didn\u2019t feel any force on you. You started to even feel somewhat safe and pat the boot a few times. It stays there on you for a few minutes until you feel it lift off you. As you stood, you are picked up carefully and placed down in Rey\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ok? Rey said. I\u2019m fine. What was that all about? You said. I said I was going to help you trust me. You\u2019re scared of me crushing you, so I just repeated what I did. She said. \u2026..Couldn\u2019t you have told me? You said. It wouldn\u2019t be effective if I told you. It had to be a surprise. I want you to trust me, Tyne. You\u2019re my friend. She said. But what about that part about you trusting me? You said. I saw you looking out into the vast desert, and you turned your back. I trusted you not to run away from me. And you must trust me because I didn\u2019t feel you fight against me. She said. I did feel\u2026..safe after a few seconds. You said. See? It worked. She said. So the scavenging was a lie? You said. Not really. I did want to scavenge with you. She said. Well as long as step on the sand and not me. You said. That\u2019s cruel. Depriving a girl of her fun. She said with a pout, making you both laugh. Come on. This stuff isn\u2019t going to do itself. She said. I\u2019ll help any way I can. You said. Rey places her hand next to you and you climb on. She lifts you up and brings you to a Y wing. I\u2019ll start you off easy. Pull out the wires so I can dislodge the astro droid. She said. Easy enough. You said. Rey puts you down in the inner parts of the Y wing. Ok. I think it\u2019s this\u2026.green one. You said. With your one good arm, you pull the wire and here a clack sound. Did it work? You shout. No. Pull another one. She said. Alright. The yellow one. You said. You pull the yellow one and hear something pop out. Now? You said. It worked. Grab my finger. She said. You see Rey\u2019s finger come down and you latch on as tight as you could as Rey pulls you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice work in there. She said. Thanks. I didn\u2019t want to look bad in front of a professional. Well there\u2019s a lot more to do. So try and impress me more. She said. With your help, Rey was able to collect a good amount of scrap. Ok. That\u2019s enough for today. Let\u2019s get this stuff to the outpost. She said. With you in tow, Rey gets into her speeder and drives to the outpost. After reaching the outpost, Rey unloads everything she has. Ok. That\u2019s done. And as for you\u2026. She said with a smile as she picks you up. You\u2019re not going to sell me, are you? You said. Depends on how well I do. A tiny human can sell for so much. She said. Well, it was fun while it lasted. You said. I\u2019m joking, shorty. She said as she pats you lightly on the head. You\u2019re with me now. So that means I take care of you. Now where to put you so no one steals you? She said. How about where I was last time? You said. Little perv. She teases. Rey places you in her cleavage and giggles from your movement. You position yourself as comfortably as you can so the heat from the sun and Rey won\u2019t bother you much. Ok. That\u2019s enough. Stay still down there. She said. Before long, customers start to come to her. You listen to the haggling and conversation, but the soft beating of Rey's heart lulls you to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey was making a killing on her salvage. She didn\u2019t overcharge, but there was a lot of people coming to her. Once all her things were gone, Rey was counting her credits. 200\u2026..300\u2026.450! Not a bad day. Now to get a few things. She said. Rey buys some food packs and stims before getting to her speeder and driving back home.</span></div></div>",

She gently picks you and pokes you. You feel something jamming you and you open your eyes to see it\u2019s Rey. Had a good sleep? She said. Yeah\u2026.. How\u2019d did it go? You said. More people than I thought. I made a small fortune. And with the credits I got, I was able to pick up a few things. She said. Rey shows you some food packs and the stims. Are the stims for me? You said. Yeah. You\u2019re under my care until your arm is healed. She said. Rey gently sticks you with one of the stim. Ok. That should help. She said. It does. Thanks. If I get back to normal size, I\u2019ll repay every credit you spend. You said. No need to. She said as her stomach rumbles. You stifle a laugh when yours rumbles too. Guess we have something in common. She said. Rey peels the plastic on one of the food packs and heats it in the microwave. When it\u2019s done, she feeds you a few pieces, which was more than enough for you, and eats the rest. I\u2019m full. You said. Same here. I\u2019m going to go shower. You want in? She said. Is that a trick question? You said. No. It\u2019s a simple yes or no. She said. O\u2026.Ok. You said. With a smile, Rey picks you up and takes you with her into the shower. You cover your eyes as she got undress, making her laugh at your modesty. Are you going to shower with your clothes on? She said. Well\u2026. I\u2026 You said. It\u2019s just me, Tyne. I\u2019m sure you saw me bare naked earlier today. She said. You did, but at that time, you didn\u2019t pay much attention. You take your clothes off and the sling. The pain in your arm was slowly going away. You guess a day or two before you can move it without any problems. Rey picks you up and giggles at you covering yourself. She steps into the hot shower. You watch intently as Rey washes herself. Enjoying the show over there? She said. Uh\u2026.. You said. I take that as a yes. For a shorty, you\u2019re a big pervert. She tease. When she\u2019s done, she cleans you off. I can't wash you properly if you're covering yourself. She said. I'm just....nervous. She said. Oh come on. Earlier today, i was bare naked in front you. Chest out, pussy showing, and my ass for all to see. I didn't care if you saw me naked. I was hoping you'd say something so i could make that cute face of yours red as a tomato. She said. W....Well..... If we're going to be sharing the same space.... You said. With an embarrassed look, you uncover yourself. Now was that hard to do? She said. Rey was staring at you with intrigue, and you know why and where she's staring at. At least, not everything on you is small. She said. Your whole face is red from her saying that. Rey started to clean you. Having her touch you all over sent very lucid thoughts through you head, but you wouldn\u2019t dare say them to her. You might not come out of this shower alive. You know, being small and having someone touch you all over, what are you thinking right now? She said. (Damn\u2026.) You thought. They must be very\u2026\u2026very vivid things. Let me guess one. You want me to keep rubbing until you pop. She said. Uh\u2026. You said. Maybe, if you play your cards right, those dirty thoughts of yours will come true. She said. Your face became red and it wasn\u2019t from the water and it made Rey laugh. When she\u2019s done, Rey cuts off the water and steps out. You put your cloths and sling back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo do you trust me now? She said as she sits on her bed. Yeah. I trust you. You said. Now was it that hard to? She said. I uh\u2026..guess not. You said. You were staring at her chest, which she caught onto. Keep staring and your eyes will fall out. She said. S\u2026.sorry. They\u2019re just\u2026.. You said. Just what? She said. Bigger than I thought they were. You said. Bigger, huh? She said. Rey brings you close and drops you between her breast and pushes them together in a playful manner. Rey could feel your little squirms and it made her laugh. There\u2019s no way out, Tyne! She said. Rey wanted to play a little with you, and since you were always eyeing her breast, this was the perfect way. (I really need to keep my mouth shut\u2026.) You said. You were enjoying her soft flesh being pressed against you. You had pressed against them and your hand sinked into them. After a few minutes of playing, Rey plucks you out. Had fun down there? She said. As sudden as that was, yeah\u2026. You said. You know, for everything you\u2019ve been through, I think you deserve a little reward. She said. Rey brings you closer to her mouth, which made you go wide eyed. (Is she\u2026) You thought. Her mouth opened slightly. Don\u2019t be scared. She whispered. She brings you to her lips and kiss you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t just a peak, this was a full body kiss. You were completely enveloped in her soft, warm lips. Rey breaks the kiss after a few seconds. Did you like your reward? She said. You couldn\u2019t speak from being surprised by the kiss, so you just gave her a big smile. I take that as a yes. There\u2019s more of those if you want them. She said. You still didn\u2019t say anything. Are you dead down there? She said. Rey placed the tip of her finger on your chest and feels your heart beating. Ah, so you are alive. I didn\u2019t think a kiss could make you so lose your tongue. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey noticed that it was getting dark. Looks like it\u2019s time for bed. And this time, you\u2019re sleeping with me. That\u2019s final.  She said. Rey gets into her bed with you. See this isn\u2019t so bad? She said. You were still looking for your tongue. Have you ever been kissed before? She said. You nod your head yes. Just not like that. Maybe in the morning, you\u2019ll learn how to speak again. She said. Rey pulls you closer to her check. Sweet dreams, Tyne. She said as she snuggled you. </span></div></div>",

Your slowly take in your surroundings as the sun light shines on you. You try to move, but can\u2019t. Oh, yeah. You said. You rub Rey\u2019s check until she wakes up. Morning already? She said as she sits up. She moves her hand in front of her. You slept well? She said. Yeah. No nightmare this time. You said. So you finally found your voice after i took it. She said. Well, I still had it. I just forgot how to form words. So what are we doing today? You said. I wanted you to decide. She said. Me? You said. It wouldn\u2019t be fair if we only did what I wanted. She said. Alright then. I want to try my hands at scavenging. You said. You sure? Your arm isn\u2019t fully healed. She said. We\u2019re living together, so I might as well contribute somehow. I don\u2019t want to seem like a parasite. You said. Who told you that? She said. Well\u2026.. After all you\u2019ve done for me, I can return the favor somehow. No good deed goes unpunished. You said. Rey starts to rub your head. Listen, I don\u2019t mind taking care of you. I don\u2019t know where you got parasite from, but you\u2019re not. You\u2019re my friend. Not parasite. Friend. She said. I know, but it doesn\u2019t sit well with me that you\u2019re going out of your way for me and not getting anything. You said. I don\u2019t want anything from you except your good health. We\u2019ll go scavenging, but don\u2019t think you have to pay me back. She said. Rey gets up and dresses in her scavenger outfit and drives to an Imperial star destroyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. This area should have something of value. She said. X wings, Tie fighters, Interceptors, bombers, and a Star destroyer. We\u2019re bound to find something. You said. You\u2019re still new at this. So the star destroyer is out of the question. Rey said. Ok. Baby steps. Start small and work up from there. You said. Rey heads to a Tie fighter with a missing wing. Ok. I\u2019ll take care of the outside of the ship. Can you pull out some wires from the inside for me? She said. You got it. You said. Rey puts you inside the fighter and you see most wires are fried. You pull out some wires and drag them to the opening. That\u2019s all? She said. Most of them were fried in the crash. You said. It\u2019ll work. She said as you walk onto her hand. Let\u2019s try something a bit more complex. She said. Rey takes you to an X wing and sets you inside one of the engines. Ok. Go through here and disconnect the engines from their circuits. I\u2019ll take care of the rest after that. She said. Give me a few minutes. You said. You head into the engine and come to the inner workings of the wing. Hm\u2026. I think these red wires are it. You said. You pull out a few of them and you see one of the engines come out. You pull out more of them and Rey pops out all four of the engines. You jump down onto the soft sand. Banged up a little, but they run. Nice work in there. She said. For a few hours, you and Rey scavenge any good parts you both can find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how am I doing? You said as Rey sits on the ground. Pretty good. You don\u2019t let your size slow you down or a hurt arm. How\u2019d you turn on that Tie fighter? She said. I crossed a few wires. Tuned off the weapons for extra engine power and on came the engines. She said. Got the engine working, dislodged the weapons, and took out a astro droid. You sure you haven\u2019t done this before? She said. First time. You said. She takes a drink of water and pours you some. You take a sip. We\u2019ve been out here for hours. You think we have enough? You said. More than. Any more and my speeder won\u2019t move. She said. Call it an early day? You said. Yeah. She said. Rey gets up and drives her speeder to the outpost. Rey unloads all her stuff. You know the drill. She said. Out of sight. You said. Rey tucks you away in her cleavage before she starts selling. You hear Rey engage in multiple conversations and wonder what her clientele are like. You climb up and stick your head out. As you\u2019re getting a good look, you are pushed back down. I take that as a no. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a couple of hours, all of Rey\u2019s salvage is gone. She makes sure no one is looking and pulls you out. Why were you trying to get out? She said. I wasn\u2019t trying to get out. I wanted to see what kind of people you sell to. You said. Yeah. Having your head stick out from between my chest while I do business is a good idea. She said. Was I that noticeable? You said. You\u2019re lucky I felt you moving or someone would have saw you. She said. Well, how did we- I mean you, do? You said. You had it right the first time. And we made 435 in credits. She said. That much?! Are you asking for an arm and leg too? You said. No. I don\u2019t overcharge people. Just a lot of people come to me. And I have what they want. She said. Well, a good day of business calls for a celebration. You said. I think you\u2019re right. She said. Rey heads into the cantina and sits at an open table. Think you can get past two this time? She said. Just wait. I know what I\u2019m up against now. You said. Rey orders her drink and downs it in one go. Show off. You said. You and Rey both drink and joke with each other until you call quits after 4. Wow. Two more than last time. She said. Just\u2026.*hic* wait till I get a tolerance*hic* like you. You\u2019ll be the one seeing triple. You said. I\u2019m actually surprised you can drink a normal glass size at your size. She said. Maybe\u2026..I still eat and drink the same amount as normal sized person. *hic*. You said. Right. I\u2019ll pay off the bartender. You try and not stumble off the table. She said. Don\u2019t worry your pretty self about me. You go and *hic* take care of stuff. You said. Pretty. I wonder if that\u2019s him or the drinks talking. Rey said with a blushed face. Rey gets up to pay the bartender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she\u2019s gone, a cloaked figure approaches the table. So I was right. I knew I saw that girl talking to a tiny person earlier. They said. And? You never seen a *hic* thumb sized person before? You said. No. I haven\u2019t. Which is why you\u2019re coming with me. She said. They reach for you and pick you up. From the softness of the hand, you can tell it\u2019s a human lady. Hey, lady. I\u2019m not going anywhere with you. You said. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in a position to argue. Whether drunk or sober, you are coming with me. And I think your friend is better off without you. She said. She stuffs you in her robe\u2019s pocket and walks out of the cantina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. I\u2019ve paid. Let\u2019s get- Tyne? Rey said. She doesn\u2019t see you on the table. D\u2026.Did he? No. Even in a stupor, he\u2019s not crazy. She said. Rey heads outside and sees you\u2019re not in the speeder. No\u2026. He couldn\u2019t have been\u2026. She said. With her teeth gritted and a one hand clenched into a fist, Rey grabs her staff. Tyne\u2026.. Just hang on. I\u2019m coming for you. She said. Holstering her weapon, Rey runs through crowds of people to find you.</span></div></div>",

You were toss back and forth until she stops and takes you out. Where *hic* are we? You said. Somewhere you should know. She said. Wait. Are going to-Sell you? Yes. She finishes. I\u2019m not no object here *hic* lady. I\u2019m a\u2026.person. You said. Who can barely stand, yet you are my ticket of this dirtball. She said. You really think someone would *hic* pay for me? You said. Handsomely. You said. You\u2026won\u2019t get away with this. You said. For the right price, I will. She said. As the minutes, ticked by, you slowly sober up. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to be sold like some object. You said. You start thinking of an escape plan when you see Rey with a worried look. Rey? Rey! Over here! You shout. Her gaze comes to see something small waving at her. Tyne?! She said. Rey runs over to you. I\u2019ve been searching for you. She said. Well, I wasn\u2019t playing a game of hide and seek. I was taken. You said. I know. I turn my back for one second. I\u2019m not letting you out of my sights again. She said. Rey reaches for you, but stops when a voice calls out. Unless you pay for him, step aside. It said. Oh no. You said. The hooded woman comes back. Pay? Has the heat fried your brain or something? You took him! Rey argued. Not my fault you left him there. You were basically saying take him. She said. Now I\u2019m saying give him back! He not yours! Rey said with her staff ready. Put that away. Like you\u2019re not already causing a scene. She said. It\u2019ll be more than a scene if you don\u2019t hand him over! Rey said. Look. We\u2019re both reasonable people here. Let\u2019s try and talk this out. She said. There\u2019s nothing to talk about! Hand him over, NOW! Rey said. Do you want more people to know about him? Lower your voice! She said. I hate to say it, but she\u2019s right. I don\u2019t want everyone to know about me. You said. \u2026\u2026Alright. For you, Tyne. Rey said. See. Now let\u2019s talk about like rational people. The lady said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you want with him? Rey said. Simple: Off this dirtball. Your friend is my ticket. She said. You plan on selling him?! Rey said. A tiny human\u2019s got to be worth something. She said. He\u2019s a person! Not some object to give away! Rey said. If you feel so strongly about it, you can take him. For a price. She said. You\u2019re going to be that greedy? You said. Call it what you want, but I\u2019m getting off this dustball one way or another. She said. How much are you going to charge for me anyway? You said. If she considers you a friend, she\u2019d give up all her credits. She said. You must be suffering from a heat stroke. Rey wouldn\u2019t-Done. Rey interrupts. You look up at her. Rey. That\u2019s all the credits you\u2019ve been saving plus made during selling. You said. I can make it all back. Here. Take it and go. Rey said. She drops all her credits on the table. You must care a lot about him. Maybe even more than a friend. But that\u2019s not my concern. A pleasure doing business. She said. Rey picks you up and heads to her speeder. She hops in and drives back home. It was a quiet ride. Neither of you said anything until Rey gets home. She hops out and slumps down against wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? You said. Why what? She said. Why\u2019d you give up all your earnings for me?! You said. Because you\u2019re my friend. She said. You don\u2019t give up all your life savings just for a friend. That\u2019s something you do for a\u2026. Wait. D-Do you see me more than a friend? You said. \u2026\u2026Maybe. What of it? She said. What do you mean \u201cMaybe.\u201d? You said. Maybe I see you as just a friend or maybe I see you more than a friend. She said. You\u2019re not making any sense. You said. Can\u2019t you be happy that I got you back from that woman? She said. I am! But I want to know why you gave up every last credit just for me. You said. Because you\u2019re my friend! Like I keep telling you! She said. Nobody gives up their life saving like that. Not for a friend. That\u2019s something you do for a love one. You said. Then it hits you. Rey\u2026\u2026 Do you\u2026.love me? You said. Rey looks away from you. You just can\u2019t leave well enough. She said. If you just tell me, I would. You said. I told you already! She said. Who are you trying to convince? Me? Or you? You said. I\u2019m not trying to convince anyone! I said I did it because you\u2019re my friend. You can take it or leave it, but I\u2019m done talking about it. She said. \u2026\u2026Alright. Fine. You did it for a friend. Nothing more, nothing less. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by normally, except you and Rey didn\u2019t speak to each other and gave each other distance. With the heated conversation, you think it\u2019s for the best for now. When night came, you decided to sleep in your makeshift bed. You were about to drifted off when you are picked up and placed on a soft pillow. You look at her as she lays down. You want to say something, but bit your tongue and just went back to sleep with your back to her. While you were sleeping, Rey sat up and looked at you sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it\u2026.. Why couldn\u2019t I just tell him? She said. Rey put her head in her hands. She did see you more than as a friend, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say it. At first, she saw you as a friend, but as she started to care for you more and more, a deeper feeling had formed in her heart. She knew it when you had called her pretty. She played it off as you being in a stupor, but her heart was pounding hard. There\u2019s no way it can happen now. He probably hates me now. With good reason. I lied straight to his face, and I\u2019d be lucky if he speaks to me. Let alone even look at me. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! She said. She was kicking herself over her chance at something more being gone. And after the way I talked to him, why would he even forgive me? What if he just ups and leaves me by myself? I'll be right back where i started. Alone. She said. Tears were forming in her eyes, but she held them back. I need to apologize to him. He forgave me after I hurt him. Maybe he'll forgive me again. But after all I said, he won\u2019t listen. I need to show I\u2019m sorry. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she said that, an idea pop into her head. Rey gently turned you over on your back. He\u2019s had fantasies about me. Maybe\u2026. If I make one of them come true, he\u2019ll forgive me. She said. Rey wanted you to forgive her, but is this the best way for it?</span></div></div>",

Slowly and gently, Rey takes off your undergarments and is wide eyed at what she sees. Whoa\u2026. How can he pack that away so easily? She said. Rey poked your member. Stiff as a board. She said. Rey has never done this before, but was willing to give it a try. She brings her face closer and puts her mouth on your crouch. She starts sucking and moving her head up and down. (I hope this works\u2026.) Rey thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sleeping well. You just wanted this day to be over and done with, and hoped tomorrow would be a better day for the both of you. As you were sleeping, you felt something on your lower half. Something wet. On your crouch area to be precise. It wasn\u2019t a bad feeling. It felt pretty good. Even pleasurable. You let out a small moan. (He moaned. He must like this.) She thought. Rey started to pick up the pace and use her tongue as well, making another moan escape. Rey took that as a sign to keep going. Even though she was doing this to make it up to you, Rey was enjoying this a little. After a few minutes, she felt something wet land on her tongue. (What is this? It\u2019s warm. And i feel a need to swallow it.) She thought. Rey lets go of your shaft and swallows your load just as you open your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyne.... She said. Rey\u2026.? What\u2026..are you doing over me? You said half asleep. She blushes heavily as you look around. You see your pants are down and your member is out and limp. You look up at Rey, who is a blushing. D\u2026.Did you blow me? You said. ......Yes. Hear me out, please. She said. Rey takes in a breath. I wanted to tell you I\u2019m sorry and the truth, but you wouldn\u2019t listen if I told you. So I\u2026.wanted to show you. She said. By blowing me? You said. I thought\u2026..it might be one of the things you thought about. If I played out one of them, you\u2019d listen to me. She said. \u2026\u2026Alright. You got me there. So what is it you thought I wouldn\u2019t listen to? You said. I\u2026.do see more than a friend. I wanted to tell you at a later time, but\u2026. When that lady mentioned it and you questioning me, it put me on the spot and I didn\u2019t know how to respond. So I denied everything. I wanted to apologize, but you\u2019d just put it off. So I thought if I\u2019d make one of your little fantasies come true, you\u2019d forgive me and wouldn\u2019t leave. She said. Leave? Where would I go, Rey? You said. I don\u2019t know. Somewhere\u2026. You were upset. She said. Ugh. You said as you pulled your pants back up. Rey. For starters, I\u2019m not going anywhere. Second, I wasn\u2019t upset. I just gave you space. You said. Is that why you didn\u2019t speak to me at all? She said. Thought it was for the best. You were pretty heated. You said. So you weren\u2019t going to leave? She said. For what? A vast desert at my size? I wouldn\u2019t last a minute. I got nowhere else to go. So I might as well bunk with a pretty lady. You said. P\u2026.pretty? She said as she touched her hair. Ok. Hot. Is that better? You said. Rey was blushing madly. N\u2026.no one has ever called me hot. She said. Well, first time for everything. You said. You and Rey looked at each other and you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo are we friends? Or more? You said. You said. More. Definitely more. She said. That\u2019s all you had to say from the get go. You said. Rey picked you up and kissed you for a few seconds. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry for giving you a hard time. She said. You give her a big smile, making her laugh. Voice gone again?  We\u2019ll work on that later, But for now, just stay in my arms. She said. Rey lays down with you in her embrace.</span></div></div>",

Rey was holding you close to her face, and you get an idea. You plant a kiss on her check and she quickly woke up with a jump, making you fall onto her bed. Morning. You said with a smile. T\u2026.tyne. Did\u2026.y\u2026.you just\u2026. She said. Heh. Who\u2019s speechless now? You said.  Rey starts blushing heavily. You ok over there? You said. I\u2019m\u2026..fine. Do I look like something is wrong? She said with a flushed face. You\u2019re talking fast and your face is red as a tomato. You said. I\u2019m\u2026.uh\u2026.. She said. Wait a minute. Rey\u2026.. You\u2019ve never been kissed before! You said. That\u2019s not\u2026.. I mean I have\u2026.. Well\u2026.. She said. Have you? You said. N\u2026.no. I haven\u2019t. She said. You hold back a laugh. It\u2019s not funny. She said. I\u2019m not laughing at you. I just find it hard to believe a pretty girl like you hasn\u2019t been kissed before. Not even a drunk kiss? You said. No\u2026. She said. You let out a small chuckle. I said it\u2019s not funny! She said. Ok, ok. But you got to tell me. What\u2019s the occasion? You said. Rey starts to twiddle with her hair. W\u2026.well. I\u2026.think a kiss symbolize the deep feeling between two people. Not something to do just because. She said. So you\u2019re waiting for Mr. Right? You said. A\u2026.and? Is that a bad thing now!? She said. You barely hold back a laugh, which angers her. Rey grabs you and holds you in front of her. Quit laughing or I\u2019ll send you on a one-way trip to my stomach! She said. Alright, alright. Calm down. It\u2019s just cute that you\u2019re waiting for Mr. Right. You said. Sorry I\u2019m not some harlot and actually have some sense of reality. You said. You might, but your expectations might not be. I bet Mr. Right needs to drive you everywhere and come to your beck and call. You said. You know, I haven\u2019t eaten yet and you\u2019re looking really good right now. Can\u2019t decide if I should chew or swallow you down? She said. Ok, ok. No need to be so threatening. I\u2019m done joking with you. You said. Thank you\u2026. Rey said. Long walks in the desert, scavenging and selling together, holding hands while staring at the moon\u2026.. You said. Rey grabs your leg with two fingers and dangles you close to her open mouth. One more time, and your grave is my stomach! She said. That was the last time. I promise. You said. Rey licks you and smiles mischievously. That\u2019s your only warning. Next time *Gulp* She said. Rey traces her throat and down to her stomach and rubs it tauntingly. Loud and clear. I\u2019ll stop. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey walks over to the counter and gently injects you with a stim. So\u2026. How are you feeling? She said. I can move my left arm a little. You said. Good. Hopefully, we can take that sling off by tomorrow. She said. Rey gently strokes you with her finger. You\u2019re not still angry, are you? You said. I don\u2019t like that you teased me, but\u2026. You\u2019re too cute to stay mad at. She said. So I don\u2019t have a date with your stomach acid? You said. No, shorty. You\u2019re a person. Not food. She said. Hey. If shorty is going to be my nickname, you need one too. You said. Fair enough. What will it be? She said. Hm. I like the name Titaness. You said. Titaness? Alright. She said. Rey lightly pats you on your head. You look up at her smiling when you notice she isn\u2019t wearing clothes. Uh\u2026. Rey? You\u2019re\u2026.naked. You said. And the problem is? She said. Just saying. At least I got a nice view. You said, eyeing her chest. Well, someone is starting to like living with me. She said. I prefer staying with a naked Titaness. So what are we doing today? More scavenging? You said. Have to get my credits back somehow. She said. Rey puts on her clothes, places you down her cleavage and drives to the downed star destroyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey comes to a stop and gets out. Bound to be something in there. She said. She pulls you out. We\u2019re doing the star destroyer?! You said. You\u2019re still new at this. She said. I can handle it. What do you need from that thing? You said. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you\u2019re still green. She said. So when do I get to have a go at it? You said. Maybe after a few more small ships and fighters, I\u2019ll let you at that destroyer. She said. I\u2019m holding you to that. You said. I know. Now help me with this transport. She said. Rey puts you through a small hole in the hull. You pull out and reroute some wires that opens up the shuttle for Rey to get in. Now. What still works? For hours, you and Rey scavenge parts from fighters, transports, and even a small cruiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to say, you really are good at this. She said. I do what I can. Have to take care of you until Mr. Right comes along. You said. Ha. Ha. Ha. So funny, I forgot to laugh. She said. Do you even know who Mr. Right is? You said. I\u2026.do\u2026 She said. So what\u2019s his name? You said. T\u2026..that\u2019s personal! She said. No more personal than walking around naked. You said. In my own home. She said. Well, you got me there. You said. Rey comes to a stop at the outpost. Ok Let me just unload everything first. She said. Rey unloads all of her items, then grabs you. I know the drill\u2026. You said. And no trying to peek neither. She said. You jump down into her cleavage and she pats you down. As you get settled, you hear the sounds of dealing and wait a while until Rey pulls you out. You must be a good luck charm! Rey said. What do you mean? You said. Eight hundred plus! She said. Eight hundred plus!? From scrap?! You said. I used to make no more than two hundred, but ever since you came along, I\u2019ve been making more and more. I put it off at first, but this is too good to be true. She said. Is that enough to cover how much you lost? You said. More than enough. This calls for a celebration. She said. Rey walks into the cantina and takes a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much\u2026.. From scarp and partially destroyed things\u2026\u2026 You said. I even can\u2019t believe it. She said. Rey downs her drink in one. Think you can keep up this time? She said. I know what I\u2019m up against now. You said. Really? How about a little wager then, shorty? She said. I\u2019m listening. You said. If I win, I get to play and use you any way I want to, and you have to refer to me as mistress. She said. Alright. If I win, next time we go scavenging, you have to do it naked, and tell me who this Mr. Right is. You said. Deal. Bartender! Another round! And don\u2019t stop! Rey said. The bartender nods and brings Rey her drinks. She downs it in one setting. Beat that. She said. Oh no. You\u2019re not showing me up this time. You said. You manage to drink all of yours in one go. I might enjoy this. She said with a smile. You and Rey down multiple drinks. You keep up with her, but you start to see triple after the eighth drink, and she\u2019s not even slurring her words. You can still back out. I won\u2019t think less of you. She said. N\u2026.no way. I\u2019m\u2026..not losing to you\u2026..this time. You said. You drink another. There\u2026. I can\u2026.still go on. You said. Persistent, but it\u2019s going to take more that. Get ready to call me \u201cMistress Rey\u201d! She said. And you\u2026..get ready to\u2026..scavenge\u2026..naked. You said. You both continue to drink, but in the end\u2026\u2026</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t beat yourself up. You got to 10. That deserves some recognition. She said. You must have a secret. That stuff is strong. How can you drink so much of it and not slur your words? You said. I have a high tolerance. She said. No way. No one has that high of a tolerance. Even a hutt has to say when. You said. Heh heh. You don\u2019t expect a girl to revel her secret? She said. Come on.

You said. Far from it. She said. Man\u2026. I got played by a scavenger. You said. A scavenger you have to refer to as mistress. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Fine. Mistress. You said. Not yet. Even though you lost, I\u2019m going to tell you what you want. You\u2019re going to tell me who Mr. Right is? You said. Yeah. And you\u2019ll be surprised who it is. She said. Who? You said. It\u2019s\u2026..you. She said. Wait, me?! You said. Is anyone else named Tyne? She said. Wait. When I had pressed you about caring for me, I thought it was like a brother/sister way. You said. I wouldn\u2019t blow my brother. You were talking about love\u2026. I thought you knew. She said. Well\u2026.. I do care for you, but I didn\u2019t know you were thinking like that. You said. Well I do. I\u2026.like you. She said. W\u2026.wait. Don\u2019t take this wrong, you are really pretty, but why me? Isn\u2019t there someone else around here? You said. No. I don\u2019t have time for creeps and sleazes. But you\u2019re different. You were nice to me. Even after I hurt you, you didn\u2019t hold it against me. You treated me like a friend. She said. To be honest, I was hoping for that when you gave me that stim the first time. You said. See. You didn\u2019t even know me yet, and you already thought of me as a friend. She said. Well with a pretty face and a cute smile like yours, how can I not? You said. And you compliment me. I\u2019m not use to getting compliments, so I still don\u2019t know how to act when you do. She said. Smile, laugh *Cough* *Cough* kiss. You said quickly. Rey laughs and kisses you on the head. And funny. I\u2019ve never met a person like you before. And I don\u2019t want to lose you. So\u2026..would you be my tiny boyfriend? She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2026\u2026Rey. Are you sure about what you\u2019re saying? This is a serious thing you\u2019re talking about. You said. I\u2019m dead serious. I\u2019ve never felt like this before about someone. I don\u2019t want to be just some girl to you. I want\u2026..to be your girlfriend. She said. Then\u2026.i\u2019d love to be your boyfriend. You said. Rey squeals with joy and hugs you. I promise. I\u2019ll be the best girlfriend ever! I\u2019ll take care of you and all! She said. Hey. I\u2019m not handicap. I can do things on my own. You said as she lets go. At half the size of my thumb and one good arm? She said. I\u2019ve grown\u2026..some. Almost the size of your thumb. And I can almost move my left arm. You said. Yeah. Almost doesn\u2019t count. When you get back to normal and both arms work, then we can talk. She said. I might not get back to normal size. You said. And that\u2019s even better! She said happily. You swallow hard, but Rey has been gentle and caring to you. She even asked before picking you up. So if you are stuck like this forever, you are glad that it\u2019s with her. You look up at her smiling face. \u2026\u2026If it\u2019s you, and only you, I wouldn\u2019t\u2026..mind staying like this. You said. Aww. That makes me feel special! She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow. To hold up my end of the bet. You said. Do you remember the terms? She said. I\u2019m at your total disposal, and I have to refer to you as mistress. You said. Good. And I already know what to do first. She said, picking you up. Hang on. We never said how long this would last for. You said. All today and tomorrow. Now, shut up and enjoy this. She said. Rey brings you to her lips and starts kissing you nonstop. Each kiss from her soft lips were in rapid succession, but to you, it felt like each kiss lasted longer and longer. *Kiss* *Kiss* How does it feel to be treated like this? You lose you voice every time I kiss you, so I\u2019ll make sure you never speak again. She said. Rey continues to barrage you with kisses for the next few minutes. When she stops, you have the biggest smile on your face. So. Can you speak after all that? She said.  Y\u2026..y\u2026..yes. You manage to say. You\u2019re forgetting something. She said. Y\u2026yes, mistress. You said. That\u2019s better. Now. What should I do with now? She said. You know Rey wouldn't take things too far with you, but you prepare yourself for whatever she has in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. I want you to.....</span></div></div>",

Rey sits down in one of her chairs and takes off her boots. Ahh. So much better. She said. Rey sits you down on the table and puts her feet up. You stare up and down at her foot; taking in how small you are to her feet. Jeez. Her toes alone are like the size of a rancor. Her whole foot is the size of starship. (And they nearly took my life.) You thought. As you stare, Rey lightly pokes you with her finger to get your attention. Don\u2019t be afraid, Tyne. History won\u2019t repeat itself. I know you\u2019re down at my feet. All I want is a little massage. She said comforting. You take a breath and touch her foot and it twitches. Hahaha! That tickles! She said. You could only use one arm, but you had to do this for her since you lost. So you move your hand up and down her foot. Rey throws her head back in bliss. Your hand feels so good on my foot. She said. As much as she\u2019s on her feet, they were in good condition. A little sweaty, but there were no other complaints. (Soft to the touch\u2026. My hand sinks in when I push. She must take care of them.) You thought. You rub for 30 minutes until she says stop. And where are my kisses? She said, faking annoyance. You give her foot a few good kisses. Now the other one. She said. You do the same to her other foot and finish it with kisses as well. Mmmm. My feet feel so good right now. She said. Rey puts her hand next to you and you climb on and brings you to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for the wonderful massage. Did they smell bad? She said. Not at all. You said. Ok. That\u2019s good. I saw you hesitate. Did you remember? She said. A\u2026.little. You said. I won\u2019t hurt you again. You got that? I nearly had a heart attack last time when I found out I broke your arm. That\u2019s as far as I want it to go. You\u2019re safe with me, ok? She said. O\u2026ok. You said. Ok what? She said. Ok, mistress. You said with a smile. That\u2019s better. Now. Come bathe with your mistress. She said. With you in her hand, Rey goes to her shower. Rey turns on the shower and gets undressed. You were still hesitant about undressing in front of her. Do I have to rip them off you? She said. No. Just still not use to this part. You said. We\u2019ve been over this before. She said. I know\u2026. You said. Working up the courage, you undress yourself. Rey steps into the shower and cleans you first. You\u2019re so filthy this time. She said. Scavenging will do that to you. You said. You\u2019re right about that. She said. Rey gently scrubs you down until you were clean. There we go. She said. Rey starts to wash herself when she notice you staring at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike what you see? She teases. S\u2026.sorry. I don\u2019t\u2026.mean to. You said. Calm down. I didn\u2019t say it was a bad thing. I find it\u2026.cute that you stare at me. She said. Cute\u2026.? You said. Yeah. Your constant staring means that you like my body. She said. If it was anyone else, you\u2019d bury them alive in the desert. You said. Right in the middle. But you\u2019re my little boyfriend, so I can\u2019t do that to you. And like I said, I find it cute that you\u2019re staring. She said. It\u2019s\u2026.not like I want to\u2026. I respect your privacy and all, but\u2026.. It\u2019s just that\u2026. You said. You\u2019ve never seen a naked woman until now. She said.  Yeah\u2026. That\u2019s it. You said. It\u2019s not like me with the kissing, but I guess we both don\u2019t have that much experience with the opposite sex. She said. Wait. Are you telling me that\u2026.. I\u2019m your first boyfriend!? You said. Is that surprising or something? She said. It\u2019s not. But someone pretty like you, I thought would have at least one or two. You said. I told you already, I don\u2019t have time for creeps and sleazes. You\u2019re different. You actually show interest in me. And you\u2019re nice and kind. You don\u2019t see that much around here. She said. It\u2019s just who I am. Especially if that person is pretty girl. You said smiling, making her laugh. And a flirt. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey went back to washing, but she did it slowly. Hm. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m clean yet. I hope no one is watching me. She said, winking at you. (For not having a boyfriend, she knows how to tease a guy.) You thought. Rey washes herself again, smiling as you watch her. When she starts on her chest, she moves her hand down and around slowly. As you watched, you notice your \u201cfriend\u201d was at attention. Rey giggles when she saw you trying to hide it. I\u2019ve seen it before, Tyne. No need to hide it. She said. I\u2026.guess you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve seen your\u2026..assets before. You said. And I have to say, I\u2019m impress. For a shorty, you carry a huge package. She said. Your face turns completely red from embarrassment. I gave you a compliment. What do you say? She said. Thank you, mistress. You said. Hehehehe! You\u2019re so cute when embarrassed! She said. Rey gets out of the shower and you dress yourself and jump back on her hand. She walks to her bed and sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I can have my say, you\u2019re not abusing this bet. You said. What did you think I\u2019d do to you? Shove you up my bum? Put you in my boots as an insole? She said. Something like that\u2026. You said. I\u2019m not going to abuse or use you like that. That\u2019s horrible. Only someone with an ego problem would get there fun that way. I prefer to get my fun from teasing you. She said. I know that now. You do know how to tease a guy. And I know tomorrow is going to be a full day of teasing. You said. And you can\u2019t refuse. She said, grinning. I know\u2026. Your wish is my command, mistress. You said. Aww! Such obedience needs to be rewarded. She said. What are you thinking of? You said. For tonight, you\u2019re sleeping between my breast! She said. I\u2019m what?! You said stunned. You heard me. She said. W\u2026.wait. Don\u2019t you toss and turn? You said. No. How I fall asleep is how I wake up. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be fine. She said. Rey drops you between her breast and you were surprised that you were staying there. There\u2019s no sweat. Or anything sticky. What\u2019s keeping me in place? You said. You\u2019re not just cute, you\u2019re adorable down there! She said. Rey lays down on her back so it will be easier for you to breath. She rubs your head and giggles. Sweet dreams, Tyne. She said. Rey goes to sleep and, hearing the soft beating of her heart, you slowly drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You notice that you were right where Rey left you. Speaking of her, you hear the light snoring coming from her. Soundly like a baby. You said. You stand up and walk to her face. She\u2019s like a baby. You said. Tyne\u2026.. You\u2019re being\u2026.so affectionate. She said. And talking in her sleep? Now that\u2019s cute. You said. You kiss her on the check. This time, she doesn\u2019t jump up, but a smile forms on her face. And I\u2019m the cute one. You said. You are\u2026. She said, opening her eyes and looking at you. Rey grabs you by your leg and dangles you above her mouth and starts kissing you. So cute, I could eat you. She said. (Oh boy. I know where this is going.) You thought. In fact, I am a little hungry. And I have the perfect snack. She said. Rey brings you closer and licks you from head to toe. Mmmm. Tasty! Might be a tough swallow with all those clothes on, but you'll go down in the end. She said. Rey opens her mouth and holds you close. Heh heh! I\u2019m gonna eat you! She said in a singsong voice. (She's really enjoying this bet.) You thought. Rey licks you a few more times before dropping you. You freefall and land right onto her puckered up lips. You stay there for a second before Rey picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy weren\u2019t you scared? I went out of my way to make that convincing. She said, pouting. I knew what you were going to do when you said could. You said. Awww. It\u2019s no fun when you know what I\u2019m going to do. She said. I'll try and act surprised next time. You said. Rey gets up and heads to the counter. She sits you down and injects you with a stim. Ok. How does your arm feel? She said. You take the sling off and move your left arm around. Like it was never hurt to begin with. Thanks! You said. Don\u2019t mention it. She said. I owe you\u2026.. Well, everything I have. If I could give you my name, I would. I\u2019ll pay you back every credit somehow. You said. I don\u2019t want you to. It was my fault for hurting you in the first place, so it\u2019s was my responsibility to take care of you. She said. But I didn\u2019t want you spend your credits on me. They are hard enough to come around on this planet. A cute girl like you should keep her credits. You said. Flattery won\u2019t change my mind, shorty. She said, smiling. Let me just\u2026.think of a way at least. I don\u2019t want you to think I don\u2019t appreciate you. You said. Tyne\u2026.. \u2026\u2026Alright. But if you can\u2019t think of anything, then don\u2019t bother. I\u2019m perfectly fine. She said. Whatever mistress says. You said. And don\u2019t you forget it. She said, poking you. Rey puts on her clothes and you climb onto her hand. She heads to her speeder and drives to the outpost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are we doing here? She said. I need to get a few things for us. Stay here. She said. Rey hops out and goes into one of the many shops. Ok. How can I pay her back? You said. While you were thinking, a voice broke your concentration. Still around? So she does care. A familiar voice said. Oh. It\u2019s you. You said. You look to see it\u2019s the hooded lady who tried to sell you. Seems like I was right. She does care for you more than a friend. She said. Yeah. Pat yourself on the back. Weren\u2019t you suppose to be gone by now? You said. I\u2019m well on my way out. My flight arrives in a few minutes. Thought I see if you were still around. She said. Whatever. Look. I need some help and you seem to know this planet well. You said. Too well. But what do you need from me? I tried to sell you. Remember? She said. I know, and I\u2019ve gotten over it. I want to pay Rey back for her kindness, but I can\u2019t think of anything. Do you know anything at all that would be good? You said. Well..... Normally I don\u2019t do this, but I can make an exception for you. You\u2019ve seen that destroyed star destroyer? She said. Multiple times. You said. On board there is an artifact of the Emperor Palpatine. It was bound for his vault of conquests, but it was shoot down when the Empire and Rebellion fought over Jakku. If you can find it, you can sell it and make a grand fortune. She said. A grand fortune\u2026.. That will be more than enough. What\u2019s it look like? You said. You know what a holocron looks like? She said. Yeah. They come in different shapes. You said. It\u2019s a square one. Find it and it\u2019s yours. She said. Hold on\u2026. If you knew about this artifact, why didn\u2019t you go for it? You said. I did, but couldn\u2019t find it. Maybe you\u2019ll have better luck. She said. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this to you, but thanks. You said. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, my flight is her. She said. She heads onto a shuttle just as Rey walks out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got what we needed. We\u2019ll be good for this week and next. She said. Rey\u2026.. I need to ask you something. What is it? She said. Can\u2026..we go scavenge the star destroyer? You said. I know you\u2019re eager for it, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready yet. She said. But I know I can do it. I\u2019ve taken out weapons systems, targeting computers, even engines. I can handle that destroyer. Just give me a chance at it. You said. Rey remains quiet for a few seconds. \u2026..Ok. We\u2019ll scavenge that destroyer, but I\u2019m tacking on an extra day to our bet. She said. I won\u2019t disappoint, and I'll be very careful. You said. Rey starts up her speeder and drives to the star destroyer. Ok. We\u2019re here. She said. You climb onto her hand and she gets out. Rey walks into the giant hole in the hull of the ship. So this is Imperial engineering? I\u2019ll give them credit, they know how to build a ship. She said. Rey stops when she gets to engineering and sees intact, but deactivated droids. We can start here. I\u2019m take apart these droids. You see if these consoles work. She said. Got it. You said. Rey puts you down on the console and starts to take apart the droids. You jump down from the console and quickly leave. Ok. Now to find that artifact. If it goes well, I can pay back Rey every single credit she spent. Maybe even enough to get her off this planet. You said. You start looking around for the artifact.</span></div></div>",

It won\u2019t take her long to dismantle those droids. You said. You look around what looks like a quarter for troopers. Wouldn\u2019t be where they keep the troopers. I\u2019m just wasting time. You said. You squeeze back through the door. You head down the corridor and take a right and go through the blown open door. This seems like storage. Maybe here. You said. You look around and check in the overturned metal boxes, but find nothing. Damn. It\u2019s not here. You said. You look around and see the blown holes in the metal floor. A chance it fell in one of these holes, but which one? You said. As you were contemplating, you heard rapid footsteps. She\u2019s done already? Damnit! You said. From the sounds of the footsteps, they were heading your way. You quickly chose a hole at random and jump down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall down and land hard on the metal linings and wires. Oh\u2026\u2026 That hurt\u2026.. You said. You slowly get up and hit your head on a metal pipe. Ow! You said. You take a step and fall to the ground. You rub your head as your sense come back. Ugh. How am I going to find that artifact? You said. You lean against something when you meant to fall over. What the? You said. You look to see that you\u2019re laying against the artifact. T\u2026..the artifact! You said joyfully. You take a breath of relief. Ok. I\u2019ve found it. Now I need to get it out. I think I can push it. You said. With all your strength, you manage to move the artifact. You keep pushing and pushing until you get tired and take five. If my knowledge is correct, the metal lining around here, I should be around the hanger or the engines. You said. You brace against the artifact and start pushing. You push and push until the artifact falls down onto a catwalk. You fall down and land on top of it. Ok. Now to just push this thing until I come across Rey. Judging from where I am, I\u2019d say I\u2019m where the hanger used to be. You said. You get back to pushing it across the catwalk and into the hanger overlook. Not that far to go. You said. You push some more and take a break. This thing better be worth a lot of credits. You said. You hear rapid footsteps at you start pushing. Rey! You said. Tyne?! Tyne!! Where are you!? She said. Rey looks around feverishly for you. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have agreed with him! If something happened to him\u2026.. Tyne!! She shouts. Rey looks around and sees a square, glowing object moving to her. What\u2026..is that? She said. Rey picks up the object and sees you hanging on. Tyne!! She said. Rey plucks you off the artifact and hugs you tightly. I should go missing more often. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did you go!? Do you have any idea what was going through my mind!? Or how worried I was!? She said. Well, I was thinking of way to pay you back. An old acquaintance of ours told me about an artifact of great wealth. You said. You didn\u2019t\u2026. She said. I know, but if I\u2019d told you, you wouldn\u2019t come here. And I wanted to get back ever single credit you lost. It was wrong of me to lie to you. You said. And? She said. And dangerous to look alone in a giant ship. You said. And? She said. And I\u2019d should have dropped the whole thing from the beginning. You said. And? She said. And I\u2019m sorry for making you worry about me. You said. Rey looks at the artifact. You gave me a heart attack over this object; so you can pay back all the credits I willingly and happily spent on you. Am I right? She said. When you say it, it sounds horrible. You said. It is! I said you didn\u2019t have to do this. She said. I know\u2026. You said. \u2026..How much did she said it would be worth? Rey said. A grand fortune. It looks grand in value, so I though it would get you all your credits back plus enough for a ticket off this planet. If you wanted to. I just\u2026.wanted to return the favor. You said. *Sigh* Your heart was in the right place at least. Plus, I can\u2019t stay mad at you, shorty. You\u2019re just too cute for it!  She said. So\u2026.you forgive me? You said. Promise to never do something like this again? She said. Never again. Mistress's word is law. You said, making her laugh. With you on her shoulder, Rey heads out of the destroyer and to her speeder and drives to the outpost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t planning on selling today, but if you\u2019re positive that this will net a fortune, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll wait in the speeder. You said. Rey sets down the few items she had plus the artifact. You wait a while until Rey comes back. Before you could say anything to her, she picks you up and barrages you with kisses. Whoa! Whoa! Rey! You said, between kisses. You were right!! It was worth a fortune! She said. H\u2026.how much was it? You said. The person bought it for ten thousand! She said. That much!?! You said stunned. Too much to carry home, so I had to get an account. And it\u2019s all thanks to you! She said, kissing you again. Who was the person? You said. It was some archaeologist sort. He saw the thing, and said it was a real sith holocron. Offered ten thousand credits for it, and gave me a finders fee as well. She said. So you made ten thousand plus off that thing? You said. Because of your insistent of paying me back. Thank you! She said. So no need to stay out here anymore. You said. Rey gets in and drives back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen thousand credits\u2026.. Never have I\u2019d imagine making or seeing that much. She said.That should more than cover my debt to you. You said. I know you wanted to Tyne, buy you never owed me. I told you it was my responsibility because I hurt you. The only thing I wanted was you in good health. She said. I didn\u2019t want to seem ungrateful. I mean. A pretty scavenger nurse me back to health and spends her hard earned credits on me and gets nothing back? Not in my books. You said. You have a big heart. And that\u2019s a rare thing on Jakku. She said. Call it a good upbringing. So what are you going to do with all those credits? You said. I\u2019ll think about it later. Right now\u2026.. She said, picking you up. You owe your mistress for lying to her and giving her a panic attack. She said. O\u2026of course, mistress. What do you need? You said. You\u2019re going to\u2026..</span></div></div>",

She said, winking at you. I\u2019m\u2026..not following, mistress. You said. Come on. Use that brain in there. A special way. She said. You think for a minute. Oh\u2026. OH! You mean like!? You said. You bet your cute head. She said. H\u2026how would I even\u2026. You said. Use that imagination of yours. She said. I\u2026.don\u2019t think my body would handle that. You said. You\u2019re selling yourself short. Plus, I know you\u2019ve dreamed of it. She said. In my dreams, I\u2019m normal size doing it. You said. The experience will be better at that size. She said. I\u2026. You said. You have to. Remember? She said. As\u2026.mistress commands. You said. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be very gentle with you. She said. Rey undress and walks over to her bed. Come on. Lose the clothes. She said. You take off all your clothes. Ready? She said. You take a few breaths and give a thumbs up. Rey moves you past her waist line and to her womanhood and shoves you in. Ah! She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain your senses from the forceful thrust. I\u2026I\u2019m in her\u2026..! You said stunned. You notice that it was a tight squeeze. Never thought I\u2019d be inside a woman like this. You said. You can hear Rey moaning as you gather yourself. If I want out, I have to play. You said. You crawl deeper inside her, making her moan more. Ohhhh\u2026. Yes\u2026. Rey said, in bliss. She\u2019s enjoying this. If I don\u2019t drown or die from the pressure in here, I might try this again. You said. Your movement was causing Rey more stimulation than she thought. Yes! I\u2019m almost there!! She said. You had reach the sweet spot when you saw a rush of juice coming your way. \u2026\u2026Shit. You said. You are washed away and pushed out as Rey reaches climax. You land on the bed as Rey catches her breath. Have\u2026..to\u2026.do that\u2026..again sometime. She said. You breath hard and cough out juice. Man\u2026. That was an experience\u2026.. You said. As you get to your feet, you are picked up and dried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was it? She said. Not how I imagine my first time. You said. You were amazing. I feel completely relax now. Good job. She said. Whatever mistress says. Are you pleased? You said. Very. We have to do that again sometime. She said. You jump from her hand to put your clothes on. So what now, mistress? You said. I can think of one thing. She said. Rey hoisted you up by your leg and are dangles you over her face. She brings you close and starts kissing you. R\u2026.Rey? You said. Shhhh. Relax, and enjoy yourself. You\u2019ve done a lot for me. Now it\u2019s my turn. She said. Rey barrage you with kisses, and with each one she gave you, giggled as your face got redder and redder. Awww! You\u2019re so cute with a red face! She said. She kisses you a few more times, then holds you against her chest in a hugging manner. M....mistress. What brought this on? You said. For being a good sport and cute as a button, you deserve a reward. She said. Rey holds you there for a few minutes before she stands up. She walks over to the counter and put you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungry? She said. A little\u2026.. You said. A little? I can hear your stomach from here. She said. Right on cue, your stomach growled loudly. Ok. I am. You said. Uh-huh. Your mistress knows her tiny servant. She teases as she pokes you. Rey takes out and heats up one of the food packs. Once it was done, she gives you a few pieces and you scarf them down. Wow. You must have been starving. She said. Rey gives you a few more pieces until you couldn\u2019t eat anymore. Full? She said. Yeah. I can\u2019t eat any more. You said. You burp loudly. You look up at Rey and she laughs. She lets out a loud burp as well and you both laughed. Once you both were done, you climb onto her hand and she takes you back to her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does mistress have planned now? You said. To keep playing with you. Day\u2019s not over just yet. She said. May I ask how? You said. Maybe another trip down there\u2026.. You were so wonderful. She said, smiling. Uh\u2026.. Can we do that another time? You said. What\u2019s the magic word? She said. Please, mistress? You said. Alright. Because you asked nicely. Plus, I have other ideas of fun we can have. She said. Are\u2026..they safe ideas? You said. Of course they are. I don\u2019t want anything to happen my little boyfriend. She said. If mistress says so. You said. And don\u2019t forget it. She said. Rey places you on the ground and places her feet next to you. Climb me. She said. Mistress? You said. You heard me. Climb me like a mountain. And as an incentive, I\u2019ll let you decide your reward. She said. I get to decide? You said. It can be anything, and I mean anything, you want. She said seductively. Watching you stand there stunned, Rey giggles. Don\u2019t just stand there. Don\u2019t you want your reward? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab onto her toe when you stopped. You got an idea. Rey was enjoying herself and you were as well, but you wanted to have some fun of your own. You wanted to see how she would react to you refusing her. She is a nice a reasonable person, so you hope she would see you just playing. Do you go with your idea or keep playing it safe?</span></div></div>",

No. You said. So why haven\u2019t you started yet? She said. Don\u2019t want to. You said. What do you mean by that?! You lost the bet. She said. And that means\u2026..? You said. It means you have to listen and do what I say! She said. I\u2026.don\u2019t remember agreeing to that. You said. You\u2026.. Ohhhh. I see what you\u2019re doing. She said. Doing what? You said, smiling. Rey lifts you up by the leg and holds you in front of her grinning face. So you\u2019re rebelling against your mistress, huh? She said. Yeah. I had enough. You said.  And you think I will just let you go against me? You\u2019re mine to own and play with as I see fit. Someone needs a reminder of what I can do to him. She said. I\u2019m not scared of you. Do your worst. You said. I intend to. Seems like someone forgot their place. Such disobedience needs to be punished. She said. Rey toss you into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land onto her moist tongue. Mmmmm! She said. Rey tosses you onto her teeth and holds them close to you, especially her incisor, which is near your head. Then tilts her head to the side and you roll onto her tongue. She licks you multiple times and tilts her head back and you slide to her throat, but she tilts her head forward and you slide and fall right onto her hand. Enjoyed your little trip? She said. Oh\u2026.. Anyone catch the number of that freighter? You said. See how easy it is? I can swallow you with little effort. You\u2019ll be nothing but a piece of candy. I\u2019ll enjoy you, then swallow you. Still want to rebel against me? She said. You look up to see her smile and wink at you. Heh\u2026. I\u2019m not scared of your mouth or a little acid bath. You said. Want to test that theory? She said. She opened her mouth and brought you to it, but pull you away. On second thought, No\u2026. You don\u2019t deserve the privilege of becoming a part of me. You deserve something else. She said. She thinks for a few seconds before getting an idea. Rey drop you onto the ground. As you stand up, a shadow is cast over you. You look up to see her bare foot coming down on you, and pinning you under her big and second toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember this? You almost died as an insignificant bug under my boot. This time, I\u2019ll finish the job. She said. Rey adds a little pressure to your body.  Ohhhh. You feel good under my foot. I wonder how your guts and blood will feel on them? She said, smiling evilly. You wouldn\u2019t\u2026..! You said. Rey lifts and hovers her foot a few feet above you. Think I won\u2019t? I crush bugs like you on a daily basis. Preferably barefoot, so I can feel their bodies crunch under me. You\u2019ll join them too. Unless you resubmit to my authority. She said. You could see Rey was holding back her smile and laughter as she acted out. (She\u2019s enjoying this fake rebellion I\u2019m doing. Making mistress happy.) You thought. So. Are you going to submit? Or do you and my foot want to be the closet of friends? She said. Go ahead and kill me. Cause I\u2019m not going back. You said. Have it your way. She said. You roll out the way as her foot hits the ground. Think I\u2019ll make it that easy? Have to catch me first. You said. You run away just as Rey stands up. You\u2019re not getting away from me! She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran and hid behind some fallen pieces of metal as Rey passed by. You can\u2019t hide forever. She said, smiling. She\u2019s loving this. You said. Rey looks in her bathroom, the kitchen, and on her shelf. Running out of hiding spots, Tyne. It\u2019s won't be long before i find you. She said. (This is much more fun than what I had plan. Shorty knows how to entertain his mistress.) She thought. Rey searches up and down the inside of the AT-AT, but comes up empty. Where did you go, Tyne? She said. As she thought, her eyes come to the few items on the ground. Under my nose the entire time. She said. Rey picks up the items one by one. You know she will soon find you, so you ran from behind your hiding spot and bolt for a new one; hoping Rey didn't see you.</span></div></div>",

From your new hiding spot, you chuckle. She\u2019s cute when she\u2019s surprised. You said. You digged a hole in a small sand mound and watched as Rey looked around for you. With each step she took, the mound shaked. Having a giant, naked woman looking for you\u2026. Is that a good thing? You said. You peaked out to see her still looking. Where would I hide if I was his size? She said. Rey\u2019s massive feet were right in front of your spot. Can\u2019t be that many places he could get into. She said. Rey walks away and you laugh. As the minutes tick by, you saw her looking and coming up empty. You\u2019re only making this worse on yourself! She said. This is getting good. I\u2019ll wait a few more minutes before coming out. You said. When you peaked out, you had saw Rey\u2019s knees where on the ground, right in front of your spot. Uh-oh. You said. I know you\u2019re hiding in there. If I have to dig you out, you won\u2019t like it. She said. She\u2019s bluffing. You said. Rey waits for a minute, but you don\u2019t come out. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. She said. Rey digs through the sand mound until her hand feels something. Gotcha! She said. Rey brought her hand up and open it. Found you, little rebel. She said. Oh boy. You said. You rebelled against your mistress. There\u2019s only one punishment for a crime like that. She said. Rey closes her hand around you and gets up. After walking and sitting down on her bed, she opens her hand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to punish you. She said. You brace for whatever when you felt something being pressed against you. You open one eye to see Rey is kissing you. Your punishment is one thousand kisses of death! She said. D\u2026..death? You said. Rey kisses you multiple times; assaulting you with soft lips. I\u2019ll kiss you until you go limp. She said. With each kiss Rey gives you, you found it hard to breath. Rey saw this and stops. It\u2019s getting hard to breath, huh? This is what happens to disobedient servants. She said. She then gives you one long kiss that literally took your breath away. *Gasp* Gasp* You\u2026. You said. They\u2019ll only get longer and longer, little rebel. Each one cutting it closer and closer. She said. You regain your breath and look up at her. Since you were a good servant, I\u2019ll make this offer once. Resubmit to your mistress\u2026.. or be kissed to death. She said. Knowing that you\u2019re beat, you give up. I submit to you, mistress. I\u2019m sorry for rebelling. You said. That\u2019s a good boy. She said, smiling victoriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey kisses you on the head. I had so much fun! Was that your plan from the get go? She said. Wanted to see how you\u2019d react to me refusing. You were enjoying yourself. You said. I was enjoying the game, although it killed me inside to threaten you. But I had a role to fill. And It was so fun and cute watching you fight back. She said. Same to you. You really got into it. You said. What kind of mistress lets her servant defy her? She said, rubbing your head. A bad one? You said. Right. And I\u2019m no bad mistress. My little servant will listen to me. She said. As you say, mistress. You said with a bow. That\u2019s my obedient shorty. She said, kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what would you like your reward to be? She said. You\u2019re\u2026..still offering that? You said. For the fun game you made me play? Of course. So. What does my little boyfriend want? It can be anything you desire. She said. Anything? I\u2026.don\u2019t know. You said. There must be something you want. She said. Well, if you\u2019re going to play that, I need to find a way to repay you. You said. Oh, no. You promised not to do something crazy for me. She said. Crazy. You didn\u2019t say anything about normal. She said. You know what I meant by that promise, shorty. Do I have to pull rank? She said. No. I understand mistress\u2019s word. And her word is law. You said. Such a good servant. Now. Why don\u2019t you tell your mistress what you desire. She said. I\u2026.can\u2019t ask anything of you. I already owe you everything I have. You said. What did your mistress say about you owing her? She said. That it\u2019s unnecessary and all she wants is my good health. You said. And that\u2019s final. I don\u2019t want you owing me. She said. As you say, mistress. So come on. I\u2019m waiting on your answer. She said. W\u2026well\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Plus, I can\u2019t ask a pretty girl for a favor. I\u2019ll look bad. You said. To who? The other little people? She said. You never know. They could be around. You said. So I have more little people in and around my home? She said. I\u2019m sworn to secrecy. You joke. Secrecy, huh? I demand you tell me if there are others! She said. Demand? On whose authority?

That\u2019s a good servant. Now, come kiss your mistress. She said. Rey brings you to her face and you walk up to her lips and she kisses you. You\u2019re enjoying this power, aren\u2019t you? You said. A little. She said. Rey places you on her pillow as she lays right next to you. I want you to stay right here tonight, so in the morning, you\u2019re the first thing I see. She said. As mistress says. You said. Rey places her hand over you. She kisses you on the head before you both fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey wakes up, but doesn\u2019t see you in her hand. She thought she was dreaming, but as her vision became clear, she wasn\u2019t dreaming. Tyne? She said a little frantic. Rey then felt something moving between her breast. Rey blushes as she looks to see you down there, snuggling against her breast. There you are. She said as she fishes you out. Oh, Tyne\u2026. Wake up\u2026. Your mistress needs you. She said, with a smile. You turn over and hug Rey\u2019s index finger, and she giggles. Just when I thought you couldn\u2019t get any cuter. She said. Rey pokes you a few times, but you don\u2019t stir. How do I wake up a tiny? She said. Rey heads to her shower and turns on the water, but it was ice cold. Wakey wakey! She said. Rey holds you in the shower as the cold water washes over you. Whoa! You said as you grip her finger tighter and shiver. Rey giggles as she turns off the water. R\u2026..r\u2026\u2026rey? W\u2026..was this your\u2026..doing? You said, freezing. Me? No! She said with an innocent smile. I\u2026.innocent as\u2026..a b\u2026.baby wampa rat. You said. Rey walks to her the counter and takes off your clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet those dry so you don\u2019t freeze to death. She said. Now I\u2019m c\u2026.cold and naked. You said. And? She said. Still not use to it. You said. Why not? I get to see you in all, and I mean all, your glory. She said. You start to sweat a little. For some reason, I\u2019m not cold anymore. You said. So I don\u2019t need to do this? She said. Rey picks you up and hugs you. W\u2026.what are you!? You said, shocked. Isn\u2019t it obvious? I\u2019m warming you up with my body heat. She said. H\u2026.hold on a second. Did you have this all planned out?! You said. Nope. And that\u2019s the best part! You. Me. Naked and in each other\u2019s arms. I love it when things work out for me in the end. She said. T\u2026.this girl is either smart or lucky. You said. Being held against her warm body, It didn\u2019t take long before your body temperature returned to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that\u2019s enough Rey. You said. Aww. But I\u2019m enjoying this. My body heating up your body\u2026.. Aren\u2019t you enjoying this? She said. As much as I love being right next to your breast, I don\u2019t want to suffocate or over heat. You said. Can\u2019t have that. Who else will I find cute? She teases. Rey lets go of you. Speaking of being there\u2026. Why were you there when I told you to stay in my hand? She said. I\u2026.got cold last night. I\u2019m talking about teeth clattering cold. So I wormed out from your hand and went to the only warm spot I could get to. I wouldn\u2019t disobey mistress if it was anything else. You said. Hmmm\u2026. You disobeyed a command from your mistress.... Which is unacceptable. She said. Rey pokes you and you fall over. But..... Since you've been on the up and up after your little rebellion, I think I can forgive your disobedience this one time. She said. Thank you, mistress. You said. For my leniency, you owe me a kiss. She said. Rey holds you to her lips and you kiss them. Such a good little one. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026. Does mistress have anything plan? You said. I have a few things plan. Things that we're going to enjoy. She said. We are? What are they? You said. Use your imagination. I\u2019ll give you a hint, though. Just you *Kiss* and me. She said seductively. Since when did you have a dirty mind? You said. I have a little boyfriend now. So I need to make sure he\u2019s happy. She said. Guess that means I need to make sure my titaness girlfriend is happy as well. You said. With you, I can\u2019t be anything but happy. She said. Then I\u2019ll make you happier. You said. You\u2019re about to\u2026. Unless you want me to go first. She said. </span></div></div>",

You crawl deeper and deeper inside her, exciting her more. Her moans got quicker and quicker as you find a sweet spot and agitate it. YES!! She said. Within a few minutes, Rey reaches climax as her eyes roll into her head and you are pushed out in a violent wave of her juice.

Rey gets up and undo her hair to let it fall down. Just sit back and enjoy the show. Now. How did that Twi\u2019lek dance go? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey starts to swing her hips and move her body in fluid motion as if music was playing. She\u2019s dancing like she\u2019s done this before. You said. During the dance, Rey brushes her hair and winks at you. She then bends down and jiggles her breast in front of you. You reach to touch them, but Rey pushes you over with her finger. Ah, ah, ah, little one. No touching. She said. Rey turns around, and rises to her full height, arching her back and giving you a nice view of her perfect rear. Rey then puts her hands through her and starts shaking her body around. She then does a sharp turn and shakes her body before crouching down to your level and kiss you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDid you like my dance? She said. I\u2026.had no idea you could dance like that. You said. For a certain someone, whose name starts with a T and who I love dearly, I\u2019ll do anything they want me to do. She said. So you\u2019ve been seeing someone else behind my back? You said, smiling. His name is Tyne. He\u2019s cute, considerate, kind, and I can put him in my pocket. She said. Don\u2019t stop there. Keep the complements coming. You said. Don\u2019t get a big head, shorty. She said. Rey gives you a passionate kiss, licking you a few times before breaking it. I love you. She said. I love you too, Re- I mean, mistress. You said. Giggling at your mistake, she gets up and puts her clothes on and redo her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019re going somewhere? You said. Just because I have 10,000 credits, doesn\u2019t mean I can get complacent. She said. Fair enough, but I thought you\u2019d get off this planet. You said. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I want to. But what will I do? Scavenging is all I know. She said. You could be a dancer. You\u2019d put all those Twi\u2019lek dancers to shame. You said. I don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s only for your eyes only. She said. How about becoming a bounty hunter? You go the attitude and fighting skills. And you'd never have to worry about credits again. You said. Hmm. I get to travel and see the galaxy, but..... I don't like the concept of being paid to kill. She said. Rey picks you up and rubs your head. I like that you're thinking about me, but don\u2019t worry about me, alright? As long as I have my tiny boyfriend, I\u2019ll be fine. She said. Ok\u2026. You said. Rey puts you down her cleavage and makes sure you\u2019re perfectly secure. Wait. You\u2019re not going to let me put my clothes on? You said. I like feeling your skin on mine. Don\u2019t you won\u2019t to feel my breast in all their softness without those pesky clothes getting in the way? She said. They do feel softer without them\u2026.. You said. Then it\u2019s settle. She said, squeezing them together. Rey gets into her speeder and drives to a graveyard of star fighters.</span></div></div>",

Rey walks up to one of the many down fighters and starts taking it apart. It\u2019d go a lot faster if I\u2019d help. You said. No. You\u2019re not dressed for this kind of work. You'll hurt yourself. She said. Have a feeling you left my clothes on purpose\u2026.. You said. Ding! She said. For a scavenger, you\u2019re smarter than you look. You said. I\u2019ll take that as a compliment. She said. For an hour or so, Rey takes apart a few fighters and only takes the parts that are valuable or still works. After a while, she takes a seat against the back of an x wing and takes you out. Are you done? You said. No. Just resting. Plus, I wanted to do this. She said. Rey brings you closer to her and kiss you. Feeling her soft lips on you made you forget about the bearing heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat brought that on? You said. You\u2019re so cute like this, it\u2019d be a crime not to kiss you! She said. Well, my cuteness is nothing compared to your beauty. You said. *Laugh* Quit it. I\u2019m a mess. Covered in sweat and sand\u2026. You think I\u2019m beautiful. She said, blushing. I\u2019m mostly covered in sweat and a little bit of saliva, and you think I\u2019m cute. You said. It\u2019s a hard fact to deny. You are cute. She said. And you\u2019re beautiful. You said. Rey blushes deeply and gives you another kiss. She was about to give you another when she heard the sound of footsteps. Someone\u2019s here. She said. I don\u2019t hear anyone. You said. Trust me, I know when someone\u2019s coming. She said. Rey knows someone is nearby, but she can\u2019t do anything about it if you\u2019re in harms way. As difficult as it was for her to do so, Rey places you gently behind a fallen engine. Stay there. Whatever happens, don\u2019t come out. She said. Wait. You don\u2019t know who or how many people there are. What if you get hurt? You said. Better me than you. If a fight happens, I won\u2019t have to worry about your safety. She said. And have me worry about yours. You said. Tyne. Please. If something happens to you, I\u2026\u2026 don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. She said. Rey\u2026.. You said. Trust me, I\u2019ll come back. I promise. She said, extending her pinky. I\u2026.. I\u2019m holding you to that. You said, grabbing her finger. With a nod, Rey gets up and walks away, staff in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, silence. Then you hear blaster fire. Rey! You said. Rey told you not to leave, but the sound of that blaster shot got you worried. It could have been a warning shot\u2026.. But what if it wasn\u2019t\u2026.? What if\u2026.? You said as your concern rises. You run out from your hiding spot and to see Rey on one knee with a blaster pointed at her. You saw two people. One holding the blaster and another looting Rey\u2019s speeder. From the looks of them, you can tell both are female and human and covered in robes. That\u2019s what you get for blindsiding me. You\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t shoot you between the eyes. She said. You\u2019re stealing my stuff! Rey said. Like there\u2019s any law against it. Not my fault you left it unguarded. Basically asking for someone to take it. She said. Doesn\u2019t mean you should. You\u2019re interfering with someone\u2019s payday. Rey said. Not like you\u2019re going to miss a thing. I\u2019ve seen how you\u2019ve been raking in credits left and right. You should have plenty lying around. She said. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to sit on my butt and wait until it\u2019s all gone. Rey said. Rey reaches for her staff, but is shot in the hand. Still don\u2019t know when you\u2019re beat. How much longer, Camelia? She said. Just a few more trips. Camelia said. Rey was looking for a way to solve this when she saw something moving out the corner of her eye. The lady saw Rey\u2019s eyes darting around. Who\u2019s out there? You\u2019re partner? She said. I work alone. Rey said. The lady puts the pistol to Rey\u2019s head. I know you\u2019re out there. If you want her alive, come out now! She said. Not wasting any time, you step out from your spot and call out to the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW\u2026.what? Is that a\u2026..tiny human? She said. Is the sun getting to you? There\u2019s no-whoa. Camelia said. Yeah. Take a picture. You don\u2019t see this every day. We don\u2019t want any trouble. What will it take for this to end nicely? You said. At least one person knows their place. Riza. The lady said. Leave him out of this. This is between you and me. Rey said. Not anymore. What\u2019s this girl worth to you? Riza said. \u2026\u2026A lot. You said. Really? You\u2019d do anything to see her unharmed? She said. Just name what you two want? You said. Straight to the point. I like that. What can we get for a tiny human? Riza said. Wait. Maybe we should keep him. Camelia said. As a slave? Good idea. Riza said. What!? No! There\u2019s no way-Done. You interrupt. No! I\u2019m not letting them take you for their sick games! Rey said. That\u2019s his choice. Not yours. Riza said. You walk up to Riza\u2019s lowered hand and climb up. She lifts you up and eyes you. You are somewhat cute. Maybe I won\u2019t be too mean to you. She said. You\u2019re about to see mean if you don\u2019t put him down! Rey said angerly. He\u2019s ours now. And don\u2019t forget who has a blaster. She said, knocking Rey to the ground. Hey. You got what you wanted. There\u2019s no need for this. You said. You\u2019re right. Let\u2019s go, Camelia. Riza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you in hand, Riza and Camelia get into her speeder, but it didn\u2019t go anywhere. Come on, you piece of junk! Riza said. As Riza was trying to get the speeder working, you and Camelia looked over to see Rey with her arm out. Uh\u2026. Riza. Camelia said. Rey\u2026.? Y\u2026..You\u2019re\u2026..! You said, stunned. You\u2019re\u2026..not\u2026..taking him!! Rey said. The speeder then rises. What the!? Riza said. The speeder is pulled apart, causing all three of you to fall out and Rey bring it down right on top of Riza and Camelia. Rey stares at the flaming rubble for a second before she remembers you. TYNE!! Rey said, running to you. Rey sees you lying near the wreck and picks you up, but you don\u2019t move. Rey felt for a pulse, hoping that you weren\u2019t dead. Please..... Be alive. Don't..... Don't leave me. Rey said, tearing up. After a few seconds, she felt your heart beating. Rey breaths in relief and hugs you. She gets to her speeder and takes out all of her remaining salvage so it won\u2019t slow her down. She gets in and drives back to her home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Argh\u2026.. My head. You said, waking up. You get to your feet and see you\u2019re back in Rey\u2019s home. How\u2019d I get back here. Last thing I remember was Rey.... You said. You wonder where she is until you she her sitting at the counter with a worried expression. You get to your feet and walk over to her arm and touch her. Rey whips her head to see you touching her. Tyne! Are you ok? She said. Head feels like it\u2019s been mauled, but I\u2019m fine. You said. Are you sure? I still have some stims. She said. She said. Yeah. Healthy as can be. You said, putting your clothes on. How long was I out for? You said. Only a few hours. She said. And you sat here and waited for me to come to? You said. I couldn\u2019t do anything else. I was too worried about you. She said. Well you can breathe easy now. I\u2019m fine. You said. I see that now, since you\u2019re standing. She said, rubbing your head. While you were happy to see her unharmed, you remember what you saw before blacking out. Rey was using the force. You\u2019ve heard storied about them from your mother, but they weren\u2019t good stories. Manipulative, self-centered, self-righteous, judgmental, and they only care about themselves. Your mother had bad things to say about force users. She told you that if you ever came across one, get away from them. You don\u2019t judge people until you\u2019ve been around them, but you always keep your guard up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh... Rey. I need to\u2026..ask you something. You said. What is it? She said. How\u2019d you\u2026..stop that speeder? You said. I\u2026..I don\u2019t know. I just felt something inside me come out. Something powerful. I didn\u2019t know what, but at that time, I didn\u2019t question it. I wasn\u2019t going to let them take you away. So I reached out, and the speeder stopped dead in its tracks. Next thing I know, I pull it apart like paper. The feeling is still there. In fact, I feel it right now. I don\u2019t know what it is. But it\u2019s powerful. She said. Force sensitive. You said. What? She said. You\u2019re force sensitive. You said. What\u2019s\u2026.that mean? She said. It means you can do things with a wave of your hand. Like how you picked up and destroyed that speeder. You said. That\u2019s what that was? She said. \u2026..Hold out your hand and lift up that wrench. You said. Rey holds out her hand and at first the wrench moves around, but it\u2019s lifted into the air. S\u2026\u2026so I can do things like this?! She said. A lot more than just lift objects. You said. Rey drops the wrench and saw you looking away and backing up. What wrong? She said concerned. \u2026..I\u2019ve heard\u2026..unsavory things about force users. Now that you\u2019re one of them\u2026.. You said. Tyne. After all the time we spent together\u2026. You know me. I\u2019ve never hurt, use, or abuse you, and I never will. I might have the force, but that changes nothing between us. You\u2019re still my little boyfriend. She said.  \u2026..How can I be sure? I\u2019ve heard that people change when they get force powers. What if\u2026..you change too? And see me in a different light? You said. With a stern look, Rey walks and picks up a pair of scissors and a blowtorch. She heats it with the torch and lets it cool. What are you doing? You said. With the scissor sterilized, she cuts her finger and a small amount of blood drips out. Rey. What are you\u2026. You said. Rey turns, walks to you, and extends her finger. I take my promises seriously. And it gets no more serious than a blood promise. She said. A\u2026.blood promise? You said. I promise that nothing will change between you and me. I won\u2019t hurt you in any way, shape, or form. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember all the horrible stories your mother told you about force users. They only care about themselves, kill people just for fun, ignore the plight of others, ect. You never came across one until now. You trust Rey completely. You want to believe what Rey said. She hasn't done anything to earn your distrust of her. She's put you first and protected you since day one and probably will keep that up until time ends. But the words of your mother linger in your head. She's had experience with force users, and she describes them all the same. When she's told you something, she's never wrong about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you believe in Rey?</span></div></div>",

Never laid a finger on you. Nursed you back to health. She\u2019s probably the biggest reason you\u2019re alive right now. You look up at Rey\u2019s determined face. .\u2026If she really did want to hurt me or whatever, she\u2019d done it by now. Plus, she\u2019s a direct kind of person. She\u2019d have no reason to play around. You said. You trusted her before, you are certain you can trust her now, so you grab her finger firmly. I\u2026..trust you, Rey. With everything. You said. Rey smiles and lightly pats your head. I mean it, Tyne. Nothing will change. You\u2019ll still be my cute little boyfriend. She said. And you\u2019ll be my titaness, force using girlfriend. You said. Rey goes to dress her cut and comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow. We need to talk about you not listening to me. She said. Ok. Hear me out first. I was worried when I heard that blaster shot. I had to go and see if you were ok. You said. What were my exact words? She said. Whatever happens, don\u2019t leave this spot. You said. And what did you do? She said. Left the spot. You said. What was going through that head of yours besides making me worry sick about your safety? She said. I had to save you somehow. My only bargaining chip was me. Suffer at the hands of someone else, or Rey lying dead in the desert? A no brainer to me. You said.  And what if she shot you? What then? She said. Small target. Was banking on that she\u2019s a poor shot. Come on. You know you\u2019d done the same thing if it was the other way around. You said. If someone shoot at you, I\u2019d bury them up to their heads and practice my swinging and kicking. She said. Can I collect the teeth? You said, making Rey chuckle. See. We both don\u2019t want anything to happen to each other. Why can\u2019t I put my life on the line for you? You said. One: I love you. Two: I want nothing to happen to you. Three: It\u2019s my job to protect you. Four: The size difference. She said. Hey! Size means nothing to me. Normal or small, I\u2019d still risk it for you. You said. And I don\u2019t want that. I care too much about you. If something bad happens to you\u2026. She said. Same with me. If something happened to you, I wouldn\u2019t be able to look myself in the mirror. You said. And neither could I. I don\u2019t want to loss the only person who treats me well and wants to be around me. She said. Rey gently rubs your head. I\u2019m grateful for what you did, but don\u2019t risk your life like that. She said, giving you a pleading look. But\u2026. You said. Please Tyne. You\u2019re special to me. In more ways than one. Just leave the protecting to me. She said. You don\u2019t think you can persuade her this time. She\u2019s insistent on this one. \u2026\u2026Ok. I\u2019ll leave it to you. You said. Rey saw that you were disappointed and quickly explain herself. I know you think I\u2019m being completely unfair to you\u2026 But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just\u2026..looking out for your wellbeing. You understand, right? She said. I know, I know. You and my mother have that in common. You said, smiling up at her. Rey holds up her hand and force lifts you up to her lips and kiss you. Thank you, Tyne. She said, putting you down in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. How are you going to use your force powers? You said. That\u2019s easy. To keep you safe and sound. She said. I knew as much. You think those two were important? You said. They were just the regular scavengers. But let\u2019s not talk about them. I want to focus on you. She said. M\u2026me? You said. Rey moves her hand to her chest and holds you there gently. R\u2026.Rey? You said. Holding you this close to me\u2026..ease my heart. She said. Hearing the rhythmic beating of her heart made you feel at ease. If I could keep you there, I would. Stop all the heart attacks you give me. She said. What are these heart attacks you have? You said. When you leave my side without telling me or something happens to you, my heart beat so quickly, it feels like it\u2019s about to beat out of my chest. She said. I have that kind of effect on you, huh? You said. Heart attacks are just one effect. She said, rubbing you. And the others? You said with intrigued. I\u2019ll show you later. Right now, let me feed you. I bet you\u2019re starved. She said. A loud rumble come from your stomach. It\u2019s\u2026.been a while. You said. Give me a minute. She said. Rey starts gathering some ingredients and starts putting them together. After a 10 minute wait, she\u2019s done. Here. She said. Is that\u2026..peppered bantha steak? You said. Since I\u2019ve been making more credits, I\u2019ve bought some better things for us. I knew food packs will only go so far. She said. Rey cuts a piece of the steak and you eat it. Whoa! This is good. No. Perfect! Didn\u2019t know you could cook. You said. Had to learn. You know I\u2019ve been by myself. She said. Keep this up, and I might have to put a ring on that finger. You said, eating more. Blushing, she sits next to you and eats some herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh\u2026. I can\u2019t eat anymore. You said. Really? You don\u2019t have room for dessert? She said. That depends on the dessert. You said. Rey bends down and kiss you. She holds the kiss for a few seconds and breaks it. So. How was dessert? She said. Seconds? You said. Giggling, Rey kiss you again before picking you up and placing you down her cleavage. Rest up down there. You\u2019ve been through a lot. She said. And you? You said. I\u2019ll be doing somethings. You just rest yourself. She said. Patting her chest gently, Rey goes about her business while you slept between her breast.</span></div></div>",

She picks you up and places you in her hand. You see a bruise on her face. Did\u2026.did someone hit you? You said. Y\u2026.yeah. It\u2019s nothing. Just a bad sale. It happens every now and then. She said. You ok? You said. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been hit like this. I\u2019ll be fine, shorty. She said. Ok. What happened? You said. Like I said, a bad deal.

Anyway, those two worked for a dangerous person. I came across him at least once. I know what he was going to do since he lost his two right hands. So I went to confront him. She said. You didn\u2019t\u2026..kill him, did you? You said. No. I left him alive. She said. Wait. How did I sleep through you fighting? You said. I\u2026..didn\u2019t take you with me. She said.

She said. \u2026\u2026Why didn\u2019t you just tell me they were important? You said. Because I know you. You\u2019d do something crazy. Like back at the star destroyer. She said. Can\u2019t help it if I care for you. You said. That\u2019s why I did it. I was hoping to have all my bruises healed before you woke up, so you wouldn\u2019t suspect anything. She said. And you give me a hard time for crazy things\u2026. You said. I know. Now I see why you do them. You want me to know you care about me. She said. Does that mean I can go back to doing crazy things for you? You said. No. My heart wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. She said. Rey rubs your head gently. I'm sorry for lying to you. Can you forgive me? She said. You know you can't do no wrong by me. Of course I do. You said. Smiling sweetly, Rey kisses you. Thanks for being understanding. It means a lot. She said. Well, you forgave me for all my crazy antics. Only fair I do the same. You said. Such a big heart in a tiny person. She said. Well I can\u2019t be mean to a cute girl. Especially if that girl is my girlfriend. You said. Quit it\u2026.. She said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it\u2019s all said and done? You said. Yeah. We won\u2019t have to worry about him. She said. So that just leaves you and me together. You said. I know what you\u2019re thinking, shorty. Let\u2019s save that for tonight. More romantic. She said, smiling seductively. What do we do until then? You said. We\u2019ll just have to wait until then. She said. Rey puts you down onto the counter. Don\u2019t stray too far. Don\u2019t want anything to happen. She said. And you watch you\u2019re stepping and sitting. I\u2019m delicate. You said, landing on soft sand. Delicate, huh? She said. Rey takes off her boot and places her soft foot on you. Rey giggles as she feels you squirm. Should I twist or stomp you, shorty? Since you're delicate, I want to make it painless. She teases. Rey then felt a sensation on her foot that made her giggle then laugh hysterically. You were tickling her foot and she couldn't take it. She fell on her butt as she laugh. Heh heh. You chuckle. No.... No fair.... I'm the only one who gets to do the teasing. She said. Like trust, teasing is a two way street. Good for you, good for me. You said. I guess..... She said, getting up. Well, we\u2019ll see just how delicate you are later tonight. But right now, I need a shower. Got blood and dirt on me and I don\u2019t want to get a disease. Rey walks and sways her hips as she walks, smiling as you look at her tantalizing rear as it shakes. Damn\u2026. She knows how to tease a guy in more ways than one. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rey was in the shower, you walk out of the AT-AT, and look out at the outpost as you sit. Never really had time to sort things. Shrunk down to thumb size, far from home, on a desert planet, and into the arms of a caring scavenger who is now my girlfriend. If I do get back to normal, nobody will believe me when I tell them. You said. While enjoying the view, you heard voices. Someone\u2019s close. You said. You hide behind a metal plating and peak out to see two fully armored people next to the head of the AT-AT. You get closer so you can hear the conversation. As you get closer, you see there armor isn\u2019t standard. It\u2019s Mandalorian. M\u2026.Mandalorian armor\u2026. That must mean these two are\u2026.bounty hunters. If two are here, how many more are there? You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was last seen coming out here. One said. Is it really true, Shanta? We\u2019re hunting a jedi? The other said. From what our client said, she used a staff and the force on our client. But he described her more as a sith. The anger in her eyes was more ferocious than a volcano. Shanta said. Jedi or Sith, I just want the challenge. Credits are just an added bonus. The other said. If we find her, Dal. For all we know, she could be in the outpost. Jedi are good at hiding. Shanta said. Then let\u2019s head back and look. Del said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to know how deep this goes, you quickly ran over to one of them and climb onto their boot and hang on as they jet pack back to the outpost.</span></div></div>",

While they searched, you overheard their conversation. Nobody seems to know this girl. It\u2019s like she\u2019s a nobody. Del said. She\u2019s a jedi. They know how to hide. Shanta said. I think we\u2019re asking the wrong people. We need to find someone that knows her personally. Del said. Who\u2019d that be? Nobody here knows her. Shanta said. She must be close to someone. We just have to find them. Del said. Well let\u2019s find them before more competition arrives. Shanta said. Great\u2026. Now they\u2019re after me. But for now, it\u2019s only these two. I need to get back to Rey and warn her. You said. You jump from her boot and quickly run away. Huh? What\u2019s that? Del said, noticing you. What? Shanta said. That. Is\u2026 Is that a small human? Del said. Shanta looks at what Del\u2019s pointing at and sees you running. It\u2026is\u2026 Hey, you! Stop! Shanta said, running after you. You quickly cut a corner and watch them run by. You peak out and head the long way until you come to the vast desert. It\u2019ll take too long to walk there. Maybe I can hitch onto that speeder. It\u2019ll get me closer, and I can run from there. You said. As you move to the speeder, a hand blocks and closes around you. Damnit! You said. The hand rises and opens, and you see the face of the bounty hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to make sure you weren\u2019t a heat induced illusion\u2026. But you\u2019re real. Shanta said. Yeah. Take a picture. It\u2019ll last longer. You said. Del removes her helmet to. So I wasn\u2019t seeing things\u2026. She said, surprised. Looking between the two, they are identical twins. Only thing that\u2019s apart is that Del has black hair, and Shanta has red hair. W\u2026.what do you two want with me? You said. We\u2019re looking for someone. A jedi to be specific. Shanta said. What\u2026..she look like? You said. She shows you a holo of Rey. With your size, you must get around easily. Have you seen her? Shanta said. I\u2019ve\u2026.seen her a few times. But I don\u2019t know where she lives. You said. I think you do. And you just don\u2019t want to tell us. Shanta said. Why would I lie to two Mandalorian? Especially one who has me in her hand? You said. Maybe you\u2019re a brave one. Let\u2019s see if this helps. She said. She grabs your arm and twists. You bite your tongue so you don\u2019t scream. Not\u2026.again. You said, holding it. Now remember? She said. I told you\u2026. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d tell you if I did. You said. Don\u2019t hurt him. He\u2019s cute. Del said. I\u2019m getting information. Maybe I\u2019ll pull the other one out of socket. Shanta said. As you back up, you remember what Rey did when you were in trouble last time. Alright, alright. I\u2019ll talk. That downed AT-AT out there. That\u2019s where she is. You said. Are you saying she was a few feet from us? Shanta said. Basically. Can you let me go now? You said. No. You\u2019re going to help since you lied. She said. H\u2026how? You said. You\u2019re going to keep her attention. She said. Ok, ok. No need to be so threatening. You said. Hmph. Del. You hold him. She said. Shanta hands you to Del. You back up a little as she smiles. You\u2019re so cute! She said. Del! Shanta said. Hang on, little guy. She said. Del puts on her helmet, closes her fist and jetpacks all the way to the AT-AT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey land next to the AT-AT and Del opens her hand. Ohhh\u2026.. I don\u2019t feel good. You said. Ok. Do your job, and we\u2019re done with you. Shanta said. Good luck, cutie. Del said. She puts you on the ground and you walk into the AT-AT. Boy, I hope this works\u2026. You said. You see Rey dressed in her scavenger outfit and looking around frantically. Rey! You said. Hearing your voice, Rey looks down so she doesn\u2019t step on you. She looks around until she sees you. Tyne! She said, relived. She force lifts you up and places you in her hand. Where were you? I looked all around for you, and couldn't find you. She said. I went exploring. You said. By yourself? In the desert? She said. No. Just around the AT-AT. I wouldn't make it far in the desert without you. You said. One of these days, you\u2019re going to make me faint. And not in a good way. She said. She sees you holding your left arm. Did you hurt yourself? She said. Uh\u2026. Yeah. Knocked my arm out of socket while climbing. Some help? You said. She grabs your arm with two fingers. Ok. This will hurt. Ready? She said. Yeah. You said. Rey twist and moves your arm back in socket. Thanks\u2026.. You said. Anything for you, shorty. She said. Rey smiles, but it fades when a blaster is to her head. Hello, jedi. Shanta said. She grabs you from Rey\u2019s hand. Nice work. She said. This is the jedi? Del said. Matches the description. Although, no lightsaber. Shanta said. What do you want? Rey said. The price on your head. Shanta said. You want me? Fine. Just put my friend down. Rey said. Friend\u2026. I knew you were lying. Shanta said. What did you expect? You said. You really want to get between my payday? She said. Leave him alone! This is between you and me! Rey said. She\u2019s right, Shanta. He should leave with us. Del said, grabbing you. Get your dirty hands off him! Rey shouted. Hmm. No. He\u2019s too cute to put down. She said. You saw the anger on Rey\u2019s face and saw a few things around inside start to shake. (Come on, nerfheaders. Keep making her mad.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won\u2019t say it again. Put. Him. DOWN! Rey said. And I said no. Come here, cutie. Del said. Taking off her helmet, Del brings you to her lips and kiss you. When she breaks it, Rey is livid. He\u2019s mine now. And the things I have plan for him\u2026. I know he will enjoy himself. She said. I'll kill you!! Rey shouted. Giving into her anger, a huge force repulse is sent out, knocking away Shanda, Del, and you. You are sent skyward and fall into some sand that cushions your fall. Ok\u2026. Think my plan worked too well. You said. You dig yourself out, and hear two violent snaps followed by the sound of bodies hitting the ground. You look around and see the two bounty hunters on the ground, and Rey standing over them. That problem\u2019s solved\u2026. Rey. You shout. She turns around and still has that angry look. (She\u2019s still angry? But why?) You thought. She walks menacingly towards you. You back up as she gets closer until you\u2019re pulled to her hand. The anger in her eyes was intense enough to send someone running, but that wasn\u2019t an option for you. R\u2026.Rey\u2026. It\u2019s me. Tyne. You said, hoping that she wasn\u2019t too far gone in her anger.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m so so sorry! I\u2019d never mean to scary you like that. She said. You breath a sigh of relief that she\u2019s calm down. (Never, under any circumstances, make Rey angry.) You thought. When you didn\u2019t speak to her, Rey was worried and started thinking her worst nightmare is about to come true. Tyne. Please speak to me. I don\u2019t want this to make you leave. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Where would I go? You said. Hearing you talk, she lets go. I\u2019m sorry! I just lost myself in anger when I saw her kiss you. She said. It\u2019s\u2026.fine. That was my plan anyway. Except that last part. You said. Please, forgive me. I don\u2019t want to lose you. She said. I\u2019m not going anywhere, Rey. And you can do no wrong by me. You said. Thank you\u2026. She said. Rey gives you a passion filled kiss. You give her a big smile that makes her laugh. And I guess your voice is gone again. She said. Well, you always leave me breathless. But I doubt these two will be the last of bounty hunters we\u2019ll see. You said. And if they can find us, others can. She said. I don\u2019t think it would be in our best interest to stay here. You said. You\u2019re right. We need to leave, and I don\u2019t think they would mind if we used their ship. She said. Works for me. You said. Putting you in her cleavage, Rey gets into her speeder and drives through the outpost until she comes to a medium size tan ship. Rey gets out and slices the door open and heads in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know how to fly? You said, jumping onto the console. First time. Cross your fingers. She said. Rey presses a few buttons and the ship hums to life. Ok\u2026 On the right track. She said. She activates the engines and the ship rises off the ground. Final part\u2026.. She said. She grabs the handles and push one more button and the ship warps into space. She breaths in relief at not crashing, then looks out at the distant stars. When I imagine finally leaving Jakku, I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be like this. It\u2019s really you and me now, shorty. She said, smiling. Wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. The whole galaxy at our disposal. You said. We can go anywhere. Where should we start our new life at? She said. I\u2019m perfectly fine with living on this ship. As long as you\u2019re here with me. You said. I prefer my feet on ground. She said. Or on me. You said. I can\u2019t help it sometimes, you\u2019re adorable when you struggle! She said. Ha. Ha. Ha. I know a few planets we could go to. Coruscant, Naboo, Nar Shaddaa, you\u2019re pick. Although, you\u2019d fit in great at Nar Shaddaa. You said. What\u2019s Coruscant like? She said. You\u2019d stick out like a sore thumb. It\u2019s a planet of politicians, ambassadors, anything government related. It\u2019s a great planet, but you either need the credits or be some big wig to live there with no problem. You said. Well only the best for my little boyfriend. She said. Hey, isn\u2019t it my job to take care of you? You said. What did I say the requirements were? She said. Arm healed and back at normal size\u2026. You said. And are you normal size? She said. Would you believe me if I said I was born this way? You said. No. She said. Then\u2026I have nothing. You said. I told you, I don\u2019t mind taking care of you. She said. Ok\u2026 You said. Now get comfortable. We\u2019re in for a long ride. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rey flew the ship, you walked through the it and took account of everything and head back to Rey. Hey, done exploring? She said. Yeah. Ship has everything we need. They must have recently restocked. You said. Better for us, then. She said. They also had armor and weapons. Seems like they were prepared for any altercation. You said. They weren\u2019t prepared for us. She said. After a few minutes, the ship reaches Coruscant. So this is Coruscant? She said. Yeah. Take it all in. You said. Is this how the rich live? Everything at their fingertips? She said. On this planet, it is. You said. Rey lands the ship on the docking pad. Ready to go? She said. Yeah. You said. Rey force lifts you to her hand and places you down her cleavage. Don\u2019t want anyone noticing you. She said. She walks out of the ship and looked at the giant buildings and sights. You were right. I do stick out. She said down to you. There\u2019s a clothes shop somewhere around here. You said.  You just want to see me in a dress. She said. And if I do? You said. You\u2019ve already seen me naked. She said. What do you think I do when I\u2019m down here? You said. Pervert. She said, smiling. A tiny, cute pervert. You said. Especially cute. She said. Before we go any further, where are we staying if this is it? You said. Hmm. There is a deluxe apartment complex. She said. If you got the credits\u2026. You said. Could spend a lot, or get in for free. She said. You aren\u2019t thinking\u2026. You said. A force persuasion shouldn\u2019t hurt. She said. Just when I couldn\u2019t love you anymore. You said. You\u2019re in for a surprise later. She said. Rey walks into the deluxe apartment and mind tricks the receptionist into giving her the best suite in the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa! Talk about a view. Can see all of Coruscant from here. You said. This is how the 1% lives. The best accommodates credits can get. She said. I wouldn\u2019t let it go to your head. You might forget who and where you came from. You said. I won\u2019t be forgetting those days any time soon. Especially the day I meet you. She said. It was a rough first meeting, but it worked out. You said. It really did. I have a thumb size boyfriend, more credits than I thought I\u2019d ever see, and living in fancy suite. She said. And don\u2019t forget the force. You said. And that. But out of everything, you're the only thing I care about. Everything else is secondary. She said. She picks you up and kiss you. I love you. You know that, right? She said. I know. You said. I don\u2019t say it much. I prefer to show it. She said. Is that why you want to wait until nighttime? You said. Yeah. Nothing more romantic. She said. Well, what are we going to do until then? You said. I want to see the attraction of this place. Especially that huge temple over there. She said. The jedi temple? You said. You know the place? She said. No one has been in there since order 66. But before that, It was a place where force sensitives would learn to become a jedi. Lightsaber building, training, meditation, force control. You said. And that was before order 66? She said. Yeah. Now the temple\u2019s in ruins. We won\u2019t find anything there except skeletons and dust. You said. I\u2019d still like to go. I might find a working lightsaber in there. She said. A lightsaber? You think you can find one in my size? You said. I don\u2019t think they make them that small. She said. A person can dream\u2026. You said. Don\u2019t fret, Tyne. I\u2019ll make your other dreams come true. I promise. She said, rubbing your head. But let\u2019s see what Coruscant has to offer us. She said. You jump from her hand and climb into her cleavage. She makes sure you're secured and comfortable before walking out.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019ll take your breath away. You said. I still can\u2019t believe I got off Jakku. I knew  would one day, but a part of me thought I would never leave there. She said. I wish it was under different circumstances. Leave because you wanted to. Not because bounty hunters are after your head. You said. As long as I\u2019m off that planet and have you with me, I don\u2019t care for the reason. She said. So looking to the future? You said. With you by myside. She said. Against anything that comes our way. You said. You and me, shorty. She said, kissing you. Come on. I know this fancy restaurant you\u2019ll love. You said. If it\u2019s fancy, you think they\u2019ll take commoners like us? She said. With a little \u201cpersuasion\u201d they\u2019ll let us walk right in. You said. I like the way you think. She said. You tell her which way to go and when she gets there, she mind tricks the doorman and heads to a table. Fancy? This place is like a palace. How do you know this place? She said. Dated a senator\u2019s daughter. It was a mutual break up. You said. Really, Tyne? A senator\u2019s daughter? What did she do for you? She said, narrowing her eyes. Is that jealousy I hear? You said. Why would I be jealous? You\u2019re my boyfriend now. She said. A waiter comes and Rey orders her food. This one sounds good. She said. With a nod, the waiter leaves and comes back a few minutes with her food. This smells good. She said. Rey starts eating and gives you a few pieces. I\u2019m full. You said. I still have some room for dessert. She said. Rey eyes you with hunger. Here we go again\u2026. You said as she picks you. Rey licks you a few times. Mmmm. Tasty! She said. Rey\u2026. You said. Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t chew. She said. She brings you to her open mouth and licks you one last time before kissing you. She holds it for a few seconds before breaking it. Mmmm! Sweeter than any candy! She said. You are such a tease. You said. That\u2019s how I get my fun. You\u2019re too cute not to tease! She said. Rey gets up and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Rey travel around Coruscant, taking in all it\u2019s sites until nighttime and you both head to the cantina. When Rey gets her drink, she downs it in one. Feeling like making another bet, shorty? You might win this time. She said. Oh no. I\u2019m not falling for that again. You said. Come on. I\u2019ll go easy on you. How about a three drink head start? She said. Even with a head start, I\u2019d still lose. You said. I think you\u2019re being hard on yourself. She said. Well, if you tell me how you have such a high tolerance\u2026. You said. You expect a girl to give up her secret? She said, shocked. I\u2019ll tell you one of my secrets. You said. I already know your secrets. She said. R-Really? You said. You like to stare at my butt when I walk. Every chance you get you stare at my chest. And when I\u2019m asleep, you climb up to my breast and rub them. She said. Uhhh\u2026. How long did you know about that stuff? You said. Ever since you started. She said, smiling as your face turns red. I\u2019ll\u2026.stop all that if you don\u2019t like it. You said. I never said I didn\u2019t like it. I think it\u2019s cute you find my body attractive. She said. I\u2026.it\u2019s that why you always tease about eating me? You said. That, and I like that scared look you make. She said. Who wouldn\u2019t? You said. Rey picks you up and leaves the cantina and heads back to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. Life on Coruscant. Think you\u2019ll like it? You said. I think I can handle it. The only bad thing is the stuck-up people. They seem to look down their nose at anyone not with a silver spoon in their mouth. She said. Don\u2019t get me started. They wouldn\u2019t last one day on Jakku. You said. Dead or slaves on the first day. She said. You both laugh until Rey kisses you. I had a great time. It\u2019s not often I get to enjoy myself. She said. Anytime. I do what I can for you. You said. Well, how about I do something for you. Want to join me in the shower? She said. Like you have to ask. You said. With you in hand, Rey walks to the shower and gets undress. She takes off each piece of clothing off slowly until she was naked. You must really like my body. She said, smiling. I do, but I like everything about you. You said. You take off your clothes and Rey steps into the shower with you. Rey washes herself thoroughly and slowly to give you a show. Mmm. I feel a lot better now. Surprised your eyes didn\u2019t pop out. She said. Rey gently cleans you off. How do you always get so dirty being that small? She said. Closer to the ground. You said. After cleaning you thoroughly, she kisses you. Clean as a whistle. She said. Rey steps out and heads to the bed and lays down. She force lifts you up and holds you over her. I promise to make all your dreams come true. Ready for that to happen? She said. I\u2019m all yours. You said. Rey brings you down onto her lips. She licks and kisses you a few times before closing her mouth around your crouch. She vigorously sucks you off, stimulating you with her tongue. You moan in pure bliss and Rey giggles. She gently strokes your back. After a few minutes, you blow right onto her tongue. Mmmm! She said. Rey didn\u2019t stop sucking. She wanted more. She kept going and going until you blew again. Mmmm! She said. She lifts you up and swallows your load. She traces it all the way down to her stomach and rubs it. Yummy! Taste better than anything I\u2019ve eaten. She said. She drops you for a kiss then picks you up again. Now\u2026. It\u2019s your turn. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey put you on down and rubs your crouch with her soft toes. You like this? She said, smiling. It\u2019s\u2026.feels so good\u2026. You said. Hehe! I\u2019ve wanted to try this out, but scared I\u2019d hurt you. But since you like it\u2026. I see no reason to stop now. She said. Feeling her soft toes and gentle movement, you let out a moan, making her giggle. R\u2026.Rey\u2026 You said, nearing climax. Go on. Let it all out. She said. After she said that, you blew onto her big toe. While catching your breath, She picks you and give you a kiss. When she breaks it, you feel reenergized. Now. Let\u2019s end this on a high note. She said. Rey lowers you to her pussy. You force yourself in, sending a jolt through her. You crawl through her slowly, trying to drag this out. With you in her, Rey grabs one of her breast in one hand and fingers herself with the other. AHH! She said. Rey was in the height of ecstasy until you reached her sweet spot and slowly agitate it. Her moans got louder and quicker. YES!!! Don\u2019t you dare stop!!! She said. Rey was now overboard in ecstasy. Her toes were curled tightly onto the bed. As she reaches climax, Rey shouts your name. TYYYYYNE!! She said as you\u2019re squirted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey\u2019s breathing was heavy and she could barely move from the rush of pleasure. When she regains her composure, she force lifts you up to her face and licks you clean. Th\u2026..that\u2026..was\u2026..amazing! I love you\u2026. She said. Rey embraces you and sighs happily. Say you love me. Say that you\u2019ll love me until time ends, and won't leave me. She said. I love you. I won\u2019t stop until time ends. And i'll never leave you. You said. I love you, Tyne. I always will. She said as a single tear runs down her check.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the sunlight directly on you, you wake up and hear Rey snoring lightly. After last night, I doubt she\u2019d want to wake up at all. You said. You squirm free of her hand and climb up to her face. She must be on cloud nine. You said. You kiss her on the lips and a smile forms. You jump down and head into the bathroom to get your clothes. When you put them on, you notice they were a little snug. Strange\u2026. They were comfortable yesterday. You said. You look in the glass shower and see you\u2019ve grown. I\u2019ve\u2026.gotten bigger? You said stunned. You don\u2019t know how big you\u2019ve gotten, but you know you\u2019re not thumb size anymore. You pinch yourself to make sure you\u2019re not dreaming. Ow\u2026. I\u2026 It\u2019s not a dream\u2026 I\u2019ve grown. You said stunned. You thought you\u2019d be this size forever. Which you had no problem since Rey has been there for you. But now, if luck is smiling on you, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get back to normal.  I\u2019ve got to tell Rey. You said. So you ran out and climb up the bed to Rey\u2019s face. Rey! Wake up! You said. T\u2026.Tyne\u2026. Rey said, opening her drowsy eyes. Rey. I\u2019ve got- You\u2019re cut off by Rey lifting you up and bring you to her cheek and snuggles you. Guess\u2026.she\u2019s still tired. I\u2019ll tell her when she wakes up. You said. You hug her cheek and enjoy her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for a few hours until Rey stirs. She sits up and yawns like an animal. She looks around for you and sees you in her hand. You slept well. You said. I really didn\u2019t want to wake up. With you in my arms, I wanted to sleep the day away. She said. Still can. I have no objection to exploring a sleeping goddess\u2019s body. You said. Fancy me that much to the point of goddess, huh? She said. Any other words won\u2019t do you justice. You said. You bow and say worshipful words to her. *Laughs* Rise, little mortal. She said. You get up on your knees. Your goddess is pleased with your worship. She said. I aim to please you. You said. Others can learn from you. You should be reward for being such a good little servant. She teases. She gently rubs your head when she notices your height change. You look\u2026.taller today. She said. I wanted to tell you earlier, but you were sleeping. I think I\u2019m starting to grow back. You said. What?! Really!? She said. I think so. My clothes are tight, and I\u2019m more noticeable. You said. But\u2026. You won\u2019t be my cute little secret anymore. She said. I\u2019ll still be your cute boyfriend. You said. But you won\u2019t be little, and that makes you even more cute. She said, sadly. If luck is on our size, the teleporter gave me the power to shrink and grow at will. You said, hoping to cheer her up. You think so? She said. The project was shut down for a reason\u2026. Maybe that was it. You said. I hope so. I want to keep my tiny boyfriend. She said. Rey gets up and dresses herself before picking you up. Where to today? You said. The jedi temple. I want to see it what being a jedi is all about. She said. Putting you down her cleavage, Rey heads out, rents a speeder and drives to the Jedi temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo. This is the jedi temple\u2026.. She said, taking in the damage. Yeah. Order 66 was no joke. Nothing less of a massacre. You said. Rey looks around with a distraught look. You ok? You said. I can\u2026.hear them. The screaming of all the lives lost here. She said. Rey. Rey! You said. Huh? S\u2026sorry. Sort of spaced out. She said. Rey heads deeper into the temple and comes across a room with force pikes and practice blades. This must be where they practiced at. Force pikes and training blades. You said. They didn\u2019t get lightsabers right away? Rey said. You have to train first. You don\u2019t want to lose a hand or leg on your first swing of a lightsaber. You fought with your fist before using that staff, right? You said. I\u2019ve only been in a fist fight once. After that, I made sure I had a weapon. She said. Learning process. You said. I guess so. Maybe it\u2019s because I think it\u2019s better to just go ahead and give it to them. She said. Picking you up and placing you on her shoulder, Rey heads out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm. This must be a meditation chamber. You said. Jedi meditate? She said. I think it was a way to focus and clear your thoughts. Or become more in tune with the force. You\u2019re going to try it? You said. I\u2019ll give it a shot. She said. Rey puts you down and takes a meditating position. You wait and see a few objects rise. Man, she\u2019s really deep in the force. You said. As she meditates, Rey felt calm. But after a few minutes, she felt something that broke her concentration. She suddenly opens her eyes and the objects fall. Rey. You said. I felt\u2026.something. She said. Rey suddenly stood up with her hand on her staff. Who\u2019s there?! She said. What? You said. I heard someone talking to me. She said. I didn\u2019t hear anyone. No one here but us. You said. But\u2026. I swore I heard someone. She said. Rey looks around again. There it is again. Come out! She said. Rey. I know you love to confront problems head on, but a disembodied voice isn\u2019t one you should. You said. Disembodied voice. No. It\u2019s much more, shorty. A voice said. A figure appear out of nowhere and it was Rey except her eyes were yellow, her clothe were black and she had a saber to her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR\u2026R\u2026.Rey? But....how are there? You said stunned. Aww! You\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re speechless. She said. What are you?  Rey said. I\u2019m the darkness in your heart. She said. S\u2026.shouldn\u2019t you be inside her? You said. You\u2019re in the jedi temple. One of the trials is conquering the darkness inside yourself. And she has a hard time with that. She said. Especially when she found you. She said. Wh\u2026. What do you mean? You said. Oh? She didn\u2019t tell you? She\u2019s keeping a dark secret from you. Would you like to know? She said. Shut up! Rey said. Touched a nerve. You consider him your little boyfriend. He will understand how you decided what his fate would be. She said. Decided\u2026..my fate? You said. Don\u2019t listen to her! She\u2019s lying through her teeth! Rey said. I\u2019m you. Why would I lie about something you did? You know it\u2019s the truth. How you couldn\u2019t decide to help him or enslave him. She said. Wh\u2026. R\u2026Rey\u2026. Is it\u2026.? You said. It\u2019s true, shorty. She- Rey\u2019s dark half is pushed into a wall. Followed by multiple pieces of rubble. Before you could say anything, Rey force pulls you to her hand and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFind that saber so we can get out of here. She said. Is it true? You couldn\u2019t decide what to do with me? You said. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. She said. Why not? Why do you have to hide things from me? I keep telling you I won\u2019t leave you. You said. I said I don\u2019t want to talk about it! It was all lies! She said. From the tone in her voice, she was adamant about not telling you. She must not be proud of whatever she did. But you want, no, you need to know. You could push her on this. You know she'll cave like last time. But that could make her angry, and you know what happens when she's angry.</span></div></div>",

I said I\u2019m not talking about it. She said. Why? You said. Because what\u2019s done is done, alright? So just drop it. She said. (She\u2019s not budging on this. Got to do something drastic\u2026.) Talk. Or I\u2019m gone. You said. Rey stops dead in her tracks. You\u2019re bluffing. You\u2019d break a promise you made me? She said. You're keeping secrets from me. How do i know anything you've told me is true. Is Rey even you're real name? You said. You\u2019re really going to be like this? All our time together out the window over this? She said. I\u2019ll take my chances and find someone I can actually trust. You said. You were bluffing, but you know Rey wouldn\u2019t take that chance. After a few seconds of silence, Rey gives in. \u2026..Fine. You want to know? I\u2019ll tell you. Every word back there was true. I didn\u2019t know what to do with you when I found you. She said. The word \u201chelp\u201d didn\u2019t come across? You said. It\u2019s not that easy. She said. Why not? You see someone in danger, you help. You said. Not everyone is good nature like you. She said. So what were you thinking, then? \u201cHow long will he last as my slave?\u201d You said. See, this is one reason why I didn\u2019t want to tell you. You\u2019re judging me without hearing the whole thing. She said. Ok. Tell me the whole thing. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback to Jakku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey\u2019s sitting at the counter overlooking your unconscious body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s\u2026.tiny. How\u2019d he get like this? Wandering the desert at his size\u2026. Surprised he hasn't been eaten by some insect. She said. She puts her finger on your chest. He\u2019s alive and breathing. That\u2019s a good thing. But he\u2019s small, hurt, and probably in a place he doesn\u2019t know. She said. The obvious thing to do would be to help, but Rey started to think of using you for her own interest. The thought of having a tiny person at her mercy brought a smile to her face and she already had a few ideas in mind. He needs help. But\u2026.. How often does this happen? Having a little person at your whim? Doing whatever you tell him to do? And It not like he\u2019ll be able to resist. I could always show him who\u2019s in charge and\u2026. No! What am I thinking!? He needs help. But this is a once in a life time opportunity. I can do anything I want with him. Any\u2026. Get it together, Rey. He\u2019s not some object to play with! She said. Rey is torn on the situation. A tiny person that she injured is hurt and the last thing he wants is someone dominating him with an iron fist. But how often does something like this happen? It\u2019s not everyday that a tiny person comes to your hand. It\u2019d be a wasted opportunity. The things she could do. What do I do with you? She said. Then she gets an idea. Rey grabs a credit chip. Heads: I\u2019ll take care of him. Tails: I dominate him. She said. Rey flips the coin. As she watches, It seems to stay in the air forever. Then it lands in her hand and it comes up heads. Putting it away, she gently rubs your unconscious body. You\u2019re in good hands, little one. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of flashback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flip of a credit chip. That\u2019s how you decided!? You said. How else? She said. Was it really, really that hard? You said. You make it sound like it was suppose to be an easy choice. She said. It is! Someone hurt and unconscious, lying there in need. And you\u2019re deciding whether to offer an open hand or a fist. You said. Would you say that if the roles where reverse? If I was your size, you wouldn\u2019t have a single though of using me? She said. A few, yeah. But I wouldn\u2019t let them cloud my judgment of the situation. Someone needs help. End of discussion. You said. So I\u2019m a bad person for having a few selfish thoughts? She said. I never said you were a bad person. Your priorities during the time and how you handle it are bad. You said. What do you want from me, Tyne? An apology? I\u2019m sorry for being indecisive and flipping a coin. And even if it did come up tails, I wasn\u2019t going to be a slave driver. I\u2019d still treat you like a person. Just my needs come first\u2026..and you\u2019d have to obey me. She said. So basically, I\u2019d be your boytoy or property. Is that how much worth you saw in me at the time? You said. I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve told you everything like you wanted. So I hope you\u2019re happy. She said. You wanted to know, but now that you do, you wish you didn\u2019t. If we\u2019re done discussing this, let get back to the reason we\u2019re here. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip through the temple was done in silence. You both tried to push your feelings aside, but they were weighing on you. You were feeling bad for prying, and Rey was feeling bad for telling. You tried to find the it interesting about the jedi code, philosophy, training, and lifestyle, but your conscious was heavy, and you weren\u2019t going to sleep well tonight. While exploring the archives, Rey found a working saber that was partly buried under some rubble. You were going to say something, but a sharp look from her shut you up. Now that she had a saber, she left the jedi temple and drove back to the apartment. It was quiet there too. Neither of you said anything. What was said back in the temple hurt more than the both of you knew. Rey started to practice swinging her saber, but she couldn\u2019t focus. She was more preoccupied with what you said to her and how horrible you made her out to be. So she put her saber down and sat on the foot of the bed. You wondered why she stopped until you heard her crying lightly. Now you were feeling horrible. (Good going, Tyne. Just couldn't keep your mouth shut and leave well enough alone.) You thought. You couldn\u2019t stand to see her cry, so you made your way to her and climb all the way up to her shoulder. *Sniff* What do you want? Come to ridicule and judge me more? She said. I think we both said more than enough. You said. Rey rubs the tears out of her eyes before placing you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurt me. You made me out to be this\u2026.uncaring monster! She said. I know, but what you did hurt me as well. You made me feel like I was some thing to be owned. You said. I know, it was wrong. But having a tiny person all to myself? How couldn\u2019t I think of my own enjoyment? And you judge me harshly for it. She said. Yeah\u2026. I did. I didn\u2019t give you a fair chance. I jump the gun too quickly and made you cry. Won\u2019t live that down. Hurt you in more ways than one. You said. Badly. You made me out to be a monster, and you threaten to leave me. And you swore never to do that! She said. I know\u2026.. I\u2026.didn\u2019t think it cause that much pain. You said. I told you how I had no one who cares about me. For you to just say what you said so casually\u2026.. She said. And I\u2019m sorry for it. I never want to cause you any kind of pain. Physical or emotional. You said. The only thing I want is you happy. Even if it means I have to stay handheld forever. You said. You mean that? She said. Yeah. I\u2019m sorry for what I did and said to you. I never should have said what I said. Bluffing or not. I\u2019m sorry. You said. Rey looks away for a second. \u2026\u2026One condition. I\u2019ll forgive you on one condition. She said. What? You said. Don\u2019t ever say you\u2019re going to leave me again. Bluffing, lying, joking, I don't care what the situation is. Don't ever say those words again. She said. I won\u2019t. You said. Rey hugs you and kisses you multiple times. Now we can go back to enjoying ourselves here. You said. Yeah. Lets. Rey said, smiling.</span></div></div>",

Then I\u2019d make you do a few things for me. Nothing strenuous or anything. Wouldn\u2019t want you to collapse on me. She said. That doesn\u2019t sound like all you would do. You said. Well that would depend on you. She said. Me? I thought I had to obey you. You said. You would, but I\u2019d reward you on your obedience. She said. What kind of reward? You said. Anything you want. And if you\u2019re really good, I\u2019d give you a special reward. She said. How special? You said. Let\u2019s just say a night of passion wouldn\u2019t be the right choice of words. She said. Your treatment of me is astonishing. You said. I told you I wouldn\u2019t be a slave driver. A cute pervert like you needs to be properly motivated. She said. Hey, I\u2019m not a perv. You said. Say that when you\u2019re not looking at my chest while I talk. Which you\u2019re doing right now. She said. Ok. That not enough to be a perv. You said. Climb my breast when I sleep, look at my rear while I walk, look at me while I undress\u2026. Need I go on, perv? She said. W\u2026w\u2026 Well it\u2019d be a crime not to. I mean, you are gorgeous! You said. If I wanted to be ogled and touched, I\u2019d date someone from Jakku or become a dancer for a hutt. Which will never happen. She said. What about me? You said. Like I said, my dancing is for your eyes only. And as for touching\u2026.. You know where my sweet spots are. She said with a seductive smile. Outside\u2026..or inside? You said, trying to be smooth. Trying to get lucky, shorty? She said. I\u2019m in the hands of pretty girl on a beautiful planet. I might as well try. You said. *Laugh* You\u2019re impossible. But I\u2019ll give a shot at wooing me. Show me a good time? She said. I\u2019ll sweep you off your feet. And make you feel like royalty. You said. Alright hotshot, where to first? She said. I know this cantina that you can get all your drinks for free. You said. Free, huh? And how\u2019s that? She said. The bartender owes me. Mention my name to him and he\u2019ll see you taken care of. You said. Ohhh! I didn\u2019t know my boyfriend\u2019s name was big. She said. Heh. You said. Putting you down her shirt, Rey walks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe follows your directions to the cantina and sits at a table. When she mentions your name, the bartender nods. Rey pulls you out as she drinks. So you weren\u2019t lying to impress me. She said. I have no reason to lie to you. Nothing beats free drinks. You said. Free credits? She said. Ok. That beats free drinks. You said. Enjoying the free drinks, you and Rey have a good time in the cantina. Rey got hit on a few times, but she brushed them off. You got noticed by a patron. She was in a drunken stupor and thought you were a tiny humanoid species. She found you cute and gave you a drunken kiss. When she puts you down, she winks at you and stumbles away. Rey stares daggers at the lady and you laugh. The rest of the time in the cantina was enjoyed with drinking, gambling, and watching a few people fight each other. After a long time in there, you both leave. All those drinks, and still walking straight. How do you do it? You said. It\u2019s a secret. She said. Come on. You said. If I tell you, I\u2019d have to tell everyone. She said. Fair enough. You said. So where to now? She said. We spent more time there than I thought. I don\u2019t think you want to go back to the restaurant. We could watch the sunset. I know a perfect spot. You said. Watching a sunset. Romantic. She said, smiling. Rey heads to a perfect spot and you both watch the sunset. It\u2019s beautiful. She said. Pales in comparison to your beauty. You said. Stop it\u2026.  I\u2019m not at my best today. She said, blushing. Best or worse, you\u2019re still beautiful. You said. Her face gets redder and she gives you a long kiss. Rey laughs at the huge grin on your face. Does that beat the one that harlot gave you? She said. By a mile. You said. Rey embraces you in a loving hug. Let\u2019s go before it gets dark. She said. Rey heads back to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFine dining, free drinks, a romantic sunset kiss. I have to admit, shorty. You know how to treat a girl. She said. It\u2019s something I take pride in. I\u2019ve got to make sure my titaness is happy. You said. I\u2019m always happy with you. She said. She gently rubs your head. Come on. I need to get the smell of drunken harlot off you. She came onto me. You saw me trying to get away. You said. I saw. Still need to get the scent off you. She said.  Rey heads into the bathroom and you both get undress. Rey rubs her eyes in mocking confusion. Am I seeing this right? You didn\u2019t hesitate to undress in front of me. She said. I've been around you for so long, I don\u2019t feel ashamed anymore. You said. Don\u2019t know why you were in the first place. I\u2019ve always liked what I\u2019ve seen. She said. You saw her eyes look downward and she bit her lip. You still can\u2019t help but blush. It\u2019s\u2026.not that impressive. You said. I beg to differ. She said, moving her finger across your body. Your face gets redder. Giggling,  Rey steps into the shower and cleans you first.  She gently cleans every inch of you. She takes a particularly slow time when she washed your lower region. When she's done, she kiss you. Clean as whistle. She said. Rey starts to wash herself. She washes herself slowly. Especially her chest, butt, and pussy. Tyne. Rey said. Huh?! You said. Enjoying the show, pervert? She said with a smug smile. I wasn\u2019t\u2026.. Never mind. You said. How your eyes haven\u2019t fallen out\u2026.. She said. Rey turns off the water and steps out. She dries you off then herself before she goes to the bed and lays down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTell me, shorty. What perverted thoughts do you have when you stare at me? She said. I don\u2019t think I should say. It would leave you mouth hanging. You said. Now I really want to know. You know I can make any and all those dirty thoughts true. She said. I know. You said. She embraces you and sighs happily. I love you. I really, really do. She said. I love you too. You said. She said. Within her embrace, you both drift out to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She looked over to see you sleeping soundly with her hand over you. She couldn\u2019t help but smile as you snuggled up against her thumb. Tyne. Come on. Wake up. She said, rubbing you. You just hold onto her thumb tighter and snuggle. He\u2019s so cute. Come on, Tyne. I want to play. She said. Rey pokes you a few times, but you wouldn\u2019t wake up. No\u2026. Only the best for Rey\u2026. You said. Rey smiled as you talked in your sleep. Wake up, Tyne. She said. Only the best for you, dear\u2026.. You said. Rey blushed heavily. Your dear is waiting, Tyne. She said. You kiss her thumb; making Rey giggle. She wondered how to wake you up when she gets an idea. She manages to get you off her finger. She moves her index finger to your stomach and starts to tickle your stomach. He\u2026. Hehe\u2026. You said, not really feeling it. Hm. How about right here? She said. She moves her finger to your armpit. Hahahahah! You blurted. Tickle tickle! She said. HAHAHAHAHA! STOP! I\u2019M-HAHAHAHAHA! You said.  Ah! What\u2019s the magic word? She said, sing-song. P-p-please! HAHAHAHAHA! You said. Well\u2026. Ok. She said. Rey stops tickling you. Th-thank you\u2026 You said, catching your breath. It took a minute before you finally calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the things\u2026. Tickling\u2026.. You said. Would you prefer the cold shower again? She said. Anything but tickling\u2026. You said. Anything? So next time you\u2019re sawing logs, I can wake you in any way I want? She said. As long as it\u2019s sensible. I don\u2019t want to wake up and see I\u2019m hanging over your mouth. You said. Aww, you\u2019re no fun, dear. She said. W\u2026.what you call me?! You said stunned. You\u2019re very talkative in your sleep. Some very interesting things. Like calling me dear. She said. You blush heavily. So, shorty. We\u2019re husband and wife in your dreams? She said. Uhhhh\u2026\u2026 You said. You wouldn\u2019t lie to your wife, would you? She teases. Your face turns bright red and she laughs. She gently rubs your back to calm you down. Relax, Tyne. I find it cute that you like me that much to ask to be my husband. She said. \u2026..So, hypothetically saying, if I did want you\u2026..as my wife. You wouldn\u2019t mock me or anything? You said. Hypothetically speaking, of course not. I\u2019d be happy to have such a good person like you as my husband. She said. Oh\u2026. Ok. You said. Breathe, Tyne. The world isn\u2019t ending. She said. She kisses you again, easing your nerves. Better? She said. I\u2019m good now. She said. Rey smiles and hugs you for a minute before letting go. Never thought someone would dream of me as their wife. I must have an effect on you. She said. Well, no one else has gone as far as you have for me. You\u2019ve done a lot for me. You said. And so have you. You and your crazy antics\u2026.. You said. Well, when you love someone, you want to show it. You said. They do, but you take it to the next level. She said. I promised no more crazy antics. You said. And I\u2019m holding you to it. Don\u2019t want my husband doing something dangerous. She said. She giggles as you look face turns red as a tomato. But let\u2019s save that talk for later and do something we\u2019d both enjoy. She said. And what do you have in mind? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey lays down on the bed and places you on her stomach. Since you adore my body so much, I\u2019ll let you do whatever you want. She said. You sure? You said. Yes. I want you to indulge yourself. Act out any dirty thought you want. She said. \u2026.If you say so. You said. You look at her perky breast and decided to start there. You make your way to her breast and climb up them. When you reach the top, Rey gently presses you into her nipple. Mmm\u2026 She said. She moved you around a little and kept you there for a minute before taking her finger off. She giggles and blows you a kiss. You smile back and rub her nipple. Rey shivered and bite her lip as she felt your hands touch her. To you, it was mini quake. You kept your balance and continued rubbing the nipple. You end it with a kiss, making Rey shivers again. This time, a little more violent, causing you to tumble onto her stomach. That was quite a ride. You said. Sorry. I got a little excited. She said. Don't worry about it. Could you turn over on your stomach? I want to do something. You said. She force lifts you up as she turns over and places you on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze at the huge mound that is her butt and form a wide smile. You make your way to her butt. When you get there, you try to climb. It took a few tries, but you manage to get a good grip and start climbing up. You always took quick glances at her rear as how tantalizing it was when she walked until she told you she knew all along about it. You finally make it to the top. It was like standing on top of an overlooking hill. You could see her stretched out legs, and at the end of them was her soft feet.*Laugh* Be careful back there. You really don\u2019t want to fall in. She said. That would be bad. You mutter. Even though you love the sight of her butt, you had no intention of being face to face with her rim. Shaking the thoughts out, you start jumping up and down on her butt, even though you didn\u2019t get as high as you want. Each time you land, there\u2019s a small jiggle. A wide smile spread across Rey\u2019s face as she was enjoying whatever you were doing. She lays her head down on her arms and enjoys the feeling of what you're doing. From the light moan that escaped from her lips, you can tell she\u2019s loving this. Hehe\u2026. What are you doing back there? She said. Just having a little fun. You said. You bounce a few more times, until you land and lose your footing and start to slip. Oh no.....! You said.</span></div></div>",

Tyne started to lick her feet all over and eventually she picked her feet up. \" Now it is time for your reward a footjob!\" Tyne instantly got a boner.

Then she gets a idea. A very nasty, dirty idea, but it would be the only way to get you out. Forgive me, Tyne. She said. Rey started to push you out like she was taking a dump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought it was all over when the direction you were going went in reverse. You were heading back to her asshole. Your head pop out. Rey felt you coming back out and pushed harder until you were halfway out, and she pulls you out with her fingers. Tyne! Rey said. She quickly took you to the bath room and washed the stench off you. She cleaned you thoroughly. When she was done, she hugs you tightly. I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m so so sorry! She said. R\u2026.Rey. Can\u2019t\u2026..breathe\u2026.! You said. Oh! She said. She lets go of you and sets you down on the sink. You take in a few breaths and look back up at her. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean for it to\u2026.. I\u2019m a horrible person! She said. Rey was close to breaking down. You\u2019re not a horrible person, Rey. You said. I am. I broke my promise to you. I used you for my own pleasure when I said I promised you I wouldn\u2019t. If I can\u2019t keep that promise, then what good am I? It wouldn\u2019t be good for you to stay with me anymore. She said. You said. Ok. Rey, hold out you hand. You said. Why? She said. Trust me. You said. Rey do as you said and you step on. Lift me up to your shoulder. You said. She does this and you hug her cheek. T\u2026.Tyne? She said stunned. There are two things I can\u2019t stand to see. A person crying and a person beating themselves up. And you\u2019re doing both. You\u2019re not a horrible person and you\u2019re good to me. And I made a promise to. I\u2019m not leaving you. You said. B\u2026.but I used you. And I promised not to. She said. It was mostly my fault. I wanted to have fun on that sexy rear of yours. You said. Rey lets out a small chuckle. It\u2019s not like you said, \u201cI\u2019m going to use you as my ass toy.\u201d And shoved me in there while I protest. You said. I\u2019d never say that to you. I\u2019ll take this lightsaber to the gut before I say something like that to you. She said. Which is one of the many reasons I love you. You said. The smile you like to see on her face returns. I know you said you\u2019re fine, but I won\u2019t be unless you say you forgive me. She said. I forgive you. You said. Her smiles gets wider and she hugs you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow. How do I make it up to you? She said. You don\u2019t have to. You said. No, I want to. Like I said, I take my promises seriously. And I broke it. So I need to make it right. She said. You\u2019ve been doing right by me since day one. I can\u2019t ask anything of you. I\u2019ll feel bad for asking something from a beautiful girl who treated me when i was injured. Plus, the shrunken people would ridicule me for doing so. You said. Rey laughs at your joke. Her beautiful smile came back. And that's all you could ask for. Well, if you can't ask out of fear of ridicule. Then I'll think of something for you. She said. Rey thinks for a minute before getting an idea. I think I know just what you\u2019d love. She said. And that is? You said. It\u2019s a surprise. You\u2019ll have to wait. She said. Rey puts on her clothes and hand you yours. When they\u2019re on, she gives you a kiss on the head. I\u2019ll be right back. She said. Rey leaves with a smile. You wonder what she has plan, and can\u2019t help but be a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait for her, you take measurements of yourself. Looks like an inch or two. Better than nothing. You said. You would be happy about the prospect of growing back, but since being under Rey\u2019s care, did you really want to grow back? At first, yeah. It was all you could think about. But Rey\u2019s been there for you. Food, water, keeping you safe, love and affection. And she doesn\u2019t talk down to you. With her around, you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. Getting back to normal would be nice, but is it really what I want? You said. Before you could think about it, you hear the doors slide open. You walk out of the bathroom and expected Rey, but you duck back in when you see it\u2019s not Rey, but another bounty hunter. You peek out and look. She\u2019s covered in light clothes with a cloth that covers all of her face except her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm. Looks like I missed her. She said. She starts looking around for clues. Nothing. Where would I go if I was a jedi? She said. When her head looks your way, you duck back down. You think she didn\u2019t see you when a blaster bolt hits right next to you. I know you\u2019re in there. Come on out. She said. You heart nearly jumped out your throat for how close the bolt landed to you. I-If she was aiming at me, I\u2019d be dead! You said. I\u2019m not going to repeat myself. She said. You know that if you wait her out, she\u2019ll come to you, and that won\u2019t end well. So taking a few breaths, you walk out. What\u2026.the? She said in surprise. She holsters her blaster and walks up to you. She grabs you roughly and eyes you. A\u2026..tiny human? H-How is that even possible? She said. She pokes you a few times to see if you were actually real. I assume you have other things to do than this. You said. I\u2019m looking for a jedi. I heard that she\u2019s living here somewhere. She said. I haven\u2019t seen her. You said. Really? At your size, you could go just about anywhere.She said. Look at me. You think I go out and about when I can be killed easily? You said. True\u2026.. Unless she took you in. Protecting the weak is their nature. She said. Well, it\u2019s not me. This is someone else\u2019s room. You said, hoping she\u2019d believe your lie. Is that right? You\u2019re well fed and clothe for someone hiding out in someone\u2019s room. She said. W-well I scavenge a lot of food. You said. Then why do your clothes look clean? She said. I take care of my things. These are the only ones I have. So i don't want them ruined. You said. Uh-huh. Where is she? She said. I don\u2019t know where this jedi you speak of it. You said. Do I have to get it out of you the hard way? She said. I\u2019m telling the truth! You said. No. You\u2019re not. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls down the cloth and toss you into her mouth. She swirls you around and pins you to the roof of her mouth. She takes her tongue off you and you fall down onto it. Then she spits you back out into her hand. That jog your memory? She said. I\u2019m\u2026..not telling you anything! You said. Then lets try a different method. She said. As you get your senses back, she pushes you down with her finger. She presses down hard. You beat against her finger, making her giggle. Come on. Put your back into it. She said. You keep pounding on her finger until she moves it up. I have a lot more ways I can torture you, and I don\u2019t want to mess up that cute face of yours. So how about you be a good boy and tell me where she is? She said. Do\u2026.whatever you want. I won\u2019t tell you a thing! You said. She seems to take your word as she pushes you back down. Her titanic finger looms over you as you brace for another round when you felt her finger rubbing against your crotch. Ah\u2026..! What are you doing?! You said. She smiles mischievously. I doubt she does this for you. A jedi isn\u2019t allowed to have relations with another person. So I bet you\u2019re really back up and in need of release. She said. I'm.....not that desperate! You said. She giggles as you fight against her finger until she stops. Wait. I\u2019ve been doing this wrong. She\u2019s a jedi and they help the weak. So if take you from her, she\u2019s bound to come running. She said. No! Don\u2019t you dare\u2026\u2026! You said. I have my bait. Now I just need a location for a trap. And I know the perfect place. But first. She said, pulling out a holo recorder. We\u2019re going to leave her a message. She said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>10 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey walks back in with slim box. She sets it down in the closet and giggles to herself. I can\u2019t wait to see his expression when I show him. He\u2019s going to love this! She said excited. Tyne? I\u2019m back. Where are you? She said. Rey waited but you didn\u2019t show. He usually comes out if I call him. Is he hiding from me? No. He knows not to give me a scare like that. She said. Rey looks around for you and sees a black mark on the ground. That\u2019s from a blaster\u2026.. But why would that be\u2026. She said. Rey\u2019s eyes widen in realization. TYNE!!! She shouted. Rey fell to her knees and cried her eyes out. There was no sign of you, and Rey thought that you were completely obliterated. The one person in her life who cared for her was gone. After a few minutes of sobbing, sadness was replaced with anger. She was going to find who took you away from her and make their deaths as slow and drawn out as possible. She turns around to see a holo device. Rey picks it up and plays it and the image of the bounty hunter appears. Hello jedi. It seems that I came around the wrong time. But I didn\u2019t leave empty handed. She said. The image changes to you being held in hand. Tyne! He\u2019s\u2026.alive! Rey said, overjoyed. If you want your little man back, come to the jedi temple. No fitter place for you to die at. Be quick. Or I might have to sell your little friend away. And who knows who will get him and what they would do to him. She said. The recorder stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s made the biggest mistake of her short life! Rey said. Rey ran out and got into a speeder and flew right to the jedi temple. When she gets there, Rey hopped out and ran up the flight of stairs and through the entrance where she sees the bounty hunter standing there. So you came. Just as I thought you would. She said. Where. Is. He? Rey said. Your little man? She said. You know who I mean! Hand him over! Rey said. Take a breath jedi and remember your teaching. She taunts. Give him back!! Rey said. Oh, I would love to, but I can\u2019t. He\u2019s\u2026.not with us anymore. She said. You didn\u2019t!! Rey said, seething. Not before I had a little fun with him. I must say, he\u2019s gets it everywhere for his size. She said. Rey\u2019s fist was clenched and her teeth were gritted. I think I still have some on my lips. It was quite tasty. And so was he. He let out one last scream. I think it was \u201cRey.\u201d Before he fell silent. She said. Rey was beyond furious. This bounty hunter\u2026.. This murderer. Took you from her and had her way with you and ate you. As Rey grabbed her lightsaber, the ground cracks. I\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019ll make you regret taking him from me! Rey shouted. There goes her teaching. She said. In actuality, you were still alive and well. The bounty hunter hid you away in her pocket. Her goal was to make Rey angry, so that she won\u2019t be able to focus properly and fall right into her trap with ease. Come on\u2026. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey ran at her with the speed of the force. The bounty hunter dodges Rey\u2019s frantic swings. You aren\u2019t going to hit me with wild moves like that. She said. Rey lifted up multiple objects and threw them at the hunter. She didn\u2019t have proper control over her force powers, but her anger is making them go wild. The hunter rolls out the way, taking extra care not to hurt her passenger. As she got up, she barely had time to dodge Rey\u2019s lightsaber. Rey force pushes her into the wall and she moves out the way as Rey goes to impale her. The hunter shoots at Rey, but she blocks them and sends out a massive forcequake under the hunter, knocking her down. Rey ran and jump with her saber pointed downward, but the hunter moves out the way and runs into the nearby room. Get back here!! Rey shouted she ran after her. The hunter ran into the room. She didn't have much time to waste, so she sets down a frag mine at the entrance and places you on the half broken round table. You were regaining your senses from all the movement as she talks down to you.Ready to do your part? She said. You.....won\u2019t get away with this! You said. Let\u2019s see about that. She said. The hunter hid just as Rey came in. Quit hiding!! Rey said. Rey! You shout. Rey\u2019s eyes go wide when she hears your voice. Tyne! She said, seeing you on the table. She runs over to you, but you try to stop her.  Wait! Stop! It\u2019s a trap! Rey didn't noticed until she stepped on the mine. No....! She said.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s in tremendous pain, her vision was blurry, and a terrible ringing noise. She could take a hit, but this was nothing like she\u2019s experienced before. She heard this voice calling out her name multiple times. Heh heh. Surprise your legs weren\u2019t blown off, jedi. I love it when a plan comes together. Endanger the helpless and jedi come running. The hunter said. She pulls out her pistol and points it at Rey\u2019s head. STOP!!! You shout. Aww. Someone wants to say goodbye. She said. I have deal for you. You said. Oh? And what\u2019s that? She said. Let her go\u2026..and you can have me. You said. You? Is that all? She said. Think about it. You\u2019d get a few hundred thousand credits if you kill her. But I\u2019m worth probably a few million. You said. Million? Selling yourself a little high, don\u2019t you think? She said. How often do you come across a small human? I can tell you from experience that I\u2019m worth that much. You said. You\u2019ve been sold before? She said. Yes. The lady made a fortune. Bought herself a palace on Naboo and doesn\u2019t have to lift a finger. You said. Not lifting a finger\u2026. That does sound good. She said, believing your lie. Let her live. That\u2019s all I ask. You said. \u2026..Fine. But one sign of resistance, and she\u2019s dead. She said. She holsters her pistol and grabs you. Hm. Maybe I\u2019ll have some fun with you first. Before I become rich. She said. Just as she said that, a lightsaber is impaled through her chest. Nrg\u2026! She said, dropping you. She drops onto her knees and her head is cut off. Rey!! You said. She\u2019s huffs as she falls on her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to her. Rey! Are you ok?! You said. She looks at you and grabs you into a tight embrace. I\u2019m never leaving you alone again. She said. I feel the same sentiment, but we need to get you looked at. You said. She lets go. Don\u2019t worry about me. Are you hurt? She said. Not at all. You said. I thought\u2026.. She said\u2026.. She said. It was all a lie to get you mad and get blown up by a frag mine. But we need to get out of here before those wounds get infected. You said. Just as you said that, all of Rey\u2019s wounds start to heal. R-Rey\u2026 Your wounds\u2026.. are healing themselves. You said. I guess this is another perk of having the force. She said. Can you move? You said. Yeah\u2026. She said, standing up. I\u2019ll be fine\u2026.. Let\u2019s get out of here. I need to see if you really aren\u2019t harmed. She said. I\u2019m fine. You said. Not until I see for myself. She said.  With you in hand, Rey leaves the temple and heads back to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep telling you, I\u2019m fine. You said as she looks for any marks on your body. I know you. You\u2019ll just say it to keep me from worrying. She said. I wouldn\u2019t\u2026.. Ok I would. You said. Rey looks over you multiple time and find no marks on you. Ok\u2026. Nothing\u2019s on you. But just in case. She said. She sticks you with a stim. Is this necessary? You said. It is for me. She said. She takes the stim out and kiss you. There. Now I can have my peace of mind. She said. So can I. You came to my rescue. I mean, I knew you would, but\u2026. I just can\u2019t believe you went through that for me. You said. I care for you. Like I told you on Jakku, you\u2019re special to me. And I\u2019m not going to lose you to anything or anyone. I\u2019ll see planets destroyed before I lose you to someone. She said. I\u2026. I don\u2019t know what to say. You\u2019ve done so much for me\u2026.. You saved me more times than I can count. You already have my name. I don\u2019t know what else to give you. You said. I didn\u2019t take or want your name. I only want two things from you. Your love and safety. She said. I know, but\u2026. It just seems like I\u2019m not doing anything for you. It\u2019s like you\u2019re jump through hoops for nothing. You said. If jumping through hoops means keeping you safe and sound, then I\u2019ll jump them. She said. I know\u2026. But I feel like I\u2019m asking a lot of you. I don\u2019t want to turn into a burden. You said. Ok. Look at me. She said. You do as she said. Never, under ANY circumstances, will you be a burden to me. I care for you like I\u2019ve never cared for anyone else. I\u2019d go to the ends of the galaxy for you. I don\u2019t care who or what they are. Bounty hunter, sith or even jedi. They touch you, they answer to me. I love you. And I will protect you like there is no tomorrow. She said. I\u2026. Thank you, Rey. You said. She embraces you in a tight hug. After a few seconds, she lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think we\u2019ve had our fill of excitement for today. Don\u2019t you think? She said. Yeah. If I see another bounty hunter, it\u2019ll be too soon. I say we stay locked in this room. You said. Hmm. Locked in a room with the person I love? My dream come true. She said. Is that your only dream about me? Or one of them? You said. It\u2019s one of my favorites. She said. You\u2019d have to tell me more later. For now, I think I owe the beautiful woman who saved me a reward. You said. I told you already, shorty. Your love and safety is all I want. She teases. And like you did earlier, I insist. I think being your servant again would suffice. You said. *Sigh* Fine. But only until the day is over. She said. As mistress commands. You said. Rey didn\u2019t like what you did, but she couldn\u2019t help but smile a little at the sound of being called mistress again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what is mistress' first wish? You said. Hm. Your mistress is tired and wants to relax. You\u2019re going to help me do so. She said. As you command. You said. Rey lays down and places you on her stomach. You're not going to take your clothes off? You said. They're already tattered and damaged, so i don't think getting them a little more dirty is going to matter. She said. If you say so. You said. Oh. And my bum is off limits. Don\u2019t want a repeat of last time. She said. As you say. You said. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience for you, and you had no intentions of going back. So where to start?</span></div></div>",

Good thing she\u2019s already take her boots off. You said. You head up to her feet. They were still gigantic, but less intimidating since you\u2019ve regain some height. You start rubbing her foot and immediately could feel the tension and knots in them. Just rubbing and moving your hands won\u2019t work this time, you\u2019d have to put some effort into it. So you put your back into and start massaging like you mean it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey could feel the tension and pressure in her feet being relaxed. Mmm. That feels so good. She said. She closed her eyes and enjoyed herself. From the way her toes are wiggling, you must be doing a good job. After 10 minutes, you move to the other foot and do the same. Mmm. I have the best little servant in the galaxy. She said. After a few minutes, Rey tells you to stop. She picks you up and rubs your head. I really needed that. Thank you. She said. Anything for mistress. You said. As hard as you were doing it, I thought you\u2019d pass out. She said. I had to make sure you were satisfied. You said. I\u2019m beyond satisfied. I think you deserve a reward. She said. Rey presses you gently against her lips. She holds you there for a few seconds before letting you go. Now. I want to play a game. She said. What kind of game? You said. Something we\u2019re both going to love. In fact, I think you might lose on purpose. She said. Really? You said with a little intrigue. I\u2019m going to put you on the ground. Your job is to run away from me. If you avoid me for 5 whole minutes, then you win. And what happens if you catch me? You said. I don\u2019t think I should tell you. I want you to try as well. She said. I will. I\u2019ll play like there\u2019re credits on the line. You said. Well\u2026. Ok. If I catch you, then I get to kiss you until my heart\u2019s content. I see why you didn\u2019t want to tell me. Losing sounds a lot better than winning. You said. But you\u2019re going to try, right? She said. Yes. You said. I better not see you give up midway. She said. I won\u2019t. I promise. You said. Then good luck. She said. Rey puts you on the ground and stands up. For as long as you\u2019ve been with her, you\u2019ve always been held or on something that made her eye level. This is your first time actually looking up at her. (Man. And I thought she was beautiful when she\u2019s holding me.) You thought. As you were taking all this in, Rey giggled as she saw you admiring her. Looking down at you, she thought you were cuter than anything. She almost squealed at the sight of you, and was barely able to restrain herself from picking you up and hugging you. You\u2019re wasting your head start by just gawking at me. She said. Head start? You said. Yeah. A ten second head start. You wasted 4 by staring at me. She said. No need for further explanation. You start running. 3\u2026.2\u2026.1\u2026. Here I come!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey chased you around and got close a few times. In one of her attempts, when you ran between her legs, she tried to pin you under her butt. She didn\u2019t want to come down fast, thinking that might hurt you. Or worse. So she did it slowly. She knew that sometimes you couldn\u2019t help but look at her rear and was counting on it. And it worked for a few seconds. You were fixated until you came to your sense and jumped out the way. Rey continued to chase you playfully until time was almost up. She wanted to have her way with you, so she used the force to take your legs out from under you. As you got up, Rey grabbed you. You open your mouth, but closed it when you remember what would happen if you lost. I win! Now I get to smother you in kisses. She said. Rey then pressed you against her lips and started kissing you. One kiss after another. Rey was unrelenting. She would stop to let you breathe, and go right back to kissing you. To Rey, this is the best victory ever. To you, best lost ever. Neither of you kept track of how long this lasted for. You wanted it to never stop, but eventual it did. I could do this all day! But let\u2019s save some for later. She said. Awww. You said disappointed. Don\u2019t feel bum. If you liked this, then you\u2019re going to love what I got plan. She said. I love anything you do. You said. Ok. One more won\u2019t hurt. She said. Rey kisses you one last time. This one was longer and more passionate than the others. Once she breaks it, she giggles at the huge smile on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad to get one more after that. Now\u2026 Your mistress is hungry. You will take me to the best restaurant on this planet. She said. As mistress commands. There\u2019s this place that you can only get in with a reservation. But with your talent, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need that. Ohh. Entry only by reservation. Can\u2019t turn that down. But I think I should get a change of clothes first. She said. Rey places you in her cleavage and heads out to one of the clothing stores. She looks around at the many choices she had until she picks one out. She pulls you out and puts you down on the side. Can you turn around? A girl needs her privacy. She said. I\u2019ve already seen you naked. You said. Are you disobeying your mistress? She said. No. I\u2019d never. You said. You turn around and wait a few minutes until she tells you it\u2019s ok to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you do, your mouth is agape. The dress was by no means outstanding. Just a regular black one with a few shiny stones on the bottom. But Rey looked completely stunning in it. Wow\u2026.. You look\u2026. I have no words. You said. Rey\u2019s cheeks turn red. I\u2019ve never worn one of these before. I didn\u2019t think I could pull it off. You like it? She said. I love it! You said. Rey\u2019s blush gets even deeper. This was still all new to her. She wasn\u2019t going to forget who she was and her values, but she was going to enjoy herself as she lived on this planet. Well? Are you going to stand there and keep me waiting? She said. Huh? Oh, right! You said. You walk onto her hand and she drops you down her cleavage and push you down deeper so no one would see you. You comfortable down there? She said. Rey felt you squeezing her one of her breast and took it as a yes. She does some final touch ups, pays for the dress and heads out to the restaurant.</span></div></div>",

Now, think you can handle the doorman? You said. Easy. She said. Rey places you back down and walks up to the doorman. You want to let me in. She said. The doorman\u2019s voice slurs before letting Rey in. Whoa\u2026. Can see why this place is reservation only. All these people dress so formal. She said. Rey finds an open table and pulls you out. I feel out of place here. She said. I know the feeling. Don\u2019t let it get to you too much. A beautiful girl shouldn\u2019t have her good time ruined. You said. It\u2019s always a good time when I have you. She said. When the waiter came, Rey ordered her food. Hey, Tyne. Want to have our drinking rematch? She said. I don\u2019t think you can get drunk off this stuff. You said. Drink enough, it might. She said. I\u2019ll challenge you when I think of a strategy. You said. Lose and swear loyalty to your mistress? She said. Ha. Ha. Ha. Just wait. You\u2019ll be the drunk one next time. You said. So confident. I can\u2019t wait to see that cute little face humbled. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Rey\u2019s food is brought to her. She shares a few pieces with you. It only takes a few minutes until she was done. You wasted no time. You said. Why would I? She said. You look like you could go for seconds. You said. Nah. I have to keep my figure for a certain someone. Wouldn\u2019t want him running off with someone else. She said. It was a kiss, and she was drunk. You saw it happen. You said. And I saw you watch her leave. Stared any harder, your eyes would have fallen out. She said. I only have eyes for you. She might have kissed me, but you\u2019ve done 4x as much. You\u2019re the one who won my heart. You said. And you mine. She said. Rey brings you to her lips and kisses you. She holds it for a few seconds and breaks it. What do you say we get out of here and I can give you that surprise I promise? She said. I\u2019ve been dying to know. She said. Rey tucks you away and heads out. She heads back to the apartment. While walking, you wonder what she has plan. It must be something good if it gets her all smiles and giggles. After a few minutes, Rey makes it back to the apartment and she pulls you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I\u2019ve kept you waiting long enough. I bet you\u2019re dying to know what I have plan. She said, smiling. I\u2019d be lying if I say I wasn\u2019t interested. You said. No better time than right now. Now close your eyes while I go change into something more\u2026..comfortable. She said. You do as she said and close your eyes. You keep them that way for 2 minutes before Rey said you could open them. When you do, you see her wearing a gold metal bra and red cloth that was covering her pussy. You were left gawked and wide eyed, which made her laugh. She was stunning in the dress, but this made her downright gorgeous. I take it you like this. She said. I\u2026. But where\u2026. You stammered. You\u2019d be surprised what they sell here. I was shocked myself when I saw it. And I knew you\u2019d love it. She said. Rey does a quick twirl, showing off her body in the barley covering outfit. Now\u2026. I think I owe my cute, shorty a dance. She said, undoing her hair. Rey moves her hips in rhythmic motion. She bends down and moves back up with her hands moved up her body. She does a quick turn, giving you a nice view of her rear. She shakes her hips and crouches down and arches her back as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were on Rey the entire time as she dances for you. Rey was loving it as well. She had your undivided attention and she got to see that surprised look on your face that she loved. She bounces back up with all her assets shaking. She then starts to take off the skimpy clothing. When she was bare naked in front of you, she dances all the way over to you and bend down and give you a full body kiss. So\u2026. Does this make up for what I did? Am I forgiven? She said. Thirty times over. You said. Rey then picks you up and giggles when she sees your friend at full peak. You\u2019re not the only one who liked it. She said. You look down to see and blush a little. It has been a while since we\u2019ve\u2026.played with each other. How bout it, shorty? You, me, and all our fantasies. She said. You didn\u2019t need much convincing, so you quickly took all your clothes off. Seeing you wrestle them off made her laugh. Someone\u2019s eager. That\u2019s good. Because you\u2019re all mine! She said. You put your hands together like you\u2019re being arrested. I\u2019m all yours. You said. Giggling at your joke, she picks you up. She kisses you a few times before closed her lips on your dick. She moves her lips and tongue around your dick. She slowly picked up speed until you cum. Mmm. She moaned. She moved her head back and swallows. So much\u2026. You were really backed up. She said. She gives you a quick kiss before smiling lustfully. Now it\u2019s your turn to please me. She said. She lowers and pushes you into her pussy. Mmm! She said. You start crawling around and can hear Rey moaning, but you notice it was more vigorous. Rey didn\u2019t want you to have all the fun, so she grabbed one of her breast and started to finger herself. The pleasure Rey was feeling was feeling only double when you hit her sweet spot. Her breathing got quicker and moaning louder until she reached her climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey took a minute to catch her before picking you up, licks you clean, and hugs you. Ah\u2026. That was amazing. She said. Rey heard light snoring and giggled. Hehe\u2026. Guess he tuckered himself out. She said. Rey lays down and gently kiss you. I love you, Tyne. She said, slowly drifting to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Yawn*  Oh man\u2026. What time is it? You said. You look around to see you\u2019re against Rey\u2019s cheek. Guess I overdid it a little. You said. You kiss her on the cheek as you worm free. You put your clothes on and they are still tight, but you haven\u2019t grown any further. Maybe\u2026. I am stuck like this forever. You said. The idea dreaded you at first, but after being with Rey for so long and under her care, it\u2019s not as bad. You look at her sleeping form. She\u2019s been there for me since day one. No one I\u2019d rather be with while like this. You said, as she moves in her sleep. Best to get back there before she wakes up. You said. You start walking back to her hand when a sharp pain is felt throughout your body. Argh\u2026.! My body\u2026. W\u2026why does\u2026.it hurt? Feels like\u2026..multiple lightsabers in my body. You said. The pain is so intense that you start to sweat. While writhing in the pain, you see Rey stirring. Shit\u2026.! If she sees me hunched over\u2026..! You said. Fighting through the pain, you make your way back to her hand just as her eyes open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes to see you, she smiles. You were trying your best not to show any sign of being in pain. Good morning. You feel asleep after our\u2026.session. She said. I\u2026.guess I over did it. You said. She kisses you a few times. It ended to early for my liking. How about we pickup where we left off? She said. She repositions herself over you and with ease takes off your clothes. Hehe. Is that for me? She said, poking your erect shaff. Well\u2026. Waking up next to you\u2026 How could I not? You said. Such a charmer. She said. She kisses you. Let\u2019s do\u2026..something different this time. She said. Like? You said. Rey moves back down on the bed and holds her foot over you. Heh heh! You love my mouth, let\u2019s see how much you love my feet. She said. Rey gently strokes your body with her soft foot. She giggles as you shiver, but it wasn\u2019t from pleasure. She moves her big toe over your crouch and slowly moves her toe on it. She slowly starts to pick up the pace before stopping. Hmm. Should I make you finish yourself? She said. Rey\u2019s foot looms over you as she ponders. She giggled at the thought of you jerking off to her foot. In fact, the thought of jerking off to her in general made her wet. But she gets another idea. She'd save that for another time. No, I have a better idea. She said. Rey grips your shaft between her big and second toe and start to move her foot up and down. You didn\u2019t think you\u2019d like this much out of fear of being crushed on accident, but Rey is taking extra care not to while also giving you satisfaction. She giggles as she sees you buckle under her. R-Rey\u2026! You said, nearing climax. Just what I want to hear. Say my name as you cum! She said. Rey\u2026.! You said as you climaxed all over her toes. Smiling, Rey sweeps up your load with her finger and swallows it off her finger. Delicious! She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pant* *Pant* You said in pain. You wanted to grip your sides, but that would give you away. Rey brings her face close to you. Since you said my name as you came, that makes you all mine. You're not allowed to look at any other woman from now on. She said. Wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. You said. With a big smile, she gives you a full body kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what should we do today, shorty? She said, gently rubbing you. The pain wasn\u2019t going away anytime soon. If you did anything requiring movement, Rey would catch on. How about\u2026.we lay here in each other\u2019s arms? You said. Just what I was thinking. She said. With you in her arms, Rey lays back down and smiles. This\u2026.will buy me time\u2026 You mutter. You always felt safe within her arms, but this time, it felt better. And hearing the rhythmic beating of her heart made you forget about you were in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both laid in each other\u2019s embrace. Rey had the biggest smile on her face. She had the man who won her heart in her arms. You on the other hand, where still in pain. Luckily, Rey had you against her chest, and not near her face. So she won\u2019t see you trembling. She would gently rub your head and giggle lightly. After a while, you heard light snoring. She fell asleep. Now\u2019s my chance. You said. You squirm free and made your way off the bed and quickly head into the bathroom. You look at yourself in the shower door mirror. No bruises or anything. Why\u2026.am I hurting all over? You said, gripping your side. You don\u2019t know what is causing this intense pain and it has you worrying. You make your way back to the bed. Get down was one thing, but getting up\u2026? You said. You grab the cover and start to climb as usual. You bear through the pain as you get to the top. You lay there for a minute before getting up and putting your clothes on again. Just as you finish, you see Rey stirring. T\u2026 Tyne\u2026. Tyne! Rey said shooting up. What? What\u2019s wrong?! You said. I\u2026. I had this dream. But it didn\u2019t feel like a dream. She said. What as it? You said.  I\u2026.saw you in pain. She said. Saw me in pain? Where you having a nightmare? You said. It didn\u2019t feel like a nightmare either. It felt real. You were laying down in my hand clutching your sides. She said. (Damn\u2026..) You thought. How did you get down there? She said. I fell when you shot up. You said. Oh\u2026. She said. She picks you up and you bit your tongue to stop yourself from screaming in pain. I really do hope it was a nightmare. The amount of pain you were in\u2026. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to handle seeing that. She said. I\u2019m pretty sure it was a nightmare. like the one I had of you. You said.  You\u2019re probably right. Now, how about we have some time to ourselves? You *kiss* and me. She said. I\u2019m always up for us time. You said. With what\u2019s happen, we can use that. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey puts you down on the bed. Now, you stay right here while I cook us something. She said. You\u2019re going to cook naked? You said. Why not? It\u2019ll give you something to look at. Plus, if I make a mess, I know you\u2019d love to help me\u2026.clean up. She said. Oh\u2026 You said. Rey gets up and heads into the kitchen. With her back turned, you collapse onto the bed in pain. Ah\u2026. You said. Every fiber in your body was telling you to tell Rey about this, but you didn\u2019t want to make her worry about you. You know she\u2019d go out of her way for you. Hell, with how she cares for you, she\u2019d cut through the Empire AND the Rebellion if it meant your safety. And that was the problem. The image of her stepping on that mine and blowing up was seared into your mind. You don\u2019t want to see that again. Just as she turns around, you got up and put on a brave face. She brings a plate and place it on the bed. What\u2019s this? You said, intrigued. Batha steak in sandwich form. I cut your half into pieces as small as I could so it\u2019d be easier for you. She said. I\u2026 Thanks. You said. Don\u2019t mention it. She said, smiling. You ate your half while Rey ate hers. When you both where full and done, she picks you and kiss you. You\u2019re so cute when you eat! She said. She takes you to the kitchen and places you on the counter. When you looked at her, her cute smile was replaced with a mischievous one. Alright, don\u2019t keep me in the dark. What are you planning? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, shorty. I was thinking we could finish our drinking contest. Here? Are there enough drinks here for that? You said. Just about. Plus, I found a really special one. Just in case of a tie. So how about, little one? She said. Little one? Ok, you know she\u2019s taunting and teasing you at the same time. You\u2019d love to show her up. To have her do anything you want. It\u2019d redeem yourself after you passed out last time. But every time you two play, she doesn\u2019t get drunk. Not even a slur of words. Plus, you haven\u2019t fully thought of a how you\u2019re going to beat her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nice try. I\u2019m not falling for it. You said. Come on. Are you scared of losing again? I\u2019ll give you a head start. She said. No way. I\u2019ll challenge you when I figure out a plan. You said. You still haven\u2019t thought one up? She said. No. I want this to be perfect. It\u2019ll be so much sweeter for me. You said. You really think so, huh? She said. I know so. You said. Well then, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. But for now\u2026. She said. She leans down and kiss you. You know, there is nothing stopping me from getting on that counter and having my way with you. She said. I\u2026.don\u2019t think I\u2019d live through that. You might, and I mean this in the kindest way, I think your weight might crush me. You said. Hmm. Maybe you\u2019re right. I\u2019d hate for anything to happen to you. So I guess I\u2019ll have to leave it to one of my wet dreams. She said. That\u2019s a wet dream of yours? You said. One of them at least. She said. And the others? You said. I\u2019d tell you\u2026. But I want you to use that cute little head of yours. She said. She rubs your head a few times before stopping. Now, how should punish you for calling me heavy? She said. Wait, what?! I didn\u2019t call you heavy. I said I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle your weight. And I meant it in the kindest way I could! You said. You know you\u2019re not suppose to say something about a girl\u2019s weight. She said. She pushes you over with her finger. And here I was going to let you clean every inch of me. But it looks like I have to do it myself. You can stay there and think about what you\u2019ve said. She said walking away and shaking her hips at the same time; knowing you like to look there. Just as she turn the corner, you fall over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there as pain circulates throughout your body. And you don\u2019t know what\u2019 worse. The intense pain you\u2019re in, or that Rey denied you something you were looking forward to. You lay there until you hear the water stop. You quickly got to your feet before she sees you. Learn your lesson, shorty? She said. I did. I won\u2019t say anything about your weight ever again. You said. And? She said. And I\u2019m sorry. You said. You are so lucky you\u2019re cute as a button. And that I can\u2019t be mad at you even for a second. She said. She kisses you on the head. Since we aren\u2019t going to have our contest yet, you won\u2019t mind if I practice using my saber? She said. I don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t think doing it here is best. You said. The only place would be the temple. She said. Are you sure about going back there? After what happen the last two times? You said. There\u2019s no bounty hunter after us now. And if\u2026..that side of me shows again, I\u2019ll be ready. She said. Then I\u2019ll be right beside you. You said. No one I\u2019d rather have at my side. She said. Rey puts her clothes and picks you up and places you down her cleavage. She heads out and takes a speeder to the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she gets there, she heads up the stairs and into the temple. Being back here doesn\u2019t bring up good memories for either of you. Rey walks through a blown door into a training area with practice dummies. This looks like the place. She said. Rey takes you out and holds you close. So this is where they trained at? One of many places. You said. Rey walks over to a fallen column and places you down. Stay here. Of all the places, this is the last place I want to lose you in. She said. You don\u2019t have to tell me. I\u2019ll be right here. You said. With a nod, Rey goes in front of one of the dummies and draws her saber. She goes some simple slashes before going for a spinning slash. She nearly dropped her saber mid spin. With her back turn, you fall to your knees. You wanted this pain to end. You didn\u2019t care how or what you had to do. You just wanted it to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time she tried, Rey was improving a little. Her swing wasn\u2019t wild like before, and she kept a firm grip on her saber when she swings. Now she wanted to practice using the force. She extends her hands and a small rubble started to shake. Focus\u2026. She said. The block started to lift off the ground a little. Then it drops. Again. She said. She tries to lift up the block, but only gets it 2 feet of the ground before it drops. Come on. I know I can do this. She said. She tries a few more times and the results change very little. You saw her turn around and get up when she walks over to you. I don\u2019t get it. When I use it on you, I have no problem. But now I can barely lift up that block. She said. I know you can do it. Just concentrate. You said. Ok\u2026 She said. Rey takes a deep breathe and concentrates. She extends her arm and the block shakes. Come on\u2026.. You said. Rey keeps calm and focus until the block is lifted up into the air. I did it! Tyne, look! She said, excited. You smile for her as she throws the block around. Let\u2019s see\u2026. She said. She picks up moves her hand and the block is thrown to the side. She does this a few more times before you yourself are lifted up in the air. What the?! You said. You are then pulled right into Rey\u2019s chest as she wraps her arms around you. R\u2026.Rey\u2026. You said. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I just had to. She said. Rey holds you there for a minute before letting go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot easier to use it on you. She said. You think it might be your feelings that make it easier for you? You said. My feelings? She said. Well, every time you I\u2019ve seen you use it, it\u2019s when you\u2019re mad. Like how you snapped those two hunter\u2019s neck. Or when you lifted up three big pieces of a column and threw them at that one hunter. You said. I barely notice. At those points, my only focus was protecting you. She said. And a good job you\u2019ve been doing. You said. Like you, I aim to please. She said, kissing you. She places you back down. How much longer do you plan on doing this? You said. Can\u2019t put a price on training. Just like you can\u2019t put a price on cuteness. She said, winking at you. Then that means you\u2019re priceless. You said. Rey blushes deeply. We\u2019ll be out of here before night comes. She said. Ok. You said. She kisses you again and goes back to training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait until Rey was satisfied with practicing and she picks you up and leave. So\u2026. What do you think? She said. Oh. I\u2019m no expert, but I think you did good. You said. Thanks. I\u2019m actually surprised myself. I thought my first swing would cost me a finger or two. Worst case, my entire hand. She said. They\u2019re serious weapons. Good thing you didn\u2019t. You said as she sets you down on the bed. She lays right down next to you. I know you\u2019re going to sleep well. You have to be tired after all that. You said. I am. Too tired to wash or even change. She said.You climb up the pillow and lay down next to her. She places her hand over you as a blanket. I know it was boring for you to sit there and wait on me for so long. I\u2019ll make it up to you tomorrow. She said. What do you have in mind? You said. That\u2019s a secret. I don\u2019t want to spoil it. She said, rubbing your head. You\u2019re such a tease. You said. As it should be. She said. With her hand covering you, you felt at ease. The pain you were feeling felt long gone. You know it might come back tomorrow, but you'd deal with that then. You slowly feel asleep. Rey gently rubbed your head as you sleep. Just....cute as can be. She said before following suit as well. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As morning came, you were sleeping soundly. You faintly made out the sounds of giggling, but put it off as Rey having one of her wet dreams. But the giggling continued, and you felt something wet and moving on your lower half. Ugh\u2026.. You said drowsy. Heheheh\u2026. A voice said. The feeling wasn\u2019t uncomfortable or annoying. Rather, it felt pleasant. Wha\u2026.? You said. You open your eyes to see Rey\u2019s mouth on your crouch and her head going up and down. She sees you\u2019re awake and winks at you. Good morning. She said, smiling. What are you\u2026.? You said. What better way to wake you up? She said. She picks up the pace and giggles as she sees you shiver. It didn\u2019t take long before you blew into her mouth. Mmmm. *Gulp* Hehehe! She said. She move up a little and start kissing you. Hehe! You\u2019re my plaything. *Kiss* For the rest of the day. *Kiss* She said. I guess this is what you meant last night? You said. And a lot more. She said as she removes each piece of your clothing. You won\u2019t be needing these today. I plan on making you scream my name. She said. Hopeful in a good way. You said. Of course. You know I\u2019d never do anything to endanger you. I always have your safety as my number one priority. She said. I know. You said. So let\u2019s stop talking and start having some fun. She said. Rey starts kissing you. She opens her and slowly sucks you into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on her moist tongue, she pins you to the roof of her mouth. Mmm. She said. She lets her tongue off and you fall down onto it. She then uses it to move you to her cheek. You look at her teeth and shiver a little at the size of them to you. Then you see Rey\u2019s tongue come over to you and start licking you. She licked you all over. After a few minutes of licking you, she focuses on her main target: Your crouch. She assault it by vigorously licking it. Even using some of her saliva to make it easier. After a few minutes, you blew right onto her tongue. Mmm! She said. Rey tilts her head back and swallows. Ahh. She said. She opens her mouth and you tumble into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess that\u2019s my shower for the day. You said. You\u2019re covered in spit. And you spoiled what\u2019s going to happen next. She said. Oh. Sorry. You said, with a small smile. Now you\u2019re going to work for this. She said. Rey gentle drops you onto the bed and starts walking to the bathroom. She knew you wouldn\u2019t follow right behind her as you\u2019d be too busy staring at her butt. And she wasn\u2019t wrong. Your eyes were glued to them as they swayed. When she gets to the doorway, she turns around and gestures you to come to her. Never a good idea to keep a girl waiting. You said. You ready yourself for the blinding pain and climb down. You take a step.....and don't collapse in pain. The pain.... It's gone? You said. You take a few more and feel a surge of pain, but it's only enough to make you winded, not collapse. Well, it's not gone, but less severe than yesterday. I'll take being winded than collapsing. You said. Tyyyyne. Rey said in a sing song voice. You snapped back to it and remember Rey is waiting on you. You quickly follow after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you see she\u2019s already naked. About time. Thought I\u2019d have to come after you. She said. She picks you up and steps into the shower. So little guy. Remember when I said I wanted you to help me get clean? She said. And you let me hanging for calling you \u201cheavy.\u201d You said. A lesson I hope you\u2019ve learned. You\u2019re going to be my soap. She said. How is that going to happen? You said. I made this indent for you to fit in. You can figure out the rest. And don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll go nice and slow so you can enjoy every minute of it. She said. I love the way you think. You said. Rey kisses you and puts you inside the soap. Comfortable? She said. You give her a nod and she smiles. Seeing you like this, it\u2019s the third cutest way I\u2019ve seen you. She said. Rey proceeds to slowly move the soap across her leg. Mmm. I think this soap works wonderful. She teases. She does the same with the other leg, except she does it more slowly. Which you didn\u2019t know she was doing until she kept moving the soap back up and down for the past five minutes. She pulls you back to let you breathe. You alright? If it\u2019s too much for you, I\u2019ll stop. She said. No, no. It\u2019s fine. Just remember, I need to breathe. You said. She smiles and picks right up where she left off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves you across her smooth stomach and stops short of her breast before pulling you away. She plays with her breast with her free hand. I bet you\u2019re looking forward to this area, huh? Or is it my butt you're dying to be rubbed against? She said. She brings you close enough that, if you could, reach out and touch them. Only for her to pull you away. Ah, ah, ah. Not yet, shorty. You have one more place to be. She said. She moves you up past her chest and up to her face. She moves you slowly across and extra slow when you where near her lips. And completely stops when your body was against her lips. *Mwah* Hehehe! She said. After kissing you, she brought you back down to her chest and slowly rubbed you against her breast. Mmm. I love the feeling of this soap. I have to find more of it. She teases. After five long minutes, she stops and lets you catch your breathe. You ok? She said, worried. I\u2019m fine. You said, giving her a reassuring smile. Smiling back, she moves you to her butt and move you across it as slow as possible. When you got to the center of one of her cheeks, you give it as big a kiss you can. Feeling you kiss her butt, Rey giggled. After a while, she stops the water and walks out. Alright, Let's get you out of there. She said. She pulls you out of the soap and kiss you. She dries you off first then herself and walks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026. Did you like what I did? She said. Yeah. We have to do that again. You said. We can. Anytime you want. Just say the word. She said. She lays down with you in her hand. So am I close to making up for yesterday? She said. You didn\u2019t have to do any of this. I\u2019m never bored when I\u2019m with you. Any time we spend together, whether it\u2019s you training, one of us indulging our fantasies, or just being in each other\u2019s embrace, it\u2019s always a good time. You said. \u2026\u2026What did I do to deserve such a cute, thoughtful person like you? She said, blushing madly. Not watching that first step? You said. Don\u2019t remind me. She said. She kisses you on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kissed you again, she noticed you slumping over a little. Tyne, are you ok?  She said. (Uh-oh\u2026) Yeah, I\u2019m fine. You said. Are you sure? You\u2019re slumped over like you\u2019re in pain. Are you hurt?! She said worried. N-no! I\u2019m perfectly fine. A-And If I was in pain, would I be able to do this? You said. You hop out her hand and make your way between her legs. You crawl inside her and start moving around.  Ah\u2026.! Rey said surprised. She was going to stop you, but you acted too quickly for her. You know you have to make this extra good, so as you crawl, you massage the walls an you can hear the results of doing so as Rey\u2019s breathing got faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience this time around was different for her. It felt 2x as good. Not only did her toes curl, but she gripped the bed as she arched her back. Yes\u2026. YES!!! Don\u2019t you dare stop!! She said. You followed through and massage the sweet spot and this sent her over the moon. AHH! TYYYYYYYNE!! Rey said as she climaxed. You were forcibly ejected out and covered in her juices. *Cough* *Cough* Think I overdid it on that one\u2026. You said. You hear Rey breathing heavy to catch her breath, but it didn\u2019t stop her from force lifting you into her hand. So\u2026. Who would be screaming who\u2019s name again? You said. Rey gives you a smirk before kissing you and wrapping her arms around you. You\u2019ll be saying my name next time\u2026. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do feel a little bad for not telling her. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to, you just don\u2019t want to send her into a panic and make her worry. Let\u2019s just lay here like this. And not worry about anything as the day goes by. She said. I\u2019m all for it. You said. She holds you firmly in her arms and sighs happily. </span></div></div>",

The whole world just disappeared to her as she held you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, weren't doing so good. While not crippling, the pain became stinging. You didn't know what it was or how it started. It was eating at you. If it was something serious, you'd at least want to know. It was too much for you; You had to know. So you worm your way out of Rey's hand and gave her a quick kiss on the lips. Tyne..... She mutters. You climb down from the bed and head to the bathroom and look in the shower mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't see any marks or bruises on you. You feel around for anything out of place, but everything is where they're suppose to be. Nothing out of place, no cuts or bruises..... Then what is it? You said. You start to brainstorm on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk..... Everything was fine when i was half the size of a thumb. When i grew a little, no pain. Then i became full thumb size. That's when it came. You said. It then hit you. C....could this pain be me growing back? You said. If that's the case, you should be jumping for joy. Ecstatic. Thanking whatever kind of god was out there. But you're not. It was all you could think of at first, but now.....after spending so much time with Rey and under her care..... Do you really want to grow back? Let alone care anymore? After so much time..... If this is true.... Would i really want this? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyne..... Rey said, waking up. She looked at her hand, but you weren't there. She looked down her cleavage and you weren't there either. Tyne. Where are you? She said. Damn.... You said, overhearing her. You leave to see her searching for you, and starting to panic. Tyne, where are you!? She said. You know how she gets when she's like this, so you quickly run up to her as she searches. When she sees you, she grabs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were you? I thought someone took you again. She said.  (Damn.... How do i spin this?) I was.....looking for my clothes. You said. I put them over there so you wouldn't have to go looking for them every time. She said. You see them on the table next to the bed. Shit.... You mutter. Caught in a lie, Rey knows something's going on with you. You never outright lied to her. Stretch the truth, yeah. But outright lie? Something wasn't right here, and she wanted to know what it was. So she sits on the bed sets you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. What is it? She said. What's what? You said. You lied to me. You never done that. You've always told me the truth before. What's wrong? She said. Nothing. I'm fine.See? You said. You're only saying that to make me not worry. She said. She gently rubs your head. Tyne. I love you. You think i want something to happen to you? I'd never be able to look at myself on the mirror or possibly live with myself if something happened to you. She said. And neither would i. You mutter. She kisses you on the head. All i want is for you to be happy and healthy with me. Whatever it is, I want to help and be there for you. If it helps, I promise i won't overreact if that's what you're afraid of. She said. ......Promise? You said. Promise. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've been in pain for the past few days. You said. In pain? Did you hurt yourself? Did i hurt you!? She said. No, no! It....just appeared one day. It was like getting hit by a speeder bike that goes through trees. I couldn't move and any movement i did make felt like being teared in half. You said. Why didn't you tell me this when it first happened? You said. I didn't want to worry you. You said. Tyne, I always worry about you. You're on my mind from sunrise to sunset. And sometimes in my dreams, i'm thinking of you. I care about you. You did more for me in one hour than most people ever would. She said. Well, what kind of person would i be to take advantage of a cute girl's hospitality and kindness? You said, getting a giggle out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I want to repay that kindness back. You will not or ever be a burden to me. I will always put your safety and health above all else. Like you do for me. She said. .....Thank you, Rey. I don't know where i'd be without you. You said. She gets one of the stims and stick you. Hold still.... She said. She injects you and pulls it out. That do anything? She said. A little. My body isn't aching for now. You said. Still. I don't want you moving much. She said. She kisses you. I'll take care of any need you have. And i know what you're thinking and i'm going to stop you right there. I want to take care of you. So don't think you're using me or feel bad. She said. You know you can't fight her when her mind is set, so you agree. She hugs you gently for a minute and lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, is there anything you need? Anything at all? She said. Well i am a little hungry. You said. Say no more. She said. She got up and dressed herself. I'm going to the ship. Don't want all that food going to waste. And i'll bring back any medical supplies too. She said. She bends down and kisses your head. I'd love to take you with me, but i'm scared all that movement might hurt you. So i'll leave you here. She said. Got it. Don't worry about me. I'll be right here when you get back. You said. I'm holding you to that. She said. She kisses you one last time before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your clothes back on and wait for her to come back. It was a good wait that you almost drifted to sleep until you heard the door opens up and......</span></div></div>",

Sorry if i took so long. I didn't know what to get specifically. So i got one of everything. She said. She puts them down on the counter and picks you up. Which one do you want? She said. Why don't you pick? You went all that way, and you have to be starving. You said just as her stomach growls. How is it that you know when i'm hungry? Ok. How about....this one? She said. Bantha meat and pickled space worm? I'll give it a go. You said. Rey pulls open the pack and samples the pickled worm. It's not as bad as it looks. She said. She pulls off a piece for you to try. You bite into it. You're right. It just looked nasty. You said. You eat your share of food and wait until Rey was finished. When she was done, she throws it in the trash and picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm full. Thank you. You said. Don't mention it. She said, rubbing your head. She then sits down on he bed and places you next to her as she lies down. She must be exhausted. Maybe....i can help her relax. You said. You crawl down to the floor and go to her draping feet. Good thing she took her boots off. You said. You put your hand on the semi-damp sole and start rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she laid there, Rey was taking a minuter to relax. Although she was waiting for you to say you need something. She was thinking of a way to help out your pain. Stims would only go so far and was temporary. Maybe there's something in the temple that could help..... She mutters. She also thought about taking you to a doctor, but quickly shot that down. You'd go from patient to guinea pig as they run experiments on you in a heartbeat. She screamed internally at the thought of you being poked and prodded with needles and the various tests they'd run on you. There must be something i can do for him..... I hate to see him in pain or suffering. She said. She was deep in thought until she felt something rubbing on her foot. It wasn't something annoying or painful. It felt....pleasurable. She moans softly and looks over to see you're not next to her. Tyne..... Always thinking of me. She said with a smirk. She would have this stopped right now, but you tending to her tired and sore feet felt so good right now. So she'd let this for a few more minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard the soft moan from her, it was a signal for you to keep going. You massage as much as you can of her right foot. Then moved to her left foot to do the same. It wasn't until she grabbed you between her big and second toe that you stop. She sits up and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what do we have here? It can't be Tyne because he should be up here next to me and not moving. She said. You give a nervous laugh. Because he knows what happens when his disobeys me when it comes to his safety. She said, lightly squeezing you. Hmm. How should i punish you this time?  Should i make you my toe toy for the day? She said. Her toe squeeze you with a little more force. Or.....put you in boots and make you my insole? Maybe just smother you between my feet and cover you in my sweat? Decisions, decisions.... She said. You hear a few more ideas she mulls over before looking back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm. I can't decide. What do you think i should do with you? She said, smiling. W...well.... Maybe show mercy? I was only thinking of you and how you wanted to relax. You said, playing along. Well..... You did remove all that tension in my feet. And you have been on the up and up since last time. Plus, all the ideas i could think of are cruel and mean and i can't be like that to you. So..... I guess i can be merciful. She said. You smiled until her toes start squeezing you again. But that doesn't mean my toes will be. You showed them no attention at all, and they're not happy with you. She said with a playful smile as her toes squeeze you slightly tighter. So i suggest you give them some attention as well before they stop being nice with you and start becoming rough. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't waste any time and started kissing and rubbing her big and second toe. Hehe! That's it. Show them that you care for them. She said. You kept kissing and rubbing her toes to \"satisfy\" them so they'll let you go. Rey giggled as she watched you please her toes, and it wasn't until 5 minutes had passed until they released you. Looks like you made them happy enough to let you go. She said. I won't forget them next time. You said and kissed her big toe; causing them to wiggle excitedly. You're then force lifted into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't sound harsh or uncaring, did i? She said. No. You were fine. And besides the initial shock, i'm doing just fine. You said. Ok.... She said, a little relieved. She kisses you on the head. Tyne..... I've been thinking. You think the jedi temple might have something that can help you with your pain? She said. I wouldn't hold my breath over it, but it wouldn't hurt to look. You said. I thought about going to a doctor as well, but they'd experiment on you for other reasons and i won't have you be turned into some...research project. She said. That....would be unpleasant, and the mental image of it wasn't helping either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey put her boots back on and picks you up. If you starting hurting again, let me know. Alright? She said. Ok. You said. I mean it. I don't want you putting on a brave face or anything. I want to know the second you feel it. She said. I will. As soon as i feel it coming back, i'll tell you. She said. With a nod, she puts you down her cleavage. She takes a few stim packs with her before leaving for the temple.</span></div></div>",

And her twisting and grinding did you no favors as you heard a rib crack and cough up blood. At this point, you were just wishing for death. Anything to just make all this stop. Just when you thought your prayers were answered, the foot is lifted off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that, still alive and kicking? You\u2019re a tough one. She said, with a smile. You just want this all to end. For her to just crush you and be done with it. But that doesn\u2019t happen. Instead, she grabs you with her two tree sized fingers and lifts you up to her huge face. What kind of bug are you that\u2019s so tough? I expected to clean you off like the rest, but you didn't burst. She said. You don't know whether to thank or curse being this durable. Since you're a tough one and all..... Maybe i'll keep you. I could use an insole to ease all the walking. Or as something to take out my stress on. She said with a laugh. You couldn\u2019t speak for the pain, but you grimaced at the thought of being her plaything. Let's get a better look at you. She said. When she brought you closer to her, all the laughter and smiles died away under closer look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nY\u2026.you\u2019re not a bug. You\u2019re\u2026. She said, stunned. You smile as best you can. She covers her mouth in shocked as all the actions she\u2019s done to you hit her. I\u2026. You\u2026. She said, trying to rationalize what she\u2019s done. You cough up blood which snapped her out of her trance. You could see the shock in her eyes, but that was quickly wiped away when you coughed again. She put her boot back on and ran inside her AT-AT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed somethings off the counter and set you down gently. You groan a bit as she looked over your bloody body. Her finger feels around your body. Disjointed limps, lacerations, bruise \u2026. She said. She felt around your sides and you winced. Broken ribs as well\u2026.! She said. She turns around and almost throw up. In his condition, he won\u2019t survive without immediate care. She said. She'd imagine you were screaming your lungs out that you were human. .....I have to help him. She said. She turns to you and grips your arm. Listen to me. She said gently. I need to set your limbs back in place. She said. You look at her as she grabs your left arm with two fingers. Ok\u2026.. 1\u2026.2\u2026.3! *Forces your arm back in place*. ARGH!!!! You said as it was set back. The pain was so intense that you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Now your leg. 1\u2026.2\u2026.3! *Forces your right leg back in place*. Ok. How\u2019s that? She said. No response from you. No, no, no, no, no! Don\u2019t you dare go into that light! She said. She places her finger on your chest to resuscitate you, but she felt your heart still beating. *Sigh* Just out from pain. She said, calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were out, she cleaned out your wounds, wiped up all the blood; Everything she does when she gets hurt. When it was all done, she tore off a piece of clothe and wrapped it around your stomach. She then rummage around the AT-AT until she found a stimpack. She was saving it for in case she was really hurt one day, but you need it more. So she stuck it in your side and injects you. There. Now I just need to wait. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl went about her day as usual. She made herself some food, counted the remaining credits she had, prepped for another scavenger run, ect. All the while waiting for you to come to. She was curious about you and how you got like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and hold your head. Oh\u2026.. Where am I? You moan. You look around to see you\u2019re in a gutted-out AT-AT. And you\u2019re laying down on a counter with a piece of cloth covering you. When you moved, you felt a sharp pain. You wince and grab your side. Ugh\u2026. Feels like a broke a rib. Wait\u2026. You said remembering. The last thing you saw was a huge girl\u2019s face and lots of pain. You got to your feet and see more clothe wrapped around your stomach. D\u2026. Did she do this? You said. You wondered where she was when you heard light snoring. You turn around and she her with her head on her arms and sleeping with a blanket covering her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s her. She was the last thing I saw. She brought me here. And she did this to me. You said. Did she bring you here so she could make you suffer more? You do remember seeing her concern over seeing you. She must have cared if she doctored you. But did she only do it to have her way with you? You\u2019re already small, hurting, and in a place you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t want to add being a plaything to that list. You trudge to the edge of the counter. Quite the drop, but the sand should cushion my fall. And not that far of a distance to get out. You said. You look at the sleeping girl. She\u2019s out like a light. Won\u2019t know I\u2019m gone until the sun comes up. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven your condition, you\u2019d make it out of the AT-AT, but the desert is vast. And who knows how long it could take you to reach a town or whoever finds you will be any better? Plus, the coldness and whatever insects that are out there won\u2019t make it any easier. But is that chance better than staying here with her?</span></div></div>",

Clouds of dust rush past you and your mother as the desert girl takes her closest step to you yet, forcing the two of you to raise you arms in front of your faces in an effort to protect your eyes! The next step overshoots you, as you watch the underside of the girls boot pass overhead; specks of dirt drop from the treads of the boot and land with continuous thuds as torrents of them rain down all around you! The two of you duck in cover and wait for the chaos to cease. With a final colossal boom that once again blasts you with a wave that knocks your mother onto her knees, the girl carries on towards the old wreckage of what looks like a hollowed out AT-AT from the days of the Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to your mother and help her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\", you ask as you wipe the dust from her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,... yes Im fine... Tyn... look, on her hip.\", your mother pointed with an unsteady finger up at the distancing giantess and you followed her direction, catching the sight a strange, silver, cylindrical object dangling from its place on her belt. Something about it seemed familiar, obviously your mother recognized it, she couldn't take her eyes off the thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom.. I know I've seen one of those before but.. I cant recall. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A light saber. Jedi use them, Tyn. That girl must be a jedi! She can help us get back home to the teleporter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? A jedi?\", you recalled the memory now. A photo of your father standing next to blonde haired man with the same kind of weapon holstered to his hip. \"But nobody's seen a jedi since Luke Skywalker vanished. I think its more than likely that she just stole that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonetheless, I know our odds if its just up to us to get out of this desert. We need somebody to help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder what to do as you watch the 'unconfirmed' jedi enter into the AT-AT husk and exit your sight. Your theory of her being either just a thief or a scavenger only strengthened in your mind. What would a jedi be doing in a dump like this? However, your mother had a powerful point. There was no way you would survive out in the desert without a big helping hand to keep you both out of trouble. It seemed there was really no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. What are you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... um, first things first we need to get to her. So come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your mother began your trek across the mile long stretch of hot sand to the interior of the wrecked walker. It was astonishing to realize this girl had crossed this distance in a few steps. More than that, you were just grateful you somehow ended up at this spot, and not in the middle of the endless dunes of the deep desert. Eventually, the two of you made it the cleared entry way made into the walkers belly. Once inside, you spotted the girl standing at a table, pinching the leaf of a dead potted plant you didnt recognize. If you didn't know any better, you'd say it looked like she was reminiscing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the two of you were inside, you figured you would need a plan of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, Tyn?\", you're mother asked you.</span></div></div>",

She leaned back on the headboard and stretched her still nylon clad feet over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready\", she asked and to answer you decided to just get started. You walked up to the flesh wall that is her right foot and got to work. You just used both hands and rubbed Leia's foot as much as you could. Even her foot was taller than you now so you could only barely reach her toes. \"That tickles\", Leia giggled at your attempt at a massage. \"Don't forget the other foot...unless you want to stop\", she reminded you. So you quickly ran over to her left foot and began to do the same thing. The whole time you were beginning to get a lot of Leia's foot sweat all over your hands and the only thing you were smelling was again just Leia's feet, and honestly you were starting to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Leia pulled her feet away crossing them before saying, \"Well that was fun\", she said with sarcasm, \"But I think its time...\"</span></div></div>",

I keep telling you, I'm not an Imperial spy! You shout in frustration. Her grip tightens as she gets a little angry. You're lying! Why else would you be here? Random chance? She said. Yes! I just woke up here, saw you, then you saw me and jumped to the conclusion of me being a spy. You said. That's ridiculous! You just happen to wake up in here? Why should i believe you!?  She said. It's.....the truth. You said, finding it hard to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeia grits her teeth that you still won't talk.  After being her butt cushion and mouth toy, you still hung onto that line. If you were a spy, she was going to get you to admit it, and spill everything you know. But....there's always the chance that you aren't and you are who you say you are. You could be telling the truth or you could be lying through your teeth. She can't take any chances, so there's only one way to find out for sure. She loosens her grip so you can breathe properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, little man. IF you aren't a spy, then you wouldn't mind answering a few simple questions. I mean, an innocent person would do anything to clear their name. She said with a sly smile. I am innocent! You said. Then you have nothing to worry about. If what you say is true. She said, smiling. Leia was looking for any signs of lying. Sweating, looking around, nervousness, anything. Fortunately, you were waiting for her to ask her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk then..... What's your name? She said. Tyne Wernim. You said. She stares at you for a second. Do you know who i am? She said. Not a clue. You look important, but name wise, i don't know who you are. You said. Hrm.... Do you know who leads the Empire? She said. No! I don't even know who you are. Why would i know who leads some Empire or whatever? You said. ......How did you get here? She said. Like i said, i just woke up here. I'm just as surprised as you were when you saw me. You said. Ok. Answer this. If i didn't see you, what would be your plan of action? She said. Obviously get your attention and hope you help me out. What? You'd think i'd be some pervert at this size and watch you undress or something? You said. Don't get smart with someone who can turn you into paste without thinking about it. She said. She squeezes you to enforce her point. Ah.... Ok, ok! You said. She stop and think over what you've told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this seems too much to be a coincident. You just happen to be here, at this size, and not knowing how. Overhearing any conversation i have and being able to fit just about anywhere to hide away. She said. Then here's something to thing about: Why would I let you pin me under your foot earlier? Or let you grab me? Wouldn't I have run away from you if I was a spy? You said. This seems to put her off as she didn't take that into account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits back down in the chair with you in her hand. She was deeply thinking over the things you said.

Guess I have to make it up to you now. But you can\u2019t fault me for thinking you were a spy. She said. Are you that important? You said. Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. She said. Princess? Guess that would explain why you\u2019re in all white. So what now? You drop me off at the next port or whatever? You said. That was the idea at first. But since we got all this cleared up, I think it would be better for you to stay with me. She said. Really? You said, a bit surprised. It\u2019s the least I can do after what I did to you. She said. Seem like things are taking a turn for you. You finally got her to believe you weren\u2019t a spy. And she seems adamant on making up for torturing you. But it did seem a bit quick change of heart to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, excuse me if it seems I\u2019m ungrateful, but why the sudden change? You\u2019re torturing me to your heart\u2019s content.

I made the mistake of torturing an innocent person and I don\u2019t think an I\u2019m sorry will cut it. And at your size, I don\u2019t think credits have that much use for you. So the only thing I can think of is to take care of you. Unless you want me to use and abuse you like a slave? She said, smiling. No, no! That\u2019s fine! It just\u2026..seemed like a really quick change of heart. She said. Will this change your mind? She said. She brought you closer to her mouth and you flinch, but her lips never parted. Instead, they were puckered. You felt her soft lip pressed on you. She held you there for a minute before pulling you away with a little pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her with a shocked look as she laughs. So\u2026. Does that earn your trust? She said. Uh\u2026. No. You said hoping she\u2019d give you another. You got your wish as she brought you in for another kiss. This one lasting a bit longer. She pulls you away. How about now? She said. I\u2026.think it\u2019s a start. You said. Good. And next time, just ask. She said. Y\u2026you knew? You said. Your shifting eyes gave it away. She said.

Again, she opened her mouth to breath\u2026 But as you looked up to see the light from her mouth you only found dread as you slowly slid head first closer to the back of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her tongue contracted and you slipped into the back of her mouth and your upper body was dangling over the black abyss that was her throat. Your screams fell on deaf ears, a slight smile spread over the princess\u2019s face as she closed her eyes, breathed in one last time, tilted her head back, and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gulp...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid head first screaming down as you were forced down her throat, which constricted around you as you slowly descended into her stomach, where you would meet your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Leia said to herself realizing what she had just done, but she smiled. \u201cOh well, he wasn\u2019t going to talk anyway\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(Doesn\u2019t look like she has any bad intentions. Hopefully this is a one-time thing.) Alright. Because you\u2019re pretty and been nice to me, I\u2019ll do it. You said. Ashoka giggles and puts you on the ground. She sits down, takes her boots off and puts you down in front of them. You look her feet up and down as she wiggles her toes in excitement. Well? They aren\u2019t going to worship themselves! She said. (She\u2019s pretty eager. Almost like she wants me as a foot slave.) You thought. You walk up to her feet and start kissing them. The feeling of your lips on her feet made her laugh. You look so cute down there! She said. After a few minutes of kissing, Ashoka pins you under her left foot, between her big and second toe. Heh heh! I got you! Now, what will you do? She said. You start kissing her toes frantically. Your rapid kissing makes her giggle. Kissing won\u2019t save you. She said as she wiggled her toes. (She\u2019s enjoying this too much.) You thought. If you don\u2019t act soon, I\u2019ll add more and more pressure to your body until\u2026..crunch!! She teases. You think for a few seconds until an idea came to into your head. Swallowing what pride you had left, You open your mouth and lick her foot. Ohhhh. That\u2019s better, little one! She said. You lick her foot a few more times until she lifts it off you and you get up. You\u2019re not done yet, little one. Keep going! She said. There has to be a payoff for all this. You mutter. You walk back to her feet and continue worshiping them. You kiss, lick, and even bow to them. All the while Ashoka is giggling at the little person at her feet and enjoying herself. This goes on for 30 minutes until she picks you up and places you in her hand. Thank you. My feet never been treated like that before. They didn\u2019t leave a bad taste in your mouth, did they? She said as she rubs your head. No. I was surprised that there was no pungent smell. You must take care of them. You said. As much as I move around, I do find the time to clean myself. She said. Ashoka continues to gently rub your head and smiles sweetly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t take it anymore! You\u2019re just so cute! She said. Ashoka pulled you in close and kissed you. You were completely enveloped in her soft lips. It only lasted for a few seconds, but to you, it felt like hours. She breaks it and smiles. Did you like that? She said. W\u2026.w\u2026.what was\u2026.t\u2026that for? You said, trying to form words. I couldn\u2019t help myself. You are so cute like this! She said. You blush at her comment. You\u2019re too cute to show my master. I\u2019m keeping you. She said. S\u2026.should I be worried about this? You said. I promise I won\u2019t mistreat you. And I\u2019ll protect you. No better protection than a jedi, right? She said. (At this size, I won\u2019t last a day. Staying with her is the best option. Plus\u2026.she is pretty. And if I\u2019m as cute as she says I am, then she\u2019ll keep me close.) Ok. You talked me into it. You said. You have nothing to fear now. She said as she squealed with joy. I hope this is the right choice\u2026.. You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe still have plenty of time before I have to leave. What do you want to do, cutie? She said. You\u2019re\u2026..letting me decide? You said. Why not? I already had my fun. It\u2019s your turn. She said with a warm smile. She said. If you\u2026.say so\u2026. I want to\u2026.</span></div></div>",

They left an impression on you, didn\u2019t they? She said. She moves her hand over her chest and dumps you right down into her cleavage. You take a moment to get your senses about you before climbing back up. It takes a minute before you popped right back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cute before, now you\u2019re just adorable! She said. Well, it\u2019s just like before, except she knows of you now. I guess this won\u2019t be as bad as I thought it would be. This size and in a girl\u2019s cleavage? Guys would kill to be in my spot. You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at you, Ashoka had a huge smile on her face. She was obviously enjoying having you there as she pushed her breast together a few times, but she saw you weren\u2019t enjoying yourself. Which made her frown a bit. She wants you to have just as much fun as she was having. It\u2019s not that enjoyable if she\u2019s the only one having fun here. Come on. Why are you enjoying this? You asked for this. She said. W\u2026what do you mean? You said. You\u2019re closer to me than anyone has ever gotten and I pushed them together and you\u2019re not reacting to it. She said. I-I know I said this, but I don\u2019t want to take advantage of you. You said. I had you worship and kiss my feet. I think we\u2019re well pass that point. Plus, I want you to have as much fun as I am. So if you want to get a little handsy or go further in, I have no problem with it. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give yourself a quick pinch to make sure you\u2019re awake. You are. She\u2019s letting you do whatever you want. And she brings up a good point. Not being taking advantage of went right out the window. Good thing this isn\u2019t one sided. And if she says it\u2019s ok with her\u2026. Who are you to argue? So you go down further down; which made Ashoka smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept going until you reached your destination: Her nipple. You were just barely bigger than it was. Which would make this easy for you. She wanted me to have my own fun. You said. You start rubbing it with all your might. Outside, Ashoka could feel you hands on her nipple and let out low moan. She cups her breast with a giggle and wonders how far will you go with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the nipple getting hard, so you pressed into with more effort; even biting it a few times which got a surprised yelp from Ashoka. Mmm! Someone\u2019s creative. She said. Hearing that, kept doing what you were doing as the low moans and giggles were letting you know how good you were doing. You didn\u2019t stop until she fished you out and held you in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to say, I was not expecting that. You really took me by surprise. She said. Just\u2026.having fun. You said. As you should. I don\u2019t want to be the only one having a good time here. She said. She sets you down on her bed and kneels down. Now I have to leave for a meeting. I thought of taking you with me, but I doubt you\u2019d want to be bored for that long. And if you did that during the meeting, I'd have a lot of explaining to do. She said. How long will you be gone for? You said. I can\u2019t say, but I\u2019ll make up every minute when I\u2019m back. She said. She gives you another full body kiss. When she breaks it, she stands back up and walks to door and leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ashoka gone, you had time to take in the situation you were in. Shrunken, no way to get my size back or go home, and in an unknown place. But I\u2019m with someone who\u2019s looking out for me and isn\u2019t abusing me or using me for her own enjoyment. Well, she is but she\u2019s letting me enjoy it too. You said. It could be worst for you. She could be downright mean and make your life hell. And you shutter at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing to do, you just lay there and wait for Ashoka to come back and it was a long wait too. You were about to doze off when you heard the door slide open and saw\u2026..</span></div></div>",

All you have to get into character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT\u2026that\u2019s right, jedi. I had assumed this was your master\u2019s room. You said. No. it\u2019s mine. His is the next corridor over. So. Why don\u2019t you make this easy on yourself and tell me who sent you? She said. And you\u2019d think I\u2019d tell you? You said. I\u2019m giving you a chance to come clean. Others wouldn\u2019t be as nice as I\u2019m being. They\u2019d invaded your mind and leave you a drooling husk. Is that what you want to happen? Plus, there\u2019s much more to do with a tiny prisoner. She said. Your scare tactics don\u2019t work on me, jedi. My master prepared me for things like this. I\u2019ll never tell. You said. You say that now. But you\u2019ll soon tell me everything. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops you back down on the bed. You shake your head as your senses come back just in time to see her butt land right on top of you. You weren\u2019t completely under her; just your lower half. She\u2019s not putting down her entire weight on you yet. You can stop this before it gets any worst. Just tell me what I want to know. She said. Rgh\u2026. Never! You said, pounding on her butt. The sight of you fighting back made her smile and laugh. Especially since your hits only tickled her. Ahsoka adds a bit more weight down on you, but you still say nothing. She then gets off you and grabs you. It doesn\u2019t have to be like this. Just tell me and this stops. She said. Not on your life. My lips are sealed. You said. Really? Let\u2019s test that theory. She said. Ahsoka increases her grip on you. Urk\u2026.! You said. Her grip wasn\u2019t enough to hurt you, but it pushed the air out of you. I\u2026.is that\u2026..all you got, jedi? You said. I was going gently, but since you asked. She said. Her grip became tighter as you breathe deep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it really worth it all this pain? She said. You\u2026.won\u2019t break me\u2026..! You said. After a minute passes, her grip loosens and she brings you to her lips and kiss you. She gives a soft smile before it turns annoyed. Fine. I didn\u2019t want to do this, but you leave me no choice. She said. She closes her eyes. At first, nothing happened. Then you feel a mild head pain. Like something was inside it. Ugh\u2026! You said. But the second you felt it, it was gone. Ahsoka tried to regain her concentration, but couldn\u2019t as she opened her eyes. Ha\u2026! A jedi that can\u2019t read minds? Are you even a jedi to begin with? You said. I am! She said with a hint of anger. I told you. I\u2019ll never talk. So torture me however you like. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhsoka was a bit frustrated. She\u2019s tried physical pain and even reading your mind, but that failed horribly. Then a new idea came to mind. Ok, tough guy. Since you can withstand some pain and resist mind reading. We\u2019re going to try a different method. She said. She opens her hand and drops you on the bed. She then brought her finger to you and starts rubbing you. What are you planning on doing? Tickle me to death? You said. You\u2019re going to wish that I did. She said. Her finger starts to move lower to your crotch and you go wide eyed. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s exactly what you think. She said. She rubs your crotch a few more times. You wouldn\u2019t\u2026..! You said. I would. No one harms the people I care about. But I\u2019ll give you one last chance. Tell me who sent you and I\u2019ll stop. I\u2019ll even let you go when we get to the next planet. She said. You\u2026.won\u2019t break me\u2026.! You said. Very well. Remember, I gave you a chance. She said. You tried desperately to keep from getting stiff, but the soft, gentle strokes just felt too good. It only stopped when you had a clear bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere we go. Now, I was going to do this for a cute friend of mine, but I\u2019ll practice on you first. She said. You try to fight off her finger, which got a giggle out of her. But Ahsoka was successful in getting your pants down and your member was fully exposed. She then holds your arms up and pins them together with her finger. She moved her head down towards you and opens her mouth and clamps it down on your dick and starts to suck. You had to fight to suppress from moaning. Ashoka saw you were losing it and kept going. She licks your member a few times and would pick up the pace of her head movement and then slow down. You had to bite your tongue to keep from moaning, but it was written all over your face. You were right were she wants you. Within a few minutes, you were on the edge about to release when she stops and pulls her head back. You look at her bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Were you expecting me to let you shoot everything you had down my throat? She said. You shake your head yes. No. You don\u2019t get to do that. Only one person is allowed that special privilege. And you\u2019re not him. She said. You were about to lose it. She put you on the edge just to stop. If your arms weren\u2019t pinned, you\u2019d just finish yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut\u2026. I could make an exception for you. If you tell me what I want. She said, smiling. A... Anything you want\u2026.! You said. Your master\u2019s name. She said. Lord Riktor. You said. And are you his only assassin? She said. No. I'm one of many. You said. Is he allied with the CIS? She said. No. He doesn\u2019t want to get caught up in allegiances. You said. Then why send an assassin if he\u2019s not with the CIS? She said. An initiation. To see if we have what it takes to be his assassins. You said. So a test, huh? Kinda wrong to send such a tiny assassin. She said. Size means nothing when you have the force. We either come back with a saber or not at all. You said. Then I guess you\u2019ve failed. She said, giggling. So I bet you want me to finish before you go limp? She said. Yes! You shout. Well, since you told me\u2026. She said. She opened her mouth back up and closed it on your dick and resumed. Within two minutes you blow right onto her tongue. Mmmm. She said. She pulls back and with a loud gulp, she swallows it down. So that\u2019s what a sith tastes like. You can\u2019t even respond as you regain composure. Ashoka cups her hand and picks you. Let me just\u2026.there. She said, pulling your pants back up. She then kisses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026. Did you have fun? I didn\u2019t hurt you too badly? She said. Yes. And no. You said. Oh. Good. I didn\u2019t think you would. It just came to me when I saw you there. I said I\u2019d make it up to you. She said. You did. In more ways than one. You said, smiling. Everything was impromptu, but I had a feeling you\u2019d love that last bit. She said. You said it was for a cute friend. Did\u2026.you mean me? You said. Who else do I consider cute and a friend in this room? She said. You blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow how about we get some rest? I\u2019m thinking we both could use it. She said. Yeah. It has been a long day. You said. Ashoka climbs on and lays down and places you down in her cleavage. Is this a good place? I don\u2019t want to suffocate when you turn over. You said. Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t toss and turn in my sleep. You\u2019re perfectly fine. She said, rubbing your head. If you say so. You said. With a smile, Ashoka closes her eyes and drift to sleep. You soon follow suit with the rhythmic, soft beat of her heart.</span></div></div>",

So you worm yourself free and head up to her face. You kiss her on the lips and a smile forms. That's when you got an idea. Ashoka had her fun with me. Now it's my turn. You said. You move up to her head and to the pillow and jump down behind it. Now all you have to do is wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshoka woke up about 20 minutes after you did and she kinda didn't want to wake up as she was, to her, having a really good dream of adventure with you by her side. It went as far as you finding out you had the force as well and she became your master. She taught you everything her master taught her and taking on droids and siths together. Then she just had to wake up from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh.... That was a good dream too. She said. Ashoka looks down, but doesn't see you. L-little guy?! Where are you?! She said. She quickly gets up and looks herself over. He's not on me. D....did he run away? No. He wouldn't have a reason to leave my side. She said. She rack her brain for a minute then she calms down. Ok. He must still be in here. No way he could leave through the door. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek from behind the pillow to see Ashoka looking all around for you. You quietly chuckle at her, even though she looked genuinely worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on. Where is he? She said. She was on her knees and looking under her desk. There's not that many places he could be. She said. She got up and scan for areas she hasn't look yet. The only place left was the pillow. No way... She said. She goes and reaches for the pillow, but you're not there either. Blast.... Not here at all. She said, putting the pillow back down. Little did she know, you had moved to under the sheets. You poked your head out just in time to see her sit down on the bed. Seeing her give up, you decided that now would be good to reveal yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshoka was distraught. You were nowhere to be found. If something had happened, she wouldn't be able to look herself in the mirror again. What do i do? I have to find him? But where could he be? The ship['s massive an he could be-huh? She said, feeling something crawling up her leg. She looks down and sees you getting to the top of her leg. She quickly grabs you and brings you to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were you?! Do you have any idea what i was thinking? She said. Sorry. I was just having fun with you. You said. Making me worried about you is your idea of fun? She said. I was hiding behind the pillow. You said. B-behind the pillow? Why were you there? She said. I was playing a game with you. Like you did with me. You said. But my game didn't scare you half to death. Just confused you for a minute. She said, with a little frown. It was all in good fun. You can't be mad at me for having my own enjoyment. You said. You are so lucky you are cute enough that i can't bring myself to be mad at you. She said, smiling. See?  And it's not like you weren't having some fun as well? You said. I was have a bit of it, but it was overshadowed with worry. She said. As long a you had some, my goal was accomplished. You said proudly. Ashoka just rolled her eyes as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're done being proud, how about we eat before the ship stops at our destination. She said. And where would that be? You said. Sorry, little guy. But you'd need one of these to know that. She said, activating her lightsaber. You and your jedi secrets. You said. And you still have more secrets to tell me, little sith. She said, turning her saber off. You got my master's name, but that's all you get from me! You said. We'll see about that. She said. You both laugh a little and she puts you as deep a she can into her cleavage. She then walks out of her room and head to the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there he saw that there was.....</span></div></div>",

BOBA FETT HAS ASSASSINATED OUR REBEL PRISONER! TELL THEM TO SEND AN INQUISITOR! NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyn turns back to the open door and steps onto the edge. The fall was high, but not high enough to kill someone, and the sand should help soften the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HALT! STOP RIGHT THERE!\" You hear from from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyn quickly leaps out and as she fell she turned around and shot the trooper in the gut, who then bent forward, lost his balance and fell off with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fell, Jyn grabbed you out of her pocket, then cupped her hands around you tight. Jyn landed on her feet but tucked into a roll at just the right time to avoid breaking her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyn rolls down a sand hill with her hands still around you until she reached the bottom. Jyn layed at the bottom of the hill on her back, completely out of breath, with her hands rested on her chest, still containing a tiny man between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyn seperates her hands slowly, allowing your body to lay on her chest. Jyn looks at you with deep concern and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyne?..... Tyne, are you okay?.... Tyne?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten more minutes momma.\" You respond half concious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyn chuckles, then rests her head down in the sand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This thing had the torso and tail of a scorpion, claws of a crab, hind legs of a dog with lizard feet, two sets of lizard legs up front, spider eyes, and to top it off, the armour of a rhino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thing was slighly taller than you, even though it was small, it was one of the deadliest things on Tatooine. If its stinger was left in you for more than three seconds, its venom would completely paralyze you. Then it would proceed to eat you alive from the feet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt let that happen to Jyn. You pick up a small pebble and chuck it at the creatures eyes. You strike one, the use this oppurtunity to climb up Jyns boot onto the tip of her toe. You then jump off at the Scorizer ready to bury the bone into its skull.</span></div></div>",

Her ass was right in front of you, so the idea pops into your head that maybe... you could crawl into her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never heard of tuskens committing sexual crimes, so that may be the only safe place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyns shirt was tucked in her pants, so you grabbed the shirt and tugged on it until part of it came out. You then grabbed the rim of Jyns pants, but as you did, Jyn was forced on her feet by the tuskens. Sending you up with her. You dangled from her pants as she was forced to walk to the tuskens bantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoisted yourself up then dove into Jyns sweaty ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyns eyes widened and her head shot up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didnt just do that.\" Jyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiggled down Jyns ass until you arrived in front of her asshole.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re offering to take care of me? Not hand me off to be studied? You said. It\u2019s better than being on your own. Or with that ruffian.

You said. Deluna. How about you tell me how you got tiny? She said.  She said. Oh, right. You said. You tell her everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo a teleportation device made you like this? She said. Yeah. I tested it, next thing I know I\u2019m bug size. You said.  You said. I can see why someone would take you for a spy. Small, almost unnoticeable. She said. It\u2019s terrifying. Everything can kill you at this size. You said. Then you think of something. You\u2019re not going to be taking advantage of my size? You said. Well\u2026.. Maybe if I have a stressful and long day and need to take the edge off. She said with a wink. Oh\u2026 Oh. You said, realizing what she means. But let\u2019s discuss that later. I\u2019m still on duty. She said. Before she can move you, she felt something against her back. Don\u2019t move. Jyn said. No.... Not her again. You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand him over. She said. Deluna looks at you with a pensive look. Hurry up! Jyn said irritated. Deluna puts you in Jyn\u2019s open hand and the look she gave you was anything but nice. You won\u2019t get away with this. We\u2019ll hunt you down like an animal. Heard that before. Jyn said before knock Deluna out with the gun and turning her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot an imperial, huh? Awful friendly with them. She said. I told you I\u2019m- She stops you by closing her hand into a fist and leaving only your head exposed. I don\u2019t want to hear it! Leaving me in that cell and hearing you talk to this officer is all the proof I needed. She said. You only heard the last bit. If you\u2019d just let me explain\u2026.! You said. Shut up! I\u2019ll deal with you later. She said. She shoves you into her pocket and looks for an exit.</span></div></div>",

While you couldn\u2019t see, you did hear the sounds of blaster fire and a few grunts. All you could do was sit and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for what felt like an eternity until a hand comes in and wraps around you, pulls you out, and puts you down roughly on a table. You take in your surrounding and see you\u2019re in what looks like a safehouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh\u2026. Who knew stormtroopers could aim? She said, holding her right shoulder and favoring her left leg. You also see a bruise on her cheek. How did you even escape to begin with? You said. Your Imperial friends aren\u2019t as smart as they like to look. She said. I\u2019m not an Imperial! You said annoyed. You expect me to believe you after what I heard? She said, bandaging her arm and leg. You only heard the last bit of that conversation. Just listen to me for a minute! You said. So you can make up some excuse? Like this is all a misunderstanding? She said. It is! You said.You know the worst part of all this? I wanted to believe you. She said sounding more disappointed and upset than angry. She sits down in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after this\u2026. You\u2019re going to tell me every single secret the Empire has. She said. This girl either had her mind set or just didn\u2019t care. Either way, you need to do something about this situation. As you were thinking, a loud bang made up jump back. You saw her fist right in front of you. Start talking! She said. I can\u2019t tell you anything because I\u2019m not an imperial! You said. \u2026..You know, you\u2019re no bigger than any bugs I come across. And I usually just crush them and go on about my day. She said. Is that suppose to scary me or something? You said. Let me finish. I usually just crush them under my boot. But sometimes, I like to get creative. Like squeezing them between my fingers. She said, reach for you.  Her fingers wrap around you and starts to apply pressure to you. You bite your tongue as she wanted to hear you scream. After a minute, she lets go. And that\u2019s not all. I also like to drop them inside my boots and feel them become mush as I walk. She said with a smile. You can see what she\u2019s trying to do, but you\u2019re not going to let her scare you so easily. Unless you want to experience it first hand, tell me all you know. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY-you think you scare me? I\u2019m not going to be frightened by some punk! You said. W-what did you just say!? She said. A punk! You said. You really have no idea how easy it would be to kill you right now. She said. You\u2019d have done it by now. You said. Maybe I will. After you talk. She said. Crap. That didn\u2019t work. You were hoping that calling her out would make her second guess herself. You need another plan to either get her to believe you or get away from her. That\u2019s when you get an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright\u2026.. I\u2019ll tell. Under one condition. You said. You really don\u2019t understand how this works, do you? She said. Oh, I do. I have the information you want. You kill me, and I die with it. And I doubt you\u2019d be able to find another spy so easily. Sure, you can torture and make my life hell. But there\u2019s nothing you can do that I already haven\u2019t been through to get where I am now. And I\u2019ll gladly die with it. So if you want it, you\u2019ll listen. You said. You put on a smug smile for her and hoping deep down she bought your bold face lie. You could see the anger in her eyes as her face contorted into an angry look as she knew she couldn\u2019t afford to kill you and pointed out finding another imperial spy would be impossible. Fine. What is it you want? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe play a game of hide and seek. You said. A game? Hide and seek? What are we, kids? She said. I\u2019m sorry. Who here ran away from the authorities like a juvenile? And who else but kids hate authority figures? You said. She slams her fist down in front of you again. This time with more force that caused you to fall on your butt. Don\u2019t you dare judge me. You know nothing about me! She said. She pulls her hand back and calms down as you get up. 10 minutes. That\u2019s my offer. You want the information you seek, then accept. You said. Rgh\u2026. Fine. She said. If I win, you drop all of this spy nonsense and either help me or let me go and find someone who will. You said. Still sticking to that story, huh? Fine. But if I find you, not only do you tell me all of the Empire\u2019s secrets, you\u2019re going to renounce them and swear yourself to me. She said. Swear myself to you?  You said. That\u2019s right. I get the information I want and you. I might keep you as my pet. Or maybe make you my slave. Have you serve my every whim. So many things i could do with a tiny person. She said, with a wicked smile. Like you didn\u2019t have enough incentive already. You either win or become her pet, slave or whatever she can think of. \u2026..Fine. Let\u2019s get this over with. You do know how to play, right? No blasters. You joke. She narrows her eyes at you as she takes off her boots. What are you doing? You said. You didn\u2019t say how I had to catch you. So if you happen to be out in the open when i find you\u2026.. She said, stomping her foot on the ground. Should have cleared that up. You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. Get moving. You got 30 seconds. She said. A little help off the table would be nice. And eyes closed. You said.  She plucks you up and drops you onto the ground. Go. She said, closing her eyes. You start looking around and see a few immediate spots. The small crevice between the bed and wall, there was a shelf that had some decent things to hide behind. You'd just have to climb up there first. And there also was her boots you can hide in. She wouldn\u2019t be wearing them for right now and it wouldn't make sense any sense for you to be in there. It could be the perfect spot; That is if they don't reek. She\u2019s getting closer to 30, so you had to pick somewhere.</span></div></div>",

You start climbing up her boot, get inside and make your way to the toe section just as she hits 30. Alright you little spy. Where are you? She said. You cover your nose as the foul stench hits. Ugh\u2026.. This girl must walk around lot to have this kind of smell. You said. Besides the dampness and putrid odor, you think this is a perfect spot.  Just one downside: You wouldn\u2019t be able to see her search for you. Part of you wants to watch her make a fool of herself as she comes up empty. But you\u2019ll settle for the shocked and possibly angry look on her face when the 10 minutes are up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jyn, this was tedious and annoying. Forced to play a child\u2019s game to learn the Empire\u2019s most valuable secrets. But that\u2019s if she wins. Which she no doubt thinks she will. She knows every inch of this place. And it would only be a matter of time before she finds you, gets the information she wants, and makes you swear yourself over to her. A smile spreads across her face as she thought of all the things she could do to you. Make me play your game, huh? You\u2019ll be playing my games when I find you. And you aren\u2019t going to like any of them. She said. She heads over to an obvious choice. The shelf. Many place to hide there and a good vantage point to lookout. She checks the sides to catch you climbing and started looking behind all the items, but didn\u2019t find you. Hrm\u2026. Where are you? She said. She walks over to the bed and notices space between it and the wall. She gets on her knees and checks between the small space. Not here either. She said. She gets an idea and reaches for the pillow. Got\u2026.you! She said removing the pillow, but empty handed again. Damn. I was for sure that time. She said. She even checked under the sheets but came up empty. Hmm\u2026.. No problem. Still have plenty of time. And he can only stay hidden for so long. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her boot, you could hear her looking for you. You bet she\u2019s smiling while doing so as she knows this place well. All you can do is just wait until the ten minutes are up. That's when you hear her call out to you. You can't stay hidden forever. I know every inch here and it's only a matter of time. If you come out willingly, i'll go easy on you and not make you do anything deeming or disgusting. In fact, i'll even let you choose what you want to swear yourself as. It's better than me choosing for you. She said. You're already inside one of her boots, so it can't get any worst than this. Plus, you think she's just saying that to get you out of hiding. The second you come out, she takes it all back and you're her whatever she makes you. So you stay right where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo? Alright. Don't say I didn't give you the chance. She said. I'm already taking a chance with my nose. Don't want to take anymore. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ten minutes were almost up, Jyn was starting to panic. Blast\u2026.. Where could he be? She said. Jyn checked in all the possible spots that you could fit and hide in but still didn\u2019t find you. It\u2019s like he just up and disappeared. She said. She was so sure that this would be easy. No more than 3 minutes it would take to find you. She\u2019d wanted to build up your hope as you got away from her and smash it as she found you repeatedly. But you were no where to be found. He isn\u2019t\u2026. She said. Jyn quickly checked her jacket pocket and pants pocket and they were empty. Not there either\u2026.. She said. She even looked at her bare feet to see if she might have stepped on you, but she didn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all falling apart. She was about to lose. Not only the game, but her potential information source. She\u2019d be right back to square one. Then, she looked at her boots. He\u2019s not\u2026.in there, is he?! She said. Jyn thought you were crazy if you went in there.  She\u2019s on her feet a lot and going from one place to another. And most of the time she doesn\u2019t wear socks, so the smell must really be horrible. She even turns her head sometimes when she takes off her boots. If you were in there, you\u2019d come running out in an instant. But she\u2019s checked everywhere else and came up empty. Where else could you be? </span></div></div>",

She checked everywhere in the place and even on her person and still didn\u2019t find you. He must have cheated somehow. I bet he used some sort of stealth device. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk\u2026. Ten minutes are up. You\u2026win. You can come out of hiding from wherever. She said. Waiting a few minutes, her eyes go wide when she sees you coming out of her boot and jumping down. No\u2026way.

Now this whole spy nonsense can die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the places you could have hidden\u2026.. She said, grabbing you. They were fair game when you took them off and hunted barefoot. You said. Jyn still couldn\u2019t believe it. You were right under her nose this entire time. Wanting to have her fun had cost her. If she had kept them on, she would have won hands down. And either start wearing some socks or wash your feet in your free time. Because that stench is unnatural. You said. You\u2019re lucky you won this little game or that would be your new home. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I won. So you\u2019re going to drop this whole spy thing, right? You said. She makes a sour face and says nothing. Right? You say again. Still nothing. Hey, if you would have found me, you\u2019d hold my feet to the fire about being a spy. I won fair and square. And you agreed to drop this if I won. You said. Fine! You\u2019re not a spy! I'll drop it! She said. Finally\u2026. Now are you going to help me out or not? You said.</span></div></div>",

You start pulling yourself backwards trying to get some distance as the bug works the plasma torch free finally tossing it aside. The bug was burned a bit with a few holes now gracing its face.

She felt a bit sorry for him, but she didn't know exactly what he was, so she had no intention to help him, and he could be usefull to her in the future. Plus, he was the one who tried to stuck with her, so she could say that he's definately stuck with now, that's it's fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the cantina, Jyn spotted a few stormtroopers at the entrance, checking everyone's identity. So she had to change her plan and moved on, maybe finding a place to sleep will be a better idea, and she'll find on the next day how to leave the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you started to get angry at the giantess, and you tried to escape.</span></div></div>",

That was\u2026..a quick yes. She said. Even she noticed it. It took her a few seconds for it to register what just happened. She said yes without even a second thought. Her heart must be bleeding over you. Yeah\u2026. You can stay with me. She said. You look unsure about your decision. Are you sure? You said. Positive. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you! I won\u2019t be a nuisance to you. I\u2019ll earn my keep. You need anything, don\u2019t hesitate. You said. S\u2026..sure. She said. Jyn was still on how quick she answered the question.

Of course. You said. Jyn pulls off her boots and puts her feet next to you. And they were massive. You barely came pass her heel. Outside on being sweaty, there was nothing on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyn noticed your staring and her smile got a bit wider. Are you scared of my big feet? You should be. Little things like you pop so easily. She said. She then pushes you over and holds you between her big and second toe. Or are you staring because you\u2019re a little foot perv? Wonder of all the things you can do with my feet? She teased.  She takes her foot off you and you get up. If that's case, then you can give them a kiss if you like. She said. Your face turns a bit red as she giggles and you start rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyn sighs in pure bliss. You were right. This is just the kind of distraction she needed. Plus, the sight of a tiny man at her feet was cute. For you, it was good as well. Got your mind off of the situation you were in. Minus the teasing. This goes on for a few minutes until she shifts her foot down onto you and rub her foot on you in a slow manner. Let me help you a little. She said, smiling. She rubs her foot all over you for a few minutes. Then does the same with the other foot. This goes on for a few minutes before she lifts her foot off you and pick you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm. You felt wonderful down there. I haven\u2019t been that relaxed in a long time. She said. Yeah\u2026. You\u2019re welcome. You said, a bit annoyed. Don\u2019t sound like that. It would have taken you hours. I just made it easier and quicker for you. She said. Can you at least give me a heads up next time? I thought you really were going to crush me. You said. Alright\u2026. As my apology, what do you want me to do? She said. You think for a second. \u2026..Kiss me. You said. Wh\u2026.what? She said stunned. After scaring me, I want a kiss. You said. She was taken aback by this, but puts on a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings you closer to her puckered lips and full body kiss you. You squirm a little against the warm lips as she held you there. You don\u2019t know how long she held you there until she back off with a big smile. So. How does it feel to kiss a giant? She said. It\u2019s\u2026..about the same. Only your lips are bigger. You said. Really? Just the same? Then I\u2019m not doing it right. She said. She brings you back and presses you against her lips. Just as before, her soft lips engulfed you. But this time, it felt a little\u2026.different. The last one was playful. This one feels a bit more loving. More gentle and caring. She holds you there for a bit longer then pulls you back with a little pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about this time? She said. A big difference. You said with a light tent of red. Jyn smiled until she realized what she's been doing this whole time. She doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s come over her. She\u2019s never acted like this before. Even with her few close friends. A few jokes here and a cheeky response there. But teasing? And kissing? She\u2019s never done this before. But with you, it just came like it was second nature. Is it your size? How cute you are? The desperate situation you are in? Jyn didn\u2019t know why she acted like this towards you. But somehow, you unknowingly had her affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyn? Jyn! You shout. Wha!? She said. You spaced out. Again. You said. S\u2026.sorry. I\u2019m just\u2026.thinking about something. She said. Is it something you want to talk about? You said. No, no! Not yet. At least until I\u2019m sure about it. She said. Her eyes shift from you to the ground. You think it might have something to do with you, and even though she won\u2019t say anything, you\u2019re are a bit curious as to what going on with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY\u2026.you\u2019re turn to pick. She said. Pick? You said confused. I chose what we did last time. Now it\u2019s your turn. She said. If she\u2019s giving you the option, you\u2019re not going to fight her about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh\u2026.. Ok. How about we\u2026..</span></div></div>",

But we only just met. You said. To keep you while i walk. You pervert. She said teasingly. Don't think you didn't want to put me in your breast pocket. You said. Next time, you're going in my boot. And i'll take the long way to my destination. She said. Don't threaten me with a good time. You said. You see your words are having the impact you want. She's smiling and laughing. Maybe she'll tell you why she's acting strange earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnymore? She said. Where were you going before you came across me? You seemed like you were in a hurry. You said. Do you really want to know? She said, leaning in. When you say it like that, sure. You said. Alright. I was coming from selling off some illegal weapons. I left before the guards come. She said. Strange. You don't look like an arms dealer. You said. Well, look are deceiving. And since I've told you.... She said, straightening up. I've got to get rid of you. She said. <br>\r\nWait, wha- You don't get to finish as her index finger lands on you and she push down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just had to ask. Now look what i have to do. She said. She push a bit harder. At least you won't make that much of a mess to clean up. She said. You try to lift her finger off you, but it doesn't budge an inch. You look at Jyn as she giggles and lifts her finger off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry. I just couldn't help myself. You really believed i was an arms dealer? She said. You sounded and act like one for a second. You said. Had to make it real. I didn't hurt you too bad, did i? She said. I'll feel better after I ask my last one. You said. You think you've gotten her to ease enough to tell you. Why were acting strange earlier? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when her smile drop. S-strange? How so? She said. Well, you stumbled a bit over your words, blanked out on me, and avoid eye contact like right now. You said. I-I was just thinking of.... Where to put you when night came. And i thought of a lewd place. She said. You'd blush, not look away from me. You said. She looks away. Just tell me. Maybe it's something i can help with. Look, i'll even turn around if it helps. You said, turning away from her. She looks and sees your back to her. She knows that if she doesn't tell you, you'll only ask again. Ok.... I was acting strange because..... You....do something to me. She said. I do something to you? In a good way or bad? You said. Good. I've never teased or kissed anyone before. But with you, it came second nature. And every now and then, i get this tingling feeling in my stomach. I've never been like this before. You give a oft chuckle and turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that means you find me cute. You said. Cute? She said. Of course. The teasing and kissing. You find me cute. You never come across something cute before? You said. On this planet, people are either hairy, smelly, shady, or unkind. She said. And where do i fit on there? You said. You're not on it. You're....different. She said. Like hug on and never let go? You said. More like, lock you away and keep you all to myself. She said. Same thing. It just means you think i'm cute and irresistible. At least i hope it's like that and not more of a prisoner. You said. And why not? I'd treat you well and feed you. I can't promise sleep as you'll be busy taking care of my needs. She said, smiling. And more teasing. You said. Don't worry. A lot more will be coming now. She said. Terrific. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it's my turn. She said. Only fair. Go ahead. You said.</span></div></div>",

Nevertheless the smell that was present is not so attractive anymore, indeed these sandals have not been worn for a few days now. But all of a sudden you feel something creak, that same thing moves you. You look up. The bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! Fuck me good Ani, come on!\" She said with wild excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggle to get on the bed because of the tremors, you see the senator being fucked like a dog. Only, you notice she's dressed as the Queen of Naboo in the olden days. Her face is soaked with white powder, the varnish on her fingernails and toenails is black, and she wears the big red dress with golden flowers as a motif, as well as a crown she wore when she was Queen (Episode 1: The Phantom Menace). The only difference is in the hindquarters, because the coat has been perforated...  You then see a terribly exciting scene, on one side you can see the chosen one, with only his cock coming out, fucking like a god, and on the other side you can see Padme spreading her ass with her hands to let Anakin's cock through. You're rinsing your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Padme! Padme! You like that, don't you, you little bitch? You wouldn't have thought the Jedi had such a big dick!\" He said in a dominant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ani! Your dick is so big! I implore you to come! \" She said in a submissive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't over. My powers will make you come!\" He said in a dominant tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you see now is a real game of submission. While you still see Padme getting hit by Anakin's dick, you notice Anakin's hand raised in the air and pointed at Padme, you see him using a torment of the force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your climax will stop and you'll come when you ride me like a goddess...\" He said to Padme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Padme stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie down, Jedi slave!\" She said in a dominant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadme's aggression stuns you.You see a smile appearing on Anakin's face, as if he had accomplished something that could satisfy him. It all made sense because Padme wasn't dominant enough, so something had to be done about it. A torment of force was then used by Anakin to change Padme's behavior. Something that seems to be working, since Padme positions herself right above Ani, puts her pussy on his dick, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Padme, damn it, it's so good!\" He said with wild excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Padme wagging her ass over Anakin's cock, and it's getting louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the queen, you are my toy! Do you understand?!\" She said frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got it! Arrrghh\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadme's ass slaps Anakin's cock harder and harder, it makes you jump on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Senator Amidala, former Queen of Naboo, I will make you come! Now!\" She cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh.. OOoh.. OOOH!\" He  said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ejaculation is so powerful, Padme's face is covered in semen. This last tremor is so strong and powerful that you suddenly flutter out of bed. It prevents you from seeing the rest, the final result, but you don't know what to do, get back on the bed, or go away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Qi\u2019ra giggled, \u201cWell, I hope you don\u2019t mind a closer look.\u201d She said, before gently lowering her foot\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything turned black as Qi\u2019ra\u2019s foot became your entire world as the warm fabric of her sock pinned you to the floor. Faintly from above, you could hear Qi\u2019ra giggling as she began to smother you back and forth underneath the sole of her foot. It was amazingly warm and soft\u2026 Not to mention the feeling of being completely dominated\u2026 It felt good\u2026 You could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQi\u2019ra giggled to herself sliding her foot off of you and moving her feet on either side of you. \u201cYou\u2019re so small\u2026 And cute\u2026\u201d She teased, \u201cI should keep you forever\u2026 As my little pet.\u201d She said, as her soles closed in around you and pinned you between them, and began to gently rub you back and forth between them. It felt like having two heated blankets smothering you on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the onslaught of affection stopped as Qi\u2019ra\u2019s feet slid away on either side of you. She was leaning down, smiling over you as she spoke. \u201cHow about we play a little game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously you replied, \u201cWhat kind of game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with you being small and all\u2026\u201d She said, gently reaching down and grabbing you. \u201cI was thinking it would be easy to come up with something a little more\u2026 Unique.\u201d She said as she held you in her palm just inches away from her seductive face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh\u2026 Sure.\u201d You said, getting the feeling that whatever game she came up with would be enjoyable for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was thinking we could play hide and seek or something. It should be a lot harder to find you at that size\u2026 Or maybe prison break.\u201d She giggled, \u201cI could\u2026 lock you up somewhere\u2026 Safe\u2026 And you have to try and break out, or I\u2019ll keep you there. Or maybe put you somewhere more secure\u2026\u201d She said, causing your imagination to run wild with possibilities. \u201cOr maybe something else, if you had a better idea\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You try to climb out the way you came in, but Qi'ra's stomach keeps rumbling and you can't get a good grip. You fall down, and land in a liquid. \"What is this stuff\" You ask yourself, but you soon realize what it is. \"How am I supposed to get out of here?\" You ask Qi'ra. \"I am so glad you asked\" She replies. \"If you can't get out on your own then I have a way for you to get out, but I have to warn you...you have only one hour left.\" Qi'ra explains. \"Okay then what are my options?\" You ask. \"I will start to gag, and pull you out of my throat, and everytime you answer my questions right I pull you out more, but everytime you get one wrong then you go back.\" Qi'ra explains/ \"So what will it be?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This made Rey gasp in awe as she was then worried what Jojo had planned next. Surely a child of his age did not know much about sex and the female anatomy. But whether he did or did not that did not stop young Jojo from fondling he entire body. She moaned as he ran his finger up and down the front of her body until she climaxed in his hand.

She was disappointed in this Fake Device and lay it back in the box and go to the kitchen. She came back with one wine bottle and two glasses. She saw a black point on her white floor and thought it is a bug and step on it. She put the glasses and the wine bottle on the table near the box. And go down to look at what she stepped on. There weren't any blood or something that looks like a crushed bug. She grabs the thin thing from the ground and feels it was something metal. She combined in her mind and get the device. Turn it on and go to Logs. There it stands:<br>\r\nRandom command<br>\r\nCreating object<br>\r\nSuccessful Created Car<br>\r\nSize: Random<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so happy when she read it. And she knew that will be a good night. Then Anakin cames and saw Padme. She was so hot. (Info he is now 16 years old and she 21 and hadn't had sex or something she only gave him a rub they don't care about the consequences. So they were a together but doesn't have had real sex). She said she had a surprise for him and he trusts her. She opened one Portal. The two go to the portal Padme stand 20000ft in distance and big city in front of her. Anakin was a strange mountain thing. It was a platform with Padme has spawned so he can enjoy the show. She ask him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A random Song came out: Nicky Romero - Toulouse V.24. This was slower as the normal but not distorted it was of same quality like the normal version which means she can good stomp to the beat. It was so loud that everyone in the city can hear and Anakin too. The music teasers a drop and go faster (00:00-00:45) while that Padme goes to the city and hover her Shoe above it. The people ran because they knew what now came.(00:46-01:30) the drop came and the beat start whit it Padme starts stomping on her \"dancing\" on the city. Her two shoes go alternately up and down it looks so sexy for Anakin. As it was over he tried not to cum. But Padme gives no up and start by (01:30-01:41) walking to the next city because the beat had changed. She was at the city her plan was it to do the same like before and she hovers again her shoe over the city now the city again on Panik. They say what to the last happened. She had an also a tactic if Anakin can hold it. She teaser the city so long while the beat goes faster. One of the Highways goes directly in Anakin's direction and it was full of vehicles.The beat goes again (03:00-03:45) and the city was crushed and she starts Catwalking again (03:46-04:17). She crushed with every step hundreds of people and cars.

On the left side, you can see her (Character) and she was massive. You order a scan for survivals. But the result was horrible. The ship was crushed by her shoe and stick on the sole.
