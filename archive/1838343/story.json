            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After another successful mission is done and over with, the famous bounty hunters know as NanoCorps are taking a break by the open grassy field from completing each missions today...That is until a mysterious package appears before them with unusual signature on top of the package. It look like a face with a mask and glasses on while doing a V sign. The hunters don't know it could be a big fan or something else, but they decided to open the package. Inside it is a strange device and a letter beside it...Quentin Andross, the young Drangua leader, opens the letter while Danny, the joking woman lover hunter, messes with the device but was swipe from his hands by Zeke, co-leader and wise old gunman. Quentin reads out loud to the hunters to hear this mysterious letter... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\"><span class=\"cnavy\">MWHAHAHAHA!! I am Dr. Van Micro, the greatest scientist in the world! I heard you are the best hunters around here...Allow me to offer you...A mission that could be very challenging. I sent you my latest creation that allows you and your friends to travel through time and space, into different dimensions. From there, I will sent you a list of wanted names and send something to me for proof that you taken them out. It's not like I don't trust you hunters, just seeing if you able to do it...Oh yes, here are two things you must be aware of. Number one: Since you call yourself NanoCorp...I added the device to change your size, making you smaller. A bit smaller than an ant. Number two: That list of names that you'll be tracking are actually...Females. Let's just say I have a thing for big gals~ MWHAHAHAHAHA! Good luck out there hunters! I will reward you handsomely...That is, if you survive...MWHAHAHAHA!</span> </div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finish reading the letter, Quentin and the others look at each other with confusion and skeptical. Viz Archer, the tough and cold hunter with two robotic arms, shake his in disbelief and protest on taking the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You have got to be kidding me...\" Viz said in his angry tone. \"I'm not gonna run around, killing women...Especially while were small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Viz.\" Petire, one of the Three Recon Stooges said. \"It kinda sounds fun! Not the killing the ladies part, but the whole shrinking thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? It sounds pretty bad...\" Ralph, second of the Recon Stooges said in sarcastic tone <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with Viz on this one...plus, I'm getting hungry...\" Sharper, the last of the Recon Stooges said while rubbing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree as well. How about we skip this one and call it a day.\" Danny said, relaxing against a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan...\" Slick, a powerful but lazy telekinesis said as he yawns while laying on the ground, scratching his butt <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on, if this device really works...We're gonna have to take the job, like it or not.\" Quentin said. \"If Beta confirms the device is working and able to use it, were taking it. If not, we will kindly replied back to the doc it does not work and be on our merry way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm starting to not like this Dr.Micro and this mission...Should we be offended?\" Sasha, the quiet dark assassin said to the two horned elven sisters: Alanna and Glenys which both of them nodded in agreement, the shy ghost girl Esmeralda also agrees along with the giant winged light blue skinned woman Slyphy while the wolf woman Ylva simply laughs at the doctor's writings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh...Words doesn't harm me, though he'll gonna feel the wrath of me on behalf of all women...and I hope his blood taste good...\" The vampiress Athanasia said, licking her lips for desire of blood before noticing Danny swoons over to them with his hand on Sasha's hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww don't worry, my sweet dark cutie. I'll make sure this Dr. Micro gets a good ol' fashion can of whoop ass after we make a decision.\" Danny grinning ear to ear. \"Now about us...How about you and me go somewhere nice and-\" The womanizer felt a punch in the gut, causing him to fell backward in pain. Alanna huffs in anger while Glenys laughs at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Danny...I like you, but that is not how you treat a lady...Especially grabbing her hip like that.\" Sasha said, holding back a chuckle or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gihaha! Serves ya right, Danny!\" Atomic, the biggest and silver skinned monster hunter laughs at Danny before turning to Quentin. \"Seriously though, maybe we should skip this one. I mean I love fighting our targets but being a size of a bug? That's a big no from Atomic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...But lets make this our last one before we call it a day...If the device works.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the hunters continue their conversation, Zeke hands the device over to the robotic brains hunter Beta and immediately begins scanning the device. The device has a knob on the right side and a button on the left, an antenna sticking out on the top and a screen at the center. It doesn't take for Beta to figure the device out and begins to press a button. A sudden burst of blue light appears in front of the hunters, creating a strange portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you know how it works?\" Quentin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative. I will handle the device.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like we're taking the job.\" Quentin smirks at Viz and Danny as they mutter in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I am not going to like this...\" Alanna sighs  while looking at Quentin. \"I hope you will raise our pay check for this mess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Alanna. I promise you all are gonna get a big raise after this. Who knows...This could be a challenge...Hunting down female targets-mind you, I don't find the mission quite exciting...But being tiny does sound pretty challenging and it might be-Glenys...Get off of me please?\" Quentin felt the two familiar soft orbs pressing against his neck from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to resist, my darling leader~. I know you like these big soft of happiness!\" Glenys smiles with a playful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sometimes...\"  Quentin quickly backs away from Glenys before making announcement to the team. \"Alright, folks. Grab your gears, equipment and such and head over to the portal! This could be a loooong mission....And someone get Slick?  He fell asleep again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every damn time...\" Viz sighs as he and Danny grabs Slick by the arm, dragging him to the portal with other hunters follow pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke and Ryx, the flaming swordsman, simply chuckle at their responses, knowing this is gonna be a weird and possibly challenging mission they ever done....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Quentin touches the 'ground' and it felt quite soft and squishy...and those large mountains far away from their position is quite strange as well: Orange like object covering the top of the mountains with what appears to be a bridge. Quentin scratches his head in confusion, there is no such mountains that has an orange structure on top unless it is a building, but there is no sign of buildings anywhere...As Quentin tries to figure where they are, a beeping noise from the device interrupted the leader's thinking before a hologram of Dr.Micro appears before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Mwhahahaha! Welcome to Karakura Town! There's nothing special about this town...Unless you believe in spirits.\"</span> The doctor said while laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spirits? Like ghosts? Yeah, I'm not a big fan of them...\" said Sharper \"Are we hunting a female ghost...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Sort of.

Never seen mountains with orange cloth on top and of course, mountains aren't suppose to be that brownish and this surface is a bit...fleshy...Which sums up that we are on Yoruichi's body or should I say...Her stomach,\" Quentin explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yep, that explains it. No 'mountains' can be that beautiful and delicious...Well there is another one...\" Danny eyeing on Vivian's chest. \"And they are quite big I must say.\" Danny was about to grope her breasts until Vivian brings her gun in his face, causing the woman lover to back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gihahaha! Seriously, Danny. When are you gonna stop picking on the rookie? Anyway, what's the plan, Quentin?\" The big silver brute asked the leader. \"She gonna find us here if not doing some action!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first off, is Slick awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters look at Slick, lying down on the ground, snoring away. \"That's a big old fat no.\" said Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like were gonna travel on her stomach, passing through her 'canyon' and make our way towards her face. We can get a blood sample and find anything to prove that we 'kill' her.

Now then...Her name is Nico Robin: An Archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates who is aboard on a ship called Thousand Sunny which you hunters are on as well. She has a nickname on her wanted poster that sounds pretty scary: 'Devil Child' and she has eaten a Paramecia type fruit called Hana Hana no Mi or Flower Flower Fruit which allows her to 'sprout' her body parts like arms and legs in a pretty pinkish petals...and with that info given, I'm outta here!

Be warn though...She is a water mage user, she can turn herself into water which makes a bit tough for you...If I were you...I would get a Gray Fullbuster costume and make yourself known to her and she might will-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not gonna happen, doc.\" Quentin sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Suit yourselves, good luck hunters!\"</span>The scientist laughs before signing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, we're hunting a crazy woman\" Ralph said sarcastically.\" And I do feel bad for Gray, having her following him around saying 'I love you Gray-sama~!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Good one, Ralph!...Rare to see you joke on something.\" Petire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hunters continue with the conversation, they were interrupted by a loud booming that was getting louder and louder. Before the hunters locate the sound, a large shadow covers the hunters. They look up to see a massive object heading their way, Atomic was the first one to act as he uses the tentacles he sprouts on his back grabbing his fellow hunters and jumps out of the harms way before the object slams down on their previous spot. Atomic landed away from the object and place the hunters on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whew...Thank you, Atomic.\" Petire said as he breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Good move there.\" Viz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem guys! But that was kinda close...Beta! Why didn't you tell us about this!?\" Atomic snarls at Beta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, Master Atomic. I was too busy gathering data from this world. I failed to notice we were in danger.\" Beta said. \"But we have the target. She's above us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters have notice another object right beside them which is similar to the object that almost crush them. It appears those two objects are actually dark brown boots. The hunters looks up to see a blue dress coat and since they are nearly underneath it, they can see a pair of blue panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Where's my camera!?\" Danny said drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut it..\" Viz slaps him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters keeps trailing the body, they can't get a good view of her face due to her...'Mountains' but they did see a lock of blue hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we climb this mountain of beauty!?\" Danny asked Quentin much to his annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to get a good view of her panties...Slick? You in a mood for teleporting?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really...I don't feel like it...Nor the climbing.\" Slick said while yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Guess climbing it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pervert hunter jumps for joy before heading towards the towering brown boot with the other hunters follow pursuit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

There are many different creatures in this land that she read in one of her books, big and small, but she don't recognize these ten insects here...Perhaps they are extremely rare breed of insects that no one discovers and they appear right in her room surprisingly. Delighted, Levy walks slowly and gently towards the rare insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her gentle walk, the hunters bounced on and off the floor with every step she take along with a ear shattering booms. They tried to get away from the giantess, thinking she might crush them but she was upon, placing her sandaled foot right in front of them. The hunters take a step back and get nice view of the towering Fairy Tail member: They already have met her sandal cover foot which they only can see the wall of sole, but they able to past it and sees her yellow short dress with a good view of her panties. They see her cute smiling face with blue shoulder length hair that is tied up with colorful bandanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...ain't she adorable?\" said Petire before looking at Danny. \"Ya ain't gonna swoon over her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.

Upon closer inspection, Levy gasped in shock realizing that there aren't rare breed of bugs...In fact, they are humans! Ten tiny humans in her room and not one of them is from Fairy Tail...Probably from other guilds or maybe they are spies...Levy decided to talk to them, hoping they are friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Hi there.\" Levy waves down at them  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Is she waving at us?\" Petire whispers to Quentin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I think she's friendly..Of course, just to make she is...\" Responding to Levy's friendly wave, Quentin orders the group to wave back at her, which they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy sighs in relief as they are seem to be friendly. To keep this friendly introduction, Levy lowers one of her fingers near the hunters, inviting them to climb abroad. Quentin and the group accept the offer and climbs her finger until they reach the tip. Levy slowly lifts the hunters away from the floor while standing up, getting a closer look of them. The hunters view is cover with Levy's brown grayish eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! I never seen a group of people this small before...My name is Levy, nice to meet you all! Is this magic ?\" Levy asked the hunters, knowing she has a lot of questions to throw at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am, we came from a different dimension by...a crazy scientist who wants us to test the device to see it works and well...Look what happen.\" Quentin explains to Levy, though not the whole truth of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are from another world!? Amazing!\" said Levy, \"Oh I gotta tell the others about this!\" Before she could go, Viz suddenly speaks out causing the young girl to halt in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a secret and it shouldn't be out..The scientist really gonna get us for spreading such secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Well...If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...The doctor will kill us for spilling a secret...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">not before Viz kills him first</font>...\" Danny chuckles before getting slap on the head by Petire. \"P-Plus, the device is..malfunction, so we won't be able to go back for awhile until it is fixed. Our machinist Beta, who is a robot by the way, is the only one in group know how to fix the shitty thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Master Danny. The device works-\" Beta was cut off by Petire while he was about tell them the device is working,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Beta...The device does not work, can you fix it for us?\" Petire winks at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh. Yes, of course. I'll have it fix in no time. In the mean time, why don't Miss Levy entertain you? Playing a game surely kill some time.\" Beta suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Entertain?...Gee, It's a bit embarrassing to entertain a bunch of tiny people...Alright then, I do have two of them.\" said Levy. \"The first one is a simply game called Cat and Mouse. It's a fun game that the girls and I play sometimes. Since the nine of you are small, it's obvious that you are all the mouse while I'm a cat. The rules are simple: The cat will try to catch you by pinning or trap you either under my hand, foot, mouth, etc. The other mouse can rescue the trapped one without being caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds easy enough for me.\" Viz grins. \"What's the second one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uhh...\" This one made Levy blush and she is wearing a short dress for this second game choice. \"Th-The second one is Trekking Mountain...You'll have to climb me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Damn!\" Danny blurt out his catchphrase and getting slap on the head by Petire again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anyway...It's like climbing a mountain and the first team who reaches the top, which is my head, wins. I can stop you on your tracks, but I won't pick you off...And don't get any funny ideas of groping me...Especially the one who said 'Hot Damn'\" Levy glares down at Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehe, don't worry about the perv, we're watching him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right...So which one are you going to choose.\" Levy asked the hunters, hoping they don't choose Trekking Mountain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters except Beta talk about the choices and they have made their decision...  </span></div></div>",

I do have a good wake up call just for Slick.\" Dr. Coon said as he gets out a small green pill from his pocket. \"With one dose of this, he'll wake up with such great energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!

They notice they are in someone's room, quite stylish and of course, everything's bigger due to the device's shrinking effect. Comparing to their size and everything around them-by Beta's calculation-they are at the size of an ant. Before the hunters can wait on the genius, Beta detected a life form in the same room and it's nearby...and surprisingly, Beta said the life form is exactly the same size as the hunters are right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin and the group looks over where Beta pointed at, spotting what appears to be a tiny man, slowly dragging a rather big bottle of nail polish across the floor. He appears to be a young man, wearing dark colored trousers and a dark colored blazer, striped bandanna and a pair of glasses on his forehead and he was having a tough time doing the pulling of the object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sorry for this poor fella, Quentin walks over to the man with other hunters follow pursuit with no objection of helping out...except for Slick as he is sleeping on Atomic's shoulder. The man notice the hunters, made jump up by surprise, seeing a group of tiny people walking to him...could it be it was the work for his partner? Wouldn't hurt to ask them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! I didn't except Miss Brandish shrink more on those poor people who annoyed her. She's get a pass as always~!\" The man smiles cheerfully,showing he's quite a nice guy...but to some hunters, however, finds him a bit creepy and suspicious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandish...?\" Quentin said, not knowing who is this Brandish person is. \"Who's Brandish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...!? You don't know who Brandish is!? How could you not know one of the powerful Spriggan 12 of Alvarez Empire!? Well, for that little remark, you fail.\" The man  suddenly begins to scowl at Quentin, surprising the Drangua who thought he was friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...Beta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandish \u03bc is one of the Spriggan 12: A group of extremely skilled and powerful mages gather by the emperor himself by the name of Zeref. I do not have much info about her, but she is very skilled of using this powerful magic called Mass Manipulation: A magic that gives the user the ability of altering the mass, matter, and/or structure of objects, increasing or decreasing the proportion at will.\" Beta explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! That's correct! Although...he's a robot with such full of knowledge...like that crazy Wahl Icht \" The man comes up to the robot, tapping against his armor. \"..He gets a pass~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kid. Who are you? You don't seem like a type who enjoys being this small...\" Zeke asked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right! Where are my manners? I am Marin Hollow, a proud member of Brandish Squad and servant to Miss Brandish. Now it's my turn to ask who you guys are? I never seen you group of people before...especially that big fella...\" Marin said while staring at the giant silver monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..Let's just say we're bounty hunters from different dimension, looking for our target....\" Quentin said, keeping much of their mission a secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....Are you targeting Miss Brandish?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...that I know of.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarin stares at the NanoCorps' leader in suspicion, knowing that they are here to kill his beloved master. Just as the man was about asked them another question, the massive door from the right side opens, revealing a young woman with green hair in a bob style with bangs cut above her eyes and blue cross-shaped objects attached to the sides of her head. Wearing a burgundy swimsuit showing her huge bust (much to Danny's excitement) and a coat with fur around the collar, a choker around her neck with chains attached to it and a pair of high heels that show off her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird man jumps for joy, welcoming his master's return...and hopefully he'll be able to return his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Brandish~! Welcome back! Seeing the sight of you always gets my pass!\" Marin gleefully said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes...It's annoying really...\" Brandish rolls her eyes in annoyance before walking over to Marin's spot. But as she gets near to her little servant, a foot way of Marin being squish by her, she spotted a tiny group of people beside him and none of them she didn't recognize,,,especially the rather big silver looking one. \"Marin...who are these people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...These people are actually bounty hunters from another 'dimension' and hunting down a target...which might be you, Miss Brandish! I say we get rid of them  before that happens!\" Marin got close to Quentin once more with fist balled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell you will...\" Viz pushes Marin away from Quentin with one of his mechanical arm changes into a blade, very close to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa! How scary you are and not even intimated by the sight of Miss Brandish...you get a pass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you a pass alright...right across your throat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How annoying...\" Brandish simply sighs while watching Marin almost getting close to losing his head off by Viz. She could go help her underling, if she feels like it. But this mysterious group look enough to cause trouble for her and Marin...Or rather pluck their leader of the floor and starts interrogating him.on where did they come from...and maybe have a little fun... </span></div></div>",

Not wanted to get soaking wet from these globs of rain drops, Quentin and the group ran over to a destroyed building nearby and waits for the instructions from Dr. Micro while Zeke, Danny, and Beta check out their new surroundings by peeping out of the cracked hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess the doc's invention really did the trick.\" Quentin chuckles, wiping the water off his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, he's lucky. That's all.\" Viz grumbles, shaking the water off of the mechanical arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Did any of you notice a lot of buildings demolish?\" Sasha said to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, almost like a bulldozer terrorize the town by a wacko.\" said Atomic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the group had their conversation, Zeke, Danny, and Beta came back to the group in an alarming state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys...is something wrong?\" Quentin asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, I think Beta should explain what happen to the area...or rather the world, kid.\" said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...world?\" said Slyphy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. I made a quick scan of the area and most of the half continent, and what it reveal to be quite terrifying. The humanity in this world has been killed by half of its population...by two androids.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two androids...?\" Petire and the recons look at each other before looking at Beta again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. They don't have any real names, but they go by the name of Android 17 and Android 18. Both created by a man name Dr. Gero, though he too was killed by them. Some people was strong enough to confront the two...but results in death. One Saiyan name Gohan was able to push the two back with the help of another one, Trunks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I fear this Gohan person didn't make out either, right?\" Glenys said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly, yes. Trunks is the only survivor to escape the androids' wrath and fled into a different timeline by using the Time Machine. Right now, the androids are still wreaking havoc across the world...and I bear another bad news: One of the android is here in Pepper Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. Which one of the androids is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Android 18.  A twin sister of Android 17.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...Dealing two of them in our current size will be a problem, but dealing one could be our avatage...plus she might be Dr.Micor's hit list, so there's that one...\" said Alanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be...How close is she?\" Quentin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very close.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be more specific, ya rust bucket! How close is-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Petire could finish his words, a loud booming noise causing the hunters to be high alert. Right near the entrance of their hiding area, a very large brown like object blocking the entrance way. The recons and Danny decided to climb the brown object without thinking about it and the others tries to call them back, knowing this could be Android 18's foot, but it doesn't seem to reach them in time.  While making up the top, the boys looks up, craning their necks and gets a surprise of their lives...Following the brown object which happens to be boots are dark blue tights and denim skirt, a black undershirt that has white and black striped sleeves along with blue denim vest and past through her breasts, they able to see a pretty face and blue eyes with blonde hair...and was looking straight at them four tiny hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Damn!\" Danny shouted with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no, Danny! Don't you dare say 'let's go out on a date' shit!\" Petire shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Guys...I think she spotted us...\" Sharper meekly said, hiding behind Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" The giant female android huffs with her hands place on her hips. \"I can't believe that 17! He must have cheating in that stupid video game and now I got annoying bugs crawling over my boots!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recons and Danny tries to get off of the angry android's boot but they were thrown off and onto the ground when she shakes them off before hovering her foot above the four hunters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll have to vent my angry on to you, little bugs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit! We're done for!\" Sharper shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...I rather died under her butt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny...I'll kick your ass when we're gone to heaven or hell!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his comrades are in trouble, Quentin turns to Atomic and Slick, who surprisingly stills up, to see who can rescue them. Atomic's sheer strength can easily repel the giant foot or Slick's shield can hold it off until they make a move, but who's he gonna choose...?</span></div></div>",

The young looking Kaioshin who happens to be 75 millions years old, wearing a robe that most of the Kaioshin wears and a pair of Potara earrings, and high heeled boots for her short stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiiiiii!\" The yellow and white bird named Tokitoki calls out to the Kai while siting on the perch in the middle of the pond. The bird is strangely resembles of a wise elderly man and is a best friend and pet of the Kai and a very important one for the Time Nest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know! But it has been 3 hours since he left and I haven't heard from him since!\" The Kai huffs and being impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tooooh! Kiiiii!\" The bird caws again, this time it made the Kai stops in her tracks and gotten angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I am being patience, but I'm worry about Trunks and the patrols...\" The Kai sighs before resume her pacing. Just as the Kai about to contact Trunks once more, she suddenly sense a small yet faint presence near the stairways of the Time Storage Vault. She hurries over to where the presence is, noticing a tiny light floating near the stone walkway that is barely the size of a tiny incest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh..? What is that?\" The Kai got on her knees to get a better look at the tiny light. At first she thought it was a time crack from the rift,  but this is way too small...As the Kai moves in for a closer look, the light begins to bright up and popping from the light are a group of tiny people, which are the NanoCorps, landed on the stones. Her eyes widen in shock, letting a gasp, watching the tiny group move around a bit before noticing the Kai and they too were quite stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good gravy!\" Petire shouted as he notice the Kai's large face looming over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...I guess the doc's device really works...\" Ralph mumbles to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters and the Kai stare at each other for a few minutes before the Kai calmly speaks to the group without scarring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there..Do not be frighten...I'm a friendly uhh...giant.\" She smiles a bit, showing she means no harm to them...though she actually quite glad there are beings that are shorter than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiiiii! Kiiiii!\" Tokitoki squawks once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Tokitoki....\" The Kai clutches her fist in anger before returning her attention to the hunters. \"Sorry about my friend Tokitoki, he's always like this...Are you people the new Time Patrol recruits  that Trunks mention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time Patrols? What the hell is-\" Viz was about to say something but was covered by Zeke's giant mechanical hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...Yes, we are the new Time Patrol recruits. Trunks told us to go ahead and meet you here without him, he...had other things to do.\" Zeke lied to the Kai which is very rare for Zeke to lie...and it seems working for them as she believe his words. \"We decided to wrap over here but it looks like...it miscalculated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a very <i>small</i> way, he he\" The Kai giggles at her joke though the hunters didn't laugh at her joke except Sharper who gets it. Clearing her throat, the Kai stands up to full height with her hands on her hips, towering over the tiny 'Time Patrols', craning their necks to see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"...Gosh she's cute...How old is she?\"</font>Danny whisperers to the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Oh Danny...she look like a kid to me...Beta?\"</font> Quentin asked the robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"She's 75,000,000 years old.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"...Beg your pardon?\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"The Supreme Kai of Time is 75,000,000 years old and before you asked, my calculation hasn't prove wrong.\" </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"This is true...so she must be that old...You don't think she's our target, guys?\"</font> Alanna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Not sure. Micro hasn't call us yet...But right now, play along.\" </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys talking about?\" The Kai's booming voice starle the hunters. She was quite curious of their conversation, hoping they are talking about how huge she is right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing, ma'am! Just talking about how awesome this now job gonna be and you look mighty fabulous I may add.\" Danny said in his flirty self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, how sweet!\" The Kai smiles before she lowers hand towards them, offering a lift. One by one, the hunters hop aboard her hand...expect for a certain hunter who sneaks away and latched on the Kai's white boot, snuggling against the material before his leader spotted him and orders Atomic to grab him with one of his tentacles from his arm, latching him away from her boot and back with the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Danny cried before Alanna slaps him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creep! The next time you do that again, I'm gonna busted open your head!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye aye, ma'am...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the perverted hunter, The Kai simply giggles at their actions before carrying them to the Time Storage Vault for a few warm up mission she had in mind...something that is suitable for the tiny 'Time Patrols' and perhaps try to figure a way to get them back to regular size...</span></div></div>",

As the hunters continues investigating the area, the device begins to making a beeping sounds and a familiar figure pops out from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Ahh I see my sub- uhh favorite hunters had made it through!

Without warning, the door from their right side burst open, nearly scaring the hunters and Dr. Micro except for Zeke who somehow able to remain his calm self and Slick who is...Well, near tired. The hunters watches a woman comes in, she appears to be quite cute with curvaceous and developed figure with well-endowed breasts and plum colored hair that kept in a ponytail.She wears black fingerless gloves, black tank-top that is cut off revealing her abdomen and bellybutton, daisy dukes and combat boots.

Where did that whacky doctor send us this time?\u201d groaned Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me. More hiding spots,\u201d said Viz, reaching for his sniper rifle on his back. Only\u2026 his fingers touched the wooden shaft of a spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh what the hell!\u201d Ralph whined, reaching for his own weapon, only to find out he's equipped with a dagger in each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin looked around at his motley crew, noticing each member equipped with a bladed weapon and medieval-style armor instead of their customized guns and exo-suits. Only Atomic was unaffected, which meant little for him since he didn't need weapons or armor anyway. Looking around, he also noticed a green bar at the edge of his vision, right underneath his name. Viz noted it looked the view through his target acquisition goggles, except his head was bare. Quentin could also see green bars next to his comrades, along with a green icon floating above their head. Except for Atomic, who had a black icon floating above his monstrous visage. Well, it will make keeping track of his fellow hunters a bit easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was getting used to this new perspective of the world, a flashing envelope icon floating into view. Quentin tapped it, and Van Micro's shadowy visage emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh heh\u2026 welcome to Sword Art Online, my lapdogs!\u201d the mad scientist said through the video channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell, Doc!\u201d Danny yelled at the video window. \u201cWhere's our stuff? How are we supposed to hunt anything with these kitchen knives!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, your equipment is being looked after\u2026 you can reclaim it if you get back alive! Hahahaha!\u201d the doctor cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough. Where did you send us? What's this Sword Art Online?\u201d Quentin interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a popular online game, except you connect using your own cranium instead of a computer. But pay close attention to the name: guns aren't allowed in SWORD Art Online, obviously. You'll have to make due with those bladed weapons that I payed a lot of ingame currency for. Do you have any idea how long it took me to grind to get you that sword in your hands, Danny? So many skeletons-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up. What's the target?\u201d Atomic roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right. The reason you're here. Of course. Well, if you die in this game, you die in real life. Scary, right? I put a regen skill on your equipment so you guys won't have to worry about it. But the daughter of a very important person is also trapped in this game, and some very powerful people want her taken out. So, all you have to do is defeat her here, and she'll never wake up over there! Of course, I'm getting paid handsomely-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don't care. Where do we find her?\u201d Petire demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would help, wouldn't it?\u201d the quack doctor said, rubbing his chin. The hunters heard him hit a few keystrokes and a player's profile popped into each hunter's view. A young girl's smiling face, framed by long brown hair. She was decked out in white and red armor, and a rapier hung sheathed at her hip. She was at a high level, with a lot of deadly skills. Quentin noticed her character name: Asuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What a cutie!\u201d Sharper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u2026 too skinny for me,\u201d Viz moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of size\u2026 aren't we a bit small, or are those blades of grass just huge?\u201d Zeke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! In order to transfer you guys into the game, I had to compress you really small! I wrote the algorithm myself, it's quite-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are insane! How are we supposed to hunt anything when we're only a few inches tall?!\u201d Viz screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse your skills! Welp, I should disconnect before the game notices this outside connection. Toodeloo!\u201d the insane scientist said, as the window closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin turned to his robotic ally, Beta. The android's hacking capabilities could come in handy in an online game like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeta, can you find this target?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSearching now, Master Quentin\u2026 Target acquired. She's currently on this level, staying at an inn in a town close by,\u201d the robot reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Slick, just teleport us there! Er\u2026 Slick?\u201d Ralph said, poking at the snoozing telepath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo can do\u2026 it'll be a while before his skills recharge enough for him to teleport us anywhere,\u201d Quentin concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke examined his spear. \u201cTaking down even the weakest monster will be a challenge at this size. Beta, can you perhaps hack the game to remove the target from the player list, so it will look as if she was killed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is possible, but only if the target was rendered unconscious first. The game's security layer is simply too secure otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin slammed his fist down into his open palm. \u201cThat's the plan, then. We ambush the target and render her unconscious, then we remove her character from the game's roster. Then we'll get the hell out of here,\u201d the young leader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me. What's the plan?\u201d Petire inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d </span></div></div>",

We have more than enough space to play with out here in this field,\u201d Quentin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 if we don't get eaten by a monster first,\u201d Viz whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeta, send a message to the target. Make it say that you're being attacked by a huge monster and you need help. Also, make it look like it was sent by some weakling player,\u201d Quentin told his robotic comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSending now,\u201d Beta said, his hands quickly tapping out a message in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way\u2026 you aren't planning on getting into a fight with a monster at our size, do you?\u201d Sharper gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen your eyes, kid. We got a monster right here,\u201d Zeke said, slapping Atomic on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I got feelings to, ya know!\u201d Atomic laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it. Execute plan Delta! Everyone, get ready!\u201d the young Drangua ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom their perch atop the highest tree branch, the three recon stooges were the first ones to see the target approaching. The young girl certainly didn't waste any time getting here. The target's long brown hair streamed behind her as she ran to the coordinates sent in the message. Sunlight glinted off her armor as she ran through the field at full steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must be quite the do-gooder to come running out here so quickly,\u201d observed Ralph. \u201cHow revolting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's even cuter in person! What a goddess!\u201d Sharper drooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetire knocked both of their heads together. \u201cStay quiet, and wait for the signal!\u201d the bald-headed hunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Ralph said, Asuna wasted no time coming to the rescue. She remembered how scared she was when she was a weak player, always afraid of death lurking right around the corner. She didn't think twice, quickly donning her armor and running to where the player said he was cornered by a monster. However, as she got closer, she couldn't believe her eyes. It looked like an action figure was fighting against a monster the size of a small dog. Still, the monster had a black icon hovering over its bulk, telling her this was a seriously strong monster. Even at her high level, there was still dangerous beasts roaming about. The player fighting the monster was fending off its attacks, but looked like he was giving a bit of ground with each parry. But why was he so tiny? Was this a glitch in the system, or a new status effect? Also, he looked strange. Maybe a custom avatar? Whatever, she could ask him once she defeated the beast. The monster was terrifyingly muscular and demonic. Asuna would have to be on her toes to defeat this creature. She equipped her rapier and prepared to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch it, Atomic! This is supposed to be a fake battle!\u201d Quentin yelled, just barely avoiding another one of his invincible comrade's swipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna make it look realistic! Better keep up!\u201d Atomic roared with a laugh. They both turned as they heard thundering footsteps approach. Their target came into view, sword in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there! Don't worry, I'll defeat this monster in a jiffy!\u201d Asuna said, getting into an attack stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! She has the voice of an angel!\u201d Sharper drooled. \u201cDo we really have to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust follow orders, dammit!\u201d Petire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLinear!\u201d Asuna shouted, as her body began to glow. Before anyone could blink, she lunged forward at an incredible speed, rapier pointed directly at Atomic. For anyone else, they would be impaled before they could even draw another breath. But Atomic's reflexes were unparalleled. From his view, the sword looked like the pointy end of a skyscraper was headed directly at him. His world exploded in pain as the sword entered his body, but just as quickly, his arms wrapped around the blade of the rapier. He planted his feet, and kept the rapier stuck inside his body. He watched his own HP display dip briefly, before his invincibility kicked in and his HP filled back up. Using his incredible strength, he wrenched the sword away from the giantess's grip. Shocked, the Lightning Flash began to stumble. She had never seen a monster parry an attack so with such speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Finish this quickly, because this hurts like hell!\u201d Atomic roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d Quentin ordered. Asuna was so confused over being disarmed that she didn't even notice the three tiny recon stooges drop from the tree above her. Brandishing their weapons, the three hunters jumped into Asuna's thick curtain of hair and plunge their swords and knives right between the target's shoulder blades. Their weight caused them to drag their weapons right down the giantess's back, and they landed on the ground right between her armored feet. Sharper began to looked up Asuna's skirt before Petire dragged him away, before they could be stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna doubled over in pain. The attack didn't do much damage, but she was now fighting multiple unknown enemies without a weapon. Quentin noticed the icons over the hunters' heads now turned orange. Asuna noticed this change as well, and wondered why their was tiny player-killers running around. Is this a new trick by Laughing Coffin? Whatever she case, she had to defeat these Pkers and warn other players. Tiny infiltrators would be a menace, for any guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened her inventory menu to equip a backup sword, she failed to notice three more tiny hunters rush from the grass towards her feet. Before she could finish the equipment change, Zeke, Viz and Danny sliced into the giantess's ankle, causing another glowing red wound on her avatar. Asuna saw a dreaded icon appear under her HP display: a boot with a red line through it. Limited mobility means certain death, especially since she's alone. Her knees buckled under her  as she toppled forward, but she caught her fall with her hands. She looked up to see the tiny Quentin with a smirk on his face, readying his broadsword for a final attack. </span></div></div>",

Well then... Back to business.\" Quentin walks over to the downed Asuna, still couldn't believe she was taken down by a group of tiny PKers and a monster who works for them!  With the limited mobility still in place and weaponless, it looks like it may be the end for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing personal, Miss Asuna. We are just following orders...By being guinea pigs.\" Quentin sighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... Who are you?! Are you with Laughing Coffin!?\" Asuna yelled at the tiny hunters, demanding to know who are they. To the hunters her voice was quite earth rattling to some hunters, but Sharper doesn't mind... He just in love with the beautiful Asuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laughing Coffin...?\" Ralph said. He and the others look at Beta for some info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I do not have any data on this Laughing Coffin. I shall recover it once we dealt with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Quentin turns to Asuna with his broadsword ready. \"Actually...We are the NanoCorps: famous group of bounty hunters known for 100% success of completing the missions and I, Quentin Andross, is the one who lead the mischief group. We were just hired by a...'friendly' scientist who want us to hunt down targets...namely females...So, no hard feelings, we are just doing our job.\" Quentin open his skills menu, viewing which one has the 'knockout' status...He then notice a very familiar skill that he uses before he enter this portal: Dreaded Dragon Claw<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it.\" The young Drangua active the skill, his sword along with his hand, covered in dragon scales. The tiny hunters jumps in the air, high above the Lightening Flash face and landed a serious blow against Asuna's forehead. \"Forgive me. You will reawaken a few hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters watches Asuna's avatar losing conscious before falling to the ground with a massive thud, Quentin landed besides his fellow hunters with a slight grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's that...Shall we begin Beta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master Quentin. However, we must move our target somewhere that no one will see her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...This is a MMO  trap game? No way we will find a unoccupied area.\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, monsters will be everywhere...What's the plan, Zeke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, we need to carry Asuna. That's your job, Atomic.\" The wise gunman orders Atomic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Atomic roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, we need to figure where should we go...someone get a map out.\" The hunters gather around with a map place, checking each region and terrains they could go... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The broadsword had just the right heft in Quentin\u2019s hands as he prepared to strike the finishing blow. With his quarry down on her hands and knees, it didn\u2019t feel much like a hunt. He remembered the heat from the Quantum Dragon\u2019s belly as he sliced the creature in two during his first bounty on the eighth moon around Regolith IV. His skin crawled as he recalled the slimy flesh of the Plutonium Squid deep in the Endless Ocean on Europa that had taken out a whole platoon of the galaxy\u2019s best bounty hunters before Quentin shoved a nuke through its maw. But this target, as huge as she was, was still a cute young girl. Under a dangling fringe of brown hair, her brown eyes still blazed with fire, calling to mind the old saying that a cornered animal is always the most dangerous. Oh well, he just wanted this job to be over with. His fellow hunters had done all the dirty work of disabling the target, and all that was left was for their fearless leader to knock her out. He flipped his blade over to its flat side, in order to deliver a powerful thwack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drangua\u2019s calf muscles bulged as he prepared to launch himself at Asuna. The ground cracked under his feet as he leapt skyward, toward\u2019s Asuna\u2019s heavenly face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRising Tiger Strike!\u201d he yelled, as Asuna\u2019s face loomed in the sky above him, coming ever closer like a falling planetary body. \u201cAsuna the Lightning Flash\u2026 hmph, what a joke,\u201d the Drangua laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so quick to me!\u201d he shouted up at his quarry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, the brown-haired swordswoman was about to live up to her nickname. Shifting her weight to her left side, she reached out with her right hand, intending to intercept the tiny Pker in midair. Of course, with his extremely high reflexes, Quentin saw the hand coming from a mile away, fingers outstretched like talons. He immediately went to activate his jet-boots, and\u2026 oh wait, those were left behind when he was sucked into this ridiculous game. Certainly Slick can teleport him away and\u2026 he\u2019s still snoozing. No matter. Quentin always had his handy dragon wings ready to pop out at a moment\u2019s notice. He disliked using them too often, as they always made a mess of his clothes, but this was a dangerous situation. He squeezed his back muscles, and before his wings could sprout out, a video message appeared before his eyes. Dr. Van Micro\u2019s shadowy visage appeared in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell do you want, Doc? I\u2019m a little busy right now!\u201d Quentin fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust to let you know, flying has not been implemented in this game! If you want to soar through the skies, you\u2019ll have to play this game\u2019s successor. In fact-\u201d the crazy scientist blathered before Quentin tapped the window closed in a rage. With no way to alter his trajectory, the hunter was helpless to evade as Asuna\u2019s hand grabbed him. He slammed into the skin of her palm hard enough to knock the wind out of him. Her slender fingers closed around him in a vice-like grip, crushing his lungs. His head and shoulders still poked out, however, and he quickly swung his sword around to sever the offending appendage. He still had the flat side of the sword facing her, however, and he silently cursed himself as the broadsword bounced off her wrist with a resounding thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna winced in pain, but quickly pivoted her weight onto her left hand and kicked out with her uninjured leg in a sweep, sending the hunters gathered around her feet flying into the weeds. Sharper just happened to be ducking to retie his shoe, and he got a heavenly glimpse of Asuna\u2019s panties in full view underneath her red skirt. Momentarily out of danger, the swordswoman collapsed down onto her butt, crushing Sharper underneath. The soft material of the giantess\u2019s panties did nothing to cushion the blow, and Sharper\u2019s HP quickly fell to 0 as her massive weight crushed him into the dirt. Because of the doc\u2019s machinations, he still remained in the game, but his HP couldn\u2019t recover while the giant girl\u2019s rear remained on top of him. But in all his travels, there was nowhere he would rather be more, then under the rear of the girl he just fell in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Quentin could strike another blow, Asuna\u2019s left hand hovered over his head and two slender fingers roughly pinched his wrists together, then plucked his sword from his grip and threw it away. Now disarmed as well, the Drangua looked in dismay at the icon of a sword with a slash through it right under his HP bar. Oh well. He wasn\u2019t the only member of this bounty hunter company. Quentin looked around from his elevated view, but could only see Atomic still impaled by Asuna\u2019s sword. That was a bit of a stalemate, as removing the sword from his body would allow Atomic full movement, but would give the swordswoman back her weapon, which might spell doom for the hunters, now that she\u2019s more familiar with their tactics. Certainly Zeke was planning their next move, hidden in the tall grass with the rest of his fellow hunters. Except Sharper, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little else to do, Quentin took stock of his captor. His heightened sense of smell was filled with the tangy bite of Asuna\u2019s sweat, but he could also detect faint traces of vanilla. He met her piercing brown eyes with his own gaze. Long caramel-colored hair cascaded down around her flawless face. Her clothes were impeccably tailored, and flattered her form. Like Viz, she was a bit too skinny for Quentin, but he was instead attracted to her fierce fighting spirit. Even backed into a corner by highly-skilled adversaries, she was still giving it everything she\u2019s got. As someone who has had his share of scrapes with death, the Drangua knew that look in her eyes: the look of someone who would never give up, no matter what. It\u2019s a shame she had to be his target. He would love to fight alongside her someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up!\u201d Asuna yelled, projecting her voice towards the hidden hunters. \u201cThrow down your weapons and surrender, or...\u201d she said, two fingers of her other hand reaching down and squeezing Quentin\u2019s head. \u201cOr I\u2019ll kill your leader!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the crushing cranial pressure, Quentin\u2019s ears still worked well enough to hear peals of mocking laughter coming from the grass. \u201cGo ahead, do it!\u201d Danny said. \u201cHe still hasn\u2019t given us our pay from the last two jobs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been meaning to! I just haven\u2019t gotten around to balancing the checkbook yet!\u201d Quentin choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe deserves it!\u201d mocked Ralph. \u201cHe always cooks the worst food, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he never wants to do the laundry!\u201d came another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he snores!\u201d said another, followed by roars of laughter from the hidden hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou useless...\u201d hissed Quentin. \u201cWhen this is over, you\u2019re all fired!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing pressure finally let up as Asuna stopped pinching Quentin\u2019s skull. \u201cBeing a leader is tough, huh?\u201d she said to him, knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me! They never want to wake up early, or do any recon on the target, or take out the trash!\u201d the hunter\u2019s leader complained. He could tell immediately that Asuna was one of those born leaders, that people would follow to the very pits of hell. Just like himself. But this is no time to be making friends with his target! Quentin might\u2019ve been new to this game, but he quickly figured out Asuna\u2019s strategy: by stalling for time until her HP recovered and her aliments went away, she would be able to escape. If she hid somewhere or summoned help, this job would quickly become impossible. Quentin had never lost a target yet, but he\u2019ll need his fellow hunters\u2019 help more than usual on this job\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, Zeke had something wild in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeta, can you hack into Asuna\u2019s inventory?\u201d the co-leader asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHacking now,\u201d Beta said, windows popping in and out of existence as he tried to hack into Asuna\u2019s profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking?\u201d Petire asked, coming up to the group. The rest of the hunters followed closely behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if we can add a poisonous item to the target\u2019s inventory, we might be able to make her sick. Or\u2026 a bomb would damage her...\u201d Zeke contemplated, rubbing his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDisplaying target\u2019s inventory\u2026 now,\u201d Beta announced. Asuna\u2019s armor and clothing were displayed in a window, along with her items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what does that button do?\u201d Danny said, tapping at a random button at the bottom of the window. The button glowed, and all of Asuna\u2019s equipment was now added to her inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 de-equips everything on the target,\u201d Beta explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u2026 snap,\u201d Danny said, as Zeke glared daggers at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut still\u2026 it\u2019s nice to have friends, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Asuna said, starting to bond with the tiny Drangua in her hand. He wasn\u2019t the usual Pker scum. She felt a bit of a bond with him, as a fellow warrior. However, she noticed that her HP had recovered enough to remove her movement disability. Finally, she could make tracks. Before she could move, however, her armor and clothes began to glow with a blue light\u2026 before disappearing entirely. The giantess was now as naked as the day she was born. Gasping in embarrassment and rage, she balled her hands into fists. Unfortunately for one Drangua, however, he currently occupied one fist, and his eyeballs nearly popped out of his skull, both from the pressure and the incredible view in front of him. Asuna\u2019s porcelain skin glistened in the sunlight, her hair covering her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastards! What did you do?! You\u2019re gonna pay for this!\u201d Asuna roared, standing up. The pressure on him now released, Sharper rolled onto his back, only to be greeted with the greatest sight of his life: the backside of the girl he fell in love with, now completely bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna was overcome with rage. First they attack her like cowards, now they figured out a way to remove all her clothes. People or not, she wouldn\u2019t stop until they were all dead. First one up, however, is their leader, still helpless in her hand. Brushing aside any thoughts of camaraderie she once had with the young Drangua, she opened her lips and raised Quentin to her mouth. The target\u2019s once-angelic face was now creased with anger, as she brought him closer to her lips. How convenient, his head was the perfect size to fit between her teeth like a piece of candy. Quentin saw a strand of saliva break into droplets between the giantess\u2019s pink lips as her hot breath washed over him. He could see her muscular tongue ready to strike like the Beast Anaconda from The Jungle Planet, the wettest, slimiest creature Quentin had ever faced. Until now, that is.  The back of Asuna\u2019s throat led to a deep abyss, but there would be no climbing out of that crevasse. Quentin\u2019s head was placed on a glistening white tooth, as the giantess placed him into her mouth like a large lollipop. Except this lollipop had an extra-juicy center. The cavernous maw quickly darkened as Asuna\u2019s lips closed. Her top row of teeth slammed down on Quentin\u2019s neck, severing it. He watched his HP bar plunge to 0, but his vision never went completely dark. Looks like the crazy doc\u2019s modifications made him unable to die even if decapitated. Still, it looks like he\u2019ll be out of this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stream of digital blood dribbled down Asuna\u2019s chin as she pulled Quentin\u2019s headless torso out of her mouth with a grin. She tossed the body into the grass before wiping her chin with the back of her hand. \u201cLooks like your boss lost his head...\u201d she cackled. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. Soon you\u2019ll join him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTarget approaching,\u201d Beta said, as the giant naked girl stomped toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo shit!\u201d Petire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 my bad?\u201d Danny offered, before Zeke punched him hard enough to pound him into the dirt. Asuna\u2019s fist crashed into the group, sending Danny even further into the ground and sending the rest of the hunters flying through the air like shrapnel. They could barely stand up before the giantess sundered them again with her bare hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2026 won\u2019t\u2026. you\u2026 die!\u201d she said through her teeth, unaware of the tiny hunter\u2019s invulnerability. Still, she continued to stomp and punch them mercilessly. Despite their HP reaching 0 multiple times, each hunter continued to stand up, only to be thrown into the air again. \u201cMaybe being unable to die isn\u2019t so great,\u201d Viz grumbled, as Asuna squashed him flat under her sole for the umpteenth time. By now, bits of digital blood trickled down from between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwoken by all the commotion, Slick let out a mighty yawn. The telepath was utterly unfazed by the sight of a giant naked girl stomping his comrades into oblivion. It was only when Danny flew through the air and landed next to him that he decided to act. Figuring the rampaging giantess was their current target, Slick levitated a large rock and tossed it into Asuna\u2019s head. The swordswoman\u2019s eyes rolled backward and she fell onto her back, out cold. Satisfied, Slick fell back asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was just recovering from being crushed in Asuna\u2019s fist before her shadow fell over him. Expecting to see the dirty sole of her foot, he was inside surprised to see her toppling over like a fallen tree. He just managed to roll away as she collapsed onto the ground, throwing up clouds of dust. Brushing off his hat, he was delighted to see that Asuna\u2019s eyes were tightly closed. They can feel safe, for a little while. Sharper had already climbed onto the giantess\u2019s body, and was currently spread eagle on her flat stomach, rising and falling with every breath. His eyes had hearts in them as he rubbed his cheek against Asuna\u2019s milky-white skin. Atomic finally pulled the sword out of his body, and threw it aside with a clang. \u201cI\u2019ll be feeling that one tomorrow,\u201d he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s over with,\u201d Viz said, making sure his arms were still attached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed. But we\u2019ve got one more problem to take care of,\u201d Zeke said, gesturing towards Quentin\u2019s headless body. \u201cSomeone has to retrieve the boss\u2019s melon from that girl before we can get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who will get that thankless job?\u201d Petire asked, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re up, Recon Squad,\u201d ordered the co-leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways the best jobs,\u201d Petire mumbled, grabbing Ralph and walking towards the fallen giantess\u2019s head. They grabbed fistfuls of her soft brown hair, and began climbing up her scalp. When they arrived at her forehead, they paused to admire the view. Asuna\u2019s nose rose gently upward before them, and her closed eyes were ringed by long eyelashes. The small hills of her breasts sloped downward into the plain of her stomach, and her long legs seemed to stretch to the horizon. They could see Sharper having the time of his life, rolling around like a child on Asuna\u2019s tummy. As they approached the target\u2019s lips, they were buffeted by a warm wind blowing from the giantess\u2019s nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, this is messing up by hair,\u201d complained Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetire rubbed his own smooth noggin. \u201cNot my problem.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The two recon goons began shrinking, until they were the size of one of Asuna\u2019s ivory teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s too small! We\u2019ll never be able to climb out now!\u201d Ralph moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry!\u201d Atomic roared, grabbing Asuna\u2019s head and moving it to a more vertical position. \u201cYou can just walk inside now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, thanks,\u201d Petire said, climbing over the bottom lip and onto the tongue. The walls and floor were covered in shiny saliva, and the sharp teeth formed a sharp ring all around the tinier hunters. Asuna\u2019s tongue squished under their feet as they looked around for Quentin\u2019s noggin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she ate \u2018im,\u201d Ralph said, his voice echoing off the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not. Keep looking,\u201d answered Petire, climbing over Asuna\u2019s molars and descending into the space between her gums and cheek. The humidity was overwhelming, and a drop of saliva splashed onto Petire\u2019s smooth head. He was just about to try lifting up the giantess\u2019s tongue and checking underneath when he kicked something in the darkness. Something round. Petire dislodged it from between Asuna\u2019s back molars and her cheek, and the scaly texture told him it was Quentin\u2019s separated head. The Drangua rolled his eyes at being stuck in his dark cavern for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found the boss\u2019s melon. Hey, what are you playing with?\u201d Petire inquired, noticing Ralph walking towards the back of Asuna\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this thing! It\u2019s like a punching bag!\u201d Ralph said, giving the dangling uvula a playful nudge. The fleshy ball bounced around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! Hey, bet I can hit it with the boss\u2019s head!\u201d Petire said, launching the head at the pink ball of flesh. The uvula slapped Quentin\u2019s noggin right back at the bald hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph jumped onto the swinging uvula. \u201cI feel just like Tarzan!\u201d he laughed, swinging back and forth. \u201cHey, toss me the boss\u2019s head! I wanna make a lay-up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a rumbling vibration came from deep within Asuna\u2026. </span></div></div>",

The organic chamber of the giantess\u2019s mouth began to shake with a fierce intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, playtime\u2019s over!\u201d Petire shouted, not wanting to become this girl\u2019s next meal. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could get very far, however, the bald hunter\u2019s ankle twisted and he fell awkwardly into the moist tongue. The spongy flesh yielded under his muscular form, and rows of small bumps tickled his chin. Petire shuddered as he realized that the giant girl was unconsciously tasting him. Ralph gripped the uvula\u2019s cord for dear life, but a fierce wind erupted from the throat and tossed him like a rag doll. The explosive cough knocked him into Petire, and the two hunters rolled across the tongue towards the light streaming in from the front of the mouth. A fortunate buck of the tongue prevented the hunters from being dashed to ribbons on the girl\u2019s monolithic teeth, and the two goofballs were launched out of the mouth. To the hunters, it felt like being blasted out of a cannon, but to Asuna it was just a simple reflexive action to an annoying tickle in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetire and Ralph finally roll to a stop near Asuna\u2019s navel. \u201cOh, hey guys,\u201d Sharper greeted them. \u201cHmm, were you two always so short?\u201d he asked, as the two hunters slowly got to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Petire said, wiping the slimy saliva off his bald noggin. He looked past the twin hills of Asuna\u2019s breasts to see her eyes still closed, and her head gently settling back down.  Good, she didn\u2019t wake up. An explosion of giggling laughter drew his attention. Ralph had fallen into the giantess\u2019s navel and was currently bouncing off the walls like a child in a ball pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys have gotta try this!\u201d Ralph laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bouncy castle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d Sharper mused, before jumping in the belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of there!\u201d Petire yelled down at them. \u201cWe got what we came for, so let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeta, can you hack into the player database now?\u201d Zeke asked, hoping the fearsome giantess will stay asleep long enough to pull this off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHacking now\u2026 1%\u2026 2%...\u201d the robot counted up, as hacking windows flickered into and out of existence. Danny had gathered Quentin\u2019s headless body and Petire screwed the drangua\u2019s melon back onto his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like screwing on a light bulb. Hey boss, you home?\u201d Danny asked, snapping his fingers in front of the young leader\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop that, or I\u2019ll bite them off,\u201d the irritated drangua snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, back to normal,\u201d Viz observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what was it like in there?\u201d Atomic asked, placing Asuna\u2019s head gently back onto the ground. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten lots of things, but I\u2019ve never been eaten myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWet and way too warm, like a sauna on full blast. Anyway, what\u2019s our status?\u201d Quentin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHacking into the target\u2019s profile,\u201d Beta reported. \u201cDeleting profile\u2026 now. Target has been removed from the game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Quentin said, before a chat window appeared before him. Van Micro\u2019s insane face popped into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMission accomplished! I\u2019ve just received word that the target has disappeared from the roster. Really, I didn\u2019t think you could kill her, but then again, you guys haven\u2019t failed a mission yet!\u201d the mad scientist cackled. \u201cMy associates are in place outside the hospital to confirm her death. I\u2019ve placed a teleport stone in your inventories, so you can come back whenever you\u2019re ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin clicked the message window closed. \u201cHey, won\u2019t he be pissed when he figures out we didn\u2019t actually kill her?\u201d Petire said, jerking a thumb over towards the giantess, who continued to snooze peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll collect our payment and hightail it before that happens,\u201d Quentin said. \u201cBy the way, Beta, what will happen to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe target has been converted to an item, so she cannot be further harmed. She will wake up in the real world when the game is over, along with the surviving players,\u201d the robot said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we\u2019re not going to leave her out here like this, right?\u201d Sharper said. \u201cShe could still be kidnapped, or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point. Beta, did you happen to copy down the target\u2019s friend list?\u201d Quentin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAffirmative, Master Quentin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen send a message asking for help to one of those people. I don\u2019t care which one. Tell them to come quick, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSending now, Master Quentin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny hunters hid in the tall grass as another set of giant footprints approached the clearing. They looked up to see a pink-haired girl tromp towards them. A splash of freckles adorned her friendly face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, this must\u2019ve been one tough monster if you need me to repair your armor again,\u201d Lisbeth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you\u2019re lucky I was in town and had nothing else to do-- what the heck?!\u201d she gasped, as she came across Asuna\u2019s naked, sleeping form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you, an exhibitionist? Good think Kirito didn\u2019t see you like this, he\u2019d die from a fatal nosebleed!\u201d the blacksmith said, trying to shake her friend awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you\u2019re really out cold. I better get you out of here before someone nasty finds you,\u201d Lisbeth said, dropping a cloak from her inventory and draping it over Asuna\u2019s slender body. The pink-haired girl then placed a hand on her friend\u2019s shoulder before using a teleport stone to whisk them both away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin breathed a sigh of relief. Asuna might have been his target, but he still felt glad that she was in good hands. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d the leader said, selecting the teleport stone from his inventory. He was bathed in blue light, and found himself back in the field from which they had entered the portal originally. His fellow hunters rematerialized next to him. Their equipment was in a pile at the base of a tree, along with their high-tech armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur stuff! Oh, how I\u2019ve missed thee!\u201d Danny said, kissing his favorite pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, this isn\u2019t right,\u201d Ralph said, holding up an oversized exo-suit. \u201cThis is way too big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the suit, buddy,\u201d Viz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just tiny!\u201d Zeke laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you\u2026 oh shit!\u201d Petire said, realizing that Beta had never returned Ralph and himself to \u201cnormal\u201d size after their expedition into Asuna\u2019s mouth. Both hunters were now head-and-shoulders shorter than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure Dr. Van Micro can fix you\u2026 for a price!\u201d Danny laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood work, guys. To the next adventure!\u201d Quentin said, walking towards the setting sun. </span></div></div>",

A large tree beside them is quite gigantic compare to the hunters, Sharper notice a single leaf near them is huge as well...meaning the shrunken part of the device actually works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That blasted doc's device does work! Even the shrunken part...\" Petire groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the only worst part. Look at our weapons.\" Ralph pointed at Zeke's weapon which is usually his favorite sniper rifle on his back...Now it's only a large bladed sword. They also notice they are wearing a medieval style armors instead of exo-suits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Zeke picks up his new weapon in surprise. \"...Where's 'Ol Bestie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh...I think the doc replaces our guns and suits with swords and such. Also, notice something above our heads?\" Quentin pointed a green bar with his name just above him. It seems every hunters has the same green bar except for Atomic as his bar is actually a black icon with monster like image. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...It looks like we are in a video game, I recognize Atomic's icon...I believe he's a monster in this game, typical.\" Danny said while chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I have feelings ya know,\" Atomic laughs <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hunters getting used to their new location, a flashing envelope icon floating into their view. Quentin slowly tapped it, and the crazy laughing scientist image emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Mwhahahaha! I hope you like your new looks, my hunters! Welcome to Sword Art Online!\"</span> Dr. Micro laughs through the video channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it, doc! Where's our stuff!?\" Danny shouted at the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh yes, there are with me safe and sound, you'll get them back once you are done with the mission...If you survive that is...\"</span> The doctor laughs once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...By the way, what is Sword Art Online?\" Quentin asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"It's a popular online game, except you connect using your own cranium instead of a computer and of course, guns are banned in this game hence the word 'SWORD' Art Online, meaning no guns for you! However, I manage your equipment and given you...Legendary, all enhanced weapons and armor. Sure they do look normal but I had to take extra measures...  Atomic, however, is a different story. I had to make him a....'Legendary' monster since he's not human....You know how hard it is to get this equipment ready, I mean, I pour my soul into-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, just tell us who's our target.\" the sloth said while yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh right...\" </span>The doctor types in the target's name and sends a player's profile to the hunters' view. The target is a beautiful elf like woman with glossy, dark green hair so dark that it is nearly black hanging down her back. Wearing a Japanese-style clothing and a katana that hangs from her obi and her feet clad in high crimson clogs. She is high level and acquire lots of dangerous skills and techniques. Quentin sees the player's name: Sakuya or Lady Sakyua <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello, hot and good looking!\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busty too...I'm liking her.\" Sharper said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmm...It says here she's quite a formidable opponent in the Sylph dueling tournaments. Though I'm not a complainer type, but how do we take her down while we are a size of an ant?\" said the new member Ryx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Use your skills, hunters! I mean you are the great and invincible hunters, yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"There you go! Now onward, my hunters! And make sure I see the head of the pretty Sylph...Oh yes! There's one more thing I must tell you. Now this is really a life and death game...Meaning, if you die in this game, you died in real life.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?!\" The hunters shouted in shocked.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><br>\r\n\"H-However! I did a little illegal intrusion...I added all you hunters a passive skill know as 'Immortal'. It'll regain your health when the bar reaches zero. That'll make sure you won't die in the game...And with that over with, I'm out! Good luck hunters!\"</span> The doctor laughs before closing the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin turns to Beta  since he's a robot with amazing hacking abilities which could be useful in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Can you override the game's security and tried to remove her name from the player as if we killed? We don't really want to kill her in real life...She might be a young little girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, It shouldn't be too much difficult, Master Quentin. Also, I located our target...She is in a nearby town not too far from here. It seems she is held up in a meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Then we should teleport in town and...\" Quentin notice Slick is sleeping on the job once again. \"...Never mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could head over there or lure her into the field...Either one should do quite nicely.\" said Zeke. \"Although...Atomic's a monster so he's not getting inside the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That sucks...\" Atomic grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how should we proceed?\" Another new member, Dr. Coon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin thinks about the plans about a minute or so until he figure it out, he decided to go with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We don't wanna cause panic in this game, so this plan is the better choice, plus I already got a plan that you may like, Atomic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I'm all ears. Let's hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Gather round, hunters. Here's the plan: We will send a help message to Sakuya, acting as a low level player being attack by a very powerful monster a.k.a Atomic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...Who's the low level player?\" Petire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be...Ryx. You'll be the bait.\" Quentin looks at the blind swordsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright. I'll sheathe my sword in order not to burn up Atomic...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGihaha! I still remember that burns...But yeah, keep it intact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of us will hid among the grass and tree above us. Once our target comes and begins attacking Atomic, Ryx will unsheathe his sword and try to cut her knees, so she'll lose mobility. Once she's down, we will strike her with everything we got...Though this is gonna be different since guns aren't allow, we gonna have to do this up close and personal...Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one: What if she will call reinforcement?\" said Dr. Coon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depending how many it is. If it's more than two...We retreat until we come up with another plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do need Slick in order to retreat...So, keep him awake.\" said Zeke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said than done, Zeke. That fool won't wake up during a massive earthquake or a loud explosion. We're gonna need a medicine treament...Right, Coon?\" Danny looks at the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmm...I'll think of something while we wait. I didn't bring much ingredients but I'll see what I can make of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beta, send a message to the target. Make sure it sound like a weak player.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sending the message...\" Beta quickly tapping out a message in the air and sends it to Sakuya. \"Message sent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Get in places, guys. This could be a worthwhile...\" Quentin ordered his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the jungle of a grass, the three recon, Dr. Coon and Danny ready themselves and waiting for their target to arrive...except for the sleeping Slick who resting near them. On top of the nearby tree branch, Quentin, Zeke, and Viz spotted someone heading this way...It was their target: Lady Sakuya. Her really long and beautiful hair flows through as she headed to the coordinates sent in the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Target sighted. I repeat, target sighted...Get ready on my command.\" Quentin informs the hunters among the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...She's pretty brave to come here by herself...\" Viz smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a high level after all. Keep focus...\" said Zeke <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyx and Atomic, meanwhile, pretends to fight each other in order to lure their target. Ryx keeps blocking Atmoic's large fist, dodging one of them that was a bit too close to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Atomic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gihaha! Better keep it up, pal!\" Atomic laughs while throwing another punch at Ryx. While continue fake fighting, they both  heard thundering footsteps approach. Their target came into view, sword in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya was ready to help a player to defeat the monster but was hesitate at the moment as she saw the player and the monster. While the monster is bigger than the player, both of them are really small...Still the monster has the black icon over his head, telling her its really a dangerous monster and since she is a high level, Sakuya can bring the monster down no problem...and perhaps asking the tiny player how did he get so small...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, I got this! Just stand back!\" Sakuya said, ready to strike down the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyx silently nodded and quickly gets near her sandal clad foot while Atomic gets ready to fight the giant Sylph. Before Atomic get ready to attack her, Sakuya begins casting a spell and a large fireball appears out of nowhere, heading towards the bulking hunter. Atomic skids to a stop before jumping out of the fireball's way, hitting the ground leaving the burn mark. Atomic regains his footing but not before he felt a strong pierce into his skin, causing him to grunt in pain. Sakuya smiles as she successfully hits her target, however, her eyes widen in shock when Atomic grabs her katana and pulls it away from with such amazing strength, causing the Lord of Sylph to stumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Ryx!\" Atomic shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya heard the monster talking to someone until she felt a cut on her knee, the Sylph grunts a little while kneeling. She was able to spot her attacker....It was the same player that was fighting the monster, this time he was attacking her...She soon realize this was a set up for the PKers. Sakuya quickly gets up and tries to escape but was unaware of the other hidden hunters who were about to strike her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go go go!\" Quentin orders them while he, Zeke, and Viz jumps off the branch with weapons in hand. the three hunters jumped into Sakuya's thick curtain of hair, blaze through the green jungle and plunge their weapons right in her neck. Sakuya wenches in pain and fends off her attackers by swatting them. The three recon from the grass emerges from the grass and launches their attack by going under her kimono, striking her tabi cover foot and upward to her leg. Sharper gets a quick glace of her panties before Petire slaps him, resuming their attack. Danny and Dr.Coon uses their flight skills to scale up the giant Sakuya while she was busy fending off the other hunter's attacks. Danny decided to attack her near her chest, which is quite predictable for a womanizer while Coon attack her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya felt many attacks on her body, but it didn't do much damage to her. She is now fighting mutiple PKers and there's no in sight to aid her. She quickly open her inventory to equip a backup sword, but before she could do it, the recon stooges and Ryx cut her knees again and a icon appears on under her hp bar which is not a very good sign to her: a boot with a red line. Sakuya tumbles backward landing on her but, it looks like it may be the end for the Lord of Sylphy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their target on the ground, the hunters regroup on the revealing bosom of Sakuya while Atomic stay by the ground, still holding her katana. Sakuya watches one of the PKer walks to the middle of her chest with his sword in hand, ready to finish off the Slyphy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about this, nothing personal. Just doing the NanaoCorps mission...\" Quentin said, ready to knock her out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A cold blue light engulfs the hunters as they step through the portal. The organic members feel their stomach drop out from under them as they fly through dimensions unknown on their way to their final destination. Suddenly, the floor rushes up to meet them as they are deposited onto a smooth wooden floor. Two massive beds rose up on either side of them, giving them the feel of being trapped in a canyon between two mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeta, you idiot! You said the device was working fine! Now we\u2019re shrunk to only a couple of inches tall!\u201d Danny yelled at the robot, giving the non-organic hunter a swift kick only for his foot to bounce off with a clang. \u201cThe device was indeed working properly,\u201d the robotic brain reported, as Danny hopped around on one foot in pain. \u201cDr. Micro did explain that we would be reduced in size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Danny, clean out your ears,\u201d huffed Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, maybe we should stop taking jobs from Dr. Micro,\u201d Ralph whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a goofy song started ringing out. Zeke facepalmed as he recognized Quentin\u2019s bizarre ringtone, which was a silly jingle totally unsuited for a feared bounty hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d the Drangua said, pulling out his cellphone and checking the display. \u201cIt\u2019s Dr. Micro. I\u2019ll put it on speaker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBwahahahaha!\u201d came Dr. Micro\u2019s insane laugh. It sounded just as crazy coming from multiple dimensions away as it did when he was standing right next to you. \u201cWelcome to Academy City! A place where science rules and magicians drool, my kind of place if you ask me-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan it,\u201d Zeke interrupted. \u201cWho\u2019s the target?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFull of haste, aren\u2019t you? One wrong move in this world, and you might end up as a brain in a jar somewhere. Anyway, the target is the legendary Level 5 esper, the Ace of Tokiwadai, Mikoto Misaka! Despite her youth, she\u2019s the number three ranked esper in-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Petire yelled. \u201cWhat kind of powers does she have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry not to be shocked by this next revelation,\u201d the mad scientist punned, \u201cbut she\u2019s an electromaster! She can control a billion volts of electricity at a time, as well as utilize magnetism to erase credit cards, among other things, oh yeah and get free drinks from vending machines-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Quentin said. \u201cNone of that information helps us unless we know what she looks like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, yeah, that would help, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d the insane doctor mused. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dangerous people in Academy City, and messing with the wrong one could land you guys in a world of hurt, or on another world entirely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hunters could hear Dr. Micro tapping away at a keyboard before a picture popped up on Quentin\u2019s phone. The hunters crowded around to get a better look. Except for Slick, of course, who was still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe target looked\u2026 underwhelming, for a group used to staring down cybernetic dragons and demonic overlords, anyway. A young teenage girl was centered in the photo. She was dressed in a brown vest over a white dress shirt, and wore brown shorts under a black skirt. Short brown hair matched her brown eyes, and she wore a bored expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all fine and dandy,\u201d Danny said sarcastically, \u201cbut why are we so small? We couldn\u2019t kill a flea at this size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, yes, your size is a detriment, for sure,\u201d Dr. Micro answered, \u201cbut Academy City has strict immigration protocols, and shrinking you down was the only way I could teleport you inside without tripping the sensors. But don\u2019t worry about killing anyone, you only need to get a sample of her blood. There are some very powerful people who want her genetic information-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on one sec, doc,\u201d Petire said. \u201cOf all places, why did you send us into someone\u2019s bedroom? There\u2019s hardly any hiding spots here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood observation! No wonder you\u2019re in charge of the recon stooges \u2013 er, I mean \u2018squad\u2019. Well, you see,\u201d the crazy man replied, \u201cyou\u2019re currently in the Tokiwadai Dormitory, a place where espers aren\u2019t allowed to use their powers! If your target can\u2019t use her electricity, then you guys should have no problem subduing her, even at your reduced size. You\u2019ll be meeting up with a guide that will help you take care of business. Oh yeah, men aren\u2019t allowed in the dorm either, so make sure you aren\u2019t caught by the Dorm Supervisor. That would certainly be a shocking ending, heh heh heh-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more puns!\u201d Quentin screamed in aggravation, throwing his cell phone across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Beta\u2019s proximity alarm sounded. \u201cElectromagnetic field detected,\u201d the robotic brain announced. The hunters readied their weapons and turned in unison toward the shadow that was moving under the closest bed. A young girl about their size ran toward the hunters, waving at them. She was the spitting image of the target, except she was carrying an assault rifle in her hands and was wearing a spiffy set of what looked like night-vision goggles on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on guys, I got this!\u201d Sharper yelled, eager to prove himself to his comrades. The young hunter rushed forward and tackled the girl to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Please get off of MISAKA, as MISAKA is not your target,\u2019 MISAKA implores you, as you are heavy,\u201d the girl said, robotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she talking about? Beta, do a genetic scan on that girl,\u201d Quentin orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger, Master Quentin. Scanning\u2026 complete. The young woman is a 100% genetic match to the target,\u201d the robotic brain reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe robot doesn\u2019t lie, sweetheart,\u201d said Zeke, walking forward with a syringe in hand. \u201cNow, this won\u2019t hurt, for me, anyway...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could draw some of her blood, Sharper yelped in pain as his body convulsed. Sparks leapt from his hair as he rolled off of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOww! She\u2019s gotta be the target, she just shocked me!\u201d the impulsive bounty hunter yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019You are the bounty hunters sent by Dr. Van Micro, correct?\u2019 asks MISAKA, stating the obvious,\u201d the girl said while rising to her feet. She still spoke in a strange, monotonous tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m their leader, Quentin,\u201d the Drangua said. \u201cBut if you aren\u2019t the target, then who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019MISAKA is a clone of Big Sister, whom you refer to as \u201cthe target.\u201d I am also serving as the guide that Dr. Micro hired to lead you to Big Sister,\u2019 MISAKA explains, expecting you to know this already,\u201d the girl who apparently refers to herself as MISAKA said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Van Micro for you,\u201d Petire sighed. \u201cAlways long on rambling and short on details.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Viz complained, rubbing his scar. \u201cCan\u2019t we just take a sample of this girl\u2019s blood and be done with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Because MISAKA is a clone of Big Sister, my own genetic material has already been compromised. A clone made from a clone will not be viable,\u2019 MISAKA says, explaining the obvious,\u201d the girl said, while inspecting the magazine of her assault rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis clone business is such a headache,\u201d Danny whined. \u201cRemember that one mission when Ralph got cloned by that mad scientist and the original got killed, so we had to make the clone believe that he was the real Ralph?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you guys said that was just a bad dream!\u201d Ralph said, suddenly nervous. \u201cRight??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin raised his hand, silencing the panicking recon stooge. Turning to MISAKA, he said, \u201cIt sounds like we\u2019ll need to work together for this mission. But tell me, why would you want to harm your sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019If MISAKA defeats Big Sister, then she will become the strongest esper in Academy City. Then that boy will pay attention to MISAKA instead of Big Sister,\u2019 MISAKA explains her motivation wistfully,\u201d the girl said with a nod.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSibling rivalries are messed up,\u201d Atomic roared. \u201cMakes me glad that I\u2019m one of a kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god for that,\u201d said Petire. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMISAKA answered his question by throwing a bunch of weird frog-shaped costumes at their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke doffed his trademark hat. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to wear that, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Big Sister loves Gekota. If we dress up as Gekota figures, Big Sister will be sure to pick us up. Then, we can strike,\u2019 MISAKA says, explaining her brilliant plan,\u201d MISAKA said, loading a round into her rifle\u2019s underbarrel grenade launcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst plan I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s also the best plan I\u2019ve heard all day,\u201d Petire griped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed. Suit up, people,\u201d Quentin said. Thankfully, the rubber suits fit snugly over their armor. Slick woke up long enough to slip into a costume that looked more like a set of footy pajamas before falling back asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, guys?\u201d Atomic roared. \u201cI think mine is a size too small,\u201d the giant hunter said. The costume couldn\u2019t even cover one of his massive legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Do not worry. MISAKA has prepared for this kind of situation. The monster can be Pyonko,\u2019 MISAKA says, showing off how prepared she is,\u201d MISAKA said, while pulling out a pink mask  in the shape of a cartoon frog\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtomic strapped the mask to his face. \u201cAnyone who takes a picture won\u2019t be returning home alive,\u201d he roared. The feared bounty hunters looked ridiculous in their green frog costumes. Zeke put his hat back on, making him look like some kind of cowboy Gekota figure. They held their weapons at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Big Sister should be back from school any second,\u2019 MISAKA says, noting the imminent sunset,\u201d MISAKA said, her robotic voice slightly muffled by the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard the creaking of floorboards in the hallway outside. </span></div></div>",

A nice way to have a little picnic for the people in Hyrule...that is until an evil army name the Dark Forces, appears and causing havoc across the Hyrule, led by a dragon knight, an evil wizard, and a dark sorceress. Soldiers on both sides clash against each other, spewing blood across the field, but it seems the Dark Forces are gaining the upper hand...it looks bleak for the Hyrulean Forces, but little did they know, a group of hunters is about to enter the battle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of the rocky cliff, a bright portal appears in thin air and coming out from it are the NanoCorps...although only the female members: Sasha, Alanna, Glenys, Esmeralda, Slyphy, Athanasia, Ylva, and Vivian, came out with no sign of the guys and to make it very strange of their arrival...they appear to be normal sized.

The boys aren't here and we're stranded on a unknown world!\" Alanna shouted before hearing a lot of shouting from below the cliff. \"What's all that racked?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls except Esmeralda moves to the edge, witnessing soldiers and monsters battling each other with casualties on both side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...We definitely pick the wrong time to be here. It's like a damn war zone!\"  said Vivian. \"I suggest we better get a move on before they spotted us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. Maybe we can find the boys somewhere else. Come on, Esmeralda! We gotta move!\" Sasha said to the ghost huntress but she remains still with her head down, staring at the ground. \"Esmeralda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls check to see the ghost girl is alright, she responded with a nod and points it down near her boots. As the girls lower to see what she is pointed, they let out a gasp as they spotted their fellow hunters waving their arms, shrunken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!? You're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small...We noticed, Sherlock.\" Viz huffs. \"Glad to see you girls are alright...Not that I care...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viz..Sorry, he's not happy at the moment...Anyway, glad Emmy founded us before you ladies can take off. We had to avoid the footfalls when we got out of the portal first. Alanna almost step on Danny if it wasn't for Atomic's quick action.\" Quentin said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit...\" Alanna curses under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And be very glad we got him close to us cause the moment he saw you ladies, he freaked out and about to climb your foot, Vivian.\" Petire said while smacking Danny on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You little...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now hold on my beautiful Hispanic darling, I-I wasn't trying to get a close view of your delicious thigh and big booty-\" Danny made a loud yelp sound when Vivian stomps down near the tiny hunters, sending him behind Atomic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, you two.\" Quentin comes up to Vivian's boot, patting against it. \"Right now, we gotta find out who's the target and...try our best not to get caught in this war...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I take a suggestion of seeking Princess Zelda of the Hyrulean Forces? They could use our help.\" Beta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's one of the commanders of Hyrulean Forces and also..a possible target that Micro asked. Of course we have rules of dealing with royalties, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, no killing a king or queen, prince or princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should fool him by getting the blood of the princess after helping we help her and her army out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...One problem, bucket head. We're small! How the hell can we combat a soldier who is way taller than us?\" said Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls will fight for us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are?\" said Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Atomic's help, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does Atomic gonna help us!? He's puny!\" Alanna shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can change your mind when I punch your face, gihahaha!\" Atomic laughs while cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just say!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two hunters starts to argue, the voices from the field are getting louder and more intense. Quentin, making the two stop fighting, orders Beta to location the Princess while climbing aboard on Glenys's hand. Sure enough, the robot got a location on Zelda, given them directions and makes preparation to take off...Slick isn't asleep yet so they asked him to teleport them there, much to Slick's disappointment... </span></div></div>",

The hunters look at him knowing his tone is always sarcasm. \"...It's not sarcasm, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happen next, doc?\" Quentin asked the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Let see...While the beautiful sorceress was preoccupied, something...change her...something evil...This evil presence has managed to enter her heart and pushed the light away, changing her once curiosity...into a evil desperate desire who only wanted the Hero of the Legend's soul herself,..The rest of the info-err story is blank.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...So this evil bastard must have corrupted the sorceress, but for what purpose?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing here, but probably take over Hyrule.\" said Sharper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Could be...But that's none of our concern. The target should be around here in the Temple of Souls, which you all are on now. Her name is Cia, by the way. Now be really careful, this is one sorceress you gotta end quickly...Or you'll may end up as her...Playthings...Good luck, hunters!\"</span> Dr. Micro laughs before signing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...We're going after a crazy but dangerous sorceress...I hope she's cute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for pete's sake...Q-man, mind if ya talk some sense into Danny?\" Petire said to the leader, but notice he was looking at other direction. \"...Quentin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys...I think we're being watch...\" Quentin said calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's impossible...There's no way someone able to see us small hunters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah we're definitely being watch...I can feel it\" Viz said while getting his robotic arms ready. As the hunter prepares for any ambush attacks, they were startle by a feminine laughter, echoing throughout the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww damn...It's her, isn't it?\" Ralph said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourself, ya witch! Come out and fight like a...woman.\" Petire threatens the mysterious voice...Sort of.  While the hunters trying to locate the voice, Beta detected a high level threat...Above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danger detected! Danger Detected! She's above-\" It was the last words Beta said before the hunters was cover in darkness and for some reason...Flesh. A few minutes later, the hunters regain their sights and got a nice view of a purple eye with a menacing stare...The hunters realize it was the evil sorceress Cia, the target they were looking for, who actually caught them instead! Now standing on the fleshy landscape which is her palm, they got a good view of the giant sorceress. Cia is quite a beautiful woman as she wearing a rather revealing dress that matches her personality and Danny, as always, is google eyeing her curvy body, especially her cleavage... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! What a babe!! Hey cutie, how about you and me go on a date?\" Danny tries wooing the giant Cia, but gets a slap on the head by Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh brother...ahem.\" Quentin steps forward to confront Cia. \"I'm Quentin Andross and we are the NanoCorps. We are on a mission to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" Cia interrupts the young Drangua words with her booming voice. \"You didn't think I would know...? You are here to kill me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So it's true, you have been watching us when we appear...\" Zeke spoke up. \"Then tell me this: Why didn't you kill us earlier?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia begins to laugh to his question, shaking their poor tiny ears once more. \"Let just say...I'm a bit interested of you small creatures...Especially this one.\" Cia pointed to Quentin. \"He almost like my beloved Link...though much taller.\" the hunters look at Quentin as he laughs nervously at her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...It's too bad you're here to kill me. So...I have to kill you all instead!\" Cia summons her specter from other hand and brought it close to the tiny hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnd...She gonna kill us. Get that bitch, boys!\" Petire orders the hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your ass on gear!\" Viz yells at Petire. The hunters gets ready for the battle that could go down in their own history book...     <br>\r\n  .</span></div></div>",

He favors the lance which is called Dragon Lance and has fire element to burn his foes. He is quite loyalty to Cia due to the fact that he sold his soul to her to gain more power, he is perfect for killing the NanoCorps...But will he even kill that silver monster that was with them?  It's possible...But she'll see if he can...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one is the one who is not the trusted one and can turn on her in just a second, but she'll make sure the wizard will do her bidding. This wizard names is Wizzro: A strange creature with powerful dark magic who is actually a ring. While he was a ring, he lured the victims into wearing the ring, allowing him to absorb their essence and condensing their deceased souls into a single, malevolent spirit which he is now. But due to his greed of power, he will turn against Cia like he did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind being set, Cia's body begins to glow under her dark magic. The hunters on each of Cia's body parts notice the malevolent aura and Viz decided to interrupt the casting by hitting her nose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what are you up to, witch?\" Viz digs his razor sharp blade into her skin, causing the dark sorceress to wench in pain, but manage to resume her casting. Just as Viz about to attack her again, a weapon from out of nowhere clash against Viz's blade and quickly backs away. \"What the hell!? Just who the hell are you!?\" He snarls at the lance wielding warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...That's my line, you brat...I should be asking Cia why am I summon..and gotten this small...\" The dragon knight looks up at Cia's massive purple eyes before looking at Viz. \"...Whatever it is, I don't really care. But if it means to fight an intruder, then that's good enough for me.\" Volga twirls his lance before breathing fire up in the air. \"Come, brat! Face me in battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good! Bring it on, old man!\" Viz smiles with joy and charges after the dragon knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin, meanwhile, was scaling up Cia's neck before seeing a bright light of fire on Cia's nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Cia able to summon some help...Better go help him before he gets killed.\" Quentin said while resuming his climbing, Before the young leader can reach her face, a weird and creepy laugh appears behind him...He look over his shoulder to see a dark creature with one glowing red eye and wearing a cloak. \"...And I thought Atomic was ugly...Luckily he didn't hear that, heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He he he...A comedian, hmm?\" The creature chuckles evilly. \"Well, I don't care how did I get so small...But you are a pest to Cia and must be squash.\"  Wizzro summons two dark creatures from both sides, charging after Quentin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin reacts by grabbing his sword and struck one against the head while kicking the other one with his leg encased in dragon scales. Both of the creatures disappears, causing the dark wizard both annoyed and delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho...You are quite strong. But nevertheless, you must be destroy, he he he!\" Wizzro laughs before charging at Quentin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Sorry, Viz.

She's very important in this world!\" Petire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Mwhahaha! Too bad...If you can't kill her then you won't able to use the device to return to your home world...\"</span> Dr. Micro grins evilly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You son of the-\" Sharper snaps at the scientist before he signing off, not without laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I really want to kill him...\" Viz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save me some ass kicking as well! No good rotten bastard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough you two...Let's go find Tiki and then we can figure what to do with her.\" Quentin said before turning to Beta. \"Is she near us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Actually...Yes, she's very near us. But I believe she already know were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Beta, you must have short circuit. There's no way she could spotted us.\" Danny chuckles. \"And besides, we're freaking small. No way she could hear us,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess again, kid...She's right behind.\" Zeke said as a large shadow covering the hunters location. They immediately turn around to see who it is..But they only get is a nice and scary view of a gigantic green eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Danny nearly peed himself. \"What the hell is that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I take it you're Tiki...Am I right?\" Quentin calmly asked this mountainous being, only to get a very loud voice that was an earful to the hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I am indeed Tiki. I was wondering...Can I ask you strange tiny creatures a question?...Are you here to assassinate me?\" Tiki asked the tiny hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can explain this situation..\" Before Quentin can speak any further, the enormous Voice of Divine Dragon begins to stand up, giving the hunters a more view of her.  Her clothing was in different shades of red with the little cape she wears in pink and she has a rather big chest which cause Danny to drool a bit. As the hunters counties viewing her, they were interrupt by a large hand like shadow  that is getting bigger, they realize it was Tiki's gloved hand that was about to grab the hunters. They tried to get away from her but they were not quick enough to escape her grasp as they are cover in darkness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hunters regain their vision, they notice that they are on... </span></div></div>",

The thought of seeing her siblings together make the princess smile\u2026Though the peaceful thought was interrupt when something flying near her face. Corrin spotted a tiny flying object in front of her and it moves quite strangely\u2026Corrin simply shrugs and gently blows the \u2018bug\u2019 away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin felt a hurricane like wind hitting him as the giantess tries to blow him away, luckily his dragon wings can withstand the powerful gust and remain close to Corrin\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Corrin! I\u2019m not a-\u201c Quentin tries to tell her, but the princess responded by raising both her hands near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnoying little bug. I\u2019m sorry but you leave me no choice.\u201d Corrin said before she clasped her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny Drangua quickly flies forward as the two gigantic hands closing in on him fast. The wall of flesh nearly touches him before escaping his certain death. Quentin sighs in relief of his escape but not before looking at the sky filled eye of annoyed princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersisted little thing aren\u2019t you? I really don\u2019t have time to-huh?\u201d Corrin felt a strange yet familiar draconic aura like her royal siblings have\u2026and it\u2019s coming from the tiny being in front of her. \u201cWait\u2026Could I be\u2026It can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin notice the large digits is coming towards him and was about to avoid them until Corrin said she\u2019s not going to harm him\u2026.Quentin remains still as the fingers gently closed down on the tiny hunter, moving him even closer to her red eye\u2026Gotta admit it, she sure does has a beautiful set of eyes. <br>\r\nCorrin carefully examine the tiny being and realize it was not really an insect, but a human being! Corrin lets out a gasp and quickly gets up from the bed, surprise and shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m so sorry! I almost kill you!\u201d Corrin apologize repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m quite hard to kill actually\u2026\u201d Quentin chuckles a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin sighs in relief, seeing the tiny person is okay\u2026and surprisingly speaks in human tone. Perhaps talking to him will get to know him\u2026especially he\u2019s carrying the dragon\u2019s blood. The princess sets the hunter in the palm of her hand while sitting in the bed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMy name is Corrin, I\u2019m a princess of Hoshido as well as Nohr. Mind telling me what is your name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuentin Andross. I\u2019m the leader of NanoCorps: the greatest bounty hunters in the world. I did come with the others, but\u2026it seems they haven\u2019t made their appearances yet\u2026.Anyway, I notice you are a dragon, right? I can sense it within you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do...with the help of Dragonstones, I can take form of a dragon.\u201d Corrin was actually kinda surprise that Quentin was able to tell she carries dragon\u2019s blood.  \u201cHow did you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a Drangua: A race of human/dragon. Though they are\u2026extinct\u2026I was the only survivor. It\u2019s kinda hard for me to explain it.\u201d Quentin looks down with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Corrin lowers her finger, gently rubbing the little Drangua\u2019s head. \u201c\u2026Maybe I should keep you here with me until you\u2019re friends come back. Sounds good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with that\u2026uhh\u2026first things first: Where\u2019s\u2026.uhh\u2026where\u2019s your clothes\u2026?\u201d Quentin said while looking away. Corrin doesn\u2019t know what he talking about until it has hit her. She realize she has no clothes on except her bra and panties. The princess shrieks in embarrassment, trying to cover her garments with one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe he\u2026Be glad one of my teammate isn\u2019t here, he\u2019ll jump on you like a happy little pet who won\u2019t leave you alone\u2026and stalking you.\u201d Quentin laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026That is good\u2026I must apologize once more\u2026.With your unexpected appearance, I didn\u2019t notice I was in my bra and panties\u2026I should get in more comfortable clothes\u2026Mind if I go change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Princess Corrin. I will wait for your return.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth smiles each other before Corrin sets Quentin down on her bed and head towards the other room, not before Quentin get a nice view of her shapely rear, almost as if she\u2019s\u2026flirting with him. Quentin quickly shakes his head of dirty thoughts, worrying he may become like Danny and it is a pretty bad sign\u2026The young Drangua decided to contact his team before Corrin comes back and make a decision of telling the princess the reason he came here or not\u2026  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes trails down her body, seeing each details of her body\u2026She does have a nice slim, well-toned body, perky breasts from within her rather tight tank top, her smooth thin stomach and her posture which he already seen. He did get a glimpse of her legs and her bare feet which are quite lovely for someone who goes bare all the time.  Quentin quickly comes back to reality, discarding the pervy thoughts again, he really doesn\u2019t wanna end up like Danny\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...I did tell you I\u2019m the leader of the bounty hunters, right? Well we usually get hired to take down dangerous targets-dead or alive-and we get rewarded. Today\u2026We did get hired by a doctor name Van Micro who sent a bounty for us. The target happens to be a princess who lives here\u2026.and that target name is\u2026Corrin.\u201d Quentin braces himself for Corrin\u2019s outburst of anger and tries to kill him\u2026Instead, Corrin simply looks at the tiny hunter with a concern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I see\u2026But you don\u2019t look like a cold hearted assassin and you are very friendly.\u201d Corrin scoop the tiny hunter up gently, holding him in front of her face. \u201cSorry if this sound inappropriate, but why haven\u2019t you kill me yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a simple but very strict rule of killing people, if we force to: We do not kill royalties. Princes, princesses, kings, queens, anyone who is in the royalty line will not be kill by us, hell, even I can\u2019t kill a princess since I\u2019m a gentleman towards them, he he\u2026 I do have to remind some uhh\u2026bloodthirsty hunters. But of course, the crazy doc didn\u2019t read the fine print.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did you take the job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s our last one for the day and some hunters want to try out the device that let us travel through dimension and shrink us down which works as you can see\u2026I\u2019m sorry I should say it earlier, I don\u2019t know how you reacted if I said it\u2026I hope you can forgive-\u201c Quentin then felt Corrin\u2019s finger pressing gently against his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll forgive you, on one condition.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName it.\u201d Quentin said with her finger pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not take any more request from Micro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry\u2026we won\u2019t. In fact, we are gonna pay him a visit after we get this situation under control.\u201d Quentin chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Corrin smiles before looking at the window, the sun is about to set and Quentin\u2019s friends haven\u2019t arrive yet\u2026Perhaps letting him sleep with her couldn\u2019t hurt unless someone comes up to visit during the night checking up on her\u2026especially Camilla, her older sister from Nohr. \u201cSay Quentin? Why don\u2019t you relax here for a bit until your friends arrive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll just hang around on the nightstand til then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Corrin starts to blush again, biting her lower lip. \u201cI-I think it would be best if you stay close to me\u2026Y-You know, being attacked by a bug or getting step on.\u201d The princess laughs in a awkward moment, looks away for a bit still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Close to you\u2026?\u201d Quentin gulps and starts sweating a bit, tugging his collar. \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea\u2026I can protect myself very well and resting on the nightstand seems like a good-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuentin\u2026\u201d Corrin stares down at the tiny hunter, giving a more imitating look. \u201cI said it would be best if you stay close to me and that\u2019s final. Besides, you aren\u2019t exactly in a position to argue\u2026Do I make myself clear?\u201d Corrin gently push Quentin\u2019s chest with her finger, pushing the Drangua back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Of course\u2026How silly of me to forget that you are a princess and I\u2019m small\u2026Though, you sure look cute when you are serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh? Are you flirting with me? Are you becoming like your pervert friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no. Not in a million years. \u201d Quentin laughs. \u201c\u2026Alright then, I\u2019ll stay with you, my princess.\u201d The hunter bows down to Corrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin giggles while petting Quentin on the head, she hope Quentin will stay with her for a while and getting to know more about him and his NanoCorp teammates. She develop a strange feeling towards the tiny hunter\u2026something that she is well known to her. It seems Corrin has a crush on Quentin, not only he\u2019s a dragon like herself, but he is very kind and quite a gentleman despite he and his friends were hired to kill her. Corrin could tell him about her feelings but she decided to wait for a bit\u2026it would be awkward if he doesn\u2019t like her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware to Corrin, Quentin also develops feelings towards the princess. She\u2019s really a sweet young woman who wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly\u2026well, he almost got squish by her\u2026but still, she\u2019s a sweetheart. Plus, she\u2019s a dragon. Not a Drangua, but a dragon\u2019s a dragon and he\u2019s fine with that! But telling her his feelings is a different story\u2026what\u2019s her response when he tell her? Probably a nice flick in the face or being trapped between her toes or worst\u2026But by far the worst one is when his teammates appear and Danny would try to swoon in on Corrin, ruining his moment to express his love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dragons stare at each other for minutes, figuring how to show their love to each other\u2026  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quentin just confess his love to her! Corrin tries to tell him her feelings for him but she is just quite stunned by his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin looks at Corrin\u2019s reaction\u2026seems like she doesn\u2019t take it well, who could love a bounty hunter who hunts down people for money, especially his current size. Or maybe\u2026she might have a fianc\u00e9\u2026Embarrassed, Quentin quickly changes the subject to lighten this awkward moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry! I was uhh\u2026just messing with you.\u201d Quentin laughs a bit. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say it, I know it was wrong and-\u201c Before they tiny hunter said anything else, Corrin grabs him by two fingers, holding him close to her face. Quentin apologies to Corrin about numerous of times, but it seems clear that she doesn\u2019t like that \u2018joke\u2019 very much. With a sigh of what\u2019s coming next, the tiny Drangua closes his eyes and braces himself for a punishment\u2026.But instead of feeling his body being crushed or flicked, Quentin felt a soft and smooth surface\u2026He slowly open his eyes to take a peek and his whole face literally turns red like tomatoes. In front of him that pressing on his body are Corrin\u2019s lips, kissing him gently and the Drangua himself\u2026.really enjoying it, though there are some downside. His body is almost covered in Corrin\u2019s saliva, drenching him in slimy substance...but he simply ignores it. To boost up this moment, Quentin kisses back on her lower lip though he doubts she can feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of their first kiss, Corrin pulls Quentin away from her lips and places him back in her palm, leaving both the hunter and the princess blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201d Quentin lets out a sigh while wiping off the saliva off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Corrin giggles a bit. \u201cI\u2026I hope I wasn\u2019t rushing. I mean we just met and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about, Princess Corrin. I understand.\u201d Quentin smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two half dragons smile at each other before Corrin gives Quentin another kiss, this time a less saliva which is perfect for the tiny hunter. Quentin really hopes his fellow teammates will not suddenly appear out of nowhere, interrupting their romantic moment. Just thinking about their appearance-especially the pervert Danny- makes him groan\u2026or worst: A visit from one of Corrin\u2019s siblings and spotted him as a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Corrin was concern about the hunter, gently rub him on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s nothing, just thinking of any\u2026unexpected visitors come into your room, discovering us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Beside your friends, I doubt anyone will come up and see me this late\u2026.Well except for Camilla.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCamilla?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy older sister of Nohr. She is very nice and kind to me and my friends, though she can be very ruthless to her enemies\u2026.and she always shower me with love\u2026.which is a bit annoying.\u201d Corrin sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? How so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said \u2018I love you\u2019 to me about 50 times a day. Inviting me to the spa to have a sisterly bond which is embarrassing.  Treating me like I\u2019m still a child and calling me those...pet names.\u201d The princess groans <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda reminds me of a certain fellow hunter\u2026though I\u2019m not gonna badmouth her \u2026Still, it\u2019s nice to have a big sister who loves you\u2026to death.\u201d Quentin smirks before being pushed by Corrin\u2019s finger, laughing. Quentin doesn\u2019t mind meeting her older sister with a huge amount of affection towards Corrin, she may like the tiny hunter as well due to his race and tiny form\u2026he could end up as Camilla\u2019s pet which is not good for him or his fellow hunters. In the meantime, he\u2019ll just relax with his new lover until his teammates arrives\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What you find?\" Quentin asked him, only to hear a gurgle noise. \"...Danny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin waves his hand in front of his face, but no reaction...He looks over to where Danny is looking at...and he starts to blush madly. \"Oh geez!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other hunters heard their leader shouting and quickly comes to them, Zeke asked what's wrong and the young leader responded by pointing in front of them..In front of them was a really beautiful woman with long purple hair, covering one of eyes and appears to be a buxon type due to her large breasts...And she's naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good gravy...\" said Petire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a woman...Ugh I feel like Danny...\" said Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Could she be our target?\" said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, she better be...Can't wait to claw her out.\" Crystal hisses in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh?

The hunters appears to be hiding behind the table's leg from someone who is not too happy of their appearance, Danny slowly peek his out to see the one chasing them is coming...and quickly hid himself when he spotted that person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, she's coming this way...and still look sexy as ever.\" Danny grins with delight, only to be slap on the head by Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters heard her footsteps getting louder and louder until a black object slams near the table where the hunters are and is quite familiar to them. The object happens to be a sandal with a foot resting on the surface, drumming its toes against it. Follow by her long legs cover in black clothing, her bare stomach and large breasts in white shirt with different accessories, long purple hair that bunch into a strange bun and an annoying look on her cute face...The woman they encounter and being chased by is none other than the fortune teller of Hoshido, Orochi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Orochi was doing the mess hall today since there aren't anyone available today and so she volunteer to take the shift, she then spotted the tiny NanoCorps popping out of the hole near the wall. The diviner immediately knew she has bugs infested the mess hall and won't let the creepy insects interrupt her work, so she begin chasing them and cornered the hunters, attempting to crush them underfoot. But a fellow hunter, namely Atomic, stops the oncoming foot with his immense strength and let the other hunters run to safety. He then pushes the foot away, causing the giantess to tumble backward and landed on her butt with a shocking expression on her face. With that done, Atomic follows the hunters to a safe place until the heat dies down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Orochi is quite upset about this and vows to find the tiny bugs and crush them, one way or another. She looks around the mess hall to locate the bugs, but it seems they aren't showing up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out,come out, wherever you are, little ones~\" Orochi muses while tapping her foot. To the hunters, it was a loud booming earthquake with each tapping she does and Alanna was about to snap and attack her, but Atomic grabs her before she does. \"If you don't come out now, I'll just start looking for you and I may let you live...Depending on my mood~\" The diviner chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming out, my darling~!\" Danny was about to swoon over to Orochi's foot, but Petire and Ralph knock the womanizer down before he can reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot...Zeke? Any plans?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking, kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke knows she's not gonna let them live, thanks to Atomic's action...and since Z is recharging his power and Slick is not with them, they may have no choice but to knock the giantess out before they are discover...But how?</span></div></div>",

Flames crackles and brighten the area, dripping water from the ceiling and a soft low hum of the wind blowing across the cave. The hunters knew they are in a cave as they have come across caves quite often and it's no trouble for the NanoCorps, but now being a scale of a tiny ant is a challenge for them to some hunters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the group looks around of the new surroundings and waiting for Dr. Micro to contact them for their target to kill, they heard a muffle sound  behind a humongous boulder behind them, catching few hunters off guard and on attack stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What the hell was that!? Is it a ghost!?\" Sharper said with his guns out, well known for disliking ghosts...except for Esmeralda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself, ya chicken. I recognize that sound...\" said Petire. \"Tis is a sound of someone being tied up and gagged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, like that's someone-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Petire is right. There is someone behind the rock.\" Beta informs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharper grumbles while looking at Petire with a smug smile on his face. Quentin rolls his eyes before ordering the hunters to go around the boulder and find out who is the person being tied up. As the group made around the rock, reaching their destination, they spotted a giant young looking woman lying on the ground, tied up in ropes and wrapped cloth around her mouth and to Danny's eyes...she's quite a stunning one. Detailing from top to bottom, she appears to be a ninja which they haven't seen in quite awhile. Long brown hair with large bang covering her right brown eye, curvy body with noticeable large breasts that Danny had been eyeing on. Wearing a revealing tannish pink short kimono style outfit with yellow scarf, shin and hip guards, large brown buckle with palish orange ropes tied, arm guards with blades at the end and sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the hunters' surprise, the woman was able to spot the tiny hunters with no showing of shock or flabbergast, gently moving her head up while making muffle words to them, telling them to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive. The kid spotted us and asking for our help. Ninjas must have very good keen sight.\" said Zeke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be an elite ninja...which is sooooo cool! I always wanted to meet an actual ninja!\" Ylva yelp with joy, wagging her tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh you forgot about me.\" said Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Well, technically, you are an assassin. You can't, like, vanish in thin air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can blend into shadows, Ylva! It is the same thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ninjas vanish! Like poof! Gone! Like the magicians do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft...In your dreams...\" Slick yawns while scratching his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls...and Slick, that's enough talking about ninjas. We'll discuss this later after we help her out.\" Quentin said with a sigh. \"Atomic, Danny and the recons: Cut the ropes in the upper body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it, boss and I think Danny got a head start.\" The silver monster pointed at the womanizer already climbing the ninja's body, very close to his destination: Her ample bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell...get him before he gets killed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recons and Atomic nodded before headed to the ropes while Quentin orders Alanna, Sasha and Ryx to cut the ropes on her lower body, Slyphy and Glenys to heal her wounds since he notice bruised marks on her body, Beta, Ylva, Athanasia, Viz and  Esmeralda to watch out from behind for anyone, likely the one who held her hostage, to come back here. As for the sloth...Quentin simply told to relax for a moment...which he gave the leader a thumbs up and lays down, beginning to snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter few minutes has been passed of thinning the ropes and healing her , the NanoCorps successfully cuts the ropes, freeing the female ninja and able to remove the cloth herself. The hunters that were on her regroup with the others, dragging Danny from being on her and watching the now freed ninja stands up to full height, towering the tiny hunters and wasn't able to get to see her face due to her mountainous breasts blocking the way until she looks down past them, still able to see the tiny hunters. She then lowers her hand down near them, offering them a lift which they hop on without second thoughts(and carrying Slick) before being lifted up to level with her large bosom which Danny kept staring at all the time... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your assistance, little ones. My name is Kagero; One of Lord Ryoma's retainers.\" The ninja said, bowing down to them with gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, you beautiful hot ninja! How about a kiss for a reward?\" Danny said with a sly look on his face before he was punched by Alanna,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sorry, ignore him...It was no problem at all, just doing our job of saving lives from disasters\" said Quentin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you all here in Mokushu? Did Lord Ryoma send you all here and how did you get to be so small...?\" Kagero asked the hunters with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Quentin worries about telling her about them would losses her trust and will attempt to kill them...and she might be one of Micro's targets..\"...I love to answer your questions, but I don't think its a good place to talk, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...? Oh yes. I need to return to Lord Ryoma before Kotaro returns...Would you like to come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we don;t know where to go...sure, we'll tag along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagero nodded in agreement, now she must place they tiny hunters somewhere...she didn't bring pouch and her outfit doesn't have any pockets. She thought of various places for them to hide: Putting them on top of her head is one of them, but she may lose them in her hair and accidentally hurt them when searching for the hunters,,,or could place them safely on her scarf. the next one is rather...embarrassing, but she could place them in between her large breasts, giving them a cushion and secure hold, though she doesn't wear her bra today , making her breasts bouncing freely, giving the hunters very rough ride (pleasurable for Danny). The last safe place is...her mouth. She can hold them steady in her mouth without swallowing them, but they may not like that one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind set, Kagero decided to place her tiny saviors in her...        <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Danny, on the other hand, was so excited that his nose starts to bleed uncontrollably and quickly tries to jump off and dive in head first, but Alanna angrily grabs him by the leg, roughly place back on the skinned ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Is something wrong?\" Kagero asks the hunters, stopping her from placing them in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn right something is wrong! What the hell are you doing!?\" Alanna shouted in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Putting you in a safe place...?

The ninja lets out a sigh before looking down at the hunters again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Forgive me, but we are out of time. So please bear with it until we are safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of the hunters about to ask her, Kagero close her hand around them before stuffing them inside her cleavage, deep enough so they won't bounce their way out. With the NanoCorps secure, the ninja runs towards the opposite direction of the entrance before the enemy ninjas notice she escape... </span></div></div>",

The two girls are named Velouria, a parent loving, junk(treasures) obsessing Wolfskin and Selkie, a playful and innocent Kitsune. The two decided to collect any variable or rare treasure they can find, but so far, that\u2019s only a leather pouch and rabbit\u2019s furball\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelouria happily keeps the treasures without thinking twice and decided to check on Selkie\u2019s progress\u2026only to find the playful vixen chasing after a bird, losing her focus on collect stuff. The wolf girl sighs of disappointment and resume her treasure hunt elsewhere. A few minutes has passed with no luck of finding the rare treasure, Velouria picks up something that smells quite\u2026divine. She smiles with joy and follows the scent\u2019s direction, she really can\u2019t wait to find it and show it to her beloved father. But as she got closer to the scent\u2019s location, she heard voices behind the bushes\u2026and it sounds human. The wolf girl growls in annoyance cause she may have to ask them to give the treasure to her\u2026So she gets near the bush without being notice and eavesdrop of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201c\u2026Mwhahaha! So, you hunters got all the information?\u201d</span> The mad scientist Dr. Micro said to his hire workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do, though some of us are\u2026not agreeing with this.\u201d Quentin looks at Viz who is grumbling about the mission, along with Alanna who sharpen her blade in boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh toughen up! I can\u2019t pay on those who slacks on the job! Now get to it, mwhahaha!\u201d</span> The doctor laughs before signing off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him\u2026\u201d Viz said with a anger look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame some for me. I want to cut his little head off\u2026.\u201d Alanna smirks a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave some bloodthirsty moment for later. Right now we need to find the target and get it over with\u2026Beta, where\u2019s the target?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScanning now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the hunters waiting for Beta to finish the scanning, they are unaware that Velouria was peeking through the bushes, viewing an interesting tiny creatures\u2026.even some of them are humans. The wolf girl then picks up the same scent she smelled earlier\u2026and its coming right near the tiny creatures, in one of their bags.  Perhaps asking them to give up the treasure is the only choice and tries to avoid crushing them\u2026that is if they don\u2019t give up their possession. With a huff, Velouria steps out of the bushes, revealing herself in a calm manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters felt an earth shatter booming noise that very near of them and looks at the source\u2019s location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that!? Is someone-Good gravy!!\u201d Petire shouted as he spotted a gigantic girl wearing a red hoodie with wolf like ears and tail from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa there! A cute furry girl!? Hot damn!\u201d Danny jumps up and down with joy and gets slapped by Petire and Viz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring their outburst, Velouria lowers her body and gets a close view of the hunters, sniffing them in progress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters watches the giant wolf girl lowering herself, getting a good view of her and her nose as she sniffs them. The felt a powerful suction and quickly hold their ground, Sharper was almost being suck in but Atomic grabs him just in time before she stops. Then they heard her loud booming voice from above, asking one of the hunters to show his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou. The bald headed human\u2026What\u2019s in your bag? I pick up a wonderful scent while I was looking for treasures\u2026and it\u2019s coming from inside your bag.

Uhh\u2026Okay.\u201d Petire doesn\u2019t know why this giant girl want to see his bag\u2026but he most complied or he and the other will feel her wrath.

How the hell did you get it!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Let me see it!\" Danny tries to grab the photo but Viz punches the womanizer into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou put it in my bag, ya dumbass! Next time look carefully where ya put it.\u201d Petire gives the picture to Viz who quickly hides it in his suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026That\u2019s not the one either.\u201d Velouria said, finding the tiny hunters quite amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026There\u2019s one more thing in here\u2026and\u2026Oh!\u201d Petire pulls out a large feather in golden color with four gems on the front \u201cIt\u2019s my old lucky golden feather from the legendary bird! I been looking for that for years! This feather has taken such good memories...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelouria sniffs gently and lets out a gasp. That\u2019s the wonderful smell coming from! Petire\u2019s golden feather and it\u2019s quite a rare sight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one! Can I have it?\u201d The wolf girl lowers her gloved hand near the hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But\u2026I just found my lucky feather\u2026I\u2019m afraid I have to say no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really want it.

In front of the hunters is a very large chair like structure...It's seems they are in someone's chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...Our target must be royalty.\" Viz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. We might be hunting a princess or a queen...Ugh.\" Quentin sighs. \"...Alright then, let's-Petire! Sharper!

Well...She's a goddess! Mwhahahaha!\"</span> The doctor crackle with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin was kinda unsure about their target...She's a goddess, that could mean they might not able to 'kill' her. \"...Uhh doc, you know gods and goddesses can't die right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Hmm...That's what I been thinking, guess we will find out then hmmmmm~?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I swear I'm gonna kill you.\" Viz growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Eep! So vicious! G-Good luck on your mission!

I would say that are chances to eliminated the target, with are now decreasing size is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it, Beta...\" Petire sighs. \"Let's...Just look for the goddess.\" Petire then realize something...Something frightening him and quickly scans the entire room. The hunters notice it and decided to ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Petire? Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...If she is a goddess...Does that mean she knows we're here, despite our small size?\" As Petire speaks to the hunters, they heard a loud, feminine like voice that appear out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"That's correct. I never thought a group of tiny mortals and creature would come to meet me.\"</font> The voice giggles at the hunters<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nearly jumped by this voice and look around to where it's located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourself!\" Viz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy Viz...I take it your the Goddess of Light Palutena?\" Quentin speak to the mysterious voice. As the hunters keep looking for the source, a bright light appears before them, blinding them except Beta. As the bright light begins to dim away, the hunters got their sights and now staring a brown colored wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I don't remember seeing a brown wall...\" Danny said while scratching his head. He then notice the other hunters are looking up in awe. \"Uhh guys? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid. You might wanna look up. Very slowly.\" Zeke said in a calm voice. \"You might enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny,still scratching his head, shrugged before looking up...And immediately was shock at the sight he witness. The goddess was beautiful indeed, with very long green hair reaching down to her lower legs. She appears to be wearing a simple white dress with numerous gold ornaments, gold laurel crown, red fibula that is on her hips, vine-like patterns on the hems of her dress and brown sandal like footwear which the hunters are quite near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Shit...\" Danny nearly collapse in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Atomic said with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good gravy almighty...\" Petire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hmph.\" Viz grunts as he is not quite impress of her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Andross. Shall we begin eliminate our target.\" Beta said before being slap on the head by Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\" Quentin sighs. \"Err..Hello, Goddess of Light. We uhh...Come in peace, we mean no harm...I hope\" Quentin said in his honest word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena forms a gentle smile on her face, although the hunters feel an uneasy feeling about her smile...   </span></div></div>",

They weren't dead, it seems... Still sentient and aware while absorbed. But they were definitely very limited in what they could do. They could talk to each other, and that was it. They seemed powerless right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What the fuck just happen?\" Viz said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?

All the hunters had ended up in there. The goddess had gotten a clean sweep of absorbing them. However, when their powers hit... She blinked, and recoiled a bit. \"Woah....\" she looked down ay her hands. Power was seeping out of every pore in her body. It was... Incredible! She felt like the strongest goddess in the world now! Maybe even strong enough to take on Hades herself!! She clutches her hands determinedly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then completely broke the serious mood when she giggled to herself from thinking she now had 'the most powerful breasts in the world!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was such a silly thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, she looked down to her new breasts, cupping them and holding them up a bit. \"With all this power, I dont think you all are just perverts here to fondle me.

She wears a black and navy blue, high-collared halter top, a black corset with two pairs of white laces and black shorts, white bell-sleeves with small, segmented piece of armor on each of her upper arms and tan, fingerless gloves, black stockings reaching about halfway up her thighs,  two strips of blue cloth draped over each of her hips and armored silver boots with sharp hook in the outer side.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Damn! What a woman~!\" Danny drools at the sight of his savoir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh the poor fool...Anyway, she did save our butts. Question is...Did she see us?\" said Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out...\" Quentin said while watching the giant woman getting closer and closer with each booming steps she takes... </span></div></div>",

It must be dangerous for you to be out here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...rather a long story...\" Aqua sighs before standing at full height. \"I can't stand around here...I have to find a way out. I suggest you tiny ones to do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish we could, kid, but the device not responding nor the doctor trying to contact us...So we're kinda stuck here.\" Zeke said rubbing his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...Why don't you come with me? I can protect you from those black creatures.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good idea, right hunters?\" Quentin asked his comrades which they agree except for Danny as he jumps on Aqua's boot, hugging it with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, you can protect me anytime!\" Danny said with his face rubbing against the armored part of her shoe. Aqua looks at the other hunters, confused about this tiny man's weird behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask....He's a bit delusional around girls.\" Viz shrugs. \"Let's leave him there and get a move one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me!

The hunters scanned their new location to see what's new...It seems to be a very peaceful place. They notice buildings on mountains with waterfall gushing out beautifully, ancient like trees blooming with pink flowers and most noticeably of them all is several large glowing crystals that stand-or rather float on top of buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Talk about paradise!\" Danny pulls out his sunglasses. \"I can get used to this!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not here on vacation. Though it does look nice, I'll admit.\" said Petire. \"What era are we in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still collecting data on our newly location, Master Petire.\" said Beta. \"But we are on an island called Ionia. It is off the east coast of Valoran and northeast of Noxus. Our target is likely lives here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beeping noise startled the hunters before taken notice of the device they use. The device begins projecting a hologram of their 'boss', Dr.Van Micro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Mwhahaha! You made it, excellent!\"</span> The scientist laughs with glee. <span class=\"cindigo\">\"I take it you enjoy this lovely sight of Ionia, yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually pretty nice...But of course, we can't relax. Who's the target?\" Quentin asked the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Well, I'll be blunt: Your target is gonna be tough for you...Ever heard of a Fox Spirit or rather The Nine-Tailed Fox?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, those mystical creatures in those Chinese folklore and stuff..Wait a minute...Are trying to say we're going up against a Nine-Tailed Fox...Woman?\" Petire asked him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Correct! Her name is Ahri, the nine tailed fox woman who lives here in Ionia. She lure unsuspecting men by her charm and uhh...Beautiful body and I mean-\"</span> The scientist does a wolf whistle while using his hands to form a curvy body of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn!\" Danny yells with excitement before being slap on the head by Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Ahh but I wouldn't be too excited when you get near her if I were you. She consume their life essences when they were under the spell of her seductive charms. killing those poor slobs...Luckily, you bounty hunters may withstand her charms since you're way too small for her to detect you and you got the robot and the monster. Also watch for her orb and those flames, that also can pack a nasty punch...Well, good luck hunters! You'll be needing it...\"</span> Micro laughs before signing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Danny. You heard the doc, she'll kill you with her charm, so no eye candying on her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww..Can I at least take a picture of her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Danny...\" Quentin sighs before the robot tells the hunters their target is near...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Target detected. She is straight ahead.\" said Beta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters turns to the location where Beta said, spotting a feminine figure not too far from the stump they are on and what the doctor said is true: She IS beautiful! This beautiful, curvy fox woman appears to be wearing a quite revealing kimono with traditional accessories and black and white shoes and of course, the nine fox tails behind her...Danny couldn't help but eyeing on her yellow eyes and her body...Almost like he was under a spell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Danny!\" Petire slaps him on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!...What the hell, Petire!? I can't help it if she's beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this is not good...Danny really gonna get himself killed. Of course, some of you are also gonna fall prey to her charm...Any suggestions?\" Quentin asked the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have two: I'll snipe her with a special bullet that knock anyone unconscious without killing her and then we'll decided what to next. Or we could send Viz, Atomic, Beta and Slick to knock her out since they doesn't seem to be affecting her charm...\" Zeke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two plans sounds good.

Danny, on the other hand, was eyeing on her slender yet curvy body, especially her behind when walking into her room...Although his fantasy was interrupted by Petire slapping him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!

She then activated the holographic goggles that allowed her to view a strange box and sat contently viewing.

Their first stop is her feet which get anice view of  her elegant legs rising into the air. Without any thought, Danny jumps on top of her slick cover foot and runs towards her leg, climbing it with his thoughts being filled with dirty images...But it was interrupted when Danny can't get a good grip of the fabric, causing him to slid down her leg and landed on her foot with a thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbass...\" Petire said under his breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Climbing her leg is a good choice, I wonder what's our other option?\" Quentin scans Kasumi's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Follow me, kids.\" Zeke spoke up while walking beside Kasumi's leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see...It might uhh...Please Danny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters decided to follow Zeke with Danny jumping off her foot and following them. After a=their little short walk, Danny's favorite assest, her curvy rear came into view and once again, Danny runs towards her rear and instantly grabs a hold of fabric, smothering his face on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeke! You are the best man! Ooohh...This is sooo soft and squishy...I'm in heaven!!\" Danny yells, continuing his prevy ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Zeke, are you a pervert?\" Ralph asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...No, I think it'll be best if we climb her backside instead...In a faster rate.\" Zeke said while staring at Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh...Not my favorite choice of climbing, but it'll have to do. Grab a hold of her butt-good grief- I mean...Grab her suit and climb. Quickly.\" With the orders from the leader, the hunters starts climbing. It seems the fabric of her suit is quite easy to scale. With few minutes has passed, they are able to reach a makeshift like canyon formed by her raised leg and vertical body. They could see her waist just up ahead...   </span></div></div>",

As the incest like woman was about to finish up her resting, a small but bright light appears out of nowhere in the middle of the snow field. Thinking it might be another one of the rebellions, the incest woman hid behind the rotten tree and peaks a bit to see who it is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon her surprise, a very small group of people emerges from the light, landing on the snow...The woman blinks a few times, thinking it's an illusions, but they do move and talk, so it has to be real...She don't recognize all ten of the tiny people, especially the large silver one, in fact...they really don't belong from the Outworld or Earthrealm. She then notice they are talking to a hologram of a man who appears to be a scientist and decided to listen to their conversation <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Mwhahaha! Nice to see you hunters in one piece...Because you're gonna have a good time today!\"</span> the doctor laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by 'good time'?\" Quentin asked, knowing this doesn't sound good to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Your target is really weird...I mean, yucky weird.

Only genders of Kytinn is female, they may be some males but it is unknown. The Kytinn, if planted inside a human host, can emerging with wings in a humanoid form from them as if they were a cocoon. Also, if the human host is stronger, the planted Kytinn will also grow stronger. Just think if the Kytinn plants a larvae in Atomic's body...\" Beta explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then we will be dealing a very dangerous Kytinn...For once, I'm actually glad we are too small to be a host.\" Danny chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gihahaha!

Love seeing those stinging bastard fried up.\" Alanna grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware to the hunters, D'Vorah had been listening to their conversation and was quite angry at one of the hunter's rude comment. \"This one will enjoy killing the small creatures..\" She hisses while waiting for them to finish up with their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Mwhahahaha! Good one...But joke aside, beware of her swarm of insects, able to fly, and has highly toxin blood. Avoid that and you should be able to finish her off in no time. Good luck hunters!\"</span> The doctor laughs before signing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hunters begins the search of their target, D'Vorah slowly comes out of her hiding spot with four poisonous pincers emerging from her back and calls out the tiny hunters. \"This one been waiting for you to end those foolish human conversation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter immediately turns to face D'Vorah and get a good look of the female Kytinn...and the doctor was right, she is one weird bug woman. Her skin takes the appearance of a yellow chitinous hide and the heels of her feet are what looks like high heel wedges. Her eyes are compound like a fly's eyes, her teeth are sharp and pointed which could make her a carnivore. She wears a black top and hood, spiked gauntlets on her arms armored ringlets on her forearms, and armored shin guards, and a jewelry that rests around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...I think I need a bigger bug spray for this bugger.\" Petire continues to joke around D'Vorah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...I don't think she taken the bug jokes very lightly..\" said Ralph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...She's ugly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis!\" Glenys playfully smacks Alanna on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter noticed the insect woman is walking towards them with an angry look on her face, the hunters kept their distance while she walks. Soon she was upon them and attempts to crush them under foot, but the hunters moves away before her foot slam against the snow.

This one cannot understand...\" D'Vorah hisses. \"Powerful or not...You will be part of this one's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry for us huh, bug girl?\" Petire taunts the giant insect woman. \"Have a taste of bug spray instead! It'll give you a nice lemony scent for your breath...As well as  insecticide which gives a painful death, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'Vorah got really tired of hearing the tiny hunter's rude words and tries to grab them with her hands, but once again, the hunters dodge her attack. Quentin decided to do something daring and flies straight towards D'Vorah's face with Viz following pursuit. The woman spotted the two hunters and decides to deal with them instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two will make a nice appetizer for this one. My insects will take care of your friends for the time being\" D'Vorah releases a swarm of wasps from her hands into the air, charging after the other hunters. These wasps are about the same size as the miniature hunters except for Atomic who is bigger then the others. Normally Petire uses the bug spray to kill the annoying bugs but this time he has to use his fist and guns. Quentin and Viz looks on as the other hunters battle against the swarm of wasps while they deal with the giant Kytinn who eyeing on them with her black compound eyes, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I really hate bugs...Guess I'll start by killing you, bug freak.\" said Viz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we make you uncomfortable? Do not worry, you'll be much comfortable once you two are inside me...\" D'Vorah moves her hand and quickly grabs the two hunters with her two digits. Quentin and Viz struggles to get free from her fingers but to no prevail and to make things worst, she lowers her fingers near her mouth. \"Struggle all you want, my morsels. This one will enjoy your tastiness.\" Licking her lips, she opens her mouth wide enough to see a great view of her  row of teeth, dripping saliva from the top and a dangling uvula in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell, being eaten by this freak is annoying enough, but it still won't top on the doctor's shitty mission.\" Viz said while trying to escape her clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't give up just yet...I got an idea.\" Quentin said with a smirk on his face.      </span></div></div>",

The hunters fight off most of the wasps but more swarm of raging insects appears from D'Vorah, continuously tries to sting or bite the hunters. Zeke summons his favorite gun, Ol' Bestie, to snipe off the flying insects one by one. Quentin burns most of the wasp with his fire powers and cutting them with his sword while Viz changes his arms into chain guns, blasting almost all the pests with one swoop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Viz!

Atomic punches the wasps from left to right with a few of them clinging on him, stinging the silver monster but unfortunately, his skin is way to tough for their stingers and gets punish by Atomic's fist. Atomic boasted on his superior strength and skin when a large shadow cast upon him. The monster notice it and tries to move away, but D'Vorah was too quick for him and grabs him, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no escape, my tasty victim.

This one's-Urk!\" D'Vorah felt a powerful sting  inside her mouth, causing the Kytinn to scream in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there it is...Rule #1: Never eat Atomic Vile.\" Danny and the Three Recon Stooges laughs out loud. \"Hey look, those wasps are gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a counterattack!

The others look to where he is looking...The Three Recon Stooges nearly scream their heads off before covering their mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit...Is that Hisako?\" Danny whispers to Quentin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters continue watching Hisako as she walks slowly across the wet and muddy ground until she stops at her track, standing very still. They notice she appears to be...jitters like static, distorting the space around her with a eerie green glow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think its a good time to attack her.\" said Viz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Physical attacks may not work her unless Slick give us a boost of his powers, we might have a good chance to hit her.\" said Zeke. \"That is...If he's still awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm wide awake...\" said Slick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with that settle, we can defeat the ghost and get the hell out of here and...\" Petire notices the ghost girl slowly turns her head to their location...Seeing her pale white skin and dark and sunken eyes. \"Holy shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she....Looking at us...?\" Ralph asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters watches the ghost girl for a minute until she starts walking towards them...She starts to jitters again, making her disappear and reappear in a different place. The hunters gets their weapons out while watching her, they nearly started when Hisako starts crawling very fast towards them and then disappear again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-This is nuts! Were in like a freaky horror movie!\" Petire shouted in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Petire. That just what she wanted! Stay calm and don't let her get you-\" Before Danny can finish, his eyes widen in fear and take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Danny,,,?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Petire...Guys...Do not freak out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Three Recons slowly turns around and gets a huge sky full of Hisako's eyes and this time...they did scream their heads off and run behind Atomic, shaken in fear. The others back away from the sudden appearance of Hisako and watches her slowly rises to her height, silently staring down at the tiny hunters before speaking to them in Japanese language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What did she just said?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Translating...Who are you, tiny creatures? Are you the ones who disturb my slumber? \" said Beta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no! We did not disturb you, miss Hisako! We...We just arrive here! We did not disrespect the dead!\" Petire said, still shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost girl slowly moves her head to the left shoulder, looking at the hunters while talking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Translating....Lies, you are the soldiers who come to steal us,robbed from our graves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! we are telling you the truth! We didn't disturb you!\" Quentin tries to reason Hisako but she simply ignores his words and talks to them in an angry tone, nearly shouting at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Translating....Liars! You will pay...All of you will pay with your lives!\" After Beta finish, the angry ghost girl screams in anger, her mouth grows quite large, showing several rows of razor-sharp teeth inside, giving more fright to Petire and the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she not listening, Q! We gotta fight her!\" Danny said, not willingly to die by the undead girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh...\" Quentin curses under his breath... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She has long white hair and a curvaceous hour-glass figure. She wears an ornate dress of golden armor acting as a chest plate with a revealing midriff, matching gauntlets and a skirt that extends a little portion past her knees, and golden leg guards connected to her high heeled shoes. The Lust Mantra user was given order to hunt down the traitor, Asura once they heard he was once again come back from the dead and resume his vengeance on the Deities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asura... That foolish baboon!\" The demigoddess snarls in her thoughts. \"He shall not interfere with Lord Deus' plans any further!\" Before Olga orders all ships for purification, something caught her attention in the corner of her eye...A very small glint of light appears below the stand and tiny like figures emerges from the portal which surprises the demigoddess...Curious, Olga slowly approaches the spot...could be an intruders who aided Asura or the vile Gohma creatures who somehow enter the ship without detected, either way, she must deal with this quickly before destroying Asura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters, meanwhile, landed on unfamiliar area and scans the new location....Beta informs the hunters that they are on the ship and the target's nearby. Before they could proceed, a beeping noise appears from the device and a hologram of the mad doctor, laughing before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Mwhahaha! Welcome hunters...To whatever this dimension this is.\"</span> The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. You don't know where we are...Besides we are on the ship?\" Quentin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Unfortunately, I don't have any info on this...But let just say there are a lot of demigods around here and they are extremely powerful!

This may be the toughest one to fight due to your small size, too bad though...If the big guy was normal size, he will stomp her in the ground for good.\" <br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n\"Gihaha, thanks for the compliment, doc!\" the silver monster laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Good luck hunters!

As the hunters planning their attack on their target, a loud booming noise appears behind them and getting louder. They quickly turn around, only to face a massive figure of a woman with a hand on her hip, staring down at the hunters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How interesting...You low lifeforms able to enter the Septentrion Alioth without being notice...\" The demigoddess's voice thundered down upon the tiny hunters' ears. \"And more interesting is you are here to kill me...This can not go unpunished! I will not let a small group of little bugs take me down!\" Olga stomps her foot near the hunters, causing them to move back few feet away with their weapons ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess talking to her ain't gonna help. Get ready for a big fight, hunter!\" Quentin orders the group to do battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. She talks all high and mighty...I hate that kind of people...\" Viz smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This IS a demigod, Viz!

Olga holds her injure hand, backing away in shocked....There is no way the two beings can have this much power, it almost like they are demigods themselves!

We are small and in a different world....Uhh where are we exactly?\" Quentin asked the robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still collecting data, Master Quentin. It shouldn't take long before-Wait.\" Beta detects a massive figure on his radar and its heading this way. \"A figure is heading this direction. We must proceed to a hidden spot before the figure spotted us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell who it is?\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again I'm still collecting data and now the figure's info. Follow me to the hidden location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft! Fuck that. Let's just kill that bastard already.\" Alanna brought out her sword, ready to take on this figure, but she was pick up by Atomic. \"H-Hey! Let me go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Alanna! No time for getting your ass whopped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell that supposed to mean!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off and follow Beta!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin and the hunters follow their robot hunter to the other side of the roof, covering in shadow which should be a good place to stay hidden. Soon they heard a loud booming footstep and its getting closer. The young Drangua checks to see everyone is here, only to sigh as he watches Alanna flailing her arms around to get out of Atomic's hand. It seems everyone is here...Except a certain hunter who is not with them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit...Where's Slick?\" Quentin groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there!\" Danny pointed at Slick laying down sleeping as usual unaware he right in the path of this mysterious person and the footsteps are getting louder and louder. \"I'll get him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Quentin could say anything, Danny activate his Exo-Suit's enhanced speed and dashes across the ground with great speed, leaving a trail of gold light lines. As the womanizer reaches his fellow sleeping hunter, a massive shadow appears before him and Slick, covering their entire spot. Danny looks up and spotted a foot shape object heading towards them and its getting pretty close, so close that he can see the footwear trends...Danny manage to grab Slick before being pushed by a powerful shockwave as the foot stomp to the ground, nearly crush the two hunters. Danny and Slick tumble across the ground until they skid to a stop...and surprisingly awaken  the heavy sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\" Slick yawns, noticing Danny was on the ground near him. \"...You asleep too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if...\" Danny pushes the sloth away as he gets up, wiping the sweat from his forehead. \"Get your lazy ass up and follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Slick! This isn't the time for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Seems I miss you and your friend...A shame really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Danny and Slick heard a loud voice from above, it sounds quite feminine and  has a hint of french accent. Their eyes trail the long legs of the attacker, wearing a purple suit which shows a bit of skin which is strangely bluish. The attacker appears to be a female with long blue hair tied up into a ponytail and seems to be carrying a sniper rifle in her hand. Danny, as usual, can't stop staring at the blue beauty, especially...her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...Dem hips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...What do Petire said every time Danny said something stupid...Oh yes.\" Slick raises his hand and gently slap Danny on the head. \"Now's not the time for that, idiot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh. That wasn't bad...You should do this more often.\" Danny chuckles before hearing a loud click. The two look up again but instead of looking at the beauty, they are now staring at the giant barrel of a rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Whoa there, cutie! Can't we talk over this on a date?\" Danny tries to flirt the gun carrying woman, but she simply smiles and was inches away of pulling the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...At least tell us your name before killing us...\" Slick said while he swirls his finger around behind his back, creating an invisible shield <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Widowmaker...and goodbye.\" The woman said slowly pulling the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is gonna hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Eh, maybe...If only someone will help us poor tiny people...\" Slick sarcastically pleads.   </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s quite dark and gloomy with little light from the large window from above and candles flicker on the stand, giving a more ominous feeling in the atmosphere. The team turns to notice three giant stone like pillars with one statue of a figure holding a sword right near the neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026This place gives me a creep. Let\u2019s just find the target and get out of here!\u201d said Sharper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, ya chubby one. We don\u2019t have the info on our target yet.\u201d said Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that crazy doc better hurry! I\u2019m getting a feeling we\u2019re being watched\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026You know\u2026I believe Sharper might be right. It does feel like we are being watched\u2026.Beta, what\u2019s this location?\u201d Quentin asked the robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHigh Wall of Lothric. I am still gather data of this world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, guess we will wait for the doc to appear and gives us the information on our target. In the meantime, keep your guard up. Something about this place doesn\u2019t feel right\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters nodded in agreement until Danny and Sharper both calling out their names, startling them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! Guys! Look! The door!\u201d Shaper jumps up and down, pointing at the opened doors as it beings to closing itself slowly with gust of winds flowing in, blowing the candles out in progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly hell! This place is haunted!\u201d said Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTch. It\u2019s probably just the wind, you crybabies.\u201d Viz smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026How do you explain the doors closing by itself from the inside with no strong winds a brewing?\u201d Danny pokes on Viz\u2019s forehead. \u201cHell, I ain\u2019t no expert on winds or supernatural crap, but that right there is a good sign of a ghost reside here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph. Well if is a ghost, why don\u2019t it show itself instead of hidden itself, scarring people like a coward?\u201d Viz chuckles and pokes Danny\u2019s forehead with a harder push causing him to stumble a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two hunter arguing, they then heard a dripping sound near the now closed doors and see more of the black like water substance dropping down from above. The team looks up and spotted a massive figure emerges from a black foggy portal, dropping towards the ground. The figure lets out a breathing noise and slowly rising up, turning towards the statues where the hunters are located with a sword cloaked in flames in its hand.  This creature appears to be a female-looking humanoid with impossibly long, slender limbs clad in silver plated armor running up and down her body, with a veil trailing from the head. She has a twisted crown that holds the veil up and a metal grille that covers her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys\u2026What the hell\u2026is that!?\u201d Sharper screams in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Good gravy\u2026B-Beta??\u201d Petire asked Beta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was one of the daughters in a royal family, but was ordered by a man to become a dancer first, and then legionnaire, which is equal to exile. He also gifted her dual blades, infused with darkness and fire, similar to his own weapons\u2026I do believe she became a beast by fate and is now known the Dancer of the Boreal Valley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDancer, huh? But it\u2019s kinda sad she was exile. I wonder-\u201c Quentin notice the Dancer is slowly making her way towards their location, each step she took made a loud clicking sound like woman\u2019s heeled shoe.  \u201cShe\u2019s heading this way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Maybe she didn\u2019t see us and thought she was hearing things\u2026and hopefully she\u2019ll go away.\u201d Shaper stutters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the hunters watches the Dancer\u2019s movement, she quickly lunges her flaming sword towards the NanoCorps without warning! The hunters didn\u2019t have enough time to get out of the way nor was preparing to teleport away, but one hunter is prepare for this situation. Atomic quickly gets in front of the rest and punches the giant flaming sword\u2019s tip, creating a powerful shockwave. The shockwave pushes the hunters behind Atomic back against the stone statue and surprisingly push the Dancer back and falls down on her back, despite being gigantic compare to the hunter\u2019s largest member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGihaha! How do ya like my punch, ya giant bitch!?\u201d Atomic grins while cracking his knuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoo!! Atomic, you rule!\u201d Sharper jumps on the big brute\u2019s shoulder, cuddling him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh I wouldn\u2019t celebrate just yet\u2026\u201d Quentin watches the Dancer gets up again, breathing heavily\u2026it seems she is quite angry them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharper quickly gets down and goes to Slick who was about to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlick! Do NOT fall asleep until we defeat her, understand!?\u201d Sharper grabs Slick\u2019s suit, shaking him violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay\u2026I-I won\u2019t s-s-sleep. L-Let me g-go\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen teleport us behind her now!\u201d Quentin orders the lazy hunter as he sees the Dancer is about to grab the hunters. Slick surrounded his teammates in purple aura before disappearing right before the Dancer slams her hand down, only that her preys got away safely. The NanoCorps reappear behind the Dancer with no one being hurt\u2026only to face the Dancer\u2019s large booty\u2026to Danny\u2019s delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHot Damn! Creepy or not, that girl got some ass!\u201d Danny shouted, only to be slapped by Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh brother\u2026\u201d Quentin sighs.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Dancer slowly turns around to find the hunters behind her and moves slowly and vaguely towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now, Q-man? I hope you got some kind of plan to stop this monster? Petire asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t hide from her. Seems she knows our presence very quickly\u2026.The only thing we can do is fight her head on. She may got some weakness in her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d said Viz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tried attacking her from the distance.\u201d Zeke pulls out his favorite sniper rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll give her a nice and painful punch to the leg!\u201d Atomic roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGuess I\u2019ll take her other leg.\u201d Alanna smiles. \u201cGlenys, use your magic to find her weakness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn it~!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we will distract her!\u201d said Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow!?\u201d Sharper said who is still shaken in fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, my dumb hungry fool. We get on her body and attack her.  Very simple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy for you to say\u2026\u201d Ralph rolls his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus! We are bringing Danny and Slick along!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh joy\u2026\u201d Danny and Slick groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, hunters. You got your orders. Let\u2019s take her down!\u201d With the order from their leader, Quentin and the NanoCorp begins their battle against the giant Dancer which could go down in NanoCorps\u2019 history\u2026if they survive that is.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zeke, using a scope and one of the special bullets, fires his rifle at high speed and hits the Dancer's grille, causing the creature to be stunned and fall back to her knees with one hand touching the grill. With her down to her knees, Atomic begins to strike her from behind, punching her left leg with massive force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dancer grunts in pain and tries to grab the silver monster from behind, but was once again stunned by Zeke's bullet as it hits the side of her head. Petire's group was already teleported onto the Dancer's back, taking cover under the ghostly like veils so they can wait for Quentin's orders. Danny and the Recons equipped themselves with hooks to cling on the creature's armor with Ralph holding Slick and Sharper holding Sasha, much to Danny's disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin, Ryx, Alanna, and Glenys begin their assault on the Dancer's leg, causing little to great amount of pain to the creature.

Commencing Hellstorm.\" Beta summons two heavy missile launchers by his side, firing numerous missiles in the air and heading straight towards its target. The Dancer spotted the missiles and tries to attack Atomic before evading, but she felt the familiar stunning attack from Zeke's bullet, rending her paralyzed. The missiles took a direct hit on the Dancer's sword hand, causing her to bellow in pain, dropping her flame sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got her weapon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, Atomic!

The team heard the wind blowing through the area, making an ominous noise. Luckily, most of the hunters have nerves of steel...except for one hunter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Why on earth did we have to warp here of all creepy places...?\" Sharper hides behind Atomic, shaken with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is where the target is...Unless the doc miscalculated it.\" Quentin sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Quentin. I detected something from the other side...it's a strange one.\" Beta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears to be a humanoid creature...but it's classified as a fragment of Magus. A fragment of wrath according to the recent data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like Viz and Alanna.\" Petire and Ralph laughs for a bit before they were clunk on the head by the annoyed hunters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Continue, Beta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Elana, once a wife to the Sunken King. One day, a man name Sir Yorgh and a group of knights besieged Shulva and defeating the Sunken King. He then release a powerful dragon that wipe out the city using a deadly toxic cloud...Only Elana survives the raging dragon and she was enraged by this, swearing vengeance for those who destroy her city and her beloved husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...So, Elana might be our target then, but what do you mean by 'humanoid creature'?\" said Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it'll be best for us to wait for her to come. Elana is coming to this location now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Beta said, they heard a loud footsteps coming from the other side and a massive figure appears, walking slowly towards the candles that is near the walls. The candles' light shows some of the figure's appearance...Her body is reddish like a walking corpse and her dress appears to be made out of mass of red-colored dead branches, look very similar to her body and carrying a large battleaxe on her right hand with same appearance of her body. The hunters watches the creature carefully with all silent, even covering Sharper's mouth from screaming. Elana walks over the stone wall, placing the axe against it and spoke out in a demonic voice that ,of course, scarring the pants out of Sharper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You were not deserving of the mire...\" The red woman clasp her hands together as if she was praying. \"You... forever you shall rot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words from the red woman actually made Quentin  feel a bit sorry for her...She must be talking to her fallen city and can actually feel her anger...Maybe trying talking to her could help...if not, then they have no choice but to kill her. With a deep sigh, Quentin walks over to Elana, surprising the other hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quentin!? What are you doing!?\" Viz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not going to attack her alone, are you!?\" said Danny, attempting to go with him. Zeke grabs him by the shoulder preventing him to join the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on kid...I think he's gonna talk to her...If things go bad, we will attack her...\" Zeke said with his rifle already out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin, meanwhile, was close enough to the towering red woman, the stench from the dress is pretty foul. The brave Drangua take a deep breathe and begins talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elana!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red woman heard a small voice from behind and quickly turns around while grabbing her greataxe, but not one was there...She heard another voice and it's coming from the ground, Elana looks down and spotted the tiny hunter waving his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the Squalid Queen reacts to the tiny hunter? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

The hunters quickly turn to the loud source, only to be facing a very large shoe shaped object heading towards them. They quickly dive out of the way before the shoe crashes down at the spot they were, blowing the hunters few feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good gravy! That was close!\" Petire said while he and the other two recons got up. Viz got up while holding Esmeralda, protecting her from any debris, the ghost girl blushes as she looks up to her savior before looks away before he notice her blushing face. Atomic, with Slick, Beta, and Glenys on board, walk towards the others with Ryx and Zeke follow behind. Sasha, the last person to follow,  was able to get a description of the target who almost step on them: Reimu, the target's name, has brown-black hair with red ribbon. a traditional miko uniform that Sasha remembers the outfit with a red hakama over a white kimono, white tabi socks and red shoes. She seems to be heading to her bed for a little relaxation for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....Ya rust bucket!

The young Drangua groans, notice something soft around his head and reach out to grab whatever it is, much to everyone shock and Alanna lets out a yelp sound that cause Quentin to quickly pull his head out, facing Alanna's blushing face...Realizing he actually landed on Alanna by accident and grabbing her large breast, Quentin quickly gets up and moves away from her in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A-Alanna! I-I-I am so sorry! I-I didn't mean to grab your...I am sorry!\" Quentin bowing down repeatedly, even gets on the ground with his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, boss. It was an accident...\" Alanna got up and walks over to him before petting him on the head. \"Besides, I wouldn't mind let you touch me...unlike someone I know.\" The elf glares coldly at Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What!? That's messed up! Why can't I touch you!?\" Danny shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's simple and everyone knows it, including Slick: You are a pervert.\" said Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That's cold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!

They also practice sealing and purification rituals, which are highly form-based and symbolic, and are used to bless, purify, or exorcise vengeful spirits\" Beta explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virgins? Well that's a damn shame...and she's kinda cute.\" Danny sighs while looking at Reimu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I rest my case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Zeke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin sighs before ordering Slick to teleport them on Reimu's body, the sloth groans in annoyance and begins surrounding the hunters in glowing purple light before disappearing into thin air, but where would they in up?  </span></div></div>",

Here you'll find your target that is known as Marisa Kirisame.

Speak!\" yelled Viz \"You'll find out..\" said the scientist as the screen turns off. Everyone all stood wondering what he's talking about before Quentin broke the silence. \"Well we can't be standing here can't we? Alright Beta, try to scam this girl named \"Marisa\".\" \"Yes Master Quentin.\" said Beta used his scanners to pinpoint the target's location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about three minutes, Beta finally got the results. \"Well where is she?\" asked Petire. \"Marisa appears to be close, but still far off.\" said Beta \"Explanation please?\" \"There's no need to explain, Master Petire.\" Beta pointed to the left, high above the sky.

The girl stares at the herbs for a minute before sighing in sadness and proceed making a set of herb ale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters watches the girl's movement as she making herb ale, especially her huge feet that is inches away from them.

Again, I suggest we make haste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And unfortunately, Slick is sleeping...Activate your exo-suit speed, rocket boost, etc. We gotta move!\" Quentin orders the hunters while jumping up in the air, sprouting a pair of dragon wings and takes off to the Wingly's pick up spot.

Zeke and Beta activate their rocket boosters from their feet, blasting off into the air and flying over the couch with the ghostly rookie Esmeralda following them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the hunters made it to the edge of the opening ledge and not a moment too soon: The castle's soldiers burst through the door, heading towards the ledge where the hunters are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I didn't except them soldiers to move so quick!\" Petire said while the hunters look for the Wingly. \"Where the hell is that woman!?

The woman holding her hands for the tiny hunters to land on it safely. With the soldiers getting closer to them, the hunters jumps off the ledge, avoiding the stomping guards and landed on the soft surface of the Wingly's palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the tiny passengers in her hands, the Wingly quickly flies away from the castle, avoiding the arrows from the guards and disappears from their sight.   </span></div></div>",

Glenys was about to heal the poor Wingly, but Zeke place his hand on her shoulder, telling her not to heal her until she reveals herself and how did she know about Micro...It does seems pretty fishy for the hunters, but they have no choice but to go along with Micro's plan...for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir thoughts on Micro's plan were interrupt when they felt a slight tremble(earthquake to them) from the woman's body and starts sweating a bit, slowing down her flight speed in progress. If this keep up, this woman would passed out and will take a plunge into the earth, possibly injure the Wingly more or worst. Sighing, Quentin decided to speak to her, hoping to listen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh miss? Maybe it's a good idea to take a rest somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looks down at Quentin with a frown at first, but then her mouth slowly forms a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I forgot you're not little toys. Alright then, little man...Guess I'll..land here and figure what to do with this...strange situation.\" The Wingly notice she is flying over a forest, a good resting spot as long there are no wild vicious monsters or soldiers interrupt her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I agree.

The recons laughs at Viz for blushing...until he slap the three on the heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wingly descend  into the brush green forest, grunting in pain. She spotted a small river streaming down and a nice shaded spot nearby, perfect for her to rest. As the Wingly landed safely, she lets the tiny hunters off her palm before collapsing against the tree, out of breath and sore from her latest fight. This is where the NanoCorps should either heal the mysterious Wingly and get information about her or leave her be and tried contacting Micro so he can explain the situation...</span></div></div>",

But I didn't believe that weirdo.\" Lenus huffs. \"But he was right about one thing: Look for the tiny beings from the top of the castle and here you all are...Itty bitty and fragile enough to be crushed by just about everyone.\" The Wingly smirks before slowly raising her foot, with Danny still clinging on, above the hunters, playfully dangle her foot as she  was about to stomp on them. \"Hehe, don't worry, I'm won't kill you guys.

It appears they are in a dark room with candles lit up to gain some light, a gigantic circular shape clock like object in the back with long and short hands, thinking this might actually be a clock tower or something...But one peculiar object that stands out the rest: Right near the giant clock stairway...a seated woman dressed like a hunter in the old days, sitting motionless with legs crossed with one hand on it while the other dangle off the chair arm and to make it even more interesting...blood stains near the chair and some on her clothes, presumed dead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny hunters, with Sharper being carried due to being scared, slowly make their to the woman's lifeless body, making sure it wasn't a trap set up just for them. As the hunters reach to the giant long boots of the woman, Beta spoke up about the data he just receive, nearly scaring the hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Beta! Next time warn us if ya gonna say something!\" Petire said while slapping the robot on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me. I have acquire data from the deceased woman, her name is Lady Maria or Maria. She was once a hunter who followed the first hunter of Cainhurst, Gehrman and she is related to the queen of Cainhurst, Annalise....That's all I can tell you, not much what happen to her, but I found it quite...strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange...?\" Zeke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you smell the corpses' stench?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww! You want us to smell the dead woman's body!? That's...hold on...\" Alanna takes a big whiff to see the corpse gives off the stench...but it seems she  can't detect any foul smell. \"Whoa...No foul stench?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the blood stains over here looks pretty old...\" Viz crouch down, touching the blood cover floor. \"Yet, no foul stench...Something's not right here, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Keep your guard up, hunters. Who know what kind of traps and tricks that'll sprung up...Pete? Why don't you and the Recon scout up the body?\" Quentin asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa now. You're asking me to climb up a dead woman's body? I don't know...We might disturb the dead. Outta respect the dead, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again with that crap? Just do it, Petire.\" said Viz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Fine...Let's go ya dumbbells.\" Petire drags the scared Sharper with Ralph follow behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll follow you guys.\" Danny spoke up before following the recons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, Danny...Just...don't do anything nasty to her body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...? Oh...Oh! Hell no! What's wrong with you guys!? I'm not gonna fondle with a dead woman, geez!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin simply shrug his shoulders while watching the four hunters hop onto the boot, activating their exo-suits speed boost. They zip upwards at high speed, dodging and past through the hill size cloth and giant buckle and eventually made it to to the woman's knee, also covered in blood. They look up to see what she looks like and Danny instantly fell in love with Maria. She appears to be quite young with blonde hair, her eyes are closed so there's no telling what her eye color is, her skin is somewhat pale and doesn't appear to be a buxon type which disappoint the womanizer, but her beauty alone takes the prize...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Damn! What a cutie! Too bad she's dead...I would've asked her on a date if she's alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" Petire and Ralph roll their eyes while looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the hunters on the floor continue to investigate this weird  situation and waiting for Dr.Micro to call them. Beta then detects a life force coming from the woman's body and it's slowly rising...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Master Quentin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Retrieve Danny and the recons. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I detected a life force from the corpse. I suggest make haste and retrieve Danny and the recons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...Call me crazy, but I felt this woman's life force as well...\" Slick confirms with Beta...and this is quite rare for the sloth to pick up a life force from a dead body  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin orders the hunters except for Slick to get away from the supposedly dead Maria while the two go find the four hunters and escape from the trap, but it seems a bit too late. The woman's hand quickly scoops the four hunters off her leg, lifting them up close to her face and her quick reaction cause Quentin and Slick to back away from Maria. The woman opens her gloved hand, staring down with her cold eyes at the ones who disturb her slumber, the recons was startle by the sudden movement of her. Danny, however....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Damn, she's alive! Hey, cutie! How about you and me go on a date and get to know each other?\" Danny flirts with the woman before being slapped on the head by Petire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... A corpse...should be left well alone.\" Lady Maria's soft voice, though thunderous to the tiny hunters, spoken. Her surprisingly minty breath blows down upon them, barely hanging on to the cloth of her glove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In-Indeed...W-We have learn our lesson...right fellas?\" Petire said with the other two nodded quickly except for Danny, dazed at the woman's cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman slowly gets off of the chair, now towering over the hunters on the floor. Her boots alone can wipe them out in an instant, only if Atomic wasn't around. The hunters gets their weapons out, ready to fight the giant woman and try to rescue the other hunters from her clutches...Maria crouches down into front of the hunters and lowers her hand so the four hunters can regroup with the others, Petire and the others look at each before getting off her hand quickly, regrouping with their teammates while the giant woman stands back up. Quentin is glad that the woman let's them go without any harm, but they are not out of the woods yet...The NanoCorps and Lady Maria stare at each other down to see who's gonna make a move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

The ghostly Esmeralda summons her chains, wrapping around the giant weapon while Atomic jumps into the air, ready to attack Maria's face. Maria saw the tiny silver hunter and about to cut him with her other sword, but didn't notice the chains wrapping around it, pinned on the ground. The confuse hunteress looks at her weapons being chain up and tries to break it free, but the chains are pretty durable despite being small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lady! You forgot someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria quickly turn her focus on Atomic but the silver brute is upon on her and punches against her right cheek of her face, causing her to yell out in pain and pushes away the hunters a few feet, losing her swords as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one, Atomic!\" Petire cheering fro the brute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gihaha! Not so tough without your weapons, huh!?\" Atomic landed beside the hunters, laughing at Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Maria spits out a little blood before staring at the tiny hunters in a rather...curious look, not even quite angry at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...You tiny creatures...have peek my interest...\" Maira said before slowly walking up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...That's sorta good, I guess. Hunters, try to keep her away from the weapons and watch out for any tricks she go.\" Quentin orders the hunters, getting into their positions: Atomic, Alanna, Ryx, and Viz take the front as the Block,  Zeke, Beta, Glenys and Slick moves to the back as the Rear Guard, The Three Recons take the left side while Sasha and Danny take the right side, know as the Intrusions, and Quentin gets in front of Esmeralda know as the Knight's Guard.

It made her sick... the very reason she had cast her rakuyo away... the very same that she held now, thanks to the dream she resided in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYlva, seeing the woman glaring at her, raised her ears to attention. \"We are... mercenaries. Not hunters. But... how did you know?\" She asked, lowering her ears instinctively, trying to be submissive so as not to invoke the woman's wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of you smell like blood... every hunter I see is drenched in the scent of blood... beast blood.\" She said, before her eyes flicked to athanasia, just out of happen-stance.

Though it was old... it smelt more intoxicating than any that had crossed her senses before. It was intoxicating to her. More than any alchohol or wine she had tasted.

She would have gone and checked on her friend, if not for Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had seen this kind of thing enough. She had to take the initiative and catch her. With almost superhuman speed, she reached down, and snatched the woman up, taking everyone by surprise. They all took out their weapons. \"Hey!\" Said Crystal, a knee jerked yell from seeing her friend taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they'd all see soon that athanasia was not in the right state of mind. \"Rrrr... let.... let me go!!!\" She said, struggling against Marias gloved hand, still looking at the spilt cup. The warmth she felt around her was nothing compared to the draw of the blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you calm down. The blood is sweet, but do not let it take you.\" She said, trying to talk her down out of going blood-drunk like she had so many of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthanasia responded. \"No!! Let me go!! I'm fine! Rrrr...!\" That blood was too sweet. She -had- to get to it. And that's when she activated her shadow powers. She blended herself with the nearest shadow, fusing with it. But the nearest shadow.... was the darkness under Marias clothes. She was spread across all of Marias body, able to feel every inch of Marias body. She was formless as the darkness under her clothes, but she could still feel things. Things like the heat from being so close to her skin, and the heat trapped under her clothes. She could feel... -everything-. Marias chest, the curve of her rear... and even the very private spot between her legs. And the worst part is... she was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria blinked, not knowing where she had gone, opening her empty hand. She looked left, right, even turning her body to scan the room, which just ended up forcing athanasia to feel Marias nude body pushing against her and shaping the darkness she had become... and Maria had no idea. \"What? Where did she go?\" She said, looking back down to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was just staring with his mouth open. \"L-....lucky....\" was all he could whisper under his breath. </span></div></div>",

Though it didn't seem to be quiet enough, because the hunter's superhuman senses seemed to pick it up, as she looked towards him, shifting her weight to her other foot... which made her hips push right into athanasia. The vampiress could even feel the cheeks on that rear end shift as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend was going out of control. I was already going to try and put her somewhere if I couldn't talk her down... this way, it's simple enough to give her a time out.\" She said, crossing her arms. \"I've seen too many people's lives taken because of that blood lust...I took my own life because of the my past sins.\" She said, reaching up and pointing at the trail of blood on her throat, despite the wound not being there at all. \"something like this is nothing compared to keeping that from happening again.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...\" said crystal. When she put it like that, it made perfect sense. She turned to Sasha. \"Sasha...?\" She asked, looking down at the smaller woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha sighed, placing a hand on her hips. \"I've... had to do this a few times. And sush, not a word from you, danny. Your stare tells me everything.\" She said, before speaking. \"This is easy to do but hard to get out of. There's a reason I usually do it with someone's shadow on the ground and not attached to them. The shadow on the ground is always fully exposed to the open. But when it's inside of clothes, it's almost never exposed. So... the only thing you can do, is wait for yourself to be fully exposed, or transfer to someone else's shadow.... from inside of their clothes.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that means...\" Ylve trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha nodded. \"Either strip, or send someone in. And considering I've already confirmed the door behind us is locked from the outside, we'll be here for both.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria thought about it, and said...</span></div></div>",

Athanasia felt the woman's rear end sitting down on her, and it only increased when Maria crossed one leg over the other out of habit, hands in her lap. It was a rare moment of clarity for her in this dream. If only someone could come along and end this nightmare. She reached out, and took the photo on the table, gazing at it. Many things were running through her thoughts, but she simply put it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthanasia was... well, she was almost completely blocked from the outside world. The scent of that intoxicating aroma had been replaced, completely and fully, with the scent of Maria's body. It had just the most subtle hint of that intoxicating blood... but mostly it was a different kind of blood. It was enough to... well, not calm down completelt, but it changed her thoughts from the blood, to the body that she was constantly being pushed against. The body that was sitting on her, pushing her chest into her as she moved, and catching her between her thighs as she crossed her legs... all at the same time. The intoxication of that blood was forgotten... in favor of a much lesser, much less frenzy-causing intoxication of the body that she surrounded, and the subtle scent of blood about her. She'd just brushed off Danny's comments before, but maybe she could get together with this woman and grab a bite to drink on a date together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlick blinked in surprise as he sensed her thoughts and that she had calmed down... in a sense. \"Err... I think she's calmed down now... just be careful getting her out. She might be...\" Oh boy, that would be a lot of work to explain. \"....ahh, nevermind. I thought it was something, but it wasnt.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha nodded, taking charge as she was the expert in this situation.

The Primordials?\" said Danny before looking at the hunters for any explanation about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about them, though not much, they are the ageless creators of universe and the planet we are on now.

With that settle, we can find Tisiphone and 'kill' her to please Dr. Micro and get out of this world.\" Quentin said before he the group moves on towards the foot of the Apollo. However...Unknown to the bounty hunters, they were being watched by the two Furies, floating near the offshore of the island...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amusing....Seems these tiny creatures are after you, Tisiphone.\" The Fury said while Tisiphone laughs at her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those little creatures are not a threat to me, dear sister. They are not worthy enough to be stains under my foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...But the way they appear here and dressed is rather quite intriguing...and I doubt they are allies of the 'traitor'...Do whatever you like to them, but don't kill them just yet. I want to see them myself, right after I deal with the 'traitor'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha...I'm going to enjoy playing the little ones, especially the one who attach to me... \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fury flies down to the island while the other Fury headed off to the other direction.

You mean he and that assassin...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are shock as you are, doc...\" Ralph roll his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Well then...You know her info and skills correct?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I want to know how did you track her?\" Zeke asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"It's not that easy I'll tell you that, but once I able to trace her usual place and spotted her, I was able to plant her a bug before it was discover. Now with that done, good luck hunters, this silent lady is gonna be pretty tough for you...Mwhahaha!\"</span> The doctor laughs before he signs off, leaving Zeke in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...We don't have to kill your sweetheart, Zeke. Maybe she'll understand when we find her or find us.\" Quentin grins while patting on Zeke's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, thanks kid. We can fool the doc by sending her blood to him and a piece of cloth or something from her...Right now we need to find her.\"  The hunters begin looking for any traces of the silent assassin until Beta alerted them that Whisperer is...   <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

I never seen a huntress this beautiful!...Ahem... She is a tall ageless human/demon with slender yet....curvaceous figure, very large round breasts with matching hips and a beauty mark on her left side of the chin...such a hottie...Ahem!. O-On her right arm is covered in ancient demon's language and her right eye is part demon instead of regular human eye. Her very long, messy red hair that reaches almost to the floor with black colored on the tip kinda why they called her Crimson Demon...He choice of clothing is....yummy: Long black trench coat with demonic design that only buttoned between lower chest and belly button, black hunter hat, black bikini top and mini-skirt, and thigh high heel boots...Kinda like those hunters, NanoCorps, usually wears. Maybe they know her? Probably not...But it's a shame she has to be dead, mwhahahaha! <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: From what I heard: She used to be a gentle and kind woman back in a day, but something...trigger her. Viewing the humans as selfish greedy...ahem 'pigs', Prosperine is now fueled by rage and anger and will definitely kill them without hesitation and to make matter worst...someone killed her human mother, making her rage fueled even more, changing into a demonic being and rampage throughout the land, calling it the 'Crimson Massacre' ...Well sheesh, she's beautiful yet...downright terrifying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: Since she's born as a demon spawn, she may possess demonic powers...I think. she can create her own weapons, but her favorite ones are the shotgun and sword combo and...that's pretty much it.

The demoness smiled coldly when hearing the townsfolk scream once more, enjoying every scream she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the demoness returns to her cavern home for the night, she catches something sparkle across her eye, stopping right on the tracks. She watches the tiny bright light begins to grow a little larger and spotted what appears to be little figures coming out of the light.

The hunters quickly move out of the way before the demoness landed upon them. Chuck of snow spread as she landed, heading directly towards the tiny hunters and they quickly dispose the falling debris. The hunters looks up at the towering figure that tries to crush them...and they were awe at the sight of the woman, mainly Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Dr.Micro said about her, she really is downright beautiful and wearing a revealing clothing is enough for Danny to go crazy in love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Damn!

Zeke quickly throes out a flash bang at her exposing red eye, bursting with light and blinding the raging she-demon, grunting in pain and stumbling backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's blinded! What's the plan, Q-man!?\" Alanna shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her down and hopefully she'll calm down!\" Quentin said while ordering Atomic and Alanna to bring the giantess to her knees.</span></div></div>",

One of my agents tells me there are  recruits that will be joining T.U.F.F and you must be them!...Though I am unaware that they are quite small like me...Well mostly the big silver looking one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What you trying to-\" Atomic was about to pound the flea, but was stopped by Quentin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse our big friend here...He's a bit sensitive about his size. Anyway, yes we are the recruitment for T.U.F.F and uhh...We were...Born small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Born small eh...? Works for me! Welcome to T.U.F.F!\" The flea extends a handshake, Quentin grins and shakes his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turbo Undercover Fighting Force.\" said Beta<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct. You are well inform for a new recruit. Follow me, rookies. One of my best agents will give you the tour once she arrive...Oh yes, I'm The Chief of T.U.F.F Headquarters.\" The Chief said while hopping towards the large furniture as the 'recruits' follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...You're the Chief? Interesting...\" Sharper said while trying not to laugh out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...Oh I didn't know you are the chief! Well met.\" Petire grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chief jumps on the counter with the hunters follow pursuit, as the hunters waiting for this agent, they heard a loud noises outside the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! They have arrived.\" The Chief informs the hunters. They notice a feminine figure enter the building, coughing up smoke. This person appears to be a humanoid female cat with wide lime green eyes and tan fur. She has mid-length, wavy black hair and wears a  black suit and belt while her headband, sweater, gloves, and boots are white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agent Kitty Katswell! Just in time for-Wait...Where's Agent Puppy?\" The Chief asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Unfortunately, Dudley press the wrong button and cause the car to explode...Again. Keswick is out searching for him, who know where he wound up.\" Kitty explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As usual for Agent Puppy...Anyway, we got new recruits! Come over here and introduce yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty wipes off all the smoke and dust off her clothes while heading to the chief and the hunters location. As Kitty saw the new recruits, she was quite surprise to see very small people who is barely the same size as the chief except the silver person...who is quite imitating. The hunters, meanwhile, were in awe of Kitty's looming face and those pretty green eyes, enough to make Danny drooling over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh Chief...I didn't expect the new recruits to be...Small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either, but they sure do look tough, especially that silver guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you said so...Hi there! My name is Kitty Katswell: One of the greatest agent in T.U.F.F.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings. I'm Quentin Andross, I'm the leading one of the group along with my sharpshooter and vice leader: Zeke.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, m'lady\" Zeke bows down with such gentleman attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agent Katswell. You will give a basic tour around the T.U.F.F HQ for the rookies while I attended to a very serious business in my office...\" said the Chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watching Quacky the Duck, of course! They about to show us how to defuse a bomb once more-with a spoon!\"The Chief then pulls a hat that shapes like a duck and hops away to his office, leaving Kitty alone with the hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty mutters softly about watching the show before looking at the hunters with a smile on her face. Giving the tour with the tiny recruits should be a piece of cake...Unaware to her that she is actually the NanoCorp's target and will strike when ready...However, the hunters decided to play along until it is time. Extended her gloved hand to offer a ride, the hunters climb aboard her hand, readying themselves for a tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The person who lives there is a sinister and sadistic man, who enjoys the pain and suffering of the planet Mobius, along with three of his henchmen. That man name is Dr. Ivo Robotnik, an evil genius who bent on taking over Mobius, but thanks to a certain teenage hero, his plans has been foiled. Today was much like other days: Failing to destroy his nemesis and yelling at the three henchmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You nincombots! What happen to my brrrilliant traps!?\" Robotnik yelling at his henchmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uhh...You see, Your Rottenness...We did set it up just like you said but...\" The tall chicken robot Scratch said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But uhh...Sonic was able to avoid them, so we start chasing them...\" The short tank like robot Grounder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the two idiots ended up caught on your traps...With me included!\" The monkey robot Coconuts said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my fault! It was Scratch that got us into the trap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! It was yours and Coconuts fault!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up! I didn't even help you with those traps!\" The three robots bickering each other who's fault is it until Robotnik stops them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!!!\" The three quickly shuts their mouth up, knowing they are in deep trouble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should of dump you three dumbbots into a melting pot ages ago! But luckily for you, I just got an idea to destroy that pesky blue rrrat once and for all! So pay attention, you brrainless crretins!\" As the evil genius begins telling the three bots his next plan, a mysterious laughter appears on Robotnik's computer, scaring the three and Robotnik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What was that!?\" Scratch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming from the computer...\" Grounder said as the four moves closer to the computer before the computer turns on, revealing a  man wearing a long white lab coat, black gloves and shoes. He wears a hood and appears to have bandage around his face, unable to view his face and a black goggles and appears to be laughing at the four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Mwahahaha! Hello, Dr. Ivo Robotnik! So glad to see you...\"</span> The mysterious man said while laughing evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you and how did you hack into my computer!?\" Robotnik said, demanding an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I am Dr. Van Micro, the great genius in my world...I was hoping you could me and my hired hunters on a mission.\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to help you, another evil genius!? Forget it! I already have enough geniuses for one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Perhaps we can strike a deal...If you can help the hunters, they might give you some very advanced techs that could help you defeat Sonic the Hedgehog...A VERY powerful advanced techs.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....Sounds promising but I need a little more info on those hunters.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Well, one of the hunters is a really big monster with incredible strength and another one is a robot with powerful weapons...Much advance than your three robots.\"</span> The doctor laughs at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was mean...\" Grounder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm interested...Very well, but you better be telling the truth or I will find you and strangling you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Mwhahaha! Excellent choice...Enter here and you'll meet the hunters...In a different view.They will explain once you meet them.\"</span> The doctor summons a bright portal besides the computer before the doctor laughs and signs off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...Perhaps the doctor could be a worthy ally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until you betray them, your evilness\" said Scratch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...But for now we better get into the portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh how do you know if its working or not?\" said Grounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why we need a test dummy...And I know the perfect one!\" Robotnik grabs Grounder's drill nose, bringing him in front of him. He then kicks the tank robot into the portal while Scratch and Coconuts laughs at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit laughing and get in there, nincombots!\" The doctor grabs Scratch's beak and Coconuts's tail before throwing them into the portal and follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the NanoCorps, the hunters are being informed by Micro in a building filled with equipment for music. Apparently they are targeting a country singer name     Catty Carlisle...and Viz doesn't like it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunting a singer...That's a load of bullshit...\" Viz said.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><br>\r\n\"Now, now...To make this more interesting, I asked four people to join you on this mission...I kinda promise you'll be helping them.\"</span> The doctor laughs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of promise...?\" Quentin said, knowing it's not a good one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Oh you'll see! Now good luck hunters and tell Robotnik 'good luck' as well!\"</span> Micro laughs before signing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robotnik...? Who is-\" Petire was cut off when a similar portal appears before them and a robot came flying out of the portal, hitting Sharper into the ground follow by two other robots. The hunters checks the robots out, along with Sharper who is still pinned under the green tank robot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you idiots at!?\" A loud voice coming from the portal. A large man steps out of the portal, already fuming at his henchmen. \"There you are, you rust buckets! Now where is that-Oh?\" Robotnik spotted the hunters who is quite confuse of what's going on here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the hunters and he is telling the truth.\" Robot said while eyeing on Atomic and Beta. \"Greetings, my friends. I am Dr. Ivo Rrrobotnik, I am here to help you on this mission you are on, but I must ask: Why are we small!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...We are small thanks to Dr. Micro's device, it giving  us a challenge since we complete our mission with no failures.\" said Quentin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No failures...? Hmmm...Then perhaps you should help me once this is over...I have a 'pest' problems that I can't get rid off, but I'll explain it later. Now what is this mission you are doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are hunting our target by the name of Catty Carlisle, know her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know her? I hate that country singer!
