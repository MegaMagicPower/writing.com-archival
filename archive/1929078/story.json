Kari finished the pie and rubbed her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTai tasted better than he looked fat.\u201d Kari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and found Sora.

Sora noticed that her friend enjoyed herself with Tai and had a quick \u2018snack\u2019 afterward. The girls started to feed the boys with the food that Sora had made while Kari was taking care of Tai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, what did you do to our little Tai anyway?\u201d Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, after you left, I made sure Tai was nice and fat before cooking him up in a nice pie.\u201d Kari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls hand feed the boys and fed them big hand full\u2019s of food. When TK felt like he was going to explode. He started to cry in pain from all the food the girls were feeding him. Kari made sure he kept eating as she evilly laughed. Sora kept feeding large amounts of handfuls to Matt. Matt started to scream at her to stop feeding her but she didn\u2019t. They fought the girls for a while longer until they were unable to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you keep eating TK, I\u2019ll give you a special treat later.\u201d Kari said evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK kept crying but knew that she can be trusted. He didn\u2019t stop crying but he kept eating everything Kari fed him. When TK\u2019s belly wasn\u2019t able to take much more so Kari rubbed it a bit. She laughed evilly again and forced him to eat more. When TK wasn\u2019t able to take much more, his belly button popped out and Kari poked it. She then shrank him down to fit onto the top of the pizza she was going to make. Kari kept a tight grip on small TK in one hand and made the pizza on the other. She found it convenient for his small baseball size and hoped he doesn\u2019t lose it on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished the first layer of cheese done, Kari put TK on it and made sure he filled out the pizza. He struggled to get out but Kari put a thick layer of cheese on and it was super sticky from how thick and melted it is. Kari smiled at him and made him a little bigger. When TK filled out the pizza enough, she made Matt finish the pizza. He kept screaming not to cook him but Kari and Sora forced him to do so and put him into the oven. He tried to escape but Sora tied him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe smells delicious. I can\u2019t wait until we get to Matt here.\u201d Sora said. \u201cJust like Tai, I want you to eat him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora patted her friends belly and liked how it jiggled. Kari took the TK pizza out and put the final toppings on before putting it back into the oven to finish. TK was somehow still alive and bubbling up. Kari watched him bubble up until he was about to pop. When the cheese was golden yellow and the crust was a crisp brown, Kari pulled the pizza out and smelled it. She poked it a bit to make sure it was ready and TK was gone. She then cut it into pieces. She offered a couple to Sora but she wanted Kari to eat it. She was still a little full from having the wonderful Tai pie she had earlier but at it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple slightest, Kari looked at Matt and forced him to eat a couple. Matt didn\u2019t like it and soon felt like he was going to explode. Sora had a piece and liked it. She had a couple more before letting Kari eat the rest.</span></div></div>",

It felt like it was coming just below her stomach in her young womanhood. Sora told her that she feels the same thing and got an idea. Despite being young, they would fill their hunger away that any other woman would do. They kept the boys tied up while they got stripped. The girls got down undressed in front of them and rod their members for a while. They then went back to stuffing the boys. Instead of putting their clothes back on, Kari and Sora used their figures on the boys by only dressing them and feeding them more pies and burgers.

She weighed herself and the scale read she was at 300 pounds. Most of her weight is on her belly and butt but she didn\u2019t mind it for she knew she was going to get fatter. Sora went off somewhere without telling her leaving only her to take care of Matt. Every day, Kari fed Matt a boat load of food and made sure they were super fattening. Matt lost all hope in being saved by Tai now and just gave in to his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just the best looking one yet.\u201d Kari said. \u201cMuch better than your brother TK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari finished feeding one evening, Kari rubbed Matt\u2019s large belly. She guessed he had to be at least 500 pounds, if not fatter. She knew he will be as great as his older brother, maybe even tastier than TK. His large belly was completely exposed and was shiny form all the sweet on it. Kari licked his belly and loved how it tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re about ready for my stomach.\u201d Kari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t eat me. I\u2019ll do what you want.\u201d Matt pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should have thought of that before you and TK tried to escape with that traitorous Tai.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari got him down to nothing and had some fun with him. She knew that by eating him, he wouldn\u2019t get the pleasure to actually \u2018pleasure\u2019 a woman when older or \u2018fill her other hunger\u2019 or have a family. So she played with his young member and let him relieve himself into her. When she had her fun on him, she went back to stuffing him the next day. After a couple more days, Kari knew he was ready. Going over her list, Kari decided to eat him as\u2026</span></div></div>",
