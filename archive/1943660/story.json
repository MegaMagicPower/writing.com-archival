A triviality that only services to swell my anger and disgust even further. The deafening bass barrages my ear drums while sending gentle vibrations coursing through the floor and dry wall. The entire apartment complex can probably hear them, but they're not saying anything. Why would they? The cops have abandoned them and speaking out without support just leaves you battered as a response. Today will be different.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I've been standing at this door for ten minutes now, my heart thundering with every beat as my brain tries to reason with me.  Tell me how stupid this is. It's not stupid. It's absolutely necessary. It's because of them I've lost everything. It's because of them Jackie died with a needle in his arm. And it's because of them that Ashley doesn't talk anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n No more waiting. My glock stirs nervously in my coat pocket, concealed and fully loaded. At most there are six punks in there, at least four of them are chasing.the dragon, which leaves the dealer and his muscle who have their wits about them,. James Roy, but everyone calls him Turk. A violent sociopathic drug dealing neo-nazi with ties to the Hell Raisers biker gang. He deals in crack, meth, and heroine. He garners a reputation of hard cruelty and reckless brutality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Today he dies.</span></div></div>",

Nagging doubts assailed my will, by determination prevailed as I recounted everything I had endured in the face of crime's nihilistic savagery. There is no where to go but forward when everything behind you is on fire. I noticed the music dampen considerably before the door cracked open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A pair of narrow eyes stared at me unscrupulously, below those dull green orbs he wore the bitter scowl of a man in his mid twenties. He was bald, but his scalp was stained with black tribal designs. He wore a sweat soiled wife beater and a pair of black trousers. A pistol was unceremoniously wedged between his stomach and pant line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The months toil's took their toll on me. A red and irritated crown of puffed up skin surrounded my eyes . My skin was pale and malnourished. A thick black hoodie encased my muscled form.  I looked like a customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What the fuck do you want?\"</span></div></div>",

Right now it's up in the air if they know someone is trying to get in. The music drowns out the my strike, but anyone attentive enough would know someone is hitting the door. Mustering all my energy into my legs I deliver a forceful kick that topples the door outward. My hand clutches so tightly around my pistol I can feel my knuckles go white. I plunge myself into the room, stabbing myself into the heart of danger, my ears bearing the full burden of Jame's horrible garbled music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The living room is a mess. Empty beer bottles, pizza boxes, and other refuse litter the brown carpeted floor. His shelves and tables support the same refuse, but also hold the elaborate speaker system that's been pounding out that God awful music. The room is adorned with various music posters I receive a dull eyed glance from a tattooed scarred dope fiend on the couch. My pistol immediately gives him alarm, spurring him to reach for his revolver on the table, but in a haze he clumsily misses and knocks over his pipe. My lungs work to draw in a gasp of air as I steady the tremors in my hands and squeeze the trigger.  A muzzle flash briefly illuminates the dim room as the bullet travels before punching a dime sized hole into the junkie's brain. He's dead. Holy fuck he's dead. My heart pumps ice into my veins and for a moment I don't know if I'm feeling nausea or ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Adrenaline courses through my body like electricity, as my body instinctively pivots to meet a form coming out from the bathroom.  A large broad shouldered man in a stark white wife beater stares out stupidly in surprise. I level the gun at his skull and give the trigger another squeeze. The round's impact catches him in the eye, bursting the orb and creating a dark red crevice. He falls limp to the floor, like a marionette with its strings severed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n My body poised for combat and accuracy I travel to the center of the room, making note of the bearded neo-nazi sleeping face down on a rug. I unceremoniously decommission him with another blast of my glock before moving on to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <i>'Clear.'  </i> I confirm to myself, checking the blind spots. Only two more rooms to go, but first...</span></div></div>",
