Sitting down on the cold tile floor, you raised your hand to your head. It felt like you had a bad hangover or something. Everything was still hazy, but you tried to remember what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your name is Kara Maidenhead. You're 16, turning 17 in only a few months. Yeah, that sounds right. The last thing you remembered was your mother dropping you and your sister off at the front of the mall so she could find somewhere to park. You and your sister had shot ahead into the mall to find your friends. Claire had run off somewhere to do something, leaving you in the mall square\u2026 it was a circle, but whatever. You walked over to a somewhat secluded spot to sit down, and all the sudden you woke up like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking around, you attempt to get your bearings. Everything was towering over you at giant proportions. Laughing to yourself you try to sit up, thinking that you were still laying on the floor\u2026. But you were sitting up. Panicking, you shoot to your feet, which didn't change much. Looking around, you couldn't be no taller than six inches. You stumble back down into a sitting position, having a small\u2026 no, major panic attack. You sat there for about 20 minutes, trying to figure out what happened. Eventually though, you realized you needed to get up and find help. The people around you were humongous. You went to nervously pick at your necklace, but couldn't feel it. Looking down, you were naked as the day you were born. Covering up your naked self, you looked around for your presumably giant clothes, but they were nowhere insight. You stuck to the side of the wall, thinking where you could go to get help. Everything was about equal distance from where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cafeteria would be a good way to be seen, but being so small you might get stepped on and trampled. You were supposed to meet your friends there before you went shopping. Off to your right there was a clothing/lingerie store. You would definitely stick out there, but again being trampled would probably be the biggest problem there, unless you went into the back room where they fixed all the broken items and maybe find a scrap cloth to cover yourself with. It was Amelia's work, but she would have to push last her problems with you to help you\u2026 yeah most likely not. There was a doll store off to your left for collectable items. Probably the best place to get fitting clothes, and best place to get mistaken for one of them. Across the mall was a popular\u2026. Martial relief store. There you could get the attention of anyone in there. Though that might not be a good thing if they are into that sorta thing. And finally, you could attempt to make it outside and to your mom's car, though the risk of getting lost was very high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After debating on it for a few minutes, you sucked it up and started to make your way carefully towards\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mall looked above you. Normal people now giants compared to you. Seeing enough Sci-Fi shows and movies to learn the tropes and dangers, approaching one of these mighty strangers might have you a fate as the smear on a floor, or worse\u2026 as someone's pet. Not wanting that to be the case, you stuck to the side of the wall, ducking behind plants and benches, trying to stay out of sight. The mall's air-conditioning was too effective at this size, and you were freezing. Reaching for your phone to try to call someone, your hand rubs against bare skin, reminding you that you've lost all your belongings. You covered yourself the best you can as you made your way around the fountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looming above you was the Doll store. Inside, you could see children and adults alike, browsing the store's packaged dolls. You'd been inside the store only once before to apply for a job there. The only things you knew is that they were the most popular store in your town for dolls. They were very very well made, almost realistic down to having mechanized movement and small speakers. The skin was still a little rubbery, but the high end ones collectors well\u2026 collected were near perfect skin texture. Your mother and friends visited here often, your mother being a so-called collector. It was almost creepy how much she treated the dolls as real too. She would often have different dresses she would have them in, claiming that they were going to be worth quite the penny someday, so she had to keep them in pristine condition. You knew this fact to be false, because some of her dolls would almost seem wet some days, like they were submerged in water and left to air dry, often smelling quite weird too. You never said anything, assuming it was a sort of polish or glue, and left them on her shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gathering up some courage, you snuck into the store, hugging the wall yet again. You were nearly stepped on by a woman's high heel as you passed by the cashier's desk, only dodging it by the skin of your teeth. She was drop dead gorgeous, most definitely a model in her business casual outfit and long flowing red hair. You'd rather not be a Kara on a stick today. The store was enormous! You could see the walls lined with shelves stacked with dolls in boxes. On the wall closest to you, you could see that some of the dolls were encased in a semi see-through plastic sheet, you guessed they were the more expensive dolls, and the thick plastic was to keep people from tearing them open. From a guestimation, you could probably fit into some of their clothing if you squeezed yourself into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The backroom was most likely your best option of getting noticed as you would find spare clothes, people who have to pay attention to equipment, so if you got on top of one, you'd be easier to be noticed. Another choice would be to climb into the cashier's desk. She was in her early thirties, dark brown hair swept past her shoulders, attractive as most people would label her, but she might be your second best bet of spotting you. The lady who nearly spiked you earlier had set her purse down as she was admiring some dolls. You could easily slip into it and get her attention as she went to pay. Then finally, you spotted a doll under a shelf next to a open box. A shelf had fallen, knocking it's entire contents into the floor below. The doll had slid out of the box and it's twist tie restrains. You could quickly grab her clothes before anyone spotted you so you wouldn't be so naked. Though you had to be careful not to be trampled by the employee that was cleaning up the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You had to make a decision fast, and before thinking about it, you spring towards\u2026.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Born a normal girl, Kara's life is turned upside down after her mom takes her and her sister shopping at the mall the day before her sister leaves for Europe. Shrunken down to 6 inches tall and at a somewhat malleable state, she's forced to endure the wrath of unaware friends, family, and strangers as she tries to find the person who's shrunken her and return back to normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara Maidenhead (16) (You) Your typical highschool teenager obsessed with her grades and making friends, you quickly rose to be a shining example at your school and in your community as you've helped more than needed, wanting to make the world a brighter place. Easily one of the more popular kids in school, you could charm your way through just about anything. Not really interested in relationships or boys in general to get in the way might have helped that too; Not that you had any problems finding one, but just not interested at the moment. You share the same Blonde hair and electric blue eyes as your twin sister, which has caused a few times where they have mistaken you for one another. Made it a tad bit awkward meeting your sister's now ex boyfriend for the first time though. Even your mother has difficulty telling you two apart at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren Maidenhead (33) (Mom) Curvy, blonde hair, and green eyes, just taller than you and your sister, and the sweetest innocent person you've ever met, your mother is a wonder woman. Giving birth to you and your twin sister at the young age of 17, your mother had a bit of rough time, but managed to get through it thanks to your dad. Starting off as a teacher for the local highschool, which is now your school, she's now your science teacher, the gym coach, and sometimes the Sex Ed teacher. Constantly on her feet, she barely ever sits down. If things weren't bad enough with the sucky pay, she loved your dad with all of her heart, and when a drunk driver took him away from her, you, and your sister a few years ago, she vowed she would never remarry, caring for you and your sister all on her own. The only reason she still teaches there is the joy she gets from teaching the youth. You don't know how she's able to do it all these years, but she still makes time for you and your sister. Though, sometimes you can see through a crack in her smile, a darker side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire Maidenhead (16) (Sister) Claire wasn't as popular as her sister, and mostly resented her for all of the attention she got, though would enjoy it whenever someone mistook her for her sister, playing it out to see how far she could take it. She's big into theater and lives to put on a performance. Recently, she's received a scholarship to travel to Europe for 6 months on a performance arts exchange program. Combined with her \"older sister\"'s popularity, and being picked for most of the schools plays, she easily earned it. Though she loved to watch her sister squirm when she messed with her, but always acted innocent when someone questioned her, getting away with it every time. She's become best friends with your bully Amelia. She seems to be planning something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara \"Bibi\" Sinclair (16) A natural bombshell that's skinny, red head, green eyes with large breasts that happens to be one of your best friends. Not on the top of the cheerleading pyramid, but close enough. She's got the classic cheerleading personality. Not the sharpest tool in the shed, but at least she's passing. Beautiful as she is ditsy, she's usually followed around by some poor sap trying to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine Keyes (18) (other best friend) Your Raven black haired, Hazel eye colored, llama loving, flirtatious best friend with curves in all the right places with boobs to rival Bibi's. She has dated guys and girls alike. As fiery as she seems on the outside, she's very loving and caring deep down\u2026 like deep deep down there somewhere. You two became good friends after she saved you from her younger sister. Being put into awkward situations with her isn't out of the norm either, some almost getting out of hand before you catch yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Hound (41) (Teacher) Easily one of your favorite teachers besides your mom, she's sweet until someone drives her mad. She's a little lazy, usually teaching from a sitting down position. Her and your mother sometimes hang out after school, occasionally seeing her at your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia Keyes (17) (Bully) Mean. No other way to put it. She's constantly picking on you and pulling cruel pranks on you. It all stemming from you rejecting her at the beginning of highschool. She's even gone so far to trying to open your locker to put glue on the insides of your panties, thankfully she didn't, because that wasn't even your locker, it was your mother's. You safely keep your stuff hidden away in her office. She's somewhat nerdy, getting straight A's in almost every class. She works part time in a lingerie store, specifically the sewing section in the back to repair torn pieces<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything goes, just try to keep it f/f<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to write more than a descriptive paragraph on chapters, one sentence chapters will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease grammar check and make the chapters readable.
