At 4'6\", he is a 16-year-old prodigy of science who was allowed to enter college at 12 years old and finish his Ph.D in Biology in FOUR years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNewspapers covered the talents of this exceptional boy and he was offered all sorts of research grants and company offers. Everyone wanted him, but there was only one thing he was interested in...growth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, he wanted to grow himself and shed out of this 4'5\" shell that had caused him increasing annoyance. In every instance where he needed something, he needed someone's help to grab a cup from a cabinet, getting some special chemicals from his cooler, needing help whenever he couldn't see a large sign, and the list goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but no more. After months of laborious efforts and critical thinking, he finally produced a serum that will exhibit growth. He had tested on all sorts of animals: mice, monkeys, hamsters, and all of them had exhibited fantastic growth that was neither excessive nor little. He could easily grow to 6\"4' by his math in a matter of days if he took a few drops!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake-sweetie? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake froze as he saw his 36-year-old mother, Ashley entered the basement very worried. She had lightly curled dark brown hair that was neatly cut to her shoulders, round photogenic face that caused her to shine every time to smile, a slim body, and...huge endowments that seemed to stick out no matter how conservative of a clothing she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't ask for a better mother who supported and helped raise him alone. She got pregnant when she was in college by her former boyfriend, but the man decided he didn't want to commit to being a full father, so they broke up and he paid child-support. Jake really didn't have an opinion of him, but he did think that he made a terrible mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the only problem was that she could be very over-protective and sensitive to his well-being, especially since he was smaller than the average male. One time, she had a nightmare of her precious boy being trampled by football players and as silly as it sounded, she couldn't sleep alone without her son in her arms for a whole week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets easily emotional and sometimes, Jake couldn't put up with it. Despite her well-meaning, it was suffocating him figuratively and...very literally. It didn't help that his mother was 5'7\" which wasn't too tall, but Jake hated the fact he had to look up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, mom,\" Jake cleared his throat before smiling and lifting up a vile filled with a lime-colored liquid, \"I did it! I finally perfected the growth serum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley didn't understand the science of it, but she knew that her son had been working on this for months. Feeling wells of pride fill her up, she continued her decline into the basement and raised her arms towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that is so great, sweetie! I know you've been working so hard on this!\" she squealed in delight, approaching him fast to envelop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's expression slowly turned into horror as he realized he couldn't deny his mother a hug this time given the occasion and her speed. Quickly, he settled the vile back into its tray and then was swarmed by his mother's love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurgh!\" Jake groaned as his whole body was squeezed by his mother's larger body. His face was burried into the depths of his mother's cleavage and he tried to pull out before he suffocates. This was one of the many instances where suffocation is in a literal context.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom! T-that's enough!\" Jake gasped as he managed to pull his head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley let go and Jake was surprised to see tears well in her eyes. They were tears of happiness, of course, but she always spilt some tears when it came to her precious son's achievements...even if she didn't understand them quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby, you mean the world to me and I am certain that you'll be able to help people who want to grow a little more themselves with this...that's what it is for, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake maintained some distance between himself and his mother, clearing his throat again. \"Yes, that's exactly what this is for, but first, I plan on testing this on myself. I won't have to be known as the shortie scientist any longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley chuckled, thinking it was cute. \"Sweetie, I think you're perfect enough. I still don't think you should worry about your height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake frowned and dismissed his mother's words. He already made up his mind. Not only would his mother not be able to suffocate him if he grew taller, but he could also do many things on his own! He could become even more free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not backing down. I refuse to be forever this size!\" Jake stated, firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed but didn't press on. \"Just make sure you don't hurt yourself. You've done amazing things, so I trust you, but it doesn't stop me from worrying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake closed his eyes, slightly rolling his eyes as he heard he worries so many times. \"Yes yes...I know mom. Now if you excuse me, I'm going to make some arrangements for some last, final tests. If you plan on staying, don't...touch...anything...alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was a little saddened by her son's dismissal, but she was aware that she could be overly-concerned. It was in her nature though so she couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sweetie. I'll be going to do some errands. Do you need anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Jake answered quickly as he left his mother's presence and moved up the stairs to the rest of the house above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence quickly entered as Ashley stood, taking all of her son's work in. Their basement was once just a place to store junk, but her son had transformed it into his own personal lab. She could hardly believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it all in for a moment, she sub-consciously leaned on the table that contained all sorts of glass and viles, including the lime-colored serum...</span></div></div>",

She blinks a few times and pulls up her hands to see what spilled on her, but the serum had already been absorbed into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing nothing, she shrugs and leaves the table, deciding that she should get going. As she exits the lab, she feels a slightly strange tightness in her pants, unaware that the serum was slowly starting to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake arrived minutes later in his basement lab and nothing out of place catches his eyes. It is nice to have some peace and quiet in the house, but despite acting cold to his mother, he truly loves her. It's just years of being a worry-wart and doting has made him sick of all of it. Not only that but...his mother is rather...buxom. He really didn't have anyone to compare to his mother which always makes him wonder why someone like his unknown father would break up with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it be her personality? In that case, he could understand somewhat. His mother can certainly act like a clutz sometimes and even childish compared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, to say that she is a distraction is putting it mildly. Even if she's simply standing safely away and observing, her assets are more than enough for me to become distracted and perhaps accidentally create a fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, he pulls away from thoughts of his mother and begins some final tests. Knowing his mother, she'll bound to disrupt him again asking if he wanted anything to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-jake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist flinches as he hears his mother scream frantically. The fact that he can hear her all the way from the basement could be an indication that it's serious...or that she's just whining for her help carrying the groceries and no doubt sneak in a little kiss on the forehead too. He knows her all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he shuffles some papers that contain his notes and head upstairs to ground level. There, he comes out in the front and stops, his mouth opening wide. Rachel struggles to get out of what seems to be a tight fit in her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...that's putting it lightly. She's practically crawling out of the car door because she can't duck her head low enough without hitting herself. By your estimate, she must be at least...</span></div></div>",

Even though she got out, she's definitely not driving any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, forget the car. Rachel's a giant! She must be at least 10 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tears streaming down her face, she sees her son and then sobs uncontrollably. \"O-oh god, wh-what's happening to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake finally closes his mouth and gulps. His mother didn't just grow taller. She became more thicker around her ass and her chest. Her pants and dress shirt has already ripped, leaving some of her skin showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage boy shakes his head. Now is not the time to admiring. Rather, there's no doubt that his mother did something when he was gone from the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing up to his mother, he can only stare in awe at the crying woman and her size. Although she's on the ground, just her upper half of her body is a little bigger than your frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath and trying not to get upset as he's sure that won't help his mothe who is already confused and crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom, listen to me. What happened before you left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sniffles as she recalls. \"I...I just admired your lab for a little bit. I um...I did lean on one of your tables, but nothing spilled I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake frowns. Even if leaning on a table full of dangerous chemicals didn't cause any major leakage, even a small droplet could have escaped into the air. He decides to be more specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember feeling any drop on your body before you left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel pauses, her salty tears staining her face as she tries to reflect. \"N-now that you mentioned it...I felt a tiny drop on my hand, but I didn't see anything, so I assumed it was my imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit. Well obviously, it just had to be the lime-colored liquid given her size. You had double checked the vial and saw nearly the same amount to your human eye which means it had to be as small as a tiny drop that spilled out. If she grew to 10 feet just because of that then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake pales and feels terribly embarrassed to have miscalculated this big on how much the serum would effect a human body. Obviously, this is why he wanted to do some more tests. Humans will naturally react differently than animals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her son in deep thought, her lips quiver as she quickly understands that she screwed up. She puts her hands to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm so sorry baby. I'm a failure as a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake can't really get upset at her as he double checks to make sure there aren't any other physical side effects other than her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that right now. I'll work on a way to get you back to normal size. Do you feel strange like within the stomach or feel your um...clothes getting tighter around you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sniffles and tries her best to remain silent. She was so lost in thought while driving and in the grocery store that she didn't even notice passerbyers strange looks as she kept to herself. It's only on the way back did she realize she was getting way more cramped than normal. That said, she did feel a little strange in the stomach, but it was less than discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well before I did now that you mention it, but now...\"</span></div></div>",

In my tests with some apes, they would generally feel a little sickly until the amount of serum was completely absorbed. If you aren't feeling anything now, then it means that you've stopped growing...or at least, as far as my tests have proven. I'm not sure if it'll work out differently in the end with humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel tries to stop crying, rubbing her eyes. Sniffling for the last time, she takes her son's word more attentively than she has ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then sweetie, does this mean I'm essentially your first human test subject?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake raises his eyebrows and hums. \"I suppose so, but I never intended on testing on my own mother. This is all just bad luck. Don't worry though, I'll find a way to change you back and then normalize the serum so it doesn't effect growth so largely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiles a little. \"No, thinking about it, I'm glad it's me. I wouldn't want this kind of thing to ever happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his mother's reasoning, he understood somewhat. He would easily be in his mother's shoes considering less than a full drop splashed on her skin. This was a total embarrassment to his pride as a genius scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, he calms himself unlike the teenager he is and uses this event to improve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyways, let's head back home. I know it'll be uncomfortable but you'll just have to bear with the height for now. I promise to work quickly to restore you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling warmly at her son, she finds herself continuously impressed by how mature her son is compared to most boys. To see him care for her mother fills her with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, she leans forward to grab her son and hug him. Jake widens his eyes and starts to yell at her but it's too late as his body is pulled and nearly enveloped by his mother's chest and large stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's...too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel giggles, not quite hearing her son. \"Oh sweetie, it now feels like I'm actually holding you like a baby! I can't believe I've grown so much for you to look so tiny and even cuter...oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally aware that she was holding her son too tightly, she lets go and covers her mouth, once again starting to tear up. \"I'm terribly sorry sweetie! I didn't mean to hurt you! It's...habit, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake coughs, forcing himself to fill with fresh oxygen. His face is flushed red and as he stares at his mother who had done no wrong except being overly-touchy, he sees just how enourmous and jiggly her chest is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with a deep shame, he looks away. \"I...um...it's alright. Just try to be more careful. With your size, you should be able to enter our home, but you'll probably be crouching most of the time. Just...try to take it easy okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel is concerned as her son is avoiding looking at her. She wonders if her son is truly sick of her, unaware of the true reason being that Jake fought hard to not think of his busy and beautiful mother so much. It's one of the reason he also spends most of his time underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, his mother is so big, it'll be even harder to ignore her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkipping forward a week, Jake continues to work on an anti-growth serum and to his dismay, it's more difficult to formulate than a growth serum. Since human bodies are progressive naturally, trying to reverse something as moving as height is ultimately more dangerous than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he must try for the sake of his mother. Meanwhile, what is occuring with Rachel?</span></div></div>",

It was difficult for her to cook anything with her huge size and she couldn't go out as much since the public exposure of her current height would draw unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she could only bear with the displeasure of not being active by watching TV and doing her best to perform at-home Yoga to pass the time; however, she really hated to see her son ordering out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even tried to have a home-meal made by guiding her son through the process, but he refused saying he couldn't waste time to find a cure for her height. Even though she knew that she couldn't convince him otherwise, it pained her to see her son not eating her usual meals she enjoyed making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring one night sleeping on two blow-up beds in the living room space, she felt a growing pain on her chest. Originally, she had felt it but didn't let her son know since she didn't want to cause him more trouble, but now she couldn't sleep and it was becoming unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving into the bathroom, shuffling on her knees to reduce her height while still having to duck under the doors, she removed her nightgown that her son had specially made for her. Underneath, she could see wet patches around her cloth bra and widened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving experienced this before during lactation when Jake was little, she figured that she was lactating again as a side-effect of growng and as a result, she needed to relieve them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly problem, she didn't have a breast pump as she never needed one thanks to her son's eager feeding. She also refused to bottle milk for him, only wanting to nurse him close if he was ever hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lips over her current predicament, she tried to hand milk them but it turned out harder as she couldn't get anything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of trying, she gave up and went back to the living room. With a conflicted expression, she eventually pressed the alert button her son gave to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleepily, Jake quickly arrived at his mother's side from his bedroom and then was stunned by a stream of tears on his mother's face and the fact that she had no top on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to ignore the sight of his mother's large chest that could easily envelop him, he tries to clear his throat. \"M-mom? W-what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetie, I...I don't know if this is because of growing so big, but...I'm...lactating again; however, there's no pump for me to help relieve the pressure. I...need you to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake fully understood what she means by \"help\" and blushes. As a teenager, he also couldn't help but feel a certain arousal over this situation, but he quickly tries to shut out that line of thinking knowing his mother is in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",
