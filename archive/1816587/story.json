            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel looked bored at all the lights and levers, he had no idea what they were meant for. As boring as is might be, this was the best paid job he could find, especially since he only had to do fairly easy things like holding a wrench or, like now, watch that all lights are burning except the big red one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy leaned back in his chair and yawned. The job was just boring no matter how much the professor pays him. It was strange though. Daniel was not really qualified. He barely graduated high school and had trouble to find a job afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom was threatening to throw him out if he does not bring any money home so he was glad he found a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked up and saw the professor wiring something and mumbling some calculations Daniel never would understand. He yawned again. This evening was going to be a long one, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm now going in, Daniel.\", said professor Harthorn said and looked over to Daniel who was sitting behind glass. \"Just monitor everything and tell me anything unsual.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor entered a giant pod which resembled a cooking pot. Daniel had no idea what was going to happen in there. Not that he cared. The professor said that he will be save outside the pot so there was nothing to worry about when the professor does the dangerous things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarthorn closed the door behind him and moments later some lights on the pot went on and a noise like some kind of turbine was spinning could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel put his hands on his ears because the noise got louder and louder every second. \"What does this thing do anyway? I hope it stops soon. It's getting hard to hear myself think!\", he thought and look at the instrument board like the professor instructed him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later the pot was turning off and the door opened, smoke got out of it. Soon the smoke vanished and the professor could be seen. He looked like a truck drove over him and his clothes were torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\", he asked Daniel. \"Only if you wanted to create a big noisy smoke machine.\", Daniel replied joking. Little did he knew that while the machine was working some special radiation was emitted that effect every human being within a 10 feet radius that was not protected by being inside the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another failure?\", sighed the professor and cleaned his glasses with his torn lab coat. \"But why didn't it work?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shrugged his shoulders. \"No idea. What were you tring to achieve anyway?\", he asked. \"I told you but you didn't listen, right?\", sighed Harthorn. \"Like I told you before, I want to create a machine that is able to turn someone into everything he wants to be. This will help those who are unhappy with their bodies or have bad habits they want to get rid of.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think this is even possible?\", asked Daniel and raised an eyebrow in suspicion. This guy was really crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is!\", he said with confidence. \"I found this material and...\". Daniel didn't listen to him anymore. This guy was really crazy but at least he paid good money so he simply nodded and smiled to stay on good terms with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how it's possible.\", he ended his speech. Daniel simply nodded. \"I see.\", he said although he did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\", Harthorn then broke the silence. \"Since the pot isn't working anymore, I think you're free to go.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I hope you get it back to work as soon as possible.\", Daniel said and left the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside it was already dark. How long had he been at work? Six hours? Maybe more? Daniel had no idea. He lost complete track of time. No wonder considering how boring work was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis way home was eventless and short. Daniel had luck to find a job only 10 minutes away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big sigh Daniel walked to the door and stopped there. He hoped his mother would be a bit calmer now he had a job. She normally freaked out every time he got home and told him he had to do something with his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, today was no difference. As soon as he closed the door behing him, his mother was standing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're coming late.\", she said and crossed her arms in front of her chest. \"I bet you were out and didn't do anything useful.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sighed. \"No, mom.\", he replied. \"I was out working. I just got a job today. I could start right away.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah, right. You and a job! Who would hire you?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked serious at his mother. \"Professor Harthorn. He needed an assistant and pays good money.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of him. You're probably making him up.\", she said not believing that her good-for-nothing son could get a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shook his head and sighed. \"If you don't believe me. At the end of the month you'll see. Now excuse me. I'm going to bed.\". That said he went past her and upstairs into his room. He really could not wait to have enough money to get away from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not even bother to change or brush his teeth he just laid down on his bed and closed his eyes. He really wished he could escape from this terrible life he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later Daniel fell asleep. He did not know that the next morning would be some big surprise for him.</span></div></div>",

He fell asleep at least two times yesterday while wathcing the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly sat up and yawned but then stopped suddenly. There was a strange weight on his chest. He looked down as fast as possible and his vision was blocked by two big orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?!\", he gasped and grabbed both of them with his hands. He moved them up and down in disbelieve. \"They're... They're... Breasts?!\", he thought and quickly grabbed his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed in relief. That stayed. But why were there breasts on his chest? How could this happen? Daniel massaged them slightly and waves of pleasure rushed through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\", he cursed and moved his hands as far away as possible from his new found breasts. He sat there looking at the two orbs on his chest for at least half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany thoughts rushed through Daniel's head. \"How is this possible? What caused this? How am I going to revert it?\" to name a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door cracked open and his mother entered his room without asking for his permission first. \"I see, you're still in bed although you should be looking for a job!\", she nagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked over to her. \"I told you I found a job...\", he said and his jaw dropped down. His mother looked like normal but lacked her breasts. Suddenly Daniel knew who's breasts he had on his chest and why they were so sagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, right. This professor Hampton.\". \"Harthorn!\", he corrected her and was still astonished that she did not notice that he had her breasts on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\", she said and turned around. \"You're going to pay rent starting next month. If not I'll throw you out.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sighed as she left. \"How can a mother be so horrible?\", he thought and got out of the bed. \"At least I have a job now.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got out of the bed his boobs jiggled uncomfortably. \"Great, what do I do about them?\", he asked himself. \"I've got to find out how to get rid of them... But how? Maybe I should just carry through my day... Maybe they disappear tomorrow... Or I should ask the professor.\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel awoke by the sound of his alarm... Wait a minute... He did not set an alarm. It did not sound like his own either. But it sounded familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked the boy opened his eyes and looked at a night table on which an alarm clock was rining. It was a long pink box with digital digits on it. Except for the colour it looked like his own. He had seen this alarm clock before but where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his eyes opened wide in shock. Of course he knew it! It was his mother's! Shocked the boy sat up and strands of brown hair fell into his face. Surprised and shocked at the same time he brushed it away. That was the moment he noticed his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey still looked the same but the nails were different. They were long and painted pink. Daniel quickly looked down to see himself wearing a rather familiar lilac nightgown. It was the one his mother usually wore. The strange thing was that the nightgown fitted although his mother was fatter than his skinny self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked around and saw that he indeed was in his mother's bedroom. Everything was there that should have been there. \"What am I doing here?\", asked Daniel and was reliefed that he voice was still the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of the bed and looked at his legs. They were shaved. Curious his hand moved to his crotch. His penis was till there but around it were some soft panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"boy\" slowly stood up and walked over to the big mirror his mother had in her room. Inside he saw himself but with long brown hair, manicured hands and feet and dressed in his mother's nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening?\", he mumbled and quickly got out of the room and barged into his own room. Inside he found his mother sleeping in his bed, having his short hair cut and if he saw correctly, hair on her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is impossible.\", he whispered to himself and began shaking his mother. \"Wake up.\", he said. \"Wake up.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother slowly opened her eyes and looked at him sleepily. \"What is it, mom?\", she asked him. \"You're going to throw me out now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was shocked by her reaction. She thought he was him! How is that even possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother looked at him confused. \"You okay?\", she asked. Daniel was unsure what to say. He was sure she would not believe him anyway so the best was to pretend he was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah... I was just... er... waking you up so you... er... could get a job...\", stummered Daniel and tried to sound like his own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile she sighed like Daniel usually did when this subject came up. \"I told you.\", she said firmly. \"I found a job. Now go out!\", he ordered and Daniel decided it was the best to do what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked Daniel went back to his mother's bedroom. He had no idea why or how this happened but it clearly happened. He was his own mother and she thought she was him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mother's  room Daniel broke down and leaned against the door he just closed behind him. \"How is this even possible?\", he asked himself. \"It can't be. I can't be my own mother!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sat there, looking at his unfamiliar nightgown that fitted him perfectly, at his shaven legs and his manicured hands and feet, and thought about all possible scenarios that could have caused this but not one did make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it will just go away. Maybe I'm just dreaming.\", he thought and pinched himself but in vein. \"I'm not dreaming.\", he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe he...</span></div></div>",

It was a miracle that his mother did not rush into his room and told him to get a job but he was sure this would happen any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy yawned and stretched himself, scratching his chin slightly. He smiled satisfied because even though his mother would not believe him, he had a job, a well-paid one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly swang his legs out of the bed and involuntarily looked at his legs which were now bare and, if he looked correctly, shaven. His eyes widened as his gaze went upward to his upper legs. While the lower legs were bare, the upper was covered in some kind of lilac material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up even further he discovered that this lilac material formed a nightgown. He was wearing a lilac nightgown! To make it even worse, he recognised it as his mother's favorite nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\", he exclaimed and looked down at himself, still confused how this could have happened. To make things even worse, his mother entered his room without his permission for her bi-daily lecture. \"If you can curse, you also can look for a job.\", she said with a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was just as surprised to see his mother now wearing his blue pajamas as he was with wearing his mother's nightgowns. He waited for a comment why they both were dressed like this but there was only silence. His mother's lecture's were short but harsh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look so stupid and get a job!\", she said. Daniel was sure that she just did not want to believe that he had a job. If she believed it she would have to acknowledge that her son achieved something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill he was confused why he was wearing his mother's nightgown and why she was wearing his pajamas and did not notice anything at all. Daniel opened his mouth and just wanted to ask her if she noticed something strange but his mother turned on her heel and walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were you, I would look for a job. If you can't pay your rent next month, I'll throw you out!\", she said and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shook his head. \"Pay rent to live in the house I grew up. She's gone nuts!\", he thought and looked at the nightgown. \"Or maybe I've gone nuts?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the waderobe while looking for an explanation why she did not notice that they had swapped nightwear and why his pajamas were not to small for his mother's bigger frame. Come to think of it, the nightgown fitted and was not to big for his thinner frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was shocked when he found all his mother's clothing inside his waderobe. \"What is happening?\", he thought and looked at all the blouses, long skirts and dresses his overweight mother used to possess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery article of clothing was altered to fit Daniel although they still looked like clothes a fatter women would wear. A million of thought ran through his head. He was thinking what might have caused the problem and how he could fix it. He decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel awoke by the sound of some strange noises from outside. He could not quite say what made these voices but they sound familiar. He concentrated. Was that the noise of children playing in the garden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be silly. In his neighbourhood were no children at least none that were young enough to make such noises. But what else would that noises be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy slowly opened his eyes. It took him a while to notice that he was in a different room. The walls were pink. The room seemed larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he noticed that his bed sheet felt weird. Softer. His eyes wandered quickly over to the bed sheet and eventually he saw a pink one instead of his dirty blue one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\", he mumbled and his eyes wandered around the room, his head still lying on the pillow. The room seemed familiar. He was in it once or twice but where was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to inspect the room further. He slowly sat up in the bed and noticed the next strange thing. Long strands of hair were falling into his face. How could this be? Did he sleep for at least a year or two so his short hair could grow so long and dyed his hair meanwhile?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dragged one strand infront of his face and noticed that his fingernails were long and painted red. \"What the fuck?!\", he exclaimed as he looked further below his body and found himself wearing a skimpy, pink nightgown with lace trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped out of the bed as if there was a big spider in it. He stumbled backward a bit and then fell. On the ground he crouched backwards in fear although he was not sure why or what he was afraid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening. This can't be happening.\", he repeated over and over again. Unfortunately, it did happen, for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise he made did not stay unnoticed. Daniel crinched as he heard a knock coming from the door to his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theresa? Everything alright?\", a voice, he immediately recognized as his aunt Clara's voice, asked from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she just call out for Theresa?\", he thought shocked and instantly remembered where he had seen the room before. It was his cousin's room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theresa?\", his aunt asked again. \"Oh shit.\", he thought. \"What do I do? My aunt is nice and all but I doubt she would appreciate it if I were in her daughter's room, dressed in her nightgown.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Daniel had worked out a plan, the door cracked open and a blond woman in her late 40's entered the room. Unlike his mom, his aunt retained her weight after she gave birth to his cousin and the twins. She looked quite beautiful for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Daniel with a worried face. \"Everything alright, dear? What are you doing on the floor?\", she asked and acted as if it was completely normal that her nephew was sitting on the floor, dressed in her daughter's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theresa?\", she asked again even more worried. Suddenly everything made sense for Daniel, even though it did not. \"For some strange reason, my aunt is thinking I'm her daughter!\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... nothing.\", he finally responded. \"I just thought I saw a spider in my bed.\", he quickly lied and hoped she would believe his lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately his cousin really was very afraid of spider's and his aunt nodded. \"I see. No need to worry, dear.\", she smiled at him like a good mother did. He had not seen this smile on his own mother's face for years. She then left the room and left Daniel alone with his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on?\", he asked himself and got up. He looked around the room. Everything seemed normal but after a while he noticed a strange photograph. In it he saw his aunt, her husband and the newborn twins. Family was very important for Theresa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange thing was that he was in the photograph as well and he was dressed as Theresa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on he?\", he thought. \"I've got to find out what's going on! But how?\".</span></div></div>",

You open Theresa's cupboard to get dressed, only to find that the only things she owns are ridiculously feminine clothes. You sigh as you absent-mindedly put on red 6-inch high heels and the shortest skirt ever with a revealing tank-top over a bra and panties. Only after you were done dressing you realized that the switch had given Theresa's basic traits to help you survive in her body.<br>\r\n     You sigh as you decide to get the most out of it and expertly apply makeup, something you had never even attempted to do. You walk out the door of Theresa's house unable to prevent the exaggerated sway of her hips without your body stalling. You corrected yourself, the body FORCED you to act like Theresa, NOT help you. As a test, you try and laugh but the familiar manly chuckle is absent. Instead, there is an EXTREMELY girlish giggle.<br>\r\n    \"My name is Daniel,\" you try and say, as a test.<br>\r\n    \"My name is Theresa,\" is what comes out. Sighing, you continue to the proffesor's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     When you get there you knock on the door but you discover that nobody is in. You then notice a note addressed to him under the door. It read:<br>\r\n<i></i> Dear Daniel.

You will be the only one who notices the changes as reality shifts for everyone else. You may only stay in a changed form for up to 24 hours before reverting to your normal form and be able to swap again.<br>\r\nYours sincerely, Dr. Harthorn<i></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you realize the potential of these powers.</span></div></div>",

He locked at the clock. 10:43. He still felt so sleepy but he could not sleep with all this noise anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning he sat up in the bed and stretched his body. He then got out of the bed and felt the familiar swishing on his legs. Wait. What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked down at himself and saw that he was wearing a rather skimpy, pink nightgown with lace trim. \"What the fuck am I wearing?\", he asked himself and stood up to get a better view of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reached to just above his knees and had two spagetthi straps with little ribbons on them. The nightgown also showed much of cleavage. You could not called it a nightgown, it was more of a negligee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel paniced and ran over to his waderobe and opened it. There he found various sets of blouses, skirts, dresses and other female clothing articles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?!\", he mumbled. \"Is this a trick of my mother to get me out of here? Is she trying to force me to wear women's clothing if I'm not moving out?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel slowly left his room and sneaked downstairs. Just as he was down the stairs, right before he wanted to call his mother, he noticed something on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family pictures that hang there were not the strange thing even though Daniel was astonished that his mother had not cut out his heads, yet, just to make him feel even more uncomfortable at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo the strange thing was what Daniel was wearing. In every single of them he was wearing a dress instead of his suit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't change that, can she? It would be too much work. She wouldn't do such a thing, would she?\", Daniel thought and went back home and turned his old computer on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while until it was booted and he could see his facebook page. Since Alicia broke up with him he wanted to delete all the photos of them from his facebook account but he just could not do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was an advantage for him. He looked at all of them and in every single one he was wearing women's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\", he cursed. \"This can't be true. My mom didn't have anything to do with this. This would be too much work. There are simpler ways to get me out.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what should I do now?\", he thought. \"I can't go out like this, what will the people think? Who's clothes are those anyway?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he noticed on one of the pictures on facebook something strange. In one of them he and Alicia were hugging himself and both wore dresses. In the background he could saw your cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the day when this picture was taken. When he and Alicia still dated his mother was still nice to him and they went to the zoo one day. His mother loved penguins and wanted to see some. His cousin came along, his mother invited her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he saw on his particular picture his cousin in the background. The strange thing was that she was wearing clearly men's clothes and they looked rather familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa rarely wore clothes that looked not feminine and even more rarely wore pants. She wore them in winter some time but never during the summer and if Daniel remembered correctly she wore a dress on the day the photo was taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he tried to remember... The dress he wore in the picture looked just like the one she wore and now that he mentioned it: Her clothes looked like the one's he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great...\", he mumbled. \"I'm wearing my cousin's clothes. Now the big questions is what do I do?\".</span></div></div>",

He dreamt he was alone, his mother threw him out and he had nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he woke up he just shook his head. It was only a dream but it could become true in the not too distant future. That was what made this strange dream more of a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope I get enough money 'till my mom decides to ultimately get rid of me.\", he mumbled and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he did, black strands of hair fell into his face. \"What the...?\", he mumbled and pushed them away and noticed that his fingernails were longer, manicured and painted red. \"WHAT THE...?!\", he repeated, this time more agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped out of the bed and noticed it was not his own. It had light blue bed sheets and he had never seen this bed before in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shocked by having long, manicured fingernails and long, black hair, Daniel looked around the room and noticed that it was just as foreign as the bed was. \"Where am I?\", he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a hard time to notice everything that has changed at once, it was just too much for him. He needed a minute to notice that he was not wearing his pajamas anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now he was wearing a blue nightgown that reached to his knees and had two hearts on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, he stumbled backwards a bit and noticed something poking against his ass. He turned around and saw that he reached the window and his ass pressed against the windowsill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out of the window and recognised the outside world as his street. Looking even further he noticed that he could see into his garden, which meant he was next-door right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's eyes went wide the moment he figured what happened. He was suddenly in the room of his first love Chloe Chambers and currently wore her nightgown and strangely also had her manicured nails and her long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard a phone ring and he cringed. He looked over at the desk in the room and walked over to the phone. He looked at it. It was a pink cellphone with touchscreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone said that the caller was \"John\", her boyfriend. Daniel decided to...</span></div></div>",

He immediately recognised it as his mother's voice. Apparently she was in an even wore mood then last night and now made his life even more horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel simply sighed. \"I am awake!\", he shouted back and got out of the bed. As he swang his legs out of the bed his legs felt strange, air was hitting them. That could not be possible, he was wearing pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and was shocked that he now wore  blue nightgown that reached to his knees and had two hearts on the front. He was confused. \"How did I get to wear something like that?\", he thought and crinched as soon as the door cracked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you go and do something constructive?!\", his mother shouted as she entered his room without his permission. Daniel instantly blushed red in embarressment. There were really better things than being seen in a nightgown by his home in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangley she did not notice anything unsual about Daniel's appearance. \"Don't just stand there! You're getting dressed and get a job!\", she ordered, still not believing that Daniel managed to get a job on his own. \"I looked at the newspaper and marked some jobs for you! You won't find one otherwise.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Daniel could even react to what she said or even ask her if she noticed anything strange about him she left the room. Every second day she did something like that and she always looked for jobs Daniel was unqualified for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange thing this morning was that she did not notice that her son was wearing a nightgown. \"Maybe she put it on me... But why should she do it?\", he thought. \"She would not achive anything with that.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself again and just shook his head. He looked ridiculous. \"Better get changed.\", he thought and went over to his waderobe, only to discover that all of his clothes were replaced by female clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?!\", he mumbled and looked at all the clothing which was now in his waderobe. Yesterday he owned a few shirts and pants but now he had a rather vast collection of all different shirts, skirts, dresses, blouses etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening?\", he thought and noticed that every item of clothing was in his size, just like the nightgown currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped backwards and was horrified looking at all the new clothing in his waderobe. How was it even possible to exchange everything over night? And why did his mom not notice anything? Or did she just not want to notice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel thought about what to do next. He could ask the professor if he knew anything about this. After all he tried to do something reality altering. Or he could try to find out if his mom was just bluffing and knew how ridiculous Daniel looked.</span></div></div>",

Maybe he's even responsible for this, who knows?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these thoughts, Daniel decided to get changed in his new attire. He tried to choose rather gender neutral clothes. He was wearing a red t-shirt and, unfortunately, skinny jeans. \"Why aren't there any baggy jeans or something like that?\", he thought in despair and slide some pink sneakers over his feet, the best not heeled shoes he could find. He still wore the panties he had been wearing underneath the nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked down at himself. \"I look ridiculous.\", he thought. \"But nothing else to wear in here.\". He then proceeded downstairs and out of the house. The boy had hoped to avoid his mom but he had no such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel!\". Her annyoing voice sounded from behind, just before he could open the door. \"Where do you think you are going?!\", she asked. Daniel turned around. \"I'm going to look for a job.\", he lied, hoping that his mom would accept this and let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"Really?\", she asked hesitantly but then looked like she believed him. \"Good.\", she then said. Daniel just wanted to turn around when she called him again. \"Wait a minute!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\", he groaned annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going out like that!\", she said with a stern look. Daniel looked rather happy. It seemed that the mystery of his clothes had been solved. It was a trick of his mom after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go upstairs and put a bra on! I don't want you to embarrass me.\", she said with just the same look as before. Daniel's look on the other hand had changed from happiness to despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe that she would let me go outside dressed like this. So she really believes that it's normal for me to dress like this. By the look of this situation, I better get up and put on a bra, no matter how ridiculous this is. I don't want to argue with her now.\", he thought and did as he was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this was finished he could finally go out and head to the professor.</span></div></div>",

That's how you dress!\", said the professor out loud. \"Are you trying to play a trick on me?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's jaw dropped. What was that? He always dressed like that? Daniel was absolutely certain that he NEVER wore a bra before or such tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, professor. I absolutely do NOT dress like that. I mean, I'm wearing a bra. A bra! That's not how a boy is supposed to dress, right?\", tried Daniel to convince the Harthorn but with no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor shook his head. \"No, it's completely normal. Yesterday you wore one, today you're wearing one.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sighed. He somehow had the feeling that he would not believe him. \"Wait a minute... What was it that the professor did? Something... Oh, man, I really should have listened to him. He was talking about... I have no idea.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you'd excuse me now, Daniel. I have a machine to fix.\", the professor said and wanted to get back behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\", exclaimed Daniel. \"You're machine. I think... I think it worked.\". Harthorn stood still for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\", he asked. \"That can't be, it's broken for sure.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm absolutely sure. Last night everything was okay and the next day I'm suddenly wearing strange girl's clothes. The only possible explanation to how this happened is that you're machine did something to me.\", explained Daniel and hoped that the professor believed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be...?\", mumbled Harthorn and walked over to a table where he got some strange device. It looked like a geiger-counter. \"If you're telling the truth you should be full of harthitons. Named after they're discoverer. It was mere a coincidence that I discovered them. It was in...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor!\", Daniel exclaimed. \"Please focus! So tell me, what will you find out with this... gadget?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. With this device, which can count the amount of harthitons in the area, I can see if you have any of them in your body.\". Daniel nodded. \"And if it is that way... Then you're telling me the truth.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel nodded again. \"Okay... And if I am full of you what-evers... Then what?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Then you might have a problem, although you'd be very helpful for my research.\". The professor activated the device and scanned Daniel with it. \"It's true! You're full of them!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\", asked Daniel frightened. \"Will I... Will I die?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor shook his head. \"No... Maybe... I'm not sure. You're the first person to come in contact with them. You're a specimen that could really help me with my research. I have to do more tests with you.\". Harthorn left the room and entered his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was in shock. First he woke up in girl's clothes and now he was a guinea pig for the professor's strange research. And he was not sure if he wanted to be one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor... I don't want to be a guinea pig. Just... Just fix this!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarthorn came back into the room. \"I can't. I have to run a few tests. Before I do that, I can't do anything for you.\". Daniel sighed and agreed. Harthorn lead Daniel to a chamber where more data could be gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later Daniel was finally free. The professor had gathered enough data to work with, although he could not say what the particles or whatever they were, would do with him. \"Just great...\", sighed Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm lucky, I grow a second head or something...\". He scratched his bra. He really hated that thing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel woke to the sounds of an AK47 assault rifle firing off in a shooting range. He jumped several inches in fright, his blankets scattering like autumn leaves, then cursed as he realized what it was on decent. His alarm clock - a most obnoxious device with the worst tune-deaf tone in this galaxy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his mother's idea. Tired of how Daniel kept oversleeping and being a \"slob\" as in her words, she conspired against her own son's sleep - at least that's how Daniel felt about it - by buying the most full-proof waking alarm she could find.<br>\r\nOh but that wasn't even the best part. The wake-up call of gunfire was least of the alarm's headache inducing annoyance. Additionally it had a pair of wheels that started spinning on activation, ensuring that the clock would drive off of your cabinet and run all along your floor like some demented drill sergeant screaming at you to wake up; way out of your hands desperately reaching to turn it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Daniel was prepared however, and punched the clock into bits and pieces the moment it started blaring. It went airborne into the wall with brick-breaking force, gears and levers flying everywhere. Like a car radio pitifully running out of gas, the clock mournfully receded into silence. Daniel wasn't in the mood for BS this early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Daniel yawned and rubbed his haggard eyes. Man, he had slept himself into lethargy. He felt stiff; as if his back hadn't properly rested prone as it should. Oh well, time to go bath and get ready for the day. He wanted to be at Doctor Harthorn's lab early. The Doctor although easy going, insisted on punctuality. Well no point losing a job in the second day due to being late, now is there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis job was duller than watching paint dry (in fact the Doctor had actually in one of his interviews told Daniel that an experiment would involve Daniel as an apprentice literally watching some form of special highly advanced paint dry; boring as hell, right?), but Daniel could not afford to lose it. The job was a blessing from heaven, and the only thing that would possibly keep Daniel from getting kicked into the streets by his own frustrated mother at the end of this month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel made his way to his closet; opening it, he extracted his choice attire for the day. It was only when Daniel looked at his mirror that he stopped. His logic hit a Cul-de-Sac. Daniel only wore boxers to bed; resulting in his chest being exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Daniel's mind was a blank. Then confusion. Then shock. Wait, what the f###??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo perky pert breasts adorned Daniel's chest where only flatness had been the night before. Like goggle eye-pieces pointing slightly in different directions, the two mounds stood erect proudly. The areolas were much wider and darker, the nipples stood out more like pegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Daniel reacted. His hands instinctively went to to the balloons of flesh as if in need of confirmation what his eyes saw. To Daniel's horror his hands found them to be real as he cupped them. He stood there in mortified disbelief. He couldn't begin to comprehend what he was seeing or why. He stared transfixed at his newfound breasts as if hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Daniel raged. No no no no no no nooooo! I have boobs! This had to be a nightmare! Or maybe he was high! This was unreal.<br>\r\nThis couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Daniel's panicked thoughts went a totally bizarre direction. Oh crud, oh crud! His Life Orientation teacher had warned him and his friends that excessive alcohol was bad in countless ways. He recalled how he and his buddies had laughed the teacher quite literally out of the class in shame when the teacher had told them that too much alcohol disturbed your hormones and could cause the growth of breasts, even with men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this Daniel's punishment for drinking like a fish? He had in the last few weeks went to numerous bars in depression for being unemployed prior to getting hired by the professor. And he had sacked several wine vats worth of beer for many a nights. Oh crud! Daniel hadn't believed men could just randomly grow breasts, yet here he stood with them!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot small ones, not one tiny ones that could be overlooked by covering them with a jacket; but an enormously generously well endowed bosom. Daniel couldn't even place his hands over his cupped breasts; they overflowed from his fingers! Having been a teenager, and therefore having viewed the Playboy like every other testosterone-fueled twat, he judged them from experience to exceed double EE size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel gulped, trying to swallow the dryness of his throat. He was a freak. A hermaphrodite. A cross between girls and boys. He was a queer sight standing in front of his mirror. Normal boy from the feet and waist up, with the exception of his hands filled with boob matter. Oh no!!! he wept in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet in all this turmoil of thoughts, Daniel couldn't but help to admire his impressive rack. Truth be told, he never once gazed upon the breasts, real live ones, of a girl. Porn didn't count. And while he had always dreamed of touching the chests of a girl; he found the sensation of having breasts touched to be far, far more desirable. In short they felt magnificent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly his thoughts devolved into concentrating into fondling himself. He tried desperately to release his chests, but they tingled and glowered with irresistible pleasure. They became ramrod stiff and firm in his hands which rubbed and stroked and squeezed them, in very short order. It felt like having not one, but two erections on his chest!! Moans escaped his lips and breathing became laboured. A wave of ecstasy rose within Daniel like a rush of floodwater. He realized the greatest sensations awoke from twirling and tweaking the nipples. For ten minutes he was lost to pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as if in realization at what an impulsive act he was undergoing, Daniel stopped immediately. Dammit! He was an androgynous freak! He needed to figure out why, and here he stood playing with himself?!! Daniel felt the blood of shame rise to his face as he reflected what he had been up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to think. What had caused this? How was he going to remedy this, fix this? For starters. He had boobs for pity's sake!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's train of thoughts was derailed by his mother opening his door without knocking.<br>\r\nWell shaait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel, in instinct, feebly covered his chests with both arms. His face resembled a Thermometor which was overheating as his cheeks lighted up with fire. Having your mother see your newgrown alcohol-induced (in Daniel's mind at least) had to be there somewhere in the list of the top ten most embarrasing moments of all time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I c-can explain!\" He said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better, boy! Why is my clock in pieces?! You're mistaken if you think I'm buying you a replacement, you ungrateful sod. Breakfast was on the table ten minutes ago. Why haven't you bathed yet?\"<br>\r\nWas Daniel's mother for real? Was she blind; could she not see the breasts jiggling on his chest??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...mom...I need help...look.\" Daniel said, nervously as he removed his arms to reveal his chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, son. The day I've helped you with your bras have passed long ago. Now cover yourself, please. I won't have my son walk barebreasted or nude in my home, while he's freeloading. And remember: if you don't find a job in the next month, you pay rent or hit the streets. I'm tired of waiting for you to grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can you not see?!!\" Daniel asked, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's mother ignored him and walked downstairs. Did she just say, help him with his bras?? She didn't even act out of place. As if  nothing was wrong with Daniel. What on the good green earth was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on a hint, Daniel looked in his closet again. Sure enough, an impressive array of bras lined one of the shelves. Black lacy ones, pink frilly and yellow polka dot ones. How'd those get in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something else caught Daniel's eye; something making him gasp. Several photos depicting his entire life, along with his family, friends and past college colleagues which he had sticky-taped onto his closet-door mirror had him in them with breasts. From his early toddler days he had small pubescent developing booblets, to his older growing-up self he had breasts growing more sizable with the passing years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo small wonder his mother had acted as if everything was okay. Daniel had read enough science-fiction novels and comics to immediately jump to the conclusion that his whole reality had changed -and in it he had breasts!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel needed to go see the Doctor. He was a nutter, but a clever nutter. He would be able to help Daniel. Maybe even tell him what the blazes was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel  rushed around his room to get dressed. He didn't even bother with bathing. Hygiene was the very last thing on his mind at the current moment. Mid-stride, Daniel stopped. He looked down on his cleavage and frowned. Maybe he actually needed a bra. Even in the small interior space of his room, Daniel had experienced the need to keep his bouncing flopping breasts stable. With a blushing rose-red face he restrained his breasts with a bra from his closet. He was pleasantly surprised that to confine them and keep them in place was comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout detour, Daniel then sprinted to his car, and by extent to the lab.</span></div></div>",

Although he did not immediately notice that this was strange, he felt something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed sheets felt strange and something was wrapped around him. He opened his eyes and saw an unfamiliar bed table with an unfamiliar alarm clock. \"Where am I...?\", he thought and suddenly noticed that there was someone behind him who had his arm wrapped around him and that particular person was snoring right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I get here?\", he thought paniced and tried to get free of the grip this man but to no avail. The arm stayed were it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\", he sighed and rubbed his forehead and noticed something else that was strange. First he could feel hair and he should not. Daniel had really short hair so there should be not even one hair on his forehead. Second: His fingernails were longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his hand directly in fron of his face. The hands were still the same but the nails were longer and painted red. \"What the fuck...?\", he mumbled and it seemed as if this woke the guy next to him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\", he said sleepily. \"Last night was great but I've got to go, Alicia.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's eyes went wide. Die he just call him Alicia? \"Yeah... er... Do what you have to.\", he stummered and the guy was dressed and left Daniel alone faster as he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Daniel was alone in this bedroom he recognized as Alicia's with long hair in the same colour as Alicia's, long fingernails presumably Alicia's and he was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich made sense since Alicia normally slept without clothes after having sex. But how does this make sense? This was completely insensible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel got out of the bed and wanted to hurry back home but something he saw from the corner of his eye was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw something in the mirror. He saw Alicia and she was mimicing every move he did! Daniel slowly walked over to the mirror and put one hand on the mirror. Alicia did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this happen? How could there be Alicia's image in the mirror? \"This can't be happening, this can't be happening.\", Daniel mumbled over and over again and saw Alicia doing the same with the same expression of despair on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a sensible explanation for this... Ther HAS to be.\", Daniel said. But what she he do now? The guy Alicia presumably slept with thought he was her and so will probably everyone else, also there was Alicia in the mirror and the long hair and nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious Daniel peeked into Alicia's waderobe and saw her impressive clothes collection and it seemed if they would all fit his bigger frame. To prove that, he tried a dress on and it fitted perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening...\", he mumbled again and looked at the Alicia in the mirror who now wore the same dress and still mimiced his moves.</span></div></div>",

He could have looked for a testee then.\". Daniel then scratched his head sleepily and then got out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was slightly surprised to see that he was naked but dismissed it. He probably was too sleepy yesterday and just took off his clothes and did not put on his pajamas. He shrugged his shoulders and went to the door. There he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast time he walked around the house naked his mother was not happy, kindly spoken. In order to avoid an argument with her, Daniel decided to walk over to his waderobe and put something on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the waderobe, Daniel was shocked. Instead of his own clothes he now found various dresses, blouses and skirts in the waderobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\", he mumbled and grabbed one of the various dresses inside the waderobe. He wanted to confirm that this was not an illusion but real. Unfortunately it was real. The clothes were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question for the boy now was: How did they get in there? \"Did my mom put them in there? No. She couldn't. I would have noticed, wouldn't I?\", he thought. It was true, Daniel had a light sleep. The slightest noise would have woken him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what has caused this then?\", he asked himself and took out a dress and held it against his body. He had feared it but the clothes really were his size. Even if his mother succeeded in swapping his waderobe while he was asleep, it would have been way too expensive to get all the clothing in the correct size. There were cheaper ways to get him out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who or what did this then?\", he thought. \"I've got to find out but I can't in here... But I can't go out naked. What should I do?\".</span></div></div>",

But now\u2026 Now he realized that he had no idea what his mother was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother sighed deeply. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that you did not even learn some of this language from people talking. You. Find. Job. You understand?\u201d, continued his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel still had no idea what she was talking about. He knew that he should know the words but he did not. Even when she talked slowly he had no idea what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u305f\u3076\u3093\u5f7c\u5973\u306f\u4ed5\u4e8b| 34;\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u3064\u3044{ 90;\u8a71\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b?\u5f7c\u5973\u304c\u3042 427;\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059.\u79c1\u306f 4444;\u5973\u3092\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059.\u201c (Maybe she is talking about finding a job?
