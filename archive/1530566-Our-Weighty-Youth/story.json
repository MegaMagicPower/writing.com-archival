Billy is a young Caucasian boy who is home schooled by his oldest sister while his parents are at work along with his two other sisters. He is somewhat athletic and plays on the community soccer team, where he has many friends. While their parents are at work, Billy's sisters like to feed Billy junk food.They want to make Billy into a fat little boy so they can make him into their chubby little baby doll. Billy is starting to like the idea of being able to eat junk food all the time and being able to laz about. His parents are campaigning against bullying fat kids, and the kids are trying to help out by getting Billy's soccer friends over for play dates after school and trying to convince them to fatten up alongside Billy. Billy began as an underweight boy but has slowly started to get chubbier. He has chipmunk cheeks and thick little arms. He has a rounding belly that likes to hang over his shorts and his butt is starting to widen atop his plump legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey Zukiel <br>\r\nAge:4<br>\r\nWeight: 66 pounds<br>\r\nStraight black hair and blue eyes. Joey is a young Japanese boy who's parents run the child sumo underworld. They have decided to fatten him up so he will be a sumo star and they leave Joey's older brother, Ollie, to feed him up. This has made Joey become very fat with a spherical belly, thick limbs, and a roaring rump. At his preschool he rules over all the other kids. If you were an attractive young girl or messing with Joey you could find yourself tied down underground, being fed huge amounts of food till you were at least the minimum of 100 pounds and forced to compete in the underage sumo tournaments. If Joey runs into a grade school bully he will have his parents turn them into water beds and beanbag chairs for his room. Joey likes burps and farts and will often make his victims very gassy, occasionally asking his brother to feed him beans and give him lots of soda. Joey's parents adore him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One day after soccer practice, Billy went home with two of his friends. Luke was one of his friends and Mason was the other. Luke was 6 years old like Billy, but he was much more athletic and weighed 53 pounds. Mason on the other hand was 5 years old, and had spent more time with Billy so he had more of a rounder gut, the shape of a soccer ball, and weighed 65 pounds. They've known each other for almost two years because of soccer. Soccer was the connection between the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Billy got home, he and his friends went straight into his room trying to avoid Billy's sisters. They knew that as soon as they were seen by one of the sisters, that they would all be forced to eat what they were given. Billy and Mason didn't mind the thought so much, but Luke did. Unfortunately the room was at the end of the hallway and the wood floors could be very creaky. They slipped quietly through the hallway. Just as they were about to reach his room, his oldest sister, Sydney, came out of her room and stopped them in their tracks. \"Hey boys, nice to see you could come today.\" She knocked on her sister's door and both of the other girls came out to greet them, Angie and Kylie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUN!!!\" Luke said already running down the hallway. Mason wasn't too far behind while Billy was having trouble keeping up falling behind. To their surprise, all three sisters were prepared to chase down these boys. Kylie was fastest so she went after Luke, Sydney was second in speed so she chased Mason, the left Billy and Angie. Luke found a good hiding spot inside one of the cabinets full of junk food. Mason ran all over the house trying to tire Sydney, and Billy just gave up because he ran out of breath. Eventually Mason ran out of breath, and was caught by Sydney. Kylie looked all over for Luke, inside of every single cabinet but two. She knew that if she looked in the wrong one that he'd just run out the other. Using one foot to block the other cabinet from opening she looked inside of one of the cabinets. It wasn't the right one. She then looked in the other one and found Luke trying to hide behind bags of chips. Her sisters came in took all the junk food out so that Kylie could grab Luke, and made their way to the living room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there was one thing Joey liked it was his belly. Having a big belly gave him advantage in the sumo matches his parents set him in. It also asserted his power around the preschool, where even the teacher was intimidated by a 4 year old of his size. Adam, being Joey's right hand man around the school, admired Joey's large belly and wanted to grow fatter to be a good lackey for him. For these reasons when Adam and Joey arrived at Joey's house they got immediately to eating.<br>\r\nThey had a system down for maximum efficiency. First, Joey would sit down and his older brother Ollie and Adam would feed him fattening things like cakes and cookies until his shirt would ride up over his belly and his gut would ache with fullness. Then he and Adam would switch places and Adam would be stuffed. Both boys seemed rather eager today and were delighted to be fed and fattened as young boys should be. They took large bites and ate quickly as if they were racing against the inevitable feeling of fullness. <br>\r\nAfter Adam was fed Joey would have made room for whatever food was left and so he ate that. Then the two sleepy butterballs would waddle with Ollie's help to Joey's room to nap. Joey's room was a testament to his parents' influence as rulers of the underground sumo network. Posters of sumos adorned the walls (Joey especially liked the fatter ones) and there were shelves of food for him if he, or rather when he got hungry.<br>\r\nThe interesting part of Joey's room was his furnature. Whenever Joey would encounted a grade school bully who picked on him for his or his plump friends' size they would find themselves turned into squishy chairs or waterbeds for Joey's room. Now, of course Joey's parents wouldn't kill these children! Who would let their child sleep on the corpse of an immoble fat boy? No, they were kept alive and fed but encouraged not to speak, cry or yell. Some were even released after time and were reduced to (almost) their original size but Stockholm Syndrome got to a few and they wailed about how they wanted to stay and be fat for their master Joey. One such character was one Joey only knew as \"Bed\". The largest boy in the room was one that was once a cute, skinny blonde teenager who looked at Joey the wrong way when his parents were around. Now he is a fleshy pile of fat spreading out 10 feet in diameter with a blonde tuft on top and is Joey's favorite sleeping surface. Sometimes Joey likes to talk to him, usually about school or about what it's like to be Bed's size.<br>\r\nWhen Joey woke up from his nap on Bed he...</span></div></div>",

He crossed his arms on Bed's boy boobs, which jiggled as if they were jello, and stared into the massive boy's wide eyes. Bed's face was filled with fat. His cheeks were like chipmunks only way fuller. He had five saggy chins to round out his face. After doing nothing but laying for months on end, Bed's face had become very oily and greasy. His cute little blond curls help to keep this once handsome young teenager still able to look like a cute chubby baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello you big fart baby,\" Joey teased before he started taking big gulps of air. Joey then released a large manly burp right in the teen's face.<br>\r\n\"You call that a belch? You burp like a girl!,\" Bed retorted before taking in quaffs of air himself. He then blasted a huge burp bubble right in the tubby little boy's face. Joey had to turn away. It smelled as if Bed had eat three trash cans and drunk four toilet bowls worth of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you too boulder belly,\" Bed took his turn to laugh. Joey laughed along side him too.<br>\r\n\"Well if I'm a boulder, your a mountain!\" Joey got up and started jumping on Bed's tummy, eliciting a lot of giggles and occasionally a little burp or toot from the biggest boy in the room. The two kids then sighed and Joey flopped belly first into the soft bouncy teenager. Joey started massaging Bed's large boobs, lost deep in thought.<br>\r\n\"Bed?\" Joey said after a while.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Joey?\" Bed replied.<br>\r\n\"I think it is time...\"</span></div></div>",

The pressing on his bulbous tummy made Bed release a nervous burp.<br>\r\n\"W-why?\" the big boy asked cautiously,\"I'm already big and fat. My belly is soft and squishy for your sleeping.

It's been like a hundard years since I heard your big, awesome, huge, humongous,round, jiggly, bouncy, bulging,piggy,cow, elaphant belly make bubbly digesting music.\" Joey went over to the soft serve machine he had in his room and grabbed a hose that was connected on one end to the machine. He then walked over to Bed.<br>\r\n\"Wait-\"the giant boy said before he had the hose stuck in his mouth. Joey then started the machine.

I wanna know now!\" Joey pouted and bounced up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know I used to be thin, right?\" Bed asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And it was really gross and stupid so my parents took you and make you big and fat! And then when they were done with you, you begged to stay and be made fatter! So you must really like being fat. You even changed your name because you like being my fatty Bed more than whatever you were before. But what does it FEEL like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Bed wondered. He had to think about how to describe it, because he didn't want to stumble into admitting that even the slightest thought of how much weight he's gained, how fat he is now and how fat he might get in the future, and his teenage hormones go ballistic in ways that Joey wouldn't understand until he hit puberty. Thankfully, with his massive size there's no way he'd ever have to explain the \"evidence\" between the useless fat rolls connected to what once was called legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Bed decided to stay with the basics. \"It feels really heavy. Like, when you play with you other fat friends and they all sit on you, except even heavier, and everywhere. So it's like a nice blanket. And every time you move on me, I feel a wave of fat move all around me. It's like if you jiggled your belly, but the jiggle never stopped and happened all over your body, on your moobs, your back, your legs and butt, even on your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey played with his belly as he thought about what that must feel like. \"Cool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there are other reasons I like being this big, but they're... boring adult reasons and you won't care until you're older. Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\" Joey beamed. So Bed likes it when he jiggles all over, right? Like thiiiiiiis?\" He latched onto the massive belly and shook it around with all his might, causing Bed to quiver all over. He giggled, and that giggle turned into a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It feels great! And that's why I never want to lose any of this weight! And it's also why I care so much about how you're doing. You're the reason I get to be this fat. Thank you, Joey!\" Bed smiled sincerely. He felt extraordinarily lucky to have been abducted that day. It was terrifying, and he hadn't seen his parents since that day several years ago, but to him, being inhumanly fat to the point of immobility and being able to serve those who made him so fat simply by being fat made it all worth it. Everything from his previous life could go to hell, he was in love with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up. You thank me all the time!\" Joey whined. \"But I bet I know what'll make you eeeeextra happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey leaned in close to his face.</span></div></div>",

They would send scouts out onto the streets of Tokyo, looking for cute little children. These children usually ranged from infancy to 9 years old. Once the scouts had found a victim, the child would be lured out of view and snatched up. They would then find themselves in a dirty underground complex where the atmosphere was not great, but the food was a plenty. Once a kid was captured, they found themselves being feed large amounts of junk food a day and being taught how to sumo wrestle. The kids slowly start to lose their skinny or muscular physique as tummies balloon, cheeks become doughy, arms and legs plump up, fingers turn into sausages, and butts widen. When the child has reached one hundred pounds of fat, they are pitted against another adolescent blimp in a sumo match. If you win, the spectators begin to like you and you get a better chance of being adopted. If you continue to lose, you will find yourself being forced to get fatter and fatter. This still gave you a good chance of being adopted, but most of the kids would rather be some strangers fat child than being their pet blob that could only burp and fart for their entertainment. It was a thriving business and Joey\u2019s parents were always in need of some more kids to turn into sumos. The spectators who watched the match made sure that the police remained confused about the complex, keeping the business secret and safe. <br>\r\nJoey grew up around all this. He loved it so much. His parents adored him and wanted him to be a sumo star so Joey always received good food and lots of it. This took all the pressure off school because Joey knew he would never have to work hard. <br>\r\nJoey also loved that he could have a continuous supply of kids he tease and control. Most of the kids that came off the streets were Japanese, but it was always a treat for Joey and Adam when a tourist child was captured. Joey liked when a well mannered English boy with a cute English accent was forced to eat until his shirt buttons popped off to reveal a nice creamy belly and he was forced to belch and fart like a pig, while Adam liked when a high and mighty American boy realized that he was not such hot stuff as his thighs widen and tummy bulges out.<br>\r\nToday, Joey wanted to find a\u2026<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Soon they entered the entertainment area which excited the two boys because this is usually where the tourists are. After passing an arcade Joey and Adam both saw exactly who they wanted. A young boy, slightly older than them, pranced along with a handheld game. It was hard to tell whether he was American, English, or maybe something else but the kid was very white, he also seemed to already have a slight bit of fat around his belly and waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, can we get him?\" Joey asked pointing at the child. \"Please!?\" Adam said in almost a whine. Joey's dad peered in the direction of the kid and whispered, \"He looks perfect. Now kids, run home and I'll see what we can to about the boy.\" Home was actually part of the underground complex. Joey and Adam both ran home, with Joey panting from the exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours Joey's dad returned home with the boy.

The young boy looked around at all the children some chubby, some fat, and some were just blobs. While the boy looked around Joey and Adam looked at him. The boy had light brown curly hair and blue eyes. He wore a white buttoned shirt and dark blue jeans. The boy also was ever so slightly plump with a slight belly and a squishy bottom.

Alec didn't freak out but he didn't seem to entirely like the circumstances. The sound of squeaking wheels signaled that Joey's mom was coming down with a cart full of goodies for Alec to be fed. Joey's mom also brought down a scale to see how much Alec weighed. The scale read 36 kg, or about 79 lbs. Alec's belly didn't look like it could hold all the food on the cart.

But eventually, one last bite received from Joey, and he had ate it all in the cart.  He leaned back and took deep breaths to take it easy for himself.  He felt so full in fact, he placed his hands on his belly to calm it down, before letting out a loud belch that gives everyone a laugh in all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as everyone else is concerned, they were all in disbelief that a young boy like Alec could eat it all in one go.

Even with the button up shirt still on, Adam could feel the squish in the eight year olds tummy. Joey saw this and thought how it would only get bigger and squishier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. This is all going into your belly, Alec\" Joey said.<br>\r\n\"Bu...bbbb but I don't want to be a fat pig!\" Alec blurted out.

It would be best for you if you relax while you get fed by Joey and Adam here. We have a rule here that all new recruits must gain at least 100 pounds before they compete.<br>\r\nShe took her hand off the boys mouth.<br>\r\n\"Then can I go back home then?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry. After that you compete with other kids here in the sumo wrestling tournaments we have here. And if you are liked well enough you might get adopted by an even more loving family!\" She added on a high note.<br>\r\n\"But I play foot ball back home in England\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Alec but you're going to be too fat for football\" Adam pointed out. \"But now you can be a sumo wrestler\"<br>\r\n\"But But all my friends will laugh at me when they see how fat I am\"<br>\r\n\"You won't be seeing any of your old friends?\" Joey told him. \"We're going to make you fat and then you will have new fat friends here.\"<br>\r\n\"But.. But\" they could all tell Alec was just stalling for time now.<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt?\"<br>\r\nMom answered. \"Sometimes it hurts. We are going to fill your belly up with a lot of food. You most likely will feel like a balloon that is fill with too much air. By the measurements I took it looks like your tummy can't handle all the food on this cart at once, but the measurements also tell me that you should fatten up quickly. You should be done eating everything in three days and digest it all in 8. Then you will be a cute chubby handsome little boy!\"<br>\r\n\"Won't I throw up though\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sometimes the kids do throw up. You'll just have to hold it down\"<br>\r\n\"But But But... But .... But won't I get a big fat butt\"<br>\r\nAt this mom smiled. \"Not if we keep talking. Go to town boys! I see you all in an hour.<br>\r\nAlec realized too late that the two younger fat boys had both grabbed hand fulls of food and came hurtling at the restrained young man. Joey reached Alec first. The curly haired boy suddenly felt a jelly filled doughnut and a chocolate eclair shoved in his mouth. Before he could even chew, Alec had a croissant and a chocolate brownie with frosting crammed into his mouth. The food was pushed so far that the first four items in Alec's mouth were pushed back into his throat. He painfully swallowed and was about to say something when he hiccuped. The two fat boys laughed and went back to the cart. Joey grabbed a cotton candy and a carmel apple and Adam pushed the cart closer to Alec. This time he was allowed to chew before Adam pushed in a hand full of eight candy peeps into the young boys mouth. The two maniacal children began running in a circuit to feed the english boy. The force fed child only had enough time to catch a breath before another delectable was shoved into his maw. Ten minutes in and Adam saw a wonderful sight. <br>\r\n\"Joey look at Alec's shirt! It used to be a bit loose, but now look! Its tight.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow good job Alec. You're doing well.\"<br>\r\nAlec looked up. He had a rainbow of different foods smeared on his lips and cheeks. He looked hungover. At five minutes in he had his sugar rush and now he felt as sluggish as he would feel for as long as he weighed over twice his normal body weight. All that energy had made him start to sweat.<br>\r\nHe let a little belch pop out. \"Stop it guys.... I don't feel good\" Alec then...</span></div></div>",

He was looking around nervously at all the fat children surrounding him. <br>\r\nWhen he saw the two unrestrained toddlers walking toward him he asked \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\nAdam gave a little smile because he recognized an American accent. Although Joey would have liked to fatten up a nice english boy, this one did not look to bad to him.<br>\r\nThe boy looked to be around 6 or 7 years old. He had short brown hair that was a bit on the frizzy side. He rested comfortably in black sweatpants and a shirt that was tie dye between the colors grey and light brown. But Joey liked this boy because every part of this boy was already lightly rounded. He would have looked like a baby if he wasn't normal height. His hands actually looked like a baby's chubby paws. Under his shirt could be seen the starting of little boy breasts. His facial features seemed to almost be swallowed up by his full face. Joey liked boys like these even if they were american. He thought they were made to be blown up, and this one would be absolutely adorable once he was fattened up.<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Adam asked the boy.<br>\r\n\"Trevor\" the boy answered \"Why are all these kids really fat?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"We make them fat\" Joey said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" continued Adam \"Joeys parents find them on the streets. They bring um down here and we feed them lots of food so they get fattened up.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait\" Trevor said. \"You steal kids from their parents then make them eat and eat until they are fat and pudgy?!\"<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't call it stealing\" Joey said.<br>\r\n\"More like taking their kids and improving their figures\" Adam added. \"Many kids come here thinking that fat kids are losers and that they would never want to be fat, but once they get all fattened up, they realize that it is not that bad being fat. Some of them actually enjoy it and want to become fatter.\"<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Trevor asked.<br>\r\n\"So that they can compete in the sumo matches we have here\" Adam said.<br>\r\n\"But not every kid becomes a sumo wrestler\" Joey corrected him.<br>\r\n\"Oh right. Yeah some kids get fat to do other things.\"<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n\"Well\" Joey started \"There are some parents who bring their children to watch the matches, so my parents made a play area. We fattened up some teenage boys to be like bounce houses for the kids. We fatten up small babies to be soccer balls for shoeless soccer in the play room. We make pre teen boys grow really big butts so the kids can play the drums. The girls get in on the action too. We have  teenage girls that the children make drink lots of soda so they can have burping contests. We line preteen girls up along a long corridor, where they are tube fed milkshakes. Kids have to run through before they get trapped by two girls bellies. A lot of the kids just like to stand and wait though.\"<br>\r\nAdam joined in \" We also use kids for experiments. They don't harm the kids in any way. Just change them to be better. Our scientists once made two twin boys have excessive flatulence. One would burp a lot while the other farted a lot. They also made one girl ultra lazy. One boy was made so that his body would produce fat naturally. And they made another boy grow fatter by eating healthy and drinking water\"<br>\r\n\"Also\" Joey said, \"We take orders to fatten up kids. Sometimes kids ask for themselves to get fattened, whether its for a girlfriend or a bet or they just want to live a lazier lifestyle. But its more fun when others sign kids up for a feeding. Sometimes parents are so impressed with the sumo matches, they sign kids as young as three years old to be sumofied. We once got a very fat teen come in and sign his little brother up so that way he couldn't make fun of the older brother for being fat. We get older sisters walking their little toddler brothers in to be fattened up and the other way around. We get parents who make their kids run through the expanding girl hallway. If they don't run fast enough and get stuck their parents get them fattened up assuming that their kid will never be fast enough. We even have a special program where bullies are signed up by their classmates. They get fattened into blobs and they rest in a special room where classmates come to play with and tease them. And of course feed them more\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds cool!\" Trevor said \"Hey I think my class sent a couple of bullies down here. Can I go feed them?<br>\r\nAt this the two toddlers had to frown. \"I'm sorry Trevor\" Joey started. \"I thought you might have figured it out by now?\"<br>\r\n\"Figured out what?\"<br>\r\n\"You're here because you are going to be fattened up into a sumo wrestler\" Joey pointed out.<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Trevor said. He looked down for a few moments and then looked back up with a questioning look on his face.<br>\r\n\"So you are going to make me fatten up until I am ready to be a sumo wrestler?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n\"Well do I have to be a sumo?\"<br>\r\n\" Yes you do have to be a sumo, but if the watchers like you, you might be adopted by a new family\"<br>\r\n\"And they will feed me a lot of food and make me fatter?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes there are families who like the sumos even fatter. They even raise their kids on principles of being fat so then the kids will teach their kids and it becomes a long line of fat loving children.\"<br>\r\nTrevor began to smile. \" Awesome! I love to eat, you guys! But my parents said I was getting to chubby so they put me on a diet. No more burgers ice cream, chips, or chili dogs.\"<br>\r\nJoey and Adam started to smile as they realized where Trevor was going.<br>\r\n\"They made me do so much exercise while all I could think about was how hungry I was. But now you guys are going to feed me sweets and goodies till I get super fat!\"<br>\r\n\"Thats right!\" Adam said. \"And then if you win in the games people might adopt you!\"<br>\r\nTrevor frowned \"But I never won any competition. And I'll be very slow once I'm fat\"<br>\r\nJoey had an idea. \"Trevor. Do you burp and fart a lot\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. I do. I have always been more gassy than other kids. My parents did not like it, but my friends thought it was funny\"<br>\r\n\"Thats great\" Joey said. \" After we feed you, I'll ask my parents if you can face off against Ollie the blimp. He is our most fierce sumo. He likes to fatten kids right on the ring. So if you submit to him, we can ask him to feed you foods and drinks to make you gassy. He is a four year old so you being forced to burp and fart for him will make you look adorable. He can treat you like a pet or a baby! And then people will beg to adopt you! Kids who end up losing the match to Ollie usually get adopted, and they did not submit! So some one will have to adopt you and then they will pamper you. I bet you you're tummy is gonna always be filled with those delicious chili dogs!\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a great plan! Trevor smiled. But then he frowned \"But what if I don't like being fat? What if people don't like me because I'm fat?\"<br>\r\nAdam spoke up \"C'mon man! Everyone will love you! You are gonna look like a big baby! And who doesn't like a baby?! Plus its whats inside that counts. Your belly will be filled with ice cream, cake, burgers, pizza, and chili dogs! And who doesn't like all those things!\"<br>\r\nTrevor smiled. Joeys mom came in with the cart of food that would turn Trevor from a pugdy Hispanic American into a full blown sumo boy.<br>\r\n\"Get ready to become a big hungry hog Trevor\" Joey said. And then the two boys advanced on the soon to be sumo.<br>\r\nAfter feeding over a hundred kids into oversized butterballs. They never met someone as willing as Trevor. He was gobbling up the food faster than Adam and Joey could put it in his mouth. Hardly any food got mushed against the boy's mouth. Soon Trevor had eaten...</span></div></div>",

His shirt had first become tight against his front then it started to ride up. Joey and Adam were so happy when Trevor's nice little brown paunch had exposed itself. His sweat pants had started their retreat down his navel. The happy growing boy was moaning in food stuffed bliss. All three children were happy, Trevor because his stomach was full of delicious foods with more on the way, and Adam and Joey because they had found a glutton who would fatten up into a perfectly smooth little butterball pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Adam remembered something. \"Hey Trevor\" he said sternly, poking the boy in the gut.<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh.Ohhhh\" Trevor moaned, a sick looking look appeared on his face. \"Please don't do that\"<br>\r\n\"Well, me and Joey just fed you up like a pig, but I didn't here one burp or fart come out of you yet\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah\"Joey said. \"You said that you pass gas a lot.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, dudes. My belly is filled with food. There's no air in me left to burp or fart\" Trevor tried to apologize.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Do you think we are just doing this to be kind?\" Joey asked angrily. \"This isn't a free buffet!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Adam said. \"All these other kids ate a lot of food and they burped when they wern't even full. If you're gonna be fed like a pig then you're gonna fart and burp like a pig\"<br>\r\n\"I can't you guys. Can't we wait until...\"<br>\r\n\"MOMMY!!!\" Joey cried.<br>\r\n\"oooooooooohhh! Busted!\" Adam said to Trevor.<br>\r\nJoeys mom came in.<br>\r\n\"What is it honey?\" she asked.<br>\r\nPointing to Trevor \"Trevor said he would burp and fart because he's a big gassy boy but he did not do any burps or farts. We fed him half the food but he did no farts or belch!\" Joey was so upset he could hardly speak properly.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry honey. Don't worry I will make him the biggest gassiest boy we ever had for you!\" she reassured her whale like son. She then turned to Trevor. <br>\r\n\"Wow. It has been thirty minutes and you already finished half the food?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am. Am I in trouble?\" Trevor asked nervously.<br>\r\n\"No pumpkin. You've actually been a very good boy. Most of these other kids take two days to eat half the food. But you ate half of it already. You're a very hungry boy, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes miss\" Trevor said proudly puffing up a bit more. \" I love to eat!\"<br>\r\n\"That is good to hear. That is a very mature thing to say. A big boy thing to say. And we are going to make you a bigger boy. You want to be a big boy, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes please! I want to be a big boy!\" Trevor said excitedly.<br>\r\n\" And how do you become a big boy?\" mom asked inquisitively.<br>\r\nTrevor thought about this one for a long while. Then his face light up. <br>\r\n\"By eating everything master Joey and master Adam give to me\"<br>\r\n\"Duh\" Joey and Adam both thought.<br>\r\n\"Very good! You are a very smart lad! But do you know what else you have to do to become a big boy?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...uhhhh...uhhh...ummm...\" Trevor thought really hard.<br>\r\n\"I'll give you a hint. It rhymes with grass\" Mom said.<br>\r\n\"I donno\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n\"It's something you pass...\"<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuhhhhh- oh! Pass Gas!\"<br>\r\n\"Very good! Being a big boy is not just about eating till your tank is full,\" at this Mom tickled Trevor's exposed tummy making him giggle \" It's about passing gas like a grown-up. When your big boy belly is full of gas, you don't need to be told when to burp. You decide when to let go of that big bubble in your belly! You don't need a grown up to tell you to keep it in because you are a big boy with some big bubbles in your stomach! And the bigger you burp the bigger a boy you are. And if you got a fart building in your butt, you don't need to wait for an adult to let you know when to fart because you are a...\"<br>\r\n\"Big boy!\"<br>\r\n\"... and big boys let big ones rip whenever they feel like it. You're a growing boy Trevor, and growing boys need not only get bigger but they also need to burp and fart really big whenever they feel like it because they are...\"<br>\r\n\"Big boys!\" Trevor was beaming at the thought of being a big boy.<br>\r\n\"So when Joey or Adam tells you to make a big burp or a big fart, you are going to do it because...\"<br>\r\n\"I'm a big boy!\" Trevor shouted. Then he frowned. \"But... miss... my belly is so full of food that there is no room for any burps or farts\"<br>\r\nA pause. \"Let me tell you the story of the volcano and the earthquake.\" <br>\r\nJoey and Adam looked at each other and exchanged excited looks. They then ran to the cart. Joey grabbed two liters of soda while Adam gra. Mom meanwhile pulled up a chair next to Trevor. She then started to rub his distended belly soothingly in slow circles.<br>\r\n\"Let me begin. Once upon a time, there lived a small village of humans. And next to that small village, there lived a small little volcano, named Trevorius.\" Joey's mom began, as she rubbed Trevor's belly. Joey and Adam uncapped the sodas. <br>\r\n\"Trevorius was sad because he did not erupt like all his volcano friends did for their tiny villages. All day long they would grumble\" she lightly shook Trevor's belly, which gave a nice little jiggle. Nothing could be heard. \"They would growl.\" Joey's mom gentle squeezed the big boy orb. No sound. \"And they would grow bigger and bigger and bigger\" with each \"bigger\" she pressed Trevor's belly with rising pressure. Still nothing. \"And then they would erupt!\" Trevor stared transfixed at the storyteller.<br>\r\n\"And poor little Trevorius wished he could erupt for his village. So he came up with a plan. And do you know what that plan was?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Trevor asked amazed at the story. He was so captivated by the story that he did not notice Joey putting the mouth of the soda up to Trevor's lips. He did not even notice when he started to gulp down the soda.<br>\r\n\"He filled himself up with hot magma. Every day and night Trevorius would concentrate on filling himself with magma. And slowly he started to fill... and fill... and fill... and fill...\"<br>\r\n\"gulp...gulp...gulp...gulp\" <br>\r\n\"and fill...and fill...and fill...and fill\"<br>\r\nAs Joey's Mom kept telling the story to the boy, she kept rubbing his tummy in big circles. And Joey kept pouring soda in the boy. Trevor was so mesmerized, that soon he finished both Joey's bottles.<br>\r\nHer hand stopped caressing the boys smooth bronze tummy.<br>\r\n\"And Trevorius became so filled with magma, that do you know what happened?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" a curious Trevor asked.<br>\r\n\"He became so filled with magama, that he started an earthquake.\"<br>\r\nThis left Trevor in mouth wide open shock. Adam took this opportunity to shove a chili dog in Trevor's mouth. It went so far in that Trevor  hardly absentmindedly chewed it before it got gulped down immediately.<br>\r\n\"Yes, the dirt in the earth was crumbling and being ground against itself. And it became a huge earthquake!\"<br>\r\nTrevor opened his mouth in more shock and the last chili dog went in, this time down his throat whole.<br>\r\nThe two glutton loving boys then joined Mom and began to rub Trevor's huge belly. The boys were excited because they could feel the soda slosh inside Trevor's belly.<br>\r\n\"Soon Trevorius could not hold all this energy in\" Mom told to the captivated Trevor as the three rubbed circles on his belly. They then all heard a rumble emanate from Trevor's tummy.<br>\r\n\"And then Trevorius began to grumble\" Joey's mom said. The three then shook Trevor's belly. All four of them then heard Trevor's tummy gurgle as the soda and chilli dogs began to bubble.<br>\r\n\"Mrs. my tummy feels like its getting bigger\" Trevor said nervously. And he was right. The brown belly was slowly growing wider and a fizzing bubbling combo could definatly heard from the big boy's stomach.<br>\r\n\"And he began to groooorrrwwwwllllowwwwllllllrrrrrooooowwwwrrrl!\"Mom said. The three captors kneaded Trevor's tummy to the time or Mom's \"growl\". The dome of a belly was bloating up larger now and Trevor's belly sounded like bubbling mud as the soda mixed with the other food in the large tummy. Trevor definitly looked sick.<br>\r\n\"I don't feel too good\" Trevor said. his belly sounded like a swamp was bubbling up inside the boy.<br>\r\n\"And finally, Trevorius started to get...\" Mom backed off. This left Joey and Adam pressuring the great gas filled sack of a boy.<br>\r\n\"bigger and Bigger and BIGGER...!\" The two boys kept pressing the young boy's tummy as it bubbled and gurgled.<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhh guys! I think i'm gonna barrrooop\" Trevor ended his sentence in a grumbly growlish flap of air. The two boys retreated back as Trevor's cheeks bloated out.<br>\r\n\"BBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLCH!!!!\" Trevor released a giant burp, That left everyone speechless. For a couple of seconds everyone just stood there. Then the three began laughing in front of the giant hispanic boy. The butterball then let out another belch but this time a faint fart could be heard from within Trevor's sweatpants, followed by a wetter louder fart. Soon even Trevor was giggling between farts and burps.<br>\r\nAs the big boy was passing gas, Joey and Adam noticed something wonderful. Trevor's paunch had shrunk from it's stuffing, but it now certainly had some beautiful hispanic flab on it. It started hanging over the young boy's tight sweatpants. In all the excitement, a certain belly button had become an outie. Trevor's shirt now not only had to deal with an expanding stomach, but also with a pair of boy breasts that had a squishy and chubby look under the shirt now. Trevor's face looked even more squashed between his two lovely lard filled cheeks. He now looked a version of himself that had been blown up by a pump, which was good because now he looked like he could hold the gas that every big boy should be able to hold.<br>\r\nJoey hugged his mom.\" Oh thank you for making him a big burp and fart boy. He is so adorable!\"<br>\r\nTrevor smiled and let out a big belch to agree to this.<br>\r\nJoey and Adam began to rub Trevor's belly, lovingly stroking it's bloated sides.<br>\r\n\"mommy? Joey spoke up.<br>\r\n\"Yes honey?\"Joeys mom answered,<br>\r\nJoey paused to look at the flatulent boy then turned back \"I've been thinking... can we make Trevor...?\"</span></div></div>",

He couldn't think why though, he had finished his dinner, and pudding, and even had a snack, but still he was hungry. Luke turned over in his bed, and tried to go to sleep, trying to put the pangs out of his mind, but they refused to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after trying to go to sleep for what seemed an age, he decided that he had to get something to eat. Gingerly, he tiptoed accross the carpet of his bedrrom, and eased the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for a moment so that his eyes adjusted to the gloom, he continued slowly down the hall, desperate to not make any noise. At the top of the stairs, he grabbed hold of the banister, and quietly descended the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his foot hit the floor at the bottom, Luke let go of the banister, and headed to his left, towards the kitchen. He slowly and gently opened the kitchen door, and slipped through, closing it quickly and quietly behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Luke couldn't believe his luck. His mother was always telling him to eat healthily, and restricted the size of his meal portions, as she did with his younger sister. But now he had all the food in the house at his disposal. Or did he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better not have too much of one thing, mum'll notice,\" he whispered to himself, and decided to take a small amount of a few things. He opened one of the cupboards, and began rumaging for the biscuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly found them, and removed several from the packet, eating them absent-mindedly.

Buddy responded with a low whine, and Luke tensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, buddy, keep quiet. I'll get you some food. And Luke opened up another cupboard, pulling out one of the many cans of dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a fork, he prised open the ring-lid, and scooped half of the can into Buddy's bowl, which the Labrador dug into almost immediatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke picked out four more biscuits from the packet, and slowly munched through them quietly. He picked up the half-full can of dog food, and replaced it in the cupboard, but just as he closed the door, something caught his eye. Another, half-full can of dog food, from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oops, Mum's going to notice two open cans.' Luke realised, and tried to think of a solution, eating some more of the biscuits as he pondered. Finally, he came to the conclusion that he would have to feed buddy the rest of the can, that way, no one would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke tipped the rest of the food into Buddy's bowl, and the dog paused for a second, and looked up at him in the gloom of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, eat up Buddy,\" Luke whispered to his dog, and Buddy resumed eating. \"Good boy Buddy, that's it,\" encouraged Luke quietly, and stroked his dog's tummy and side, feeling the smoothness of the fur under his fingers. As Buddy ate, Luke stood up, and walked back over to the counter top where the packet of biscuits was. Picking up the packet, he noticed how light it now felt, and felt the side of it, counting five biscuits left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bugger,' he thought, 'she's going to notice this too.' Luke remembered what he did a few minutes ago, and finished off the remaining biscuits. He placed the empty wrapper and dog food can in the bin, gave Buddy one last scratch behing his ears, and retreated from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly and quietly negotiated the stairs and hallway, before ending up back in his room. After one big yawn, he plopped down into his bed, and pulled the duvet over him. His hunger now sated, his hands rested on his belly, now slightly firmer than before his 'little snack'. Luke closed his eyes, and drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Three more nights, he crept down to the kitchen again and had another midnight snack. At the end of the week, as he was getting ready for a bath, he caught sight of himself in the mirror. Luke paused for a moment, checking the minor changes to his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach, which used to curve inwards slightly, now went flatly down to his lap, and his abdominal muscles were starting to be covered by fat. His ribs were disappearing too, and the rest of his body had plumped up, though by only a very small amount. Luke saw the changes, and was surpsrised, as he did not expect the weight to pile on so quickly. He wasn;t worried however, and did not therefore check how much weight he had put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke continued to gorge slowly over the final week of his school holiday. Another four midnight snacks, and once again he snuck occasional extra food from the kitchen with his meals. At the end of the week, on Sunday night, with just one night left before he returned to school, he dicided once again to have a thorough look at his progress, and headed for the bathroom. The eight year old undressed to his underwear, and stood before the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing a curious expression, marvelling at how fast his body had changed. Just two weeks before, his stomach curved slightly inwards, and his abdominal muscles were slightly visible. His ribs poked out before, and his faced was quite thin and bony, as were his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, as he stood before the mirror in his underwear, he saw the changes. His tummy now curved out slightly, and his belly button was deeper. Luke ran his fingers over his smooth skin, and felt the silky-to-touch layer of flab that he had aquired. His ribs had now been enveloped somewhat too, as they were barely visible. His legs and butt had also grown slightly, as had his face, which was now adorned with the beginnings of a double chin. Luke decided to see just how much he had gained, slighly worried at what the outcome would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale climbed as hs stepped on it. The digital readout finally stopped on 52lbs. Fifty two lbs! Four pounds in two weeks! Luke though for a second, about whether or not he should be upset by his gain. But then he remembered how good it felt for his belly to be full again, as for the proceeding year, his mother had tried to keep her children in shape, and cut down portion sizes, often leaving Luke hungry. He looked down at his new tummy, and absent mindedly stroked it. This also felt good, he thought, and he smiled. He shouldn't be worried, or unhappy. If it felt good it was good, and he got off the scale, still stroking his slightly fleshy midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke pulled up his trousers, and noticed for the first time since he could remember, the waistband was cutting into him slightly. But that was fine, his new weight was bound to make his clothes feel slightly tighter. He pulled on his loose shirt, and was thankful for its bagginess. He would have a hard time explaining this new belly to his mother if it poked out or strained it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back to his room, lay down on his bed, and started watching the TV in his room while eating some crisps. Buddy nudged the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Buddy,\" Luke said to his dog, and patted area on the bed to his right. Buddy yipped happily, and padded over to him, jumping up onto the bed. The combined weight of boy and canine made the matress go down slightly, as the springs adjusted. Buddy lay down next to Luke, and his owner began stroking and petting his beloved Labrador, running his hands over his smooth, short fur. As Luke's hand reached Buddy's belly, he felt the new fat that Buddy had gained. It was soft and pillowy, and felt good under Lukes fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy had always been of normal size before the first 'little snack', but that had all changed after. Luke had started giving him lots of table scraps, and when it was feeding time, Luke always gave Buddy extra. Plus, on the nights when Luke had a midnight snack, Luke put something down for his Labrador. After all, pudgier dogs are cuter, Luke would think, and it was hardly doing him any harm. Buddy's belly was now distened slightly, hanging a little when he walked, whereas before it curved upwards. His waist was losing the battle against the flab, and his haunches were wider too. But Buddy was happy, and so was Luke, although it meant that Buddy almost expected food when he saw Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke watched until it was his bedtime, stroking Buddy's growing tummy. He went downstairs, said goodnight to Mum, and returned to his room. He slipped into his pyjamas, and noticed that the bottoms felt tighter around his waist than before. He loosened the drawstring, and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Luke woke up, hungry again. He tiptoed into the kitchen, and began his feast, eating several small cakes, and a packet of rice crispie squares, and put down a packet of ham slices for Buddy, before going back to bed, hunger sated once again. Luke lay awake for a little while in his bed, caressing his slightly bulbous midsection, before finally dropping off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

As he got up, he noticed that his stomach had gone down slightly after his food binge the previous night, but his pyjamas definitly felt tighter than when he first put them on the night before. He went downstairs quite quickly, to go and get his breakfast. When he got into the kitchen, he noticed that no one else was up, as his Mum and sisters would usually be havong their breakfast right about that time. Puzzled, Luke looked at the clock on the microwave. 5:00 AM. Feeling his tummy rumble slightly, Luke decided to have breakfast anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the counter, and pured himself out a full bowl of cereal, very full bowl. He added the milk, and sat down at the table to eat it. As he finished, he saw Buddy stirring in the corner. He put the empty bowl in the dishwasher, and went over to his dog, stroking the top of Buddy's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleepy,\" he whispered, and Buddy licked his hand affectionately in return. Luke went to the cupboard, to out a can of dog food, and set some down for Buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, pal,\" he said, and left Buddy to eat his own breakfast, going back upstairs to get a little bit more sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two hours later, Luke woke up again, this time to the sound of his alarm clock at half past seven. He went downstairs again, to tell his Mum that he had already had breakfast, and that she shouldn't make any for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are Luke,\" said his Mum happily as he walked into the kitchen. She was a little bit shorter than average, with brown hair and brown eyes like Luke. She was also quite thin at 130 lbs, and had a warm, loving personality. \"I've made you some toast for breakfast, if you don't mind not having cereal,\" she continued, placing 6 pieces of taost on a plate infront of him. Luke decided that he might as well not tell anyone that this would be his second breakfast, and liked the idea that his parents were actually giving him extra food. He picked up a piece, and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Luke, you look a little bit tired?\" asked his little sister, Alice. She was six years old, and had the same eyes and hair as Luke. She used to be quite plump, but then their parents intervened with a healthy eating plan, which they also made Luke follow. She had lost most of her excess fat, but still retained a little bit, as she weighed 45 lbs, the extra weight settling in her slightly chubby belly and round butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke loved her dearly, especially when she used to be chubby. He thought for a second, about whether it was her influence on him that was making him want to get fatter, and realised that it was. But, as he was so close to his sister, he didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Alice,\" he answered, and continued to eat his toast. They continued to chat as they ate their breakfasts, and after Luke finished, he put his plate on the countertop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the toast, Mum,\" he called back into the kitchen, as he went upstairs to go and get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis school made everyone wear a uniform, which was a light blue polo shirt, with a royal blue jumper on top, and black trousers. He put the trousers on first. The last two weeks were a school holiday, so this was the first time since his 'little snacks' had begun, that he had put them on. His Mum had made sure that they fit him before, and had bought ones where the waist was around one inch bigger than his own, to allow for a little comfort space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, the waistband was cutting into him, and his tummy was pooching over the top slightly, by about half an inch, with the added burden of his snacking and two breakfasts. Luke was becoming less of a skinny little rail by the week. It was the same sort of ending when he put his polo shirt on over the top. Again, his Mum had made sure that the top fitted him around the waist before, but now his belly was beginning to push outwards, and was pressing slightly against the shirt. Not by much, but it was enough to show his new body shape from the right angle. He put on his jumper, which thankfully hid his new additions. He put his shoes and socks on, and picked up his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went downstairs, ready to go to school. He picked up his lunch from the counter, gave his Mum a hug goodbye, and opened the door. Just as he stepped out, he heard his Mum calling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke, just wait a minute sweetie,\" and she picked up a second lunch that was on the counter, the one meant for his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice went with one of her friends to school, but she forgot to take her lunch with her. Could you try and find her please, and give it to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try Mum,\" Luke said, and she swooped down to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Luke. If you can't find her, then just throw it away, she'll probably be able to ask for school dinners,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke stepped out of the door, and looked back to close it. He saw him Mum scooping out some dog food from a can, and putting it in Buddy's bowl, as the Labrador circled beneath, hungry for more food. Luke smiled, and closed the door, heading for school.</span></div></div>",

That wouldn't do if he was supposed to hide his body shape. His mind debated a tiny bit.<br>\r\n(But I'm still hungry.)<br>\r\nNo, your parents will find out.<br>\r\n(I could say that I didn't find her.)<br>\r\nThey can tell when you're lying.<br>\r\n(But I'm still hungry!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a few minutes, Luke dug into the paper bag for Alice's sandwich. Taking a bite out of it, he started walking again. The way to school was a decent enough of a distance that he could finish Alice's lunch and reach school on time without being seen by other students. And so he did, feeling full afterwords but surprisingly not sick. Not hungry, not sick, just full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now can anyone tell me how to use a preposition?\"<br>\r\n Luke didn't bother paying attention. The waistband of his trousers had begun to be very painful! (Maybe I shouldn't have had Alice's lunch after all.)<br>\r\nHis friend, Dave, passed him a note that read, Are you alright, mate? Luke nodded, now glancing at the clock. 10:00? It was only morning? Luke groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 2, Luke couldn't take it anymore. He raised his hand, as the teacher called on him. \"May I please go to the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n\"Take a hallpass.\" <br>\r\nLuke rushed up to take the hallpass, to find that he wasn't as fast as he used to be, but pushed that thought away as he ran as fast as he could to the bathroom. Quickly finding a stall, he tried to push to trousers outward to accommodate him, not that it had worked. Though his throbbing stomach did feel slightly better. Therefore, Luke left the bathroom, now feeling only slightly uncomfortable. Just as he left, the bell rang loudly, signaling for the students to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luke frowned at what he saw his ribs could no longer be seen under his new layer of fat. At one time Luke had been able to, with no straining, put both of his hands around his ankle and they overlapped. Now when he tried to put his hand around his ankle the fingertips where a good quarter inch apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face now was quite pudgy had a real definition of a double chin something he found hard to hide but manged by elevating his chin if his mother or friends were around.

She had been quite shocked but had said nothing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school it was now an effort to get up from his desk and the teacher thought she had noticed. \"Luke?\" she was talking to him before lunch \" Are you feeling all right?\" .

Luke got a bag of chips and layed down on the couch to chow down. He noticed how little the chips did to fill him and felt a bit of pride that he was able to eat so much. He put his hand on his belly and rubbed it, smiling at the softness. Luke looked around and decided that if he was home alone he could really do whatever he wanted. Luke took off his shirt to look at his belly. When sitting, the ball of flab stuck out generously onto his lap and a bit off both sides which had grown a few stretch marks. He had grown a nice pair of moobs that rested on his belly, drooping down a bit. Luke realized he could fit several chips in the roll between his belly and moobs, an idea he giggled at after doing. His legs had grown thicker so that they touched when he sat. Luke rubbed his thighs together and felt them jiggle, which also made him smile. Overall Luke loved his fat and loved the chips that would help give him new fat to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy trotted over and jumped onto the couch with Luke, on the other side of him than the chips. Normally his mom wouldn't allow the dog on the couch but hey, she wasn't there! Luke patted his dog and rubbed behind his ears. He noticed that although Buddy had been on the diet for a few days he had already begun to lose weight. His belly which once distended downwards had begun to retract and the roll of fat accumulating arpund his collar was receding. Part of this was because Buddy hadn't been eating at all! The new diet dog food Luke's mom had been giving him must taste aweful because Buddy wouldn't touch it, and every night he'd go to bed with full dog bowl and an empty stomach. Luke passed the bag of chips over to Buddy, realizing he wasn't the only one who got to gain weight this week! Buddy stuck his head in and chomped on the chips happily, enjoying the greasy snack. Between the two greedy gluttons the chips were soon depleted. Luke went and got some more food for ___________ </span></div></div>",

On the other hand, he knew his little sis, if he did let her eat with him, she\u2019d tell their mom and would be in a lot of trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally decided if he was going to get caught, he might as well make them both happy. He patted the floor next to him, telling her to sit by him, while he opened the bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice grinned and sat down, happy to finally be able to pig out again as both kids began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mother seemed oblivious to his gaining, and in some ways helped him, by giving him extras or leftovers at the major meal times. Between those times Nick made sure he was snacking, using his pocket money to buy candy and crisps from the local supermarket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went down to the bathroom in his undies to check out the changes. He noticed his once flat, rib showing belly was no longer. It had become spherical, and firmish. He prodded a finger into it, but it would not sink in. His arms and legs were starting to get chubby, as was his face. His undies hugged his swollen butt. He then cradled his arms under his belly, as if he was pregnant. He was really enjoying the shape his belly was becoming, although wasn't too sure about the gains elsewhere on his body. He turned around to leave the bathroom when he saw Alice, his 6 year old sister, staring at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was once fat, but had lost most of the weight. However she was still a little chubby, especially around her belly. For a 6 year old she was pretty bright and observant. She had noticed that Luke had been gaining, but kept it quiet from her mother. She stood there, her belly stretching the front of her top slightly, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, someone has been a hungry boy,\" she said, staring at Luke's bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, oh, yeah,\" he said embarrassingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I wont tell. You are enjoying yourself, and you don't look too bad with that extra weight,\" she said, walking up to him and rubbing his swollen belly. His belly let a little gurgle go off in response. \"But you got to slow down on feeding Buddy, that is really getting obvious and don't want him getting unwell, and costing mum money,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" said Luke, amazed that his sister wasn't upset about his gaining. He walked back to his bedroom, with the plan on snacking on the doughnuts he brought earlier that week. He closed his door so his sister would not watch. He cracked open the hard plastic lid to the doughnuts and started eating them. Each one went down quickly, one after another. About halfway through the packet he stopped and tried to catch his breath. By now his belly had become really distended, blocking his view of his feet. His belly groaned in pain as the doughnuts barely fitted in his 8 year old belly, with the rest of the food he has eaten. He moaned from the pain from his belly, but looked over at the doughnuts, wondering if he could fit more in. He was starting to feel sleepy from eating, plus he was partly immobile with his swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw his door knob turn</span></div></div>",

I thought you always wanted to be thinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft! That was mum's idea. You know what a fitness nut she is, getting me to diet, checking my weight, etc,\" she said as she started the second doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't know that,\" said Luke, laying his head back on the pillow as his hands explored his swollen belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and thanks to you I don't feel so bad about slapping the weight on again,\" Alice said, patting his belly as she started on the third doughnut. Luke watched as his sister's belly expanded with each doughnut, stretching her top skin tight over her plump belly. She finished the third doughnut quickly and slowly ate the last one, panting and groaning as she swallowed the pieces. Once she had finished the doughnut, she fell back on the bed, belly sticking up in the air. She pulled up her top to expose her swollen belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, those doughnuts really did something to me,\" she said, slowly sliding up the bed so she was laying alongside her swollen brother. \"I almost look as big as you,\" she continued, pressing her belly against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how big do you want to get sis?\" asked Luke, feeling the weight of his belly when he tried to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how big we get before mum really complains,\" answered Alice, with an evil smile on her face.</span></div></div>",

He would wake up every morning at three or four to raid the downstairs kitchen and eat leftovers and some refrigerated and frozen desserts; he would go back to bed after his early binges. When he woke up at seven, his mom would make him a large breakfast. Little did his mother know that he had a feast hours earlier. He was then sent to school, where he usually bought a snack from the vending machines before class. During class Luke would notice that pudgy brunette girl was eying him recently. At the start of the month, he stocked up on his school's lunch passes, which allowed a 49 cents pass to be redeemed at lunch for 7 dollars of food per pass. Luke turned in 2 passes every lunch and spent all of the 14 dollars on the schools expanding selection of pastries, desserts and other sweets. Once Luke finished his huge bounty of desserts, he went around and asked his classmates if they had any food to spare. The only person who gave food to Luke was the brunette girl, who at first only have him some chips. But as time went on, chips turned to graham crackers, crackers turned to brownies, brownies turned to 2 slices of cake and a can of soda. <br>\r\nWhen he got home, his mom made a dozen muffins for him to eat. After eating the muffins, for the rest of the afternoon, Luke would gorge from his new candy stash. Since it was nearing Halloween, anyone could buy pounds upon pounds of calorie laden candy for only a few bucks. At dinner, his mom would make something hearty, such as steak, creamy pasta, or seafood; just to name a few. His mom was also bringing home rich cheesecakes; so rich that Luke and Alice get sugar rushes after only a bite or two. Luke would use his energy to binge on more food that his mom placed near him. For some reason, she liked seeing Luke sugar high.<br>\r\nThis would go on for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the month, Luke hopped on top of the bathroom scale and saw that he gained...</span></div></div>",

Luke took off his shirt and he looked down at his growing gut. He definitely wasn't a skinny boy anymore. He was somewhat chubby, with a new pot belly to match. There was much more of himself to squeeze and rub now, and he was also beginning to grow moobs.<br>\r\nAlice walked into the bathroom. \"Wow!\" She said. \"Your tummy is getting so squishy and soft!\" Alice said while touching his belly. \"Your going to get thick rolls if you keep this up.\" Luke blushed and put his shirt back on, which has been getting tighter around his belly recently. \"Are you gonna get mom to buy you new clothes soon?\" \"I dunno. I think mom only thinks I'm becoming a big boy, she doesn't think I'm becoming a fat boy, yet. I'm going to see how long these clothes last me.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you should get some looser wear soon, or your belly's going to be ripping shirts and popping buttons.\" Alice said. \"You should be the one worrying about new clothes, Miss Porksalot! Just look at what your wearing right now!\" Alice was wearing a pink tank-top and pajama shorts. Her tank was riding up on her rapidly expanding belly. Dispite her weighing less, because of her hight she looked just as chubby as Luke. Her way of indulging was different than Luke's. Instead of stuffing herself on the foods at home and building up a stash, she spent all day at her friends' house. Because every one of her friends were either overweight or obese, they had plenty of food around their house that they were willing to share.

He took a whiff of the sweet aroma of the room. The smell of pastries in the oven made Luke ravenous. He sat on his chair and saw that an entire devil's food cake was there just for him. His mom walked up to the cake and cut him a massive slice. \"All for you, my growing boy.\"<br>\r\nLuke bit into the cake, and boy, it tasted delicious.

Although there were some questions and thoughts that lingered in Luke's mind. For one, his mom didn't comment on how noticeably thicker he has gotten recently. Luke was also looking forward towards the four-day weekend that starts on Saturday. Although his mom was talking about how she might be away for the entire week on business. Since the current day is Wensday, he only has two more days to wait.<br>\r\nWhen the bell rang, Luke followed his classmates into the classroom. Since it was the end of the month, everyone in the class was assigned a new seat. Luke used to sit in a fairly unremarkable spot; next to some average boys and girls, as he sat behind a somewhat pretty girl. As Luke's new seat was assigned, he found out that his spot was significant becuase he sat next to:</span></div></div>",

She had long black hair with a cute chubby face. \"Here, have some more.\" Ally said. She handed him four more candy bars from a bag of her's. Two were milk chocolate, while one was dark chocolate, and the other had peanuts in them. Though Luke wasn't hungry, he was even somewhat full, he accepted them anyways because of impulse and he wanted to make Ally happy. \"Thanks for the chocolate. I could eat it all day even though I just had breakfast.\" Luke said.<br>\r\nSince there was a sub teaching the class who didn't have much to teach, the Luke and Ally pretty much talked the entire time. Throughout the school day, Ally kept offering Luke treat after treat after treat. He always accepted her offers and ate whatever she gave him.<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, there was a big pile of wrappers and crumbs on Ally's desk while there was an even bigger pile on Luke's desk.

Luke watched Ally eat the brownie. \"I could really go for some brownies right now.\" Luke thought. Ally noticed that Luke was starring at her. \"Would you like one?\" She asked. Luke nodded and licked his lips. She smiled and took out a large plastic box with at least a dozen large brownies inside. She handed Luke one and he took a bite into it. The brownie was incredibly rich. \"Woah, these are really sweet.\" Luke said. \"My mom makes them in her own special way.\" Ally said with a smile. Luke was continuing to realise why Ally was very heavy. After Luke finished the brownie, he asked for another. Ally happily handed him another and he ate it quickly.<br>\r\nLuke started feeling sluggish after his 8th brownie, but whether that he wanted to impress Ally, or exploit every opportunity to eat, one thing was certain: the brownies tasted great and Ally was watching him gorge and she kept happily handing him more of the calorie-packed brownies. <br>\r\nAfter his 14th brownie, Luke was stuffed beyond imagination but he was still motivated to keep going. \"Another please.\" Luke slowly moaned. \"You ate all of them, silly!\" Luke took a deep breath and rubbed his distended belly, which was slightly poking out of his shirt.

Luke took a while to leave the classroom because of how full his belly was. He eventually got back to his senses and left the room.<br>\r\nWhen Luke was looking around for a table, he found that most of the kids beat him to all of his usual seats. After looking around for a vacant seat for some time, he concluded that all the tables in his usual area, that the kids designate the \"boy area\", was completely filled up. Since sitting by himself and being a loner was out of the question, he decided to look towards the other areas. Luke passed by some of the other locations, such as the \"rich kid\" area, the \"little kid\" area, and \"fat kid\" area. Luke was unsure why people called the group the fat kids, because there are quite a few fat people distributed throughout the groups. <br>\r\nLuke finally reached the \"girl area\". Luke saw some familiar faces, such as his sister and a girl he used to like named Gwen. Luke liked Gwen until she started antagonizing him. Recently, she snickered about Luke's weight gains. He scanned the girl area until he spotted Alexandra. Luke approched her. \"Hi Ally, can I sit next to you?\" He asked. Ally smiled and replied, \"of course!\" Luke sat down next to her and pulled out his lunch. He was very suprised when he found that his lunch consisted of 3 pieces of chocolate cake. Luke was uncertain who packed the fattening lunch; it could have been his mom, his sister, or it could have been a mistake altogether, but Luke was very pleased. <br>\r\nWhile Luke and Ally ate their sugary desserts, er, lunches, they chatted for a while. Luke soon brought up that his mom was going on a week-long business trip starting the next day. <br>\r\n\"You could stay at my house for the week!\" Ally suggested. Luke replied-</span></div></div>",

Luke packed all his essentials; clothes, swim trunks, his toothbrush, and other trivial items. Unfortunately, since Luke hasn't been shopping for casual clothes for some time, his everyday ware was slightly snug, hugging his growing tummy. Luke wasn't sure to expect that week, but he was eager to find out. Luke and his mom soon arrived at his new best friend's house. \"Bye Luke. Have fun!\" His mom said and gave him a motherly kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n\"I will, mom.\" Luke said. He got out of the car, took his suitcase out, and waved goodbye, knowing that he'll be seeing her again the following week. His mom drove off and was gone. Luke walked towards Alley's house and took a look at it. The house was similar in size and structure to Luke's, but it still seemed foreign. Luke knocked on the door a few times and waited. He was about to knock again, but a smiling tubby girl opened the door. \"Luke!\" Ally gave him a welcoming hug. As she wrapped her arms around Luke, he felt how soft she was.\"It's so nice to see you!\" Ally said. \"C'mon in!\" Ally took Luke by the hand, which made him blush a bit, and led him into her home.<br>\r\n\"Mom! Luke's here!\" Ally said. \"You'll love my mom, she's very friendly to all my friends.\" Ally said. A pleasantly plump women with a smile across her face entered the foyer from the kitchen. <br>\r\n\"Hello! You must be the boy that Alexandra always talks about! I'm her mother, and I'll be glad to take care of you this week. I know Alexandra will be happy to take care of you as well!\" Ally's mom said. <br>\r\n\"Mom...\" Ally said sheepishly.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just joking, Alex.\" She took another look at Luke, his midriff in particular this time. \"Oh, wow...\"<br>\r\n\"What? What did I do?!\" Luke exclaimed with a hint of fear.<br>\r\nShe ran over to Luke and lifted up his shirt and then gently prodded his pudgy belly. \"You're all skin and bones! We've got to get a good meal or two into you! Alex, you can play with your tiny friend until I finish making his snack. Luke, what type of foods do you like?\" She asked. <br>\r\n\"I like desserts, I guess...\" Luke awkwardly replied.

Ally ran to her room to change while Luke scanned his suitcase for his trunks. Once he found them, he went to the nearby bathroom to change.<br>\r\nOnce he had his shirt off and his tight trunks on, he had doubts about showing his topless gut to Alllie. Since his trunks were from the days when Luke lacked the excess fat on his body, his wider hips gave off a clearly noticeable muffintop and thick love handles that he could hold on to. With the visibility of his ribs and abs long gone, the gained blubber made his midsection look soft and rounded. Above his belly were moobs which were very clear now and graspable. His arms were starting to look sausage-like and even girlish. Overall, while Luke didn't mind/somewhat enjoyed his own tubby figure, he wasn't sure what Ally would think of it.<br>\r\nWhen he opened the bathroom door and stepped out, he bumped right into Ally's plump and bare belly. Ally's tummy was quite the spectacle and Luke thought that she might be tipping the scales near 130 pounds. She was also wearing a bikini, which also showed off her plump legs, her fatty arms, and her chubby butt. After examining Ally, he noticed that he was in his tight trunks that showed off his belly. \"Look's like you've been eating a lot of desserts lately!\" Ally giggled while poking his doughy tummy. \"You're still pretty skinny though.\" She said while pinching his arm-fat. Ally went silent and started to feel Luke's plump love handles and gently shook his big belly.<br>\r\n\"Um, Ally?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh, what?<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize-\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Lets go to the pool.\" The tubby duo smiled at each other. Ally led the way to the pool. On the way, Luke poked his midsection and blushed. <br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the backyard, Ally cannonballed into the crystal-clear body of water and made a big splash while she was at it. Luke took a more cautious approach and climbed into the pool. During their time in the pool, the two playfully teased each other, talked and mildly flirted, and even swam for a minute or two. Because of how such bad shape they were in, after around an hour, both Ally and Luke were exhausted.<br>\r\nThen, Ally's mom-</span></div></div>",

Luke looked at her. \"Can you please dry my back?\" Because of how un-athletic and tubby she was, it was difficult for her to put her hands precisely around her back. As Luke dried her back, he felt how soft and smooth her skin was. <br>\r\nWhile still wearing their bathing suits, Luke and Allie walked into the dining room, ready to eat. Luke was flabbergasted to see how much food was on the table. Cakes, eclairs, and other miscellaneous goodies riddled the table. The rectangular table was moderately large with two chairs that where somewhat close together on one of the longer sides. <br>\r\n\"Yummy!\" Ally exclaimed. She quickly got in one of the chairs and immediately started to inhale brownies at a suprising pace.<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl!\" Ally's mom cooed. \"Eat up.\" She gently rubbed her overfed daughter's flabby back as she gorged.<br>\r\nLuke got in his chair, grabbed his plate, and looked at all the sweets on the table. Luke bit his lower lip. \"I don't even know where to begin...\" He thought to himself. <br>\r\n\"Here, let me get you started.\" Ally's mom cut him a gargantuan piece of cheesecake; a third of the large treat. An inviting grin shined at Luke. \"Enjoy.\" Luke licked his lips, clutched his fork with a fist, and dug into the thick, heavy dessert. It tasted fantastic. Luke quickly began to devour the fattening treat while Ally did the same with her's. <br>\r\nThe feast went on for some time. Every time Luke finished his oversized portion, Ally's mom eagerly plopped another on his plate. Not wanting to upset his hostess, despite his bloated belly's protests, he continued to gorge. While Ally's mom was fattening Luke up, Ally was happily pigging out in front of her growing friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the feast...</span></div></div>",

Like his own tummy, Ally's bare belly was bulging even more than it usually did. He was almost painfully full and Ally had eaten far more than he had. She must be horribly stuffed at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll rub your tummy Ally.\" The tubby boy replied, a little more enthusiastic than most boys would have been to rub a fat girl's bare stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth was Luke liked Ally. Actually that wasn't quite accurate. Although he didn't quite understand it completely, he REALLY liked Ally. Perhaps even stranger yet, he really liked the sight of her big tummy. Even now Luke was a little excited to get to rub and feel all over her bulging dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe offered her hand, seeing that she probably would need help getting up. Ally smiled at him and allowed him to get her to her feet. It took a bit of effort given how big she was and how stuffed Luke had become. It was something that didn't go unnoticed by Ally as she tried to gain some balance, a difficult task with her extra-fattened tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke slowly, but surely, helped his stuffed friend to the couch and let her lay back. The young boy old watched as the bloated little girl laid back, her belly jutting into the air like a mountain of blubber. He gave her a smile at this and began to slowly rub circles over Ally's big, bloated, tummy. All the while his own stomach was in plain view of the over-fed, 8 year old, girl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The seats in the classroom were connected to the desks, so Alex's fat spilled over onto the desk in front of him and over the sides, cramming him in cartoonishly. Compared to Alex's 130lb body, Luke's 80lbs seemed tiny! Finding himself curious, Luke asked Alex \"Do you always bring extra candy to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Alex grinned, showing his chocolate stained teeth, further accentuating his obesity. Alex's head was like a blob on his head, with no discernible neck. On top was a patch of clean cut, dark hair spiked forward. Were Alex thin, he'd have a traditionally very cute face, but at his size his face was... Something else. Alex grabbed his meaty side and gave it a good shake. \"Gotta keep from getting hungry before lunch, so my parents pack me plenty of snacks! If you ever want any, let me know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke grinned eagerly and nodded.

After putting them on, he saw how baggy they were.The waistband of his pants was at least 2 sizes to big for him. In the bag he found a  black belt. Putting that on his pants, he found that that kept his pants on.<br>\r\n    But why did she buy them so big? It's  like she was saying to Luke it's OK to get fat.<br>\r\n  He put the clothes way and lay back down in bed, eating the rest of the doughnuts, trying to figure things out. Should he ask, or just accept for now?</span></div></div>",

He decided not to say anything to his mum yet, because, how could he ask? And besides, he did like having the extra weight on him.  He went down the stairs just in time to hear the door  bang, and knew that was Alice leaving for the bus. Because of her age, the school needed to bus her. Luke could walk to school, if he wanted to.<br>\r\n  \"Morning Luke.\" said his Mum.\"Don't you look handsome in the new uniform.\"<br>\r\n    \"Yeah.\" he muttered as he sat down. \"They're a little big.\"<br>\r\n  \"Well, as I said, you're a growing boy, so this way, I wont have to buy them so often. I'll give the old ones to the charity shops.<br>\r\n  She gave Luke a big bowl of cereal and toast and jam. which he began to eat. She seemed pleased.She also offered him some chocolate milk instead of the regular white. He felt nice and full after that. <br>\r\n  \"Speaking of which,\" she said as she sat down next to him. \"I'm going to pick you up after school, and we'll go shopping  for some new play clothes for you to. \"<br>\r\n    \"But--What about Alice? \" asked Luke.<br>\r\n \"She's spending the night with friends, and they'll make sure she gets on the bus home from school tomorrow, so don't worry.\"  She paused for a moment  in thought. \" You know, with the weather getting colder, maybe you should ride it too.\"<br>\r\n  \"It's not that far, Mum, I can walk.\"<br>\r\n    \"Still, we don't want you getting sick. I'll call the school and make the arrangements.\"  When Mum said it like that, that settled it.<br>\r\n   She put his lunch in his backpack and gave it to him. \"I'll pick up up right outside the door , dear, OK? It'll be some special time, just the 2 of us. Have a good day.\" She kissed him and sent him out the door.<br>\r\n    On his way to school Luke notice his pack felt a little heavier than normal. He stopped and looked in it. The lunch his Mum had packed was more than she usually sent him with. . That's  why it was heavy.<br>\r\n  \"Oh well.\" said Luke as he pulled out a little something to eat along the way. He felt happy.  He had another as he went up the stairs to school.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He still was'nt sure why she had packed him so much. (not that he minded).<br>\r\n  His thoughts were interrupted by someone sitting next to him. It was his friend, John, with a school lunch tray.<br>\r\n \"Hey, Mate.\"said John, amicably. \"How're doing?\"<br>\r\n  \"Fine.\" replied back Luke. \"You?\"<br>\r\n  \"Smashing!\" <br>\r\n  \"What, your Mum forget your lunch today?\" asked Luke.<br>\r\n  \"Nope.\" replied John.<br>\r\n  \"Then where is it?\"<br>\r\n  \"Here.\" John pulled up his jumper and shirt to show his bulging stomach.

If you eat yours fast enough you'll still have time to get a tray..\"    <br>\r\n  Luke did his best to eat his lunch as quickly as he could. John also wolfed down his tray meal. Neither of them spoke, just enjoying the gorging. John finished and leaned back in his chair, his stuffed stomach visible through his clothes.<br>\r\n  When Luke finished he looked at the wall clock and saw 15 minutes left for lunch.

The boring day at school and the big lunch left him a little sluggish, so we was a little slow getting there. Mum opened the car door for him, asked him how his day was, and all that. They chatted a little on their way to the store.<br>\r\n \"Oh, by the way, you start to ride the bus tomorrow, so make sure to get up in time.\"<br>\r\n   Luke didn't say much in the store. Mum went through and asked him about what he would like. Some nice T-shirts, and striped polos. A few jumpers. She got him the cargo pants he liked, with a belt. Jeans and socks and underwear. Then a couple of hooded sweatshirts. All of this went into the cart. Mum seemed happy about them. <br>\r\n  After that they went over to the changing rooms. <br>\r\n  \"Try them all and and make sure that there's enough room in them for you to be comfortable, OK?\"<br>\r\n  Luke took all the clothes into the room and began trying them on. It was the first time his Mum hadn't come in with him. He wondered if that was good or bad. Good, he decided, as he took off his clothes. His stomach was looking bigger, and his thighs were coming together. He had developed boy bosoms. He had serious love handles . If Mum saw this, she would completely kill me, he thought. <br>\r\n   As he tried on the clothes, he noticed that they all were just a size or so large for him. Just like his uniform. This puzzled him. Again, it was like his Mum was planning on him getting fatter. He heard his Mum talking to someone out in the hall as this was going on. It was another woman, he could tell that. After he tried on the last of the clothes, he put his uniform back on and came out. His Mum was talking to another woman. At the same time, another boy came out of a changing room. It was his friend, John.<br>\r\n  \"Oh, Hi, Luke!\"<br>\r\n  \"Yeah, Hi, John!\"<br>\r\n   \"Oh so this is your Luke!\" the woman said. \"Well, he looks like a great boy. And he knows John!\" <br>\r\n  \"Luke, this is Mrs. Danbury. Your father and her husband were best friends before they passed away. They were best men at each others weddings.\"<br>\r\n  \"Luke, You have simply must come over for the weekend, John would love it, wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n    \"Yes, Luke, please come.\"<br>\r\n  Luke looked up at his Mum with an inquiring look in his face.<br>\r\n   \"Yes Luke, Go visit John for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n    \"Sure\" said Luke.<br>\r\n  Both mothers shared knowing smiles, as if some secret was being past between them.The ladies let the boys go to the toy dept. for a bit while they chatted. After a while they came and got them. Mum paid for Luke's new clothes and they made their way out to the car.  On the way home, Luke's stomach growled a bit. She looked at the time. <br>\r\n  \"Oh, I'm sorry, Luke, I forgot about dinner. You must be starved. Well, there's no time to make anything for you at home, so guess what? You get to pick where we go to dinner!\"<br>\r\n    \"Really?\" said Luke. \"Anyplace I want?\"<br>\r\n    \"Sure, Honey, it's my treat. What would you like?\"<br>\r\n     Luke thought about it for a moment.<br>\r\n    \" I want......  </span></div></div>",

He loved them, and could never  get enough of them when they had them.<br>\r\n  \"Sure, Luke.\" replied his Mum. \"In fact, I know just the place.\"<br>\r\n  Ten minutes later they were sitting in a nice cafe, and Luke was looking at the choices of the pancakes he could have. <br>\r\n  \"I can really have anything I want?\"<br>\r\n \"Yes, of course. But remember, it's wrong to waste food, so you have to eat everything.\"<br>\r\n  Luke ordered a full stack of pancakes, with fruit and honey. It came with bangers. They chatted a bit (luckily, Luke had no homework that night) while the order was made. Soon they came, stacked high, with strawberries and whipped cream. He saw the honey in a little pitcher on the side. 2 large bangers were on theplate next to them. Mrs.Jones just had coffee and a bage' Luke poured the honey over the pancakes, then couldn't hold back. Grabbing a knife and fork, he dove into them.<br>\r\n  Mrs. Jones sipped her coffee and watched as her son ate. Luke's stomach capacity was growng. That much was clear. Everthing she had learned was working. She knew Luke had been gaining weight. She had planned it. It's what she wanted. <br>\r\n  15 minutes later there was an empty plate and a very full boy. He walked sluggishly out to the car, like he had leaving school. On the way home, she noticed him slowly nodding off, then finally, being overtaken by sleep. Mrs. Jones also noticed Luke's bulging stomach, even through the loose fitting uniform. She smiled . <br>\r\n   She didn't wake him when they got home. It was too good of an opporunity. First, she let Buddy out in the back yard. Then she got Luke out of the car and carried him in. Even in his sleep, he instintively put his arms around her in a hug. Shifting her arms on him, she was able to feel how soft he had gotten. No longer a scrawny boy. First, she went to the bathroom and weighed them both.<br>\r\n   After that, she went in and laid him on his bed. Laying down, his stomach was emphasized more. She went to her room and came back with 2 things. A camera and a tape measure. Slowly, she lifted his shirt and jumper, to reveal his stomach in all it's glory. Grateful that Luke was a heavy sleeper, she edged the tape under his back and pulled it up, so she could measure how round it was. She also measured it from the bottom of his ribs to his belt. All the time, she also took pictures. She then put his clothes back the way they were and left him to sleep She then went to the scale again and weighed herself. Simple math told Luke's weight gain.<br>\r\n  In her room she logged onto a special website. Her old friend Mrs. Danbury had told her about it. It was a site for parents who wanted to make their kids fat. They shared advice, pictures, progress. Everything was shared, and they were self policed. She called her section \"Luke's Log\". She had been trying to talk about his progress, But now she had real data.<br>\r\n She listed his current weight next to his starting weight. After that, she posted the pictures she had taken. By them were other pictures ot \"skinny Luke.\"  <br>\r\n  While Luke was at the Danbury's this weekend, she was going to have a few things installed that would make tracking his progress easier. Again, this was all advise from Mrs. Danbury. She used the same items to help keep track of John's progress.<br>\r\n   After posting, she went downstairs, and let Buddy back in. Naturally, he went for Luke's bedroom. She cracked the door and saw that Luke had shifted on his side. Buddy had taken his usual spot next to the bed. Satisfied that all was well, she went to her room  and got ready for bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After he got home, he changed out of his uniform into regular clothes, and got his homework done without so much as a complaint. The plan had been for him to be dropped off Friday night and picked up Sunday afternoon. his mum had already packed a bag with all he needed, so he was ready to go.<br>\r\n  Even though the Danbury's lived just a few doors up. he was driven to the house. John met him at the door. The smell of something wonderful cooking greeted Luke's nose.<br>\r\n  \"Mum's cooking lasagna tonight!\" John told Luke. \"It's great! C'mon to my room.\" They went to John's room. He had a large bed, which they would have to share, bean bag chairs, books, toys, DVD and a video game system. Everything to keep them happy. It didn't take long for Luke to settle in.  They spent some time picking out DVD's and games to play  when Mrs. Danbury told them to come to dinner.<br>\r\n  Luke sat down and saw on his plate a huge piece of multi layer lasagna. Lots of thick cheese and meat. It smelled great. Mrs. Danbury also put down a piece of garlic bread, then served John. She told them to go ahead, and both boys began to eat. When Luke took his first bite, it was the most wonderful thing he had ever tasted. Next thing he knew the plate was empty. Embarrassed, he  looked over at John, who also had an empty plate. He was smiling.<br>\r\n \"Told you it was good. Want more?\"<br>\r\n Luke couldn't believe he had eaten that big piece, but found himself nodding. Mrs. Danbury happily put another piece on, and the boys dove into them. Luke could feel his stomach pressing up against his belt, stretching. He leaned back in his chair when he was done. <br>\r\n   \" Why don't you two go to John's room for a bit?\" said Mrs. Danbury. \"I'll bring in dessert in a while. Chocolate ice cream.\"<br>\r\n Both boys got up, leaving Mrs. Danbury to clean up. The high fat cheese and meat is just what is needed, she thought. I'll send the tip off on the website.<br>\r\n  Meantime, both boys flopped down in the beanbag chairs, digesting their meals. Neither spoke  for a few minutes. Luke looked over at John.

Two large boy bosoms were on his chest, clearly visible. Below them, his stomach bulged out and sagged over his waist in a droop. There was a modest ring of fat around his waist, and Luke could see prominent love handles. Even though he couldn't see his butt in the chair, Luke knew it must have grown as well. <br>\r\n  Looking at his thighs, they looked rounder than before. It really wasn't that long ago that they had swam, Luke thought. John's really gotten bigger.<br>\r\n    John noticed Luke looking at him. <br>\r\n   \"What?\"<br>\r\n  \"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n  But Luke kept looking at him.<br>\r\n  \"Luke, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n \"Have you noticed something?\"<br>\r\n   \"What\"<br>\r\n  Uh--how much- bigger you've gotten??<br>\r\n  John smiled, and patted his stomach. \"Yup.

She saw him in there sleeping, a smile on his face. She was a little disappointed that he hadn't weighed himself after coming back from John's. That way, with the new scale, she could see how much he had gained.  No matter. He'll weigh himself sooner or later. She wanted a new measurement on him.<br>\r\n   She went into his room and carefully pulled back the duvet. What she saw was pleasing.<br>\r\n When she bought Luke his new clothes, she hadn't thought of pajamas. He was still wearing the old ones. Before he could wear the pants up by his naval, but now he couldn't. His top was tight on him. The buttons over the bulge of his stomach were straining.  She wondered how long it would be before they popped altogether.  Probably not long.<br>\r\n  She got the tape and ran it under his back and did the measuring. The same for measuring from the bottom of his ribs to his waist. It was a 4 inch gain around since last time. Great progress.  She placed her hand on his soft belly and pressed carefully. She loved the feel of it. She wanted to poke it, but she was afraid it would wake up Luke .A  few pictures were taken, and then she went to download everything to the website.<br>\r\n  Luke would be a fat ball of a boy. No matter what.     </span></div></div>",

All sweets and high calorie goodies. <br>\r\n  When she got home, she stashed away everything until after bedtime, whens he could put out the food for Luke to find. She also had a container of heavy cream available instead of milk. She wasn't' sure  how much to leave out for him. his capacity had grown a lot, at the same time, she didn't' want to overstuff him either. She left out what she thought  would be enough. She figured Luke would stop when he was full. She went into her bedroom, turned on the camera, and waited. <br>\r\n  About midnight there was action. Luke. He was in the same pajamas he had on before, so the top wasn't done up. He wandered over to the cupboard and saw the food on top.  His eyes lit up! Smiling, he grabbed an armload and placed them on the table and began to peel the labels off and shove them in his mouth. Down went biscuits, chocolates, small cakes, and other treats. <br>\r\n  Mrs. Jones watched Luke gorge himself with a sense of pride. Also wonder. Luke was an eating machine. His stomach swelled out in front of him. Chocolate was on his lips and cheeks. <br>\r\n   Luke slowed down and then stopped his binge. He hadn't eaten everything, but he had tried. He went to the fridge and drank some of the heavy cream.  Then <br>\r\nhe cleaned up the wrappers. He had troubles with the ones on the floor because of his  swollen stomach. Then he went back to bed.<br>\r\n   Mrs. Jones  had recorded Luke's binge. it was downloaded to his special site. She went into the kitchen and saw how much Luke had eaten. Now she had an idea how much he could truly eat if left on his own. <br>\r\n    She went into Luke's' room and saw him sleeping. His stomach was like a big round balloon rising up from his body. he had truly stuffed himself. Mrs.Jones  put her hand on it and felt firmness beneath the plumpness.  Luke's face was still covered with food. Mrs.Jones  got a washcloth and carefully washed Luke's face, then kissed him.</span></div></div>",

He ripped the back of the van and scooped all into his mouthful before swallowing to make a huge burp, causing it to rattle the city as it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he drops the van back to the ground and crushed it with his barefeet with ease and a smile if his face when he giggles would tell anything he know from his dream.

I know you're nice and fat right now, but really, I think you could be bigger.  Much bigger. We'll take care of that right now.\"<br>\r\n   Something started flowing from the tube into Luke. The effect on his body was immediate. His stomach swelled out, followed by he rest of his body. Luke realized his body was actually getting round. He didn't feel any pain, just a sense of fullness. His waistband popped open.  His Mum smiled as she saw the results on Luke's body. <br>\r\n   His clothes were literally skin tight on his growing body, then started ripping, and still he grew...<br>\r\n  Luke woke up, feeling his body.

She could retrieve it later at her convenience. Luke would step on the scale, and he would never know she's keeping track of it.<br>\r\n She had discussed this all with Mrs. Danbury on the phone the night before. This is how she kept tabs on tabs on John. Others on the website also did the same thing.

She saw how nice they looked with the extra weight on them, and called Mrs. Danbury, to see how she fatten up Dylan, whom she thought was way too scrawny.<br>\r\n  It was nice to have another member of their group, but her concern was Luke.

In there, he was still trying to get dressed. He stood there trying to get his uniform pants done up.  The first thing she noticed about him was that his overall thinness had softened a bit.  His arms had a little meat on them.  A small belly had formed already. <br>\r\n Over the week she had fed him  larger meals every time. Each time, she had the weight gain powder in it. Dylan had eaten them with no problem, and in a couple of dinners, asked for seconds. It was all perfect. Now here was something to show already.<br>\r\n  \"I can't do up my pants, Mum.\" said Dylan, showing how he couldn't do it.<br>\r\n \"No, looks like you can't.\" she said with a slight smile on her face. \"Try your other ones.\"  Dylan tried on his other uniform pants one by one with the same results. <br>\r\n \"What happened? They fit a while ago.\"<br>\r\n \"Oh, you're just having a growth spurt, that's all. Happens to all boys. You'll have to take a day off of school today, and we'll get you some new ones.\"<br>\r\n  \"Skip school?\" The idea was foreign to Dylan. He loved school so much.<br>\r\n \"Well. you can't go to school with no uniform, right?\" Dylan agreed. \"Don't worry, we'll do something fun today too.\"<br>\r\n  Just then Dylan's stomach rumbled.

Naturally, this left him sporting something of a tummy through his early years of school. Danny didn't notice or find himself particularly bothered by it and his 'growing boy' appetite meant that he found it harder and harder to squeeze his rounded belly into his school uniform. However, his parents did mind it, not wanting their son to grow up unhealthily, and as Danny crossed the threshold into Extra Large sized clothes, they acted, and cut down on the amount of sugary and fatty foods that he ate. He stuck to their plan, admittedly under threat of losing his pocket money, and as a result the flab melted off his frame to leave a normal, if slightly gangling Danny. Now that Danny is entering secondary school, and after a few years of good behaviour in battling the bulge, his parents have decided that they can trust him to have the school's cafeteria food instead of packed sandwiches, and the now 5', ninety pound pre-teen has virtually free reign over what he eats away from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, age 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom has always been a very sporty little boy. From the age of seven he played football for his school, and always excelled in PE classes, even if he was a little behind in other subjects like english and maths. He was also one of the most popular kids in his class, laughing and joking with his friends, and was the object of many a girl's crush. However, a less savoury side to his character was the teasing he gave to the slower, nerdier, less athletic children in his year. During the last match that the school played while Tom was in Year Five, he had beaten the opposing team's midfield with a somewhat fluked dummy, and was streaking towards the goal. However, he didn't count on the defenders, and Tom's opportunity ended with a heavy tackle, during which his slightly hefty opponent landed on his leg. He tried to get up and continue, but fell back after putting a trying amount of weight on the injured foot, and was stretchered off to hospital, his mother by his side. The doctors found that the awkward angle fo the fall put a hairline fracture in his left fibula, though not all the way across. The injury wasn't too severe, but his leg was still put in a cast, and he was out of action for five weeks, and advised to take it easy for the rest of the summer holidays, which had begun a few days after the match. During his recovery, Tom's mother had doted on her poor baby, making sure that he got plenty to eat in order to 'keep his strength up'. This, combined with an almost complete lack of physical activity for the six weeks, meant that Tom has lost a good deal of his athletic build. He isn't fat by any means, but he has lost some of his muscle tone, and replaced it with fat to give him a slightly filled out look for his final year at primary school.</span></div></div>",

Again, they don\u2019t wanna hurt his feeling, so they shrugged and made the response with the smiles as much as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm... sure!  We\u2019ll come over to yours.\u201d  Sam first spoke out with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!  Besides, you wanna get bigger and stronger to get back to the team, if that\u2019s your aim?\u201d  Mark replied also with a curious look to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan, and I cannot wait to play with you guys soon.\u201d  Tom blushed with a thumbs up when the school bell rang and it was back to class once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing usual from school work as the bell rang for the final time of the day, and students are go home to refresh themselves to the end of the day.  For Tom though, he was looking forward to have his two best friends coming over when his mother would....</span></div></div>",

Or that had been the plan anyway. His mum, a nurse, had been called back on shift \u2013 again \u2013 and now wouldn\u2019t be home until late this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, or unluckily, depending on perspective, Tom\u2019s eldest brother had somehow been co-opted to escort the three boys to McDonalds, and home again afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019cha having\u201d Tom said to Sam and Mark, and the three of them crowded around the electronic cashier scrolling through the options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuh\u201d Sam hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheeseburger and fries\u201d Mark said confidently, \u201cand a chocolate milkshake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...\u201d Sam said, still thinking, \u201cthe same... no, yes.

He couldn't help feeling a little peeved when Sam's hand went in for left overs too; perhaps Tom should have ordered nuggets as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three finished yet\" said a heavy voice with a deep sigh.

Despite all three having eaten at McDonalds - some more than others, of course - none were willing to forgo the sugar, of sweets, cake and chocolate. Not least Sam, who was already chomping on a chocolate bar, not thirty seconds after finishing a generious portion of chocolate spunge cake; and though Mark so far had only dug in to the skittles, it was Tom proving to be the gannet. After an equally generious portion of chocolate cake, with ice-cream, Tom had already demolished one chocolate bar, and was on to a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you, but I'm stuffed\" Mark said, wiping cake crums off his face. Though he'd eaten less, he had managed to polish off half a pack of skittles, a bit of chocolate and some cake. He lifted his shirt a little and rubbed his bloated stomach. Of the three friends, Mark had always been the thinnest, just a little bit shorter than Tom and Sam, he'd always been quite scrawny, but fast, very difficult to pin down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same\" exclaimed Sam, after swallowing the cola he had in his mouth. \"Feeling a little bloated myself after all that cake.\" he rubbed his stomach gently, easing the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bad influance\" Mark said to Tom, who'd helped himself to a second - or was it third - bowl of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the cast was\" Sam joked, \"you never ate like this before you broke your leg!\" Thinking of himself, he probably knew that was not the case - it was probably just not quite so much. Sam himself had always had a pretty bad diet, worse than Tom and Mark's probably, but he - taller than them both by atleast two inches - was athletic, so any weight never really hung around, besides at christmas when he'd come back from school holiday with the smallest of bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaller, atleast, than the belly Tom seemed to be getting. Not that you'd really notice that much over his tee-shirts or school uniform, even now as both he and Mark suspected and knew that their best friend had put on a few pounds, it wasn't' all that obvious just by looking at him, and certainly it wasn't somthing he was aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt he was the slightest bit stockier, but that was mostly based on the knowledge that he seemed to be eating more than he use to. Sam and Mark teased him from time to time, but as the three always did - and Mark and Tom often did after christmas, and lazy summers, to him, it probably didn't mean that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he came to the end of the ice cream, Tom picked up the end of a chocolate bar he'd previously started. \"Feeling pretty full myself, now.\" he said, putting his hand momenterily on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, you've eaten like a pig!\" Mark teasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi!\" he laughed, \"it's the end of term, we've all earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna be fit for the football when we go back\" Sam said pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, we'll be fine\" Tom said assuredly, \"I'm always fine, always fit, never sticks to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Sam shared a brief glance, and in that moment Sam's decision was made up. He lifted his drink and started sipping from it. \"Haha, true. Same for me, mostly\" he said, then casually replacing the drink, this time putting it fairly close to Tom, who like he was sprawlled across the floor, his eyes were split between the TV screen, and the chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then only took a slightest of movement, a lean forward to grab his own drink, when the glass fell over, going right over the bottom and middle of Tom's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it\" Tom said, mildly fustrated, but with that ever present cheeky grin on his face.</span></div></div>",

His father had the servants stationed it on the wall across from his bed, so that he could lay down and watch it comfortably. With on hand, Tim absent-mindedly shoveled chips from a family sized bag into his mouth. An hour ago the bag had been unopened and fresh from the store, but now it was almost empty. Tim's other hand rested on his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy was by no means a small boy. At only ten years of age, he was already tipping the scales at 159 pounds, making him quite obese. Almost a hundred pounds overweight that is. And it showed. Even wearing his school uniform (he'd been too lazy to change out of it) you could clearly see his large overhanging belly and love handles that covered his privates.  His belly was by no means the only big part if him either. His chest was soft and doughy, moobs the size that every girl in his class wished for. His thunder thighs rub against each other and his belly when he walked (a venture that Tim didn't lightly undertake), and his butt was large and round. He'd even developed a double chin, of late, and it was well on it's way to becoming a triple chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Tim minded, of course. He loved to eat and was incredibly lazy preferring to stay inside and play video games rather than do sports. Sure it'd be nice if he could eat whatever he wanted and still be thin, but c'est la vie. Besides his parents could afford to keep him feed and entertained- the only things the ten year old cared about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily, Tim lifted the nearly empty bag to his gabbing mouth and tipped the remainder of his snack into his mouth. He burped, and then giggled patting his belly. It jiggled from the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh yes, life was good.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The boy grunted trying to sit up, but the weight of his heavy body kept him trapped. After a moment of struggling, he was able to sit up. Throwing his legs over the side of the bed, he sat there for a moment, already out of breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another grunt, he stood, big belly sloshing from side to side. After steadying himself he started downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time, he reached the large dinner table he was completely out of breath and sweating. Huffing and puffing he pulled out his chair and lowered his fat body on to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table, Nick and Nora eyed their obese son. Nick was an investment banker and a former star quarterback at his college. Nora, the former head cheerleader was an attorney- one of the best around to boot. The two had managed to maintain their college figures- and Nora, the fashionista she was kept the entire family perfectly dressed. Though the two's jobs funded their exorbitant lifestyles, it left them little time for their son, which was probably how Timothy was able to rocket into obesity in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it had taken Timothy so long to get downstairs, dinner had already been brought out. The chief, used to Tim's appetite had brought out his usual spread: three  triple decker cheeseburger, an extra large serving of chili cheese fries, and a large milkshake. Without pausing, Timothy tucked in, devouring it all with gusto, shoving all the fattening fast food down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, he leaned back and burped. He was still out of breathe from his earlier exercise and his feeding frenzy hadn't helped at all. Sweat glistened on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora surveyed the aftermath of the binge and then her fat son. She tapped a perfectly manicured nail on the table. \"Baby. Mummy and Daddy have to talk-\" Nora  was interrupted by the  chief who had brought out desert. Knowing talking to her son now would be useless, Nora fell silent as she watched her son stuff his face full of double chocolate cake with gooey hot fudge and a good half pint of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finish, Timothy leaned back in his chair. He put his hands on his engorged belly and sighed, happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Nora exchanged a worried glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, as I was saying, baby. Daddy and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shot a worried glance over at his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Daddy and Mummy were talking, baby, and we were thinking, that maybe we should put you on a super special diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Timothy's attention. \"What!\" Tim shot up, swollen belly sloshing in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks right, champ.\" Nick patted his son's side sending it jiggling even more. \"Just a, ah, lil diet, Sport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tim repeated. \"No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, please.\" Nora leaned back in her sear and crossed her legs, \"Daddy and Mummy have talked about this a lot and we think it will be good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim pouted. Throwing down his napkin Timothy hefted himself up and waggled up to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick glanced over at his wife, \"Nora, are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman silenced him with a flick of her hand, \"It's the only way, Nicky.\"</span></div></div>",

Even though she could eat more her belly was obviously very full and she began to struggle as she reached the halfway point of the first pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Cindy\" her mother urged. \"You can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting excited as her shirt had ridden up to expose half her bellybutton already. With the entire pizza it would certainly be fully exposed. Perhaps the second Pizza was a bit too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy groaned as she swallowed the last slice of the first pizza and as her mother predicted her belly button was now fully exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop if you want\" her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy ignored her and began on the last pizza. She had a pained expression as she slowly ate up the first slice and then her mother realized something. She reached under Cindy's dome shaped belly and undid the button of her pants. Cindy moaned in relief as the pressure on her belly decreased and freed up room for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy now started eating the pizza at a faster rate and withing five minutes half the pizza had vanished into the toddlers swelling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's belly now forced her legs apart now that the pant button was no longer restricing it and it's enlarged state since then helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now though Cindy was starting to slow down again, now slower than ever, the respite and vigor that came with the freeing of her restricted belly had gone and she struggled to even take a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's mom took out a fork and began deviding the slices into even smaller pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you\", she told her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy laid back and let her mother slowly feed her the much smaller and more managable pieces until all the pizza was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of effort Cindy grabbed the glass of soda and downed it washing down all that she had eaten. She groaned and rubbed her strained belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so full mommy\", she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know baby\", her mother said. \"Does it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy nodded with a pained expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother knelt down in front of her and with her larger hands began gently massaging Cindy's poor overworked tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly her entire belly was exposed now, her shirt had ridden up to cover only the top quarter. And as her mother rubbed it she felt how firm it was as though filled with sand. Cindy's skin was tight as a drum and petting her belly sent ripples through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a loud low moaning and rumbling came from Cindy's belly and then she let out a long loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scuse me\" Cindy said sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's mother smiled as she continued to rub her adorable daughters equally adorable belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some water?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up but Cindy had fallen asleep with her head resing on one arm and the other arm on top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled and with careful effort and strength that came from carrying large heavy trays of buffet food lifted her daughter off to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe changed Cindy into her PJs but only the top two buttons on her top would do up. She would have to get Cindy new ones. The bottoms were much easier since she had learned early in Cindy's weight gain that all her fat seemed to go strait to her belly. All she had to do was shift her belly to get the bottoms on and then let the elastic waistband do the rest. She stood back and admired Cindy's sleeping bloated form. She looked so adorable and beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night sweetie\"</span></div></div>",

Plus is was breakfast that made her most happy. But she relised something. She was alot less hungry than she normaly was. Then she remembered her huge meal the night before. Cindy flung off her covers and looked down at her belly. It had gone down from the night before but still looked pretty full. She touched it, it was hard and soft. Her pj shirt came up to right below her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled \"well I still need to eat\" Cindy thought to herself as she got out of her bed and walked to her bedroom door. She opened it and was hit with the smell of breakfast cooking. now she knew she really didnt have a choice of eating or not. her mom would push her, but that was ok. Infact she liked being pushed to eat. t gave her more of a reaosn to eat more. She kenw she was making her mom happy. Plus she liked the outcome. A big nice round full belly peeking out from the bottom of her shirt. Just the thought made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked down the hall, through the living room, and into the kitchen where her mom was standing over the stove. She looked over tot he table where she saw it already had 3 plates of food and three glasses of orange jice and one big plate of food to pick from. Bacon eggs, toast, muffins, and even doughnuts. Even with all that food her mom was still cooking more.  She wondered of someone was comeing over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning mommy\" said cindy sweetly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning honey, guess wat this food is for....</span></div></div>",

That food there is for your breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy once again eyed the large assortment of food. One plate was stacked with bacon, another with sausages, the final plate was full of scrambled eggs. The large plate had several assorted foods including toast, muffins, and donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure your friends can eat whatever you don't\", her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's belly growled and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy sat at her chair and started with the easiest to eat scrambled eggs. They were smothered in ketchup just how she liked it. She brought her mouth to the edge of the plate and simply used her spoon to shovel it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the eggs done in short order she alternated between strips of bacon and rolls of sausages making short work of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her belly was starting to fill up now but she was nowhere close to being done, she still had a large assorted plate to finish and the room to put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had difficulty reaching the plate and was only able to scrape a muffin off of it. After quickly devouring the muffin she climbed onto the table and attacked the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate the toast first while is was still warm and then moved onto the muffins. She realized she was full now that she was halfway through the muffins but she forced herself to continue wanting to finish the other half of them as well as the donuts she still had to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother watched Cindy force herself to continue eating even though she had to be full by now and her belly looked it. It had swollen several centimeters in diameter and it looked very taught with it's shiny skin showing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy felt so full. She had felt relatively full when she woke up until she spotted the food and her appetite returned. Clearly though last nights meal had yet to leave her body as she was already stuffed to busting once she finished the muffins and she still had the donuts left. They sat there as though mocking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt so full she might throw up, but she had to finish, she had to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she put the first donut in her mouth and began to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop now Cindy. You don't have to eat all of it, I don't want you hurting yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy swallowed the first donut and considered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to keep going and so began with the next donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother looked on worriedly. The plate had half a dozen donuts and she was only starting on the second. she looked ready to explode already. She loved watching her daughter get a nice big stuffed belly but this was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over and began to rub Cindy's belly eliciting a moan of relief from the toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that mommy\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy honey you really should stop. If you hurt yourself or get sick now you won't be able to spend time with your friends later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to do it for Cindy as she simply stuffed the second donut into her mouth and resign eating the other four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother patted her head and her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl Cindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cindy lay on the table moaning, groaning and rubbing her distressed belly her mother put away the donuts and began doing the dishes as what she was cooking baked in the oven. She was relieved that Cindy had stopped eating but she should have stopped much sooner, she should have made her stop much sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burp came from behind her and she saw Cindy trying to sit up but finding it very difficult with her overladen gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went over and gently picked her up. She was noticable heavier. She carried her upstairs to her room and layed her down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some sleep\", she told Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left her buring daughter in her room she hoped that Cindy would be alright tonight.</span></div></div>",

It was very nearly six o'clock so they should be arriving soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy had skipped lunch being much too full to eat so much as a crumb and had come down from her room only in the last hour and was now watching tv in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang and She went to answer the door where three people stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sandy\", the greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\" Sandy greeted back. She looked down at their daughter who had come for the night Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for always looking after her for us\", Miranda's mother said appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's no problem\", Sandy replied. \"You to better go if you don't want to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, be good now Miranda\", her father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda nodded and gave her father and mother a hug before the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy's in the living room if you want to join her\", Sindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda nodded and went to the living room where she greeted her big bellied friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was a strange girl With short brown hair and dark green eyes. She was only as old as Cindy but her was as tall as an eleven or twelve year old making her look almost like a giant compared to her friends. Her hight came with a consequence. Her family frequently visitied the buffet where Sandy worked and indeed this was how she met the family. The staff at the buffet called Miranda (or Mir as she was also known) \"The Destroyer\" because of her immense appetite. Capable of eating more than four times what Cindy had eaten this morning if she stuffed herself her parents would always call in advance when they were coming so the staff could get a headstart. Despite her eating so much she was fairly thing with baby fat being the only source of blubber the girl had. She grew so much and so quickly that her food went strait to her height. Of course her belly did always swell when she ate which was why she mostly war belly revealing shirts and low riding pants or shorts but the belly would evaporate almost completely before her next full meal and when she woke up the next morning her belly was completely flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang again and once again Sandy went to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Celia. She was a tiny thing two inches shorter than Cindy even though they were the same age (though Celia preceeded Cindy by nearly two months). Celia had tiny hands as well almost disproportionately so. Celia was rumored to be a designer baby because of her long almost white blonde hair and perfect sky blue eyes. Her parents got a refund because of flaws in the process that were the likely causes of her diminuitivness. Well one of those flaws must've been the introduction of snake DNA Sandy thought. Despite her tiny size Celia could open her mouth wider than any of the other girls even Mir. What's more her throat could remarkably stretch to swallow whatever she could fit in her mouth. Sandy had marveled when she first saw Celia drop a full size boiled egg in her mouth and then swallow it whole. She then put her ear to the girls tummy and listned to the egg splash down fully intact. Celia's desire to eat lots came from her desire to put on any kind of size be it height or otherwise, she just wanted to be bigger. Unfortuneately for her her motabolism was quite impressive she she lost whatever weight she gained when she visited them after only a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Celia went to join the other girls in the living room the final guest arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya\", the young girl greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy was an hightly active fairly active girl who Sandy was sure was going to be very athletic when she grew up with long legs and kept her medium length hair in a neat pony tail. Her chocolate brown eyes were always bright and cheerfull. Outside of her visits here Mindy didn't indulge in food binges like her friends but always indulged when she visited because she enjoyed it. Although not an eater like the others she had a healthy appetite and loved pushing her limits much like an athelete would and she always left with a nicely distended tummy that just poked out between her shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Cindy your belly's huge!\" Sandy heard Mindy exclaim when she entered the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it was going to be another fun food filled night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls would spend most of their time eating through varous games or challenges they would come up with until they were full or fell asleep. Usually asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy couldn't wait.</span></div></div>",

However, being the smart one among them, she got high grades at the end of her last year there, and her mother decided that she should attend a more prestigious school, Newton Academy. Unfortunately for Gaby, none of her old friends went with her. They still see her outside of school, and she regularly keeps in touch online, but in school her rather meek and shy character kicked back in, and coupled with her short stature meant she often went unnoticed, though she did manage to find two friends in her class. But, before then, Gaby felt very lonely, and often found comfort in a nice bar of chocolate or bag of sweets, which her mother was always willing to provide to keep her little princess happy. This lead to a healthy accumulation of softness on her petite young body, which steadily built over the course of her first year at the new school, eventually requiring her mother to buy new uniforms for her in the school holidays. Now, she is ready to begin her second year at Newton Academy, weighing in at a little overr ninety pounds on her 4'8\" frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, age 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel is the baby of her family, with another sister and two brothers, and as such was on the recieving end of a fair amount of spoiling by her doting parents. Burgers, chips, chocolates, crisps, cakes, nothing was too much for their little girl, and as a result little Rachel grew up to be a pudgy little girl, often with her tummy stretching out the next adorable outfit her mother picked out for her. Sure, she was teased about it by her brothers and sisters, but that was all in good fun. What wasn't all in good fun was the ridicule she recieved from her classmates when she started school. Slow at first, it then built up and up, before one day her father found her on her bed, tears streaming down her face and mumbling to herself about being a fat pig. That was three years ago, and ever since then Rachel dieted. Hard. Despite her parents insistence that 'she would grow out of it' or 'it didn't matter what the other kids though of her, so long as she was happy', she cut back on her eating, and began to play sports, becoming particularly adept at tennis. However, as her weight declined, so did her attitude. She isn't a problem child, but there's a noticeable difference between fat and thin Rachel; her temper is much shorter, and she has a habit of going into long sulks over little things. Perhaps, deep down, it's because she misses being chubby, with her stringy, 4'7\" athletic body tipping the scales at a mere seventy pounds. Her parents certainly do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr would you rather another girl?</span></div></div>",

At this point she was so happy to take a break from counting calories that she didn't bother to taste the food she was eating. No stress was put on her to maintain her weight of 100 pounds, very skinny for a girl that's 5'7, because it was summer break. She didn't worry about being skinny in a bathing suit because the other 9 months of the year, she had to be skinny in a cheerleading uniform. Gaining weight wasn't her goal, but she wasn't avoiding it.<br>\r\nThe next day at the del mar fair, she skipped breakfeast, making her much hungrier than the rest of her friends. Every half hour, she would eat something huge and greasy, and still be hungry afterwards. Needless to say it was uncomfortable for her to sit on the ride back home. Her usually slim stomach that looked airbrushed was now swollen and pushed against her jeans. Nothing eventful went on for a week, so she occupied herself with tv and conostant snacking. Then a beach barbeque was in order. She wore a bikini that fit in may, that she now conostantly picked at the waistband of. Only a select few noticed her weight gain, and they joyously marveled every time she went up to refill her plate. All of them were giddy, knowing that they were one rank farther up on the hot scale because amanda was getting chubby. That night was a video game date. She ordered a pizza for her and brandon, and as they dueled on his xbox 360, she ate most of the pizza. The camisole she wore that was once \"fitted\" now showed her small soft gut, and she unbuttoned her jeans after the 3rd slice she had. <br>\r\nWhat happened by the end of summer, you ask? She gained a total of 20 pounds.</span></div></div>",

A straight nose and high cheekbones give her sophisticated look while her perfectly tan skin exudes a healthy glow.

Though his rather thick, brown fur does a good job of hiding how skinny he is, it is still possible to see his ribs, and he generally looks as though he would be blown over by a stiff breeze. His parents believe that he takes after his mother, who is lithe herself, while his older brothers take after their father, who has a much more traditional, heavyset leonine build. Despite assurances from his mother that he will have a growth spurt eventually, Kweli has always felt slightly jealous of his brothers, and resents his lack of size, though is generally a friendly and pleasant little anthro. Kweli's father signed him up for the school athletics team, but that did no good for his insecurities, although it was temporarily alleviated by winning third place in the county's 200 metre finals.

However, the teachers at his school prefer him to his classmates, as the shy mustelid is perhaps the most mature student in his class, always offering to answer problems on the board and being a well-bahaved pupil, plus he has manages to find a paw-ful of friends who share his love of books and having quiet fun; in other words, his fellow nerds. Chris enjoys nothing more than spending a peaceful afternoon in his room, curled up on his bed and reading the next lastest fantasy book, often with a cupcake and amug of cocoa, and these little titbits are beginning to have an effect on the skunk's body. Over the last few months, Chris has been growing a little bit of a belly, with the white area of fur on his tummy changing shape accordingly.</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t know exactly why, but there was just something about all the problem solving, and the fact that it seemed to be something he was very good at, that kept his attention rapt to the board at the front of class, where Ms. Robins had just written the next question. Thirty seven take-away nineteen. She was trying to get them to learn simpler ways of solving the problems, like breaking it up into parts, instead of just trying to solve it all in one go. Noticing that none of the other kids had raised their arm, he tentatively put his forepaw in the air, and was called to the front of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little skunk felt a certain sense of unease as he stood in front of the others. Not because he didn\u2019t know the answer, but because he simply felt shy. However, he was able to quickly answer the question, and earned himself a sticker on the sparkly chart on the wall that Ms. Robins had made; Chris and his friends had the majority of the little stars and crescents that adorned the board. As he walked back, he saw a few perplexed faces, wondering how he had been able to work it out so quickly, but most were thoroughly bored. Though Chris could understand why; lunch began in ten minutes, and it was pizza day, his favourite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he neared the beige wall at the rear of the classroom, where his seat was, Chris saw a familiar face smiling at him, belonging to a rather pudgy otter covered in downy brown fur despite being a few months older than him. The skunk sent a grin back at Mark, his best friend. Though the two of them had only met at the beginning of junior school, about two and a half months ago, they had become the best of friends almost immediately. It was as though they had known each other their whole lives; they liked the same games, books, TV shows, even the same school subjects. On the first day of school, they were allowed to sit next to whoever they liked, so Mark and Chris chose the same table near the back of the room. Since then, the pair had made other friends, but because the seating plan, as Ms. Robins called it, was fixed, they were too far away to talk to them in class, though they didn\u2019t mind as they still had lots of fun together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris sat back down on the little plastic chair, he felt something shift on the fur around his midriff, and he glanced down momentarily, eyes widening. His red tee shirt had been caught on the back of his chair, exposing his white, soft-furred tummy from the waist of his black trousers to his belly-button. Before anyone around noticed, he pulled the shirt back down, but something crossed his mind as he did so. This seemed to be happening more and more in the last few weeks, as winter rolled in on the village, but dismissed it as him getting taller. Mummy said he was a growing boy, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo did you get to level ten last night?\u201d asked Mark in a low whisper. Before Chris has gone up to the board, they had been talking about the latest online game they\u2019d found a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got there, but I didn\u2019t get past the boss right at the end,\u201d he mumbled in reply, a sheepish smile spreading. \u201cHe gets real quick when he\u2019s low on health.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued their quiet conversation as some of their classmates were called up to answer questions at the front. Not many of them got them right. Before long, Ms. Robins took a look at the basic clock on the wall, and told them all it was time to pack away and head for lunch. Chris and Mark were still chatting as they went into the cloakroom to find their coats. Though the classroom was warm enough to not need jumpers, it was bitterly cold outside, and the wind teased at the skunk\u2019s ears and damp nose, as he and the class trotted off to the cafeteria, which was in a separate building to their classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the warmth that enveloped the building, Chris was also greeted with all manner of wondrous smells that his keen nose could pick up. The skunk sniffed deeply at the air, and found the scents of pepperoni, tangy vinegar and sweet butterscotch, which grew stronger and stronger as the queue for lunch moved towards the serving area. It also sent the skunk\u2019s tummy, which had previously been virtually silent in class, into a rumbling overdrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s hungry today,\u201d mumbled Mark with a chuckle, and Chris smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but can you blame me on pizza day?\u201d and it was the otter\u2019s turn to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pair had gotten their meals, they made their way over to one of the tables in the dining hall, picking their way though the noisy maze. Just before they dug into their meals, they were joined by Sally, a skinny tigress and another one of their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d her fluty voice broke through the din, and she smiled at the two boys as she sat down, her impressively large fangs glinting slightly under the fluorescent lights. \u201cAt least dinner\u2019s not too bad today,\u201d she continued, looking down at her tray of food. Its contents were the same as theirs; a paw-ful of chips, two slices of pizza, and a piece of delectable butterscotch pudding for desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d agreed Chris, quite quickly. He didn\u2019t know why, but he felt compelled to talk to Sally a little more lately; <i>she looks very pretty today\u2026</i> \u201cit\u2019s better than the mush we\u2019ll get tomorrow.\u201d Chris saw the feline give a shudder, though her smile didn\u2019t diminish. The cafeteria menu was set at the beginning of each term, and so far every pizza day was followed directly by shepherd\u2019s pie day. Lukewarm mashed potatoes, stringy meat and vegetables the none of them could identify, it wasn\u2019t a particularly appetising thing: Chris sometimes asked his mum to make him a packed lunch on those days. But then again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I like that mush,\u201d said Mark with feigned indignation, and the trio began to eat as their conversation shifted to what they did last night, and if the two boys wanted to play at Sally\u2019s that evening, something that Chris agreed to without question. They had a little fun convincing Mark to do so, as he had a mock-argument over whether going to their house would be worth missing out on the online game for a night. Before any of them knew it, their trays were clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them walked together to the cleaning racks, where they were asked to put their dirty trays and cutlery, but Chris didn\u2019t really want to. He had heard the call for seconds a few minutes ago, and he still felt hungry. He didn\u2019t know why he did,<i> maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s so cold</i>, he pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou coming, Chris?\u201d Sally\u2019s voice interrupted his reverie, and his face was pulled to look at her warm amber eyes, that gave him a slightly concerned look.</span></div></div>",

They aren't there when he comes home with tears in his eyes and bruises on his muzzle, because of those <i>horrible</i> little lambs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo her little boy spends a lot of time at home, either building his models or playing those strategy games he's always enjoyed. Oh, how he loves to spend an evening tinkering with his civilisations and his cities until they're big and wonderful and impressive, but... No. He <i>loves</i> playing his games, and it doesn't hurt him at all. If anything, it's better that he's doing something nice and constructive on his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, at least this new job might be good for him, too. Admittedly, it does mean she'll have to work some odd hours, including a lot of evenings and even at the weekends, but it will make everything a lot easier money-wise, even if it means that her son won't see her some nights... However, the babysitter she's arranged to look after him is <i>lovely</i>, she can cook up a storm, and she's a sheep. Maybe spending a bit of good time with an anthro like her will give her boy a little bit of confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan, 7 year old anthro goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan is just <i>so cute</i>! He's positively adorable, with his curly little horns and his twinkly blue eyes and those <i>buck teeth</i>. Don't you just want to pinch those little cheeks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no, actually. He doesn't really have much in the way of cheeks to pinch; he's such a typical <i>goat</i>, all stringy and skinny and bony, there's barely even an ounce of fat on him. When he spends all his time sprinting around during school breaks and eating all those greens and those veggies, is it really any wonder he's such a bean-pole?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I just want to chuckle, looking back two months ago, when I wrote that in my diary. My name's Tara. I'm ten; my little sister is in Duncan's class. And ever since she brought him home with her after the first day of school, I knew I was going to make that little herbivore <i>mine</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean... he's just precious and sweet and so, so <i>cute</i>. And he has a crush on me; whenever he comes over, he always stammers when I talk to him and he taps his little hoovsies together, but he always has this sweet little smile on his face whenever I look at him. Of course, I have to do my best to look aloof and uncaring--I am a wolfess, after all--but when he scampers off to do my <i>evil</i> bidding, I can barely stop myself from hugging that little cutie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause, usually, it's eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. Maybe I'm playing to stereotypes, fattening up my prey, but it really does suit him. And it's just so adorable to watch Duncan take a cake out of my paws and scarf it down right in front of me. Last night, when he came over to play with Luna, I made sure that he didn't leave that tea-party until he'd eaten all of the cheesecake like a good little gentlegoat. I even got to pat his tummy and he let out a <i>bleat</i>; I almost picked him up and snuggled him to death then and there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there's a bit more tummy there nowadays. That stringy little goat is putting on some <i>pudge</i>. His tummy pushes out against his shirts, his arms are starting to get pinched by his sleeves, his little bottom is starting to round out against the seat of his trousers, and when he <i>sits</i>! Oh, he just has this adorable little gut that spills out into his lap, nestling onto those thicker, meatier thighs... Winter's coming, and his coat is getting a lot less straggly--hell, mine's a bit thicker now, too--so that might be a little bit what he's putting on around the middle, but there's definitely something of <i>mine</i> there, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know where I'm going to keep getting treats from, but... I just <i>have</i> to!</span></div></div>",

He sipped his tea, still a bit hot.  Nokko debated whether he should get a bag of chips from the kitchen.  He decided against it; his mother was pissed enough at him as he was for being only slightly overweight.  Nokko looked down at the bubble of fat that had formed at his abdomen.  Perhaps he should go on a diet, but Nokko admitted to himself that he would just cheat on his diet.  So he went down to the kitchen anc got the bag of chips he had denied himself 3 minutes before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was weak in front of food, Nokko admitted; but he had to be somewhere.  His life wasn't great: he lived with a single mother in a shitty school.  His mother forced him to get good grades so that he didn't end up like her.  Nokko looked at his Math again; he hated Math; and Math had always hated Nokko.  He probably needed to study, but he found greater solace in eating and reading reports about European medical care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The only reason Nokko was bothering to look this up was because his one of his classmates wanted evidence for the success of the copay model for medical care.  Places like the Netherlands, Germany, and other excellent EU systems all used the copay system, it seemed.  Nokko laughed to himself.  His friends were smart, but misinformed, as usual.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nokko heard his mother approach and quickly hid his phone in his coat, which he deliberately bought a size too large.  His mother dumped the dirty laundry Nokko had in his room and asked, \"So how's the studying?\"  Nokko hated this question.  How was he supposed to know whether he was learning the information?  \"I mean, I'm getting the problems I do right mostly; and when I don't, it's because I've made a careless error.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was then that Nokko's mother noticed the bag of chips, \"What are those?\"  Nokko froze, \"I'm sorry, Mom.  I should have checked with you first, my fault.\"  Nokko felt a pang of regret: he hated being decptive; but he was hungry and hoped his mother wouldn't notice.  \"You know my rule: one snack.  It's ok but no more, okay?\"  Nokko blushed that his mother was patronizing him, but he nodded and went back to \"work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dinner passed without incident.  Nokko's mother usually made dinner and went to eat in the front of the TV, so Nokko sat in the kitchen and snuck enough food to satisfy himself, leaving enough so that his mother wasn't suspicious.  When he wanted enough food that it was noticeable, he just asked; and his mother usually just obliged him.  'This is why I'm fat,' Nokko thought to himself and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, he had a flashback about\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

Nokko's father had been a kind, loving man for as long as Nokko remembered.  He only had one old picture of his father at his own birth.  Nokko took out the picture and chuckled with a tear running down his cheek; he couldn't let Andrew see him like this.  To only make matters worse, the state had revoked his father's medical insurance pension, which had caused Nokko's brother to die because his mother hadn't been able to afford medical care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The name \"Nokko\" was Nokko's brother's corruption of \"Nikko,\" the pet name Nokko's parents had given him.  Nokko's real name was \"Nicholas Spencer\"; but he preferred to be called \"Nokko.\"  Nokko couldn't afford to think about this now; not with that jackass Andrew, his mother's latest lout (and Nokko suspected drug-addict) of a boyfriend.  Nokko needed to be strong for his mother; he had no choice lest his mother be trampled on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of Andrew, Nokko heard the slurred dialect of Andrew call, \"Come here, you fat, lazy bastard!\"  Andrew heard his mother tell Andrew to knock it off, but he roared profanity at her, which made Nokko's blood boil.  Nokko stormed in, \"Andrew, you're drunk and probably high.  Go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew didn't react well to that.  He took a drunken seing at Nokko, which missed miserably.  Nokko led Andrew outside before he gouged Andrew as hard as he could in the stomach.  Andrew vomited and hacked, \"You, you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6good riddance.  You're Mom's not worth you.\"  Nokko sighed and went back inside, \"He's gone.\" Nokko told his mother.  His mother slumped down and started weeping, \"Shit.  Why can I not get a decent man?  Why am I such a failure?  Why did your daddy leave me?  Damn it, damn it, DAMN IT!\"  Nokko's mother screamed.  Nokko knew he just had to wait out his mother's sudden outbursts before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You must be hungry, Nokko.  You wanna get something to eat?  I know you're on a diet, but an occasional cheat day is supposed to help that,\" his mother gasped, regaining her usual soft composure.  Nokko nodded, and off they went to the nearest McDonalds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

Nokko had recently been hired as a cashier at his friend's dad's gas station.  David, a rather portly lion, was Nokko's best friend and only fellow nerd at his local high school.  David had asked his dad for a job as a cashier and invited Nokko with his dad's permission to be a cashier as well.  Technically, Nokko was allowed to dispense cigarettes to people, but he frequently did anyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0David's father, and the manager of the store, as a job perk, allowed David and Nokko to have a few little snacks from the store.  Technically, it was one per hour, either snack or drink; but David and Nokko sometimes ignored this and took a snack and a drink in the same hour; but not often enough that someone would notice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nokko was munching on a bag of chips when David asked, \"Do you smell that?\"  Nokko took a whiff: something was off.  A man had just walked into the store and was quickly identified as the source.  \"What do you think it is?\" David whispered.  Nokko took a second whiff as the man walked by again: and tried to stifle his nose's scrunching.  It smelled like acetone and cat urine.  It was awful, but Nokko had smelled it before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then it came to him: Methamphetamine.  One of his mother's boyfriends had smelled of it, which had caused his mother to call the police.  \"Meth,\" Nokko whispered, \"if the guy gives us any trouble, we call the police.  Have a phone ready.\"  Almost as soon as Nokko had finished his sentence, Nokko saw a gun.  The man was an ancient-looking lynx who was thin and weak looking; but he had a gun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, uh, I need a pack of them cigarettes, the Marlboros.\"  Nokko nodded, \"That'll be $5.18,\"  Nokko declared.  \"This is a scam!  I can get them things for $3.00!\"  Nokko shrugged, \"Do you want the cigarettes?  If you do, let me get the manager.\"  The man grew more exasperated, \"Just sell em to me for $3.00!\"  Nokko tried to leave before the man grabbbed Nokko, who spun around, \"Let go,\" Nokko growled.  When the addict of a lynx reached across his body for his gun, Nokko slugged him.  \"Call the police!\"  Nokko yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0David immediately called the police, described what had happened, and got the manager.  When the police arrived, they found an unconscious lynx and a chubby, livid Clydesdale above him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

His teacher didn't care because Nokko was discreet; and, to be honest, he was the best-behaved student in his class.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Aidan and Grayson were on the verge of a fistfight, girls were all chattering and doing each others' nails, and the rest of the guys were either asleep or being utter jackasses.  Nokko tried to eat and pay attention.  \"Hey, Nokko, no eating in class!\" Grayson called from across the room.  Nokko and his teacher ignored him, so Nokko kept eating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, Grayson came across the room and swatted at Nokko's bag of chips, which nearly fell all over the floor.  At this point, the teacher lost her mind and kicked Grayson out of her class; much to everyone's delight.  Nokko kept discreetly eating his food after Grayson had been kicked out of class.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After he finished his snack, Nokko fell asleep for the rest of class.  When Nokko awoke, the bell was ringing to end class; and Nokko remembered his next class: English.  The English classrooms had ancient, uncomfortable desks with seats that were too close to the desk for Nokko's comfort.  Even when Nokko had been relatively thin, the desks had been uncomfortbable; but Nokko now had trouble getting in and out of those desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today was no different.  Nokko had to squeeze himself, with his stomach pressed against both the front and back of the desk, which made breathing more difficult.  Nokko tried to eat in English, which was made difficult by his still half-full stomach and breathing difficulties.  Then, Nokko realized that he could push the desk out slightly with his stomach when he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So Nokko ate a two-pack of a Little Debbie's cakes and drank a 20-oz.Vanilla Coke.  To compensate for his full stomach, Nokko leaned back and relaxed his stomach.  It was a perfect storm: the ancient desk; a full, rather hefty, and tall horse; and the posture of said horse all caused the hinge that connected the desk to the seat to snap, spinning the desk around and slapping Nokko on his soft abdomen.  Fortunately, Nokko's teacher was oblivious; and only David, who sat next to him, noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heh, loser,\" David said in his sarcastic tone that told Nokko he was joking.  The desk didn't accomodate David either; and soon, the rather beefy lion popped the his desk too.  Nokko chuckled when his friend managed to do this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately, someone else noticed when David popped his desk; and of course, said person was Grayson, \"Hey, look at the fatass over there!  He broke his own desk!\" Grayson screamed.  Suddenly, everyone turned his head to David, who managed to retain his composure, \"Are you sure, Grayson?\" the lion retorted, \"This desk was like this, and I've known it for a while now.  So your assertions are not supported by evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Did this evidence convince people?  Not other than the teacher, who told Grayson to stop making an ass of himself.  David and Nokko were relieved that they had dodged a bullet.  Nokko was ponderimg how to get back at Grayson when the bell rang.  In the hall, Grayson walked over to Nokko, \"Hey, fatass, I wanna see you in the parking lot, right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNokko\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

Grayson was a loser who resorted to cheating and dirty tricks.  People knew this, and people showed Nokko decency about it.  Grayson would be pissed, but Nokko didn't care.  So Nokko got David and got in his old pickup truck and drove to work.  \"David,\" Nokko said, after he had put his seatbelt on, \"I'm not going anywhere until you put on your seatbelt.\"  David's exression soured, \"Why can't I do what I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"David, if you fly through my windshield and die, I will be cuplable.  If you want to suffer the consequences in your own damned car, fine.  But not on my watch.\"  \"Nokko, as you can hopefully see, I'm not a small guy; I'll stay where I am,\" David retorted.  To which Nokko thought, \"That's not how Physics works.\"  But to which Nokko responded, \"All right, you're wrong; but I can't make you believe anything.  I can, however, make you get out of my car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At which point, David relented after much grumbling, and he struggled to fasten his seatbelt over his larded abdomen.  David complained the whole fifteen minutes it took to ride to their work from school.  And when the two arrived, David unfastened his seatbelt and hopped out of the truck.  Nokko gently stepped out of the truck as he eased his shifting mass out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the two walked over, however, a single sign caught their attention: \"Permanently closed.  Sorry for the Inconvenience.\"  When David tugged the door and found it locked, he noticed the sign.  \"This isn't like Dad at all,\" the lion pondered: \"he's usually very deliberate and slow.  We should have heard about this weeks ago.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nokko also thought this was fishy, \"Let's go to your house to try and find him.  Try calling him.\"  David did; the call went straight to voicemail.  David grew worried; had something happened?  \"Come on,\" David pleaded, \"Let's go to my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nokko drove like there was no tomorrow because, for David, there might not be tomorrow.  When they reached David's house, police cars tipped them off that something was wrong.  When Nokko pulled into the driveway, he saw ambulances and policecars all over.

Howler was an academic who disliked exercise or the thought of doing anything more strenuous than a leisurely walk and wanted to do nothing outside but curl up on a seat or bench of some sort with a book and read, an activity which he only pursued when it got anywhere close to cold, which rarely happened in his warm, Mississippian clime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Part of the reason Howler disliked doing much outside was that his body's folds were hot enough as they were and needed no help to make Howler sweat, which revolted Howler because sweat is effectively diluted urine.  This thought again struck Howler as he studied the latest discovery and latest fad in biology.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler had been looking for ways to try and lose weight at his parents' request.  Howler's parents were both thin and had been jocks in school, and they found their son's interests in things like science, literature, and some political issues disgusting.  Howler chuckled at the thought that his mother kept up with the Kardashians and his father with every sport under the sun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler had tried sports; but with poor hand-eye coordination, clumsiness, and aversion to sweat, he found no sports which appealed to him.  His parents might have looked buff, but their appetites were full of the same trashy food which they fed their only son and child.  Howler, of course, had suffered the foolishness from a young age; and when he had finally been allowed the quit the last sport he played, ping-pong, his slightly chubby frame had suffered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler knew that excessive adipose could have negative consequences, but he wasn't willing to sacrifice food for a percentage.  Howler could also be cunning and persuasive when he needed to be, which had kept his parents at bay until today, when Howler had had a \"serious conversation\" with his pediatrician about losing weight, which had entailed the vet's monologue about the dangers of obesity and other ways to combat this problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This brought him to his current predicament: how to stave get past his parents' wrath and insults whenever he got near them.  He had tried to lose weight before, but being hungry was not a sensation he enjoyed.  Maybe he didn't have much self-discipline, maybe he was a stupid fatass, and maybe he should just quit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then reality and the voice of reason came back into his mind.  Why was he letting his parents' wrath get to him?  These were the people who cared nothing for a deep conversation and everything for the Kardashians and sports.  Howler knew that his parents were imbeciles too inept to stop him if he put his mind to stopping him.  But how?</span></div></div>",

He had friends, but he always felt uncomfortable opening up to any of them; but he was desperate and needed someone to help him with snacks and food.  And one guy always seemed to be able to produce food anywhere and always seemed to be eating something: Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alex was a quiet, chubby fox who knew some obscure things but stayed quiet more often than he spoke.  Alex sat with Howler and his group of friends, but usually sat and ate.  Although Alex was good-natured, especially about his diet, which he admitted was probably excessive.  But there was something behind that sweatshirt which Alex always wore and that humor which rang a bit false to Howler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That Monday, at lunch, Howler sat next to Alex and opened his own lunch with hidden contraband and began to eat.  Alex, being the good-humored, but quiet person who he was, offered Howler his bag of chips.  Howler graciously accepted and a moment later offered Alex a Reese's Peanut-Butter Cup, an offer also graciously accepted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pair sat in silence for a few moments before Howler spoke up, \"Your parents must be awfully nice to let you take all this.\"  Howler tried not to sound envious, but a hint of jealousy crept through.  Alex chuckled quietly for a moment, \"Shut up.  Your parents gave you all this; don't tell me how hard you have it.  I have to hide this stuff to make sure my parents don't see it.\"  Howler creased his eyebrows but nodded knowingly, \"I know what you mean.  My parents both want me to lose weight and eat less.  They've stopped buying me stuff like this food that I like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alex stopped eating for a second in surprise but played right into Howler's hands when he responded, \"Yeah, my parents don't try and do anything about me; but they still tell me that I'm fat every day.  I'm like, 'Yeah, I know.  Thanks for stating the obvious, Mom.'\"  Howler nodded, \"Hey, uh, Alex?\"  He paused until Alex looked at him, \"Do you want to come over to my house this weekend?  I could convinve my mom to order pizza or burgers, you could bring snacks, and we could have a sleepover.  I have a blowup mattress and you could sleep on the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alex looked interested, \"Sure, my mom is trying to get me to be more social anyway.  She'd be happy to buy pizza and snacks.\"  Howler nodded.  \"Look, be kinda quiet about it.  We can buy pizza, but you should just buy things which you can fit in a duffle-bag and your book-bag.  We have drinks in our fridge downstairs at my house, where my room is.  You just need to put chips in your duffle bag and cookies with your books.\"  Alex had gotten the idea and had tuned out Howler for a while but nodded as Howler had finished; and both boys quickly warmed up to each other.</span></div></div>",

Relations with his parents had smoothed by Thursday evening when Howler's paents decided to get Fast Food for dinner.  Howler then realized that his parents had such a short-term memory that they would have forgotten about his trip to the doctor's office that Monday morning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler's family had tried to eat healthy, but their old habits wouldn't die so easily.  Howler was a dog, like his parents; and the idea of eating a vegetable was undignified to them.  They were now going to try to cut back on Howler's food intake.  But on this night, Howler argued that because he had been healthy for th rest of the week, he should be allowed one decent meal; and that splurging once a week on food was proven to help dieting, which got him a large meal instead of a small one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After dinner, Howler asked his parents about Alex.  The first question Howler's parents asked was, \"So do you want pizza for tonight?\"  Howler then asked whether that would be ok, which elicited a positive response.  Whenever his parents got pizza, they always got two large pizzas, which they would always put in the fridge downstairs.  All leftovers went downstairs but were forgotten downstairs because Alex's parents never ate leftovers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That Friday passed slowly and was the first time Alex and Howler were seen together.  \"What're you two sacks of fat doing over here?\" came the sneer of one of the tackles of the football team, a blackbear who qualified as obese by BMI standards, a fact Alex made full use of with a laugh.  \"Geez, I was just joking.  What crawled up him today?\"  That was the extent of that exchange, but Howler realized that they were targets now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Howler and Alex were riding home with Howler's mom, Alex opened his bookbag and aimmed for a package of cookies.  Howler glared at him and hissed, \"Not yet.\"  Alex got the message and zipped his bookbag.  Unfortunately, Howler's mom noticed, \"What's wrong, Alex?\"  Alex, however, was smart; and he responded, \"sorry, I was just making sure that I had a book that I needed, and I do.  We're fine.\"  The rest of the car-ride was quiet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Alex and Howler got to the latter's house, Howler invited and showed Alex down to his room where they put their bags and got a snack from upstairs, which was a whole family-sized bag of chips, which would be quickly eaten.  \"Sorry about the car-ride,\" Howler apologized.  \"No, no,\" Alex responded, \"I forgot that your mom doesn't like eating.\"  Howler and Alex sat, ate, and discussed common interests: science fiction, politics, their parents, and school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To say that they had no idea how much each ate was an understatement until they finished off their snacks: three family-sized bags of chips and three containers of cookies and a 2-liter of coke.  Then, their sncack hit them like a boulder.  Despite the caffeine which was buzzing through their systems, which seemed about the only thing which kept them awake, the two felt comatose and fell asleep, for about thirty minutes curled up next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler heard the sound of his mother's calling and coming down the stairs.  Coming down the stairs?  Fortunately, Alex had stirred and risen and was brushing the wrappers onto the side of the bed away from the door.  They both stood slowly just as Howler's mother peeked her head through the door.  \"Thank you, Mom, sorry we didn't hear you,\" Howler apologized to his mother.  The two boys washed their hands; and each felt his stomach slosh as he walked up the stairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The smell of pizza sickened Howler as he opened the door at the top of the stairs.  He was n't as full as he had been half an hour ago, but his stomach had only digested a little bit of what he had eaten.  When the two boys were alone in the kitchen, Howler whispered to Alex, \"eat however you normally eat.  My parents will notice if you don't eat normally.\"  When Alex nodded but grimaced, Howler apologized.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dinner was torture for the two boys.  Forcing more food into their full abdomens was nauseating and yet\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6pleasing almost, in a twisted way.  The mounting nausea and physical pressure from their bodies was enormous, but finally both boys managed to finish their dinners with a smile on their faces. After dinner, the Alex and Howler went straight to Howler's room and slept, regardless that it was 7:00.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler awoke at 12:00, feeling much relieved from his earlier binge.  To his relief, Howler noticed that Alex was stretching and beginning to wake as well.  When a gurgle arose from one of the boy's stomachs, Howler decided it was time for a midnight snack.  Howler's shirt and pants fit normally again, if not a bit tighter; but Alex seemed to have a bit more trouble in getting his waist into his tight 36\" pants.  After a struggle, Alex finally managed to squeeze his pants closed at his waist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, Howler dug through the refridgerator and found\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

Howler decided to leave the frozen food in the freezer, but took out the leftovers.  His parents never ate leftovers, but should they come looking, he had an excuse planned as always.  He needed to heat the food; but the microwave was upstairs, which meant that his parents would hear his heating up the food.  This would immediately shoot down any other excuse he had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a microwave, which worked well-enough, in the basement; but it's timmer was obnoxiously loud and would be heard from upstairs, even with the doors closed.  There was even a chance that Howler's parents would hear the food's warming up, but Howler decided that his friendship was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler crept to his microwave downstairs and opened and closed it without a hitch.  He then carefully set the dial for enough time to heat all the food and then pressed \"Start.\"  Howler's parents' room was directly above where the microwave was; so if Howler heard any stirring, he would hide the food back in his room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everything went smoothly until the last box of Chinese, when Alex surprised Howler with a touch.  Howler turned quickly and saw his friend, and his mini heart-attack subsided.  But his gasp still caused his parents' notice and he heard the light shuffling of his father's feet towards th me basement.  Howler panicked, took the food and hid it in his room just as Howler's dad peeked through the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is everything ok, guys?\" the lean dog yawned.  \"Yes, Dad, sorry we woke you.  Alex just surprised me, that's all,\" Howler responded as Alex nodded.  \"Ok, guys, just try to keep it down, m'kay?  Your mom and I are trying to sleep,\" Howler's father smiled and retreated back upstairs.  When his father went back upstairs, he told Alex to wait while he himself quietly listened for the regular, deep breathing of his parents, which he soon heard again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Howler returned, Alex looked rapaciously at the food set before him; and the two divided the spoils and quickly ate the trove of food they had selected.  Feeling satiated but rested, the boys stayed up for a couple of hours, talked, and finally called it a night at 2:00 a.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler's parents usually rose early to run on Saturdays.  They usually forced Howler to attend; but because of his guest, Howler was left alone that day.  He finally managed to sleep past 8:00, a feat which he considered impressive.  When Howler awoke, he found Alex lazily scrolling on his phone and looking like he had just arisen as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler realized that his dad's car was gone and went upstairs; and finding no one home, he quickly made a nice breakfast of Hot Pockets, frozen breakfasts, and cereals from his house for his guest.  The two boys went back downstairs, where they watched YouTube, talked more, and tinkered around with some of Howler's designs for a little while.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler's parents returned at about 10:00 from their race; but in his mother's hands lay two-dozen donuts.  Not the small ones either, but large, dense donuts were the ones Howler's parents always bought.  Howler wandered meekly into the kitchen and asked his father if he and Alex could each have one, and with a chuckle assented.  After scarfing down the donut each, Howler waited for his father to descend into the basement with the donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Which was when Howler realized that his father would notice the missing pile of leftovers.  Howler needed to divert his father from the downstairs fridge.  Howler waited until his father was just about to open the fridge before he asked, \"it keeps the donuts more fresh if you don't refridgerate them, you know, Dad.\"  Howler's father turned and cocked it and questioned, \"Oh, really?\" And he set the donuts on the table next to the fridge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler nearly heaved a sigh of relief as his father walked up the stairs.  His parents would actually eat leftover donuts for a day or two before they were forgotten.  At bout noon, Howler's father nosed into his son's room, \"Son, where is the pizza from last night?\"  Howler froze.  He was caught, so he told his dad the truth.  To which his father nodded and replied, \"I'll let it slide, but consult us next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler nodded before his dad asked, \"What do you guys think of burgers and shakes?\"  The two boys nodded appreciatively but both felt a sense of inner excitement.  Howler playfully poked Alex's soft stomach and jiggled it slightly, making the fox yelp and wince.  Howler frowned, \"Dude, are you ok?  I'm sorry that I hurt you.\"  Alex nodded nervously, \"It's fine.  I shouldn't be so sensitive about it.\"  Howler sensed something more was going on which he didn't know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a large bacon and fried egg cheeseburger with an order of cheese fries and thick shakes, both Alex and Howler felt nearly comatose and ready to sleep off such a heavy meal.  Before either boy realized it, they were at Alex's house.  Alex thanked his hosts and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Alex got inside, the first words and the first contact he got were, \"Yo, fatass, you're home!\" and a slap in his stomach, which jiggled violently and made Alex feal queasy.  His mother laughed as Alex winced and braced over a trash can.  When Alex controlled himself, his mother called to his dad, who repeated nearly to a T what his mother had said and done.  Alex quickly retreated to his room.</span></div></div>",

They would force upon his plate seconds and sometimes thirds; and when Alex tried to politely say he was full, his father would bark angrily, \"Your mother made that for ya; don't waste it now.\"  His parents just seemed to get some perverse pleasure from Alex's suffering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alex lloked at himself in the dirty mirror.  The bruises still hadn't gone away from the last time.  He was proud of himself for enduring suffering; he thought it made him stronger.  But one thing his mother did still made him shudder.  When would she come again?  As if to answer his question, Alex heard his mother slip into his room.  She stripped him and forced him into the bed.  Alex just closed himself to what had happened.  No one he told had ever believed him.  Such people always said, \"That's just not possible,\" or, \"Stop lying about your fantasies.\"  Alex had learned to laugh and stopped trying to be angry.  The shame would never leave him, but the anger did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Alex's mother had indulged herself, she left a nice box of cookies on the table, which, by some innate desire, Alex was compelled to eat.  He would eat them all that night and go to bed overstuffed.  Alex reflected in a cold shame about the events before he drifted off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wake up, you lazy slob!\" Howler heard his mother shout as she came down the stairs.  Howler's room was in perfect order after the boxes of leftovers had been carefully discarded.  Howler sat up slowly.  It was Saturday, and his parents were making him get up to run again.  Those donuts which Howler had polished off as a midnight snack still sat peacefully in his intestines.  Howler heaved on a shirt which felt a tad tight and a pair of running shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler ate a granola bar and got in the car with his parents, who began to talk about fitness goals and things which didn't interest Howler.  When the group arrived at their race, Howler asked his parents whether he had to race and get all sweaty.  When his parents made him, Howler resigned and got ready to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Running was tiring for Howler, who felt his more prominent love-handles shake and jiggle as he ran more slowly than usual.  Thus, he finished near the bottom and earned the wrath of his parents.  When he got in the car, Howler's father took a round on his son first.  \"Son, I don't know what you were doing; but I saw no effort out there today.\"  Howler chuckled before he replied, \"I've told you, Dad, that I'm no good at sports and that I'm not feeling well today.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Howler's mother snorted at the excuse, \"Well, them why didn't you say so?\"  Howler explained that he started to feel nauseous only once the race started, not before.  \"Well, maybe if you weren't so fat\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" Howler's mother suggested, which earned her son's glare.  Howler would eventually spend the rest of that Sunday eating, sleeping, and doing his homework to counteract his exercise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That Monday, at school\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

Now you're gonna leave Alex alone from now on as I won't let someone like you harass him again.\" Howler said as he stood up and defended his good friend Alex as the person that was responsible for harassing Alex backed off and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex are you all right?\" Howler asked his good friend and schoolmate Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm alright also thanks for standing up for me and giving that school bully what for.\" Alex said as he proudly thanked Howler for coming to his rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing really for after all I won't let my schoolmates and or friends be bullied on my watch. Also we better get to our last class for the day before we get in trouble.\" Howler said as he and Alex started walking towards one of the high school's classrooms as their last class of the day was going to start soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school was over for the day Howler walked home as he discovered an note and package that was addressed to him that was sitting on his family's front porch as he read the note itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my loving nephew Howler inside this package is a sort of special caffeine free soda pop known as Super Soda Pop as this will not only instantly increase your own strength and muscles but it will help bulk you up as you'll gain both weight and height along with a major turbo boost of confidence and self esteem as well. Love your uncle Ace and aunt Amanda.\" After reading the note from his loving uncle Ace and aunt Amanda, Howler started thinking to himself aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew that super soda pop existed but one thing's for sure when I have a can of Super Soda Pop I know that not only will my own strength increase along with my muscles as well, but I'll also bulk up as well along with gaining weight and height as my own confidence and self esteem will get a major turbo boost too. Well I may as well try this Super Soda Pop and find out if this stuff's good or not.\" Howler thought to himself aloud as he carefully opened up his package as then he grabbed a can of Super Soda Pop along with pulling up the can's tab as he drank one little can of Super Soda Pop as he then let out a gnarly deep sounding burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Burapp!* \"Excuse me\" he said as his strength not only increased but his muscles also increased as well as he started bulking up like no tomorrow as his weight and height doubled until he was now the size of a great big fat sumo wrestler as his own confidence and self esteem received a major turbo boost as Howler was now bigger and fatter than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Super Soda Pop sure was delicious for after all I do have my own loving aunt and uncle to thank of course, but now I'd say it's time for me to go have a look at my now bigger and fatter body as well.\" Howler said as his own voice now sounded a lot deeper than what his normal voice sounded like as he stomped on into his house as he made his way over to one of his house's bathrooms as he looked at his bigger and fatter self in one of the bathroom's own mirrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man do I look like a great big fat sumo wrestler or what? And oh ho boy will both my parents and everyone else be in for a great big surprise of some sort.\" Howler said as he proudly smiled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew thought that his family was decent.  Sure, he knew that they were poor, working class, \"deplorables,\" who worked as farmers.  At least, that was what his father had done until his dad's profits had fallen to such a level that they were no longer able to support his family.  His father now worked as a laborer at an agribusiness, tending their fields and taking orders from them.  Andrew noticed that his father missed the autonomy of his own farm, but his new job payed well and was allowing him to invest to try and raise his family out of poverty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That is, before the state had cut funding for the state-sponsored college tuition program to pay for budget deficits.  Andrew followed all of this in the news.  He never considered himself to be particularly bright, but he had hoped to get to college and become a stock-broker.  Things looked bad, Andrew noted to himself dismally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew was of medium height, with lighter brown hair and golden fur, and a lanky appearance.  But why Andrew cared about his looks, he didn't know.  They had never done anything for him.  Andrew then remebered why he was thinking about his father: his father had begun to sport a bit more of a gut recently.  Andrew's family was incredibly efficient with its resources, as poverty forces people to be.  And that habit would never die.  Andrew further noted that his family never wasted food; but with increased means came increased gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew's mom and dad always encouraged the mantra, \"Don't waste your food.\"  Now, however, they had enough money to purchase a surplus of food; so his parents did.  Andrew knew that his dad was fat; and despite what he heard people say, Andrew had always associated fat with wealth.  If his father was content, Andrew decided he could let him enjoy this new luxury.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew sat down to think for a moment when he felt a strange pressure on the waistband of his pants.  Andrew had noticed that his pants seemed to fit better at the waist than they previously had.  They were more snug, comfortable, and able to stay up without a cincture of a belt, which Andrew noted he had to loosen a hole when he sat down because a small fold of fat pressed against it.  He was still scrawny, but at least now he couldn't see his various ribs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going to a public school was awful.  Andrew sat in class, learned nothing but propaganda, and  drooled on himself.  None of his teachers cared about him but one: his Chemistry teacher.  Mr. Chris was a middle-aged, short, stout man who had a bald-cap; but he was the kindest and smartest man Andrew had ever known.  The man's only weakness was that he didn't realize that his pupils didn't understand what he said sometimes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew frequently found himself talking to Mr. Chris after class because the man had the most amazing stories, all of which he asserted were true.  He had been a stock broker on Wall Street and was actually quite wealthy, but taught Chemistry because he could.  Andrew also smiled at the correlation between weight and wealth.  Today thebtwo were discussing how to invest well when the bell rang for the end of lunch.  Andrew decoured the last bit of his sandwich, thanked Mr. Chris, and walked to his next class\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

The dog sat in the back left, where he had been assigned, since day one.  He tried to pay attention, but his teacher just went over things he had expected his students to read the night before.  Andrew was hungry today.  He had forgotten his lunch, which his history class had come after, and had his breakfast dissipate.  He did, however, sit next to a sophomore who usually had food with him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All Andrew had to do was remember his name, which finally came to Andrew.  \"Hey, uh, Nokko,\" Andrew whispered, \"do ya think I could get one of them cookies?\"  Nokko looked over at him, surprised by the sudden tap on the shoulder.  Nevertheless, he took out a pack of Little Debbie's cakes and handed them to Andrew.  Andrew nodded appreciatively and opened the cellophane as quietly as he could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Andrew had quickly eaten his cakes, Nokko looked over, chuckled, and handed Andrew a bag of chips.  Andrew chuckled, and Nokko chuckled in response.  Class passed slowly before Andrew could thank the chubby Clydesdale for the food.  Nokko smiled and responded, \"The chips were from David.\"  Andrew looked at the shorter, but equally wide lion next to Nokko and laughed, thanking David as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0History was last period because of Andrew's free period from Football.  Andrew hated workouts for football, but he liked his off-period more.  Andrew was a backup tight end, not a very good one either.  Nokko was wondering off when he felt Nokko's tap on the shoulder, \"Hey, Andrew, this is from David's Dad, who owns a, well, several gas stations.\"  Andrew was astonished: he held a cold, twenty-ounce Dr.<br>\r\nPepper, a gift from Nokko, in his hand.  Andrew went to the cafeteria and guzzled the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew hated workouts.  Andrew noted that the effects from his lunch were wearing off already.  He would have to exercise on an empty stomach, he told himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Workouts were a chore, but practice was worse.  Mitchell, one of Andrew's classmates, whispered on the sidelines, \"So, a little bird told me you was takin' food from them little fatass sophomores.  That horse and lion.\"  Andrew chuckled but secretly panicked.  \"I forgot my lunch.  They had food; I wanted some; they gave it to me; and so I ate it.  So yeah, I did, why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mitchell chuckled and responded, \"You might become like them if you keep eaten from 'em.\"  Andrew chuckled, \"That's why I got workouts!\"  Mitchell laughed and took the field.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But after practice, Andrew went to fill up his truck at his usual gas station when he discovered that the pump didn't work.  Andrew went to another gas station down the road: closed.  Then Andrew saw a truck, in which he recognized Nokko and David near a cavalcade of police cars.</span></div></div>",

The desk in which Red sat pressed firmly against his rotund frame (which made him more ashamed and nervous). The aptitude exams began at 9 o'clock; it was 8:55. Red was examining (for perhaps the hundredth time) the qualities of his pencil when he felt a tap on his shoulder. Although it was a sweet, gentle touch, Ethelred wheeled suddenly, taking his inquisitor by surprise<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Red,\" came the quiet voice of Barley, one of the mares in Red's class, \"do you have an extra calculator?\" Red smiled nervously and fumbled about in his bookbag. Barley was a sweet mare, one of the few girls that Red respected. He eventually found his backup calculator and handed it to Barley, who smiled, thanked Red, and went back to her seat. When she did that, Red flushed. He liked Barley. But she was hot and nice; she probably has guys crawling all over her. Why would she want a useless, technocratic fatass like him, who barely fit in his seat. Red tried to recall who Barley's boyfriend was at that moment: was it Thunder? Grasshopper? He was pretty sure she had broken up with both of them. He couldn't remember.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, the exam instructor called the class to order, and the test began. The formal logic and metaphysics questions of the exam felt like a breeze to Red, who was now full of energy after his interaction with Barley. The essays he wrote, he felt, were masterworks of the subject. And the logic questions seemed easier than normal. Eventually, the proctor called for styli to be set down, but not after Red had finished and checked everything.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Then came the physical examination. Red dreaded the physical examination. In practices, he had finished at the 25th percentile in agility, 30th in speed, 20th in stamina, and 80th in strength. He wasn't the slowest on the field, but he was close, and he could feel his jiggling thighs and belly with every step. It was embarrassing for him. And of course, the run came before the power lifting, so Red's legs ached, and he was or of breath by the time power lifting came around. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He did as well as he could have under the circumstances, but he still underperformed compared to good practices. But having bathed and changed quickly, Red began his trudge home before he felt the same touch he had earlier on his shoulder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Red,\" came Barley's voice, \"I just wanted to return the Calculator from earlier, thanks for letting me borrow it.\" Red struggled not to sound like he was still breathing hard before he answered, \"No problem.\" But his breath still sounded a tad forced. Barley heard it and chuckled, \"I'm still getting used to the running too, Red; don't beat yourself up over it.\" Red's ears went back, embarrassed to have been flustered by someone he liked so much.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, this thing doesn't help,\" he laughed, jokingly proding his stomach, whose love handles and front were clear through his tunic. Barley smiled, \"I don't know, you're pretty strong, and the belly makes you seem soft and huggable. It keeps you humble and approachable. It's cute.\" Red now blushed and snorted quietly, \"Oh. Do you wanna go get lunch together sometime?\" Red murmured, expecting something to happen. Barley laughed heartily, \"Maybe sometime, but as of now, I'm going to the countryside with Wavewalker.\" Wavewalker! Red thought, that's who Barley's boyfriend was! \"Ah, wonderful!\" Red replied, \"Well, have fun, I'll see you around.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And with that, the two went their separate ways. Red, now that he has recovered his breath, was now hungry and thirsty. Walking back to his dwelling, he thought very little about the exam he had just taken and almost entirely about the girl he had just talked to. Red mused eagerly to himself about what he would say to Barley when mentorship resumed the next day. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he arrived, Red's mother instantly peppered him with questions about the exam, most of which Red couldn't answer, or didn't want to, so he tried to dodge them, to little avail. Reds father sat quietly and listened to what his son said, not saying much. Red ate his grits with gusto, using ample butter (there was no taboo on drinking breast milk after one had been weaned in Houyhnhnm society, it provided mares a supplemental income), eating two big bowls before his father raised an eyebrow, signaling an end to Red's meal. Reds father sighed, looking at the sad sack of lard his first son was.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Eventually, Red...</span></div></div>",

Come dinner time, eyes roll, shoulders get clapped, and Jenny gets asked where exacly it is she puts it all. Her mother's cooking is rich and delicious and <i>ever</i> so filling, but this little powerhouse can wolf down a full plate, then scarf her way through a second before making the gooeyest, sweetest eyes at her daddy's leftovers, all washed down with something creamy or crumbly or both for desert. Of course, she is a growing girl, and quite tall for her age, but the main answer behind her trim tummy and stringy legs is her time on the soccer fields; every single recess and every other evening, she's out on the field in her stripy shorts and her sports top, sweating away all that starch and those sweets into the kit she practically lives in, her face split into a massive, giddy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least it was. She's a growing girl, after all, and now she's going to big school. That means uniforms that chafe her grey fur. That means an hour-long bus trip in the evenings to get back. And that means no playing field to run around on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, 12 year old anthro squirrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeer through the comfortable dim of her bedroom, and brush away the plushy warmth of the tail she cuddles around, and you might get a glimpse of two beady, chocolate eyes. Except you won't; they'll be pointing down, squinting into a book thicker than a brick wall as she hunts down some delectable fact and tasty titbit for the day. Yes, Sarah is truly a bookworm. When her schoolmates whittled away their days running around under the blazing sun, or mashing buttons together and yelling incomprehensibly, she hunkered down in her room, on a plump cushion and with a smile on her face, ready to tuck into a good book. And maybe a bag of crisps. And maybe some biscuits. And a slice of cake, though that tends to make the pages go all sticky. The short walk to school and back, plus the occasional trip into town with her small cluster of friends, has been a worthy opponent to all that snacking, even if it has been losing ground in the last few months: her trousers have been pinching a little bit when she gets dressed in the morning, and a definite roll of fluff has started spilling over them when she sits, plus her mother has made a note to get a training bra organised for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so she's a soft, fluffy little squirrel, with a plump tummy and a backside that fills her slacks to bursting, but what does that matter to her? School's out now, and there's nothing that this little bookworm would love more than to spend her whole summer devouring her latest collection of tomes. And treats.</span></div></div>",

She loved exciting stories. <br>\r\nShe was sitting in a big comfy chair with her tail around her like she always did. On a small table was a glass with some cola and a bowl of chips. Sarah loved one thing... reading. She could do it for hours. She could spend hours reading stories about dragons, smart detectives, aliens, pirates, horror and so many other things. That was what she loved most. What she wanted to do when she grew up was working in a library or having her own bookstore. She also thought about writing but she was a bit doubt full about that. Sure she loved reading but reading and writing were two very different things. Besides if people did't liked you books you would end up with nothing.<br>\r\nHer paws reached for some chips. Sure Sarah loved reading but she also loved eating. especially snack like pretzels, biscuits or crisps. At least you could eat those while reading. Of course most of that snacks were fattening and that showed on her body. Sarah had gotten fat in the past time. Her tummy had gotten pretty round just like her butt and thighs. All her fat was starting to pile over the waistband of her pants. Sarah did't mind that at all. it was warm and soft and besides she did't cared how she looked. Sure she kept herself clean but she did't wore make-up, or did anything with her hair, or wore expansive design clothing or jewelry. She did't care about that. She just wore simple clothing like she did now. A pink T-shirt and some blue dungarees.<br>\r\nUnlike most other girls of her age she did't cared about clothes, shoes, parties, going out or boys. All she cared about was reading and eating<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nShe was also pretty smart and got high marks at school. Except for P.E. But her mother did't really cared about that. Her daughter had good grades for anything else. So what did one grade matter. She knew her daughter was't the active kid. She also knew she was getting a bit on the heavy side but as long if she kept good grades she saw no problem. <br>\r\nHowever she did wanted to take her to buy some new clothes. All her old ones were too tight and she thought it was also time to get her daughter a training bra. She thought she might need them and she was right.<br>\r\nBut Sarah did't cared about that either. Sure she knew she would get boobs and she accepted them but that was all.<br>\r\nBut right now she was like normally buried in a book. With a pile of books next to her.  Suddenly the door was opened an in walked... </span></div></div>",

She knew Sarah was getting a bit fat but she did't really worried about it. Sarah was't an active kid. But what she did't had in muscle she made up with brain power. Thanks to all her reading she became pretty smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah. There you are. Good we can go right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Go where?\" Sarah asked with out looking up from her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah I would like it if you put your book down if you talk to me.\" Her mother (let's call her Sandra) said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed. She put her finger between the pages she was reading and looked at her mother and repeated her question..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to the mall silly. I told you yesterday. Remember. You were reading a book by the fireplace. Then I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah remembered her mother told her something yesterday. But to be honest she did't had a clue what her mother told her. She had been to occupied by her book to really listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going clothes shopping. You really need new pants sweetie. I noticed they all got a bit to tight lately. All the time showing your cute muffin top. You really need some new ones. We can also buy some shirts because this ones are getting small too and of course your training bra.\" Sandra said an clapped excited in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sometimes thought her mother was more excited about her training bra then she was. However she must admit it would be nice giving her boobs a bit of support. <br>\r\nShe did't liked she need to stop reading but must admit that new pants would be handy. All her old pants were getting very tight and left marks around her sweet tummy. That was why she wore some dungarees today. But also her suspenders were a bit tight. They could probably snap off any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess so.\" Sarah admitted and put a piece of paper in her book. \"But mom... if we go... can we perhaps also take a look in the bookstore and visit the food court?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah loves tasty treats but she also liked junk food. She liked most things fattening and that clearly showed at her body. She knew she got fat but she liked having a big, round, soft and squishy belly. It did feel nice. Besides if you liked being fat you did't have to bother counting calories and all that stuff.   <br>\r\nSandra thought about it. If she would let Sarah eat first her belly would be full. Then the clothes she would pick would fit easily even after Sarah stuffed herself. That was maybe wiser, and what harm could a look in a bookstore do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sweetie. Perhaps we can take a bite at the food court before we look for clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled. She put her book down and heaved herself up and waddled to the car. They fast drove to the mall. After they parked Sarah went straight to the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like Sarah?\" Sandra asked, she knew her daughter had a big appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four hamburgers, two packs of fries, two boxes of a dozen chicken nuggets of and three vanilla milkshakes to wash it all down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Sarah? That's an awful lot of food for one girl your age. But if your sure\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra got in line and came back a few minutes later wit Sarah's huge order. Sarah started to stuff her face before Sandra put the plate down. She tore in the first hamburger and wolfed it down pretty fast. The second disappeared just as fast. The she started on the fries. She pushed them in her mouth several at a time. Taking sips from her milkshakes between. Then she devoured her first box of a dozen chicken nuggets. Half of her meal was gone but Sarah still had some room left in her tummy. She wolfed down the third hamburger. Then she grabbed the second pack of fries but she was clearly eating slower. But the fries disappeared in her belly. She washed it away with the last of her second milkshake. She then grabbed her last burger and ate it slowly. But she was able to eat him. Then She grabbed the nuggets. One by one. Washing each of them down with a few sips of her shake. Finally she plopped the last nugget in her mouth. After she swallowed it she emptied her third vanilla shake in her mouth and let out a huge belch. All other customers looked up disturbed.<br>\r\nSarah was completely stuffed an had a silly grin on her face.<br>\r\nSandra was surprised her daughter had been able to eat all that but she was't worried.     <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She slept naked with just a blanket over her huge body. She was a single child, and her parents wanted to keep her fat. She wiggled out of bed, her belly and thighs wobbling and jiggling with each step. She got out and stood up. Her huge belly hanging down, covering her genitals (maybe it's important to note that cow anthros don't have udders because they already have breasts that produce milk.) Even for a cow anthro she was obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to her bathroom, her pendulous belly swished and jiggled from side to side with each step and her huge ass, thighs, and udders swishing about, rubbing together with each step. As she got to the bathroom, she noticed her thighs rubbed against the door frame. \"Uhgggg, why do I have to have this body. All it's good for is taking up space\" She said. Angie turned on the shower faucet. The shower was widened so she could move around in it. Angie stepped in and rubbed her big body with water and shampooed her hair. Her wet fur dripped as she turned off the faucet. She got out and dried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie waddled to her closet and got out her XXXL clothes for school. white panties, a white bra, blue short shorts, and a gray T-shirt. <br>\r\n\"Angie!

About the only time that she felt truly satisfied was if she had just stuffed herself with as much food as she could. Dare she say, she even felt a bit of pleasure when she pushed herself a bit further. After the feeling of fullness wore off, she would always get angry at doing it again and how it would impact on her. Her parents didn't mind seeing their \"little\" girl eat so much, so she always had plenty of food around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning was no different; as she waddled through the house to the kitchen, she could already smell the feast her mother had prepared for her. Plopping down in her personal chair (which despite being reinforced for the rotund bovine, still groaned ominously under her weight), she kept thinking that she would only eat some of this. Cutting a large wedge out of the thick stack of pancakes, she looked at the thick syrup and butter dripping off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't eat much of this.\" She said to herself under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her proclamation, once she had the first bite, she continued eating and eating. Her mother certainly knew how to cook, and each taste would push Angie to keep eating, no matter how much she thought of stopping. Her mother came through to see how she was doing, grabbing some of the cleared plates and dropping them off into the sink to be cleaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my good little girl, eat it all up Angie,\" her mother said as she moved some of the other plates closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie only grunted a bit, desperately wanting to stop but unable to. It didn't take long for Angie to set her silverware down as she smeared the last bit of jam on the sole surviving piece of toast, which didn't last much longer. She sat back with a groan, the edge of her shirt riding up the swollen sphere of her belly, exposing a wedge of her stretched fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had done it again: eaten every last piece set before her. Her stomach was stretched painfully full, but she was content and pleased for now. A knock at the door stirred Angie out of her stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who could that be?\" Angie's mother said as she breezed past her daughter,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled voices carried from the door. Angie thought she recognized the new comer's voice, but she couldn't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe click of the door shutting was soon followed by two sets of foot steps coming closer, and her mother calling out \"Angie, one of your friends is her to go to school with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up as they entered the room, Angie instantly recognized who was here.</span></div></div>",

She maintained respectable feminine curves with lean muscles, all covered in brilliant deep blue scales. Despite her somewhat generous bust, she kept a large amount of grace, lightly flitting and shifting as she danced. Her clothing choices tended to help her stand out, and today was no different: a loose fitting top that complemented her body, knee length shorts that showed off her long lean legs. Her long luminous black hair was left loose and flowed from the top of her head down across her back between her small wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah, just finishing up...\" Angie trails off, realizing that Sarah can see what remains of her breakfast plates on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah just held up her hand, \"no worries, we've still got plenty of time if you need to.\" She flicked a loose lock of hair over her shoulder, looking at the wide spread of mostly cleaned plates littering the table. Knowing Angie though, Sarah knew this wasn't the whole lot though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, Angie stands up and wobbles a bit unsteadily. Sarah quickly moves in to help support her, though Angie just waves Sarah off. Sarah still hovers nearby as they move through the house back to the door.

Sarah smiled sheepishly before giving a wave to Angie's mother and closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving only a few blocks away from the school would have made it an easy walk for most people, but Angie wasn't most people.

I'm sure that your mom would be willing to drive us, it wouldn't take long.\" Sarah suggested as she caught up to Angie, who was already starting to huff and look like she was overheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can manage to walk just a few blocks to school.\" Angie said, trying to sound determined, though it really sounded like she wasn't sure herself. \"All right, if you say so.\" Sarah said, dropping into stride beside Angie.

However, as the two friends walked and spoke, Sarah was surprised to see Angie taking the walk rather well, each step she took sending her bovine curves wobbling within her clothing, making the cowgirl blush as she adjusted her bra, something Sarah had seen not many other fifteen year olds do in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie sighed as she adjusted her clothing over her huge form, hating her parents for treating her like a balloon for food, it was humiliating as she pulled her shirt down over her belly finally, having to adjust her bra again as her two triple G boobs wobbled within, she'd always been portly but since she got to her teen years it seemed like her parents were just putting more and more food on the table for her every year, she wanted to know why, but every time she asked, she got the same answer of 'a growing girl needs to eat' which infuriated her to no end, after all, she was only a 'growing girl' because of her parents constant feedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the two friends, chatting now, made it to the school, thankfully not late as they made their way to homeroom for the first period, Angie waddling into the classroom and blushing as she felt her hips snag on the door frame, Sarah following close behind, thankfully, nobody else was in class yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie wasn't an unpopular girl in school, in fact, most of the guys and girls in her homeroom were quite nice to her, knowing her troubles from her times spent crying over her weight, and most supported her if she was sad, there were however, three specific girls who took every possible chance to insult the poor gravid bovine about her weight whenever they can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese three girls entered the classroom a few seconds after Angie and Sarah sat down, a Lioness, a Wolfess, and a Fox, all plastic bimbo figured girls who started putting out when they were 13, their revealing clothes containing tight, under the knife curves that their rich daddies probably bought for them because they wined enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lioness and leader of the 'pack' was called Sheira,  a blonde haired bimbo queen of the school who had most jocks lining up for even a slim chance at banging her, yet amazingly, she was able to keep her virginity, using the guys she had at her beck and call to torment whoever she pleased. Her DD knockers were held in a tight pink tank top, wearing a denim jacket over it, her tight ass held in her black jeans. Her hair tied in a ponytail, her green eyes filled with snide malic as she spotted Angie and Sarah talking at the back of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, hey look girls, a whale's been beached in class\" she sneered, earning scowls from Sarah and Angie, as her two friends laughed at the jibe. Angie sighed, ignoring the three bitches, Sheira scowling a bit at not getting a reaction from the fat cow, before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went by as usual, Angie kept up her high grades, helping Sarah when she needed it, and maintaining a good relationship with most of her classmates, shrugging off every remark made by the class bimbo's with a sly smirk as she continued to beat them all in their tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, Angie and Sarah walked out of school to find, to their surprise, Angie's mother waiting for them in her car, waving with a smile that made Angie even angrier as she waddled up to the car, scowling at her now slightly worried looking mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...what are you doing here?\" she asked, an edge to her voice that frightened most people, her mother giving an embarrassed smile. \"w-well...i just wanted to make sure you were alright...c-c'ome on, lets go home.\" she said, gesturing to the back seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...i'll walk Mom...\" she said with no small hint of scorn, waddling with Sarah down the lane, leaving her mother looking after her sadly.</span></div></div>",

She's a mature, caring and quiet girl, who, while not shy, prefers to leave the limelight to someone else and would like to blend into the crowd, though her figure doesn't lend itself to this. Instead, she is the object of a decent amount of boys' affections, with a typically bovine hourglass figure, including a set of breasts nudging D-cup territory already, which has no doubt been helped by her appetite. She isn't fat, per se, or at least not yet, but she could definitely be called soft and doughy, with just under ten stone on her 5'4\" frame, though this extra flesh has been nicely hidden thus far with her modest dress sense. However, with her hearty eating habits, those clothes have been starting to shrink, especially now that she has just begun to enter the Christmas season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea, 18 year old anthro cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a vibrant silver tabby fur pattern, and an equally bubbly and excitable persona, Andrea was very much the party animal at her school. However, outside of her acitve socialising, she is also a fairly dilligent pupil, aside from the days of waking up with the after-effects of alcohol, and recieved good enough grades to make it into a decent university, as did her best friends and fellow feline Sandra, a black and white cat. Over the first few weeks, with the workload from her English literature course being minimal, the pair of felines took advantage and went to many of the parties and get-togethers in their hall, where booze was virtually on tap. This, coupled with a habit of ordering take-away food over cooking in the grubby little shared kitchen, has lead to the freshman fifteen already attacking her 5'9\" frame, and the accumulation of a small pooch over the waistband of her tight clothes. However, Andrea hasn't really noticed, as it has also caused her breasts and behind to swell as well.</span></div></div>",

She was a heavy gamer since she played a lot even compared to many males. She was a heavy gamer in the sense that she was an overweight girl. Seven hundred pounds was heavy for even an anthro dragon with a body similarly built to hers. She didn't care though. Anthro dragons were naturally immune to diabetes and heart attacks no matter how much they weighed. She liked being overweight and was not going to change any time soon. Her parents both oddly enough was also very pro heavy weight and three times grounded Desira for the girl's somehow losing weight. That being true Desira with a growling stomach took the three leftover triple extra large pizza pies five family sized bags of chips and four liter bottles of soda from the fridge and started eating. Both sides of Desira's family had been overweight but none of them were as heavy as she was when they were her age. If anything she was one of the heaviest in the three living generations of her family. The weight wad a tradition that started when her family was in a weight based feud. Many were immobilized during that feud. Desira was just lazy with a large appetite that had her at a peak of seven hundred seventy-five pounds. She was still gaining back that lost weight.

Within that dinner, a rather boisterous group of teenagers were out on the town having some fun and having an impromptu celebration after the successful completion of another day of finals. Three of them were cheering and chanting, the fourth only looked on with a somewhat amused expression, while the fifth was the center of attention: Isabella the dragox. She looked mostly like a vixen with thick and glossy black fur across most of her body, with similar glossy but slightly lighter gray fur forming a patch starting on her neck and continuing down across her torso. Her draconic heritage was evident in the great leathery wings sprouting from her back, the short somewhat blunt horns that were nearly hidden in the thick black curls of her hair, the small patches of scales almost hidden beneath her fur\u2014the most visible being around her eyes which had the reptilian slit as well, and the fact that her tail wasn\u2019t the usual bushy fox tail, but was long and serpentine instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad in a t-shirt from a concert she went to earlier in the year and a pair of jeans, her tail swished behind her slowly as she chugged down a pitcher of cola, with two empty but otherwise identical containers that were discarded on the table before her, all because of a friendly bet. As she finished draining all of the soda, she thumped the pitcher on the table and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. The noise level started to ramp up from the other four, but Isabella held up a finger for a moment before letting loose with a massive belch that shook the windows and rattled plates through the restaurant. A few seconds of silence reigned after the thunderous blast, before a whoop and a cheer went up from those around the table, and various irate and aggravated grimaces were cast their way from the other people in the dinner. The dragox took it in stride, giving a cocky grin and bowing her head theatrically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up at her friends, \u201cAll right, pay up. You guys should know to never bet against a dragon in something like that, even a half-dragon,\u201d she said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious grumbles of agreement went around the table as money was pulled out and stack up before Isabella. It was likely that everyone knew that she could do it, but couldn\u2019t pass up a chance to see it in any case. Once the money had been collected, she split it with Zayna, the only one who had bet with Isabella, and the one who was only amused by the event. Despite her predilection for dark colored clothes, the grey furred and blue haired bovine was quite upbeat and outgoing. She was wearing one of her typical outfits consisting of a tight low cut dark purple dress that barely fell on the right side of the school\u2019s dress code, thigh high black boots, and black arm sleeves. The sleeves were something that she almost always wore, no matter what else she was wearing. Zayna gave a slight smile as she thanked first Isabella then the other three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael \u2013 a tall and wiry falcon \u2013 scoffed as he turned his attention back to his burger and fries. He tugged at the jersey of his favorite international soccer team before turning to talk to the other male at the table: Scott a dark haired human. Scott was somewhat short and burly, and had lettered in football both his junior and senior years. Lastly, Megan slowly picked at her salad, the studious and usually shy panda looking quite surprised at how much she had gotten into the fervor of what had happened. She clutched at the collar of her long sleeved shirt, a nervous gesture that she sometimes made, especially when she realized how loud she might have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had finished eating, it was decided that things should keep moving. Michael, Scott, and Megan headed for the door to wait outside, while Zayna waited behind for Isabella. The dragox was a bit shocked at all that she had eaten: two large burgers and fries, in addition to the three pitchers of soda. Everything packed away within her stomach, causing it to bloat out and push the hem of her shirt up, revealing a band of furred flesh above her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young bovine tsked lightly before she spoke, \u201cIzzy, you know you didn\u2019t have to do all that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know, but it was fun,\u201d Isabella said with a wide grin, before taking on a more serious tone, \u201cBesides, how often are all of us going to be able to get together like this after this summer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZayna sighed and nodded, before helping Isabella up. As they did so, the dragox\u2019s hand strayed a bit, accidently brushing against Zayna\u2019s round rump. The cow stiffened as she felt it, before responding with\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zayna had to stand on tiptoes and crane her neck in order to reach but she eventually managed to brush Isabella\u2019s lips with her own. Zayna\u2019s breasts pressed up against the bottom of Isabella\u2019s own smaller bust, a situation that had happened plenty of times since their relationship had blossomed from friendship years before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around then, the buxom bovine gave a little flirty laugh and a wink before saying \u201cSave that for later, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she was out the door after the others, leaving Isabella standing there alone, more than a little flustered. She could still feel the lingering warmth of Zayna\u2019s body pressed up against her own, and was left stunned for a few moments longer. After shaking her head vigorously and recovering her wits, the dragox quickly followed, leaving a more than enough for the bill as well as a generous tip on the table before bolting out the door. Outside, night was starting to set in, and there was a pleasant cooling breeze sweeping through the streets, dispelling some of the warmth that had settled earlier in the day. Isabella also noted that there was already a heated discussion of where to go next. Mike was being rather emphatic with his choice, his hair bobbing around as he pointed and spoke, his beak clicking with each syllable. Scott on the other hand was standing firm, his stance as immovable physically as he was proving mentally. Isabella and Zayna just sat back and watched the show; this was a common enough occurrence. Megan soon stepped in as usual and first quietly disarmed the situation before suggesting a compromise. Both of the boys grumbled and rumbled a bit before giving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA decision made, the group moved off into the deepening night. Time flew and crawled as they enjoyed a little taste of freedom that they could before it really started after the next day, traveling from one location to the next, but always with a general direction in mind. Along their journey, they come across others from the school out doing much the same. The five of them eventually ended up at the beach, looking out at the waves looming out of the darkness, and savoring the cool breeze that was still hanging about and making the temperature bearable. Eventually, the group started to scatter, each heading their own way towards home. All except for Isabella and Zayna though, they continued on through the quieting streets together, the smaller young woman hugged up against the larger, hand in hand. Isabella\u2019s other arm was wrapped around Zayna\u2019s shoulder, holding her close. When she felt a shiver pass through the bovine\u2019s body, the dragox extended a wing out, draping it across her like a cloak. Zayna hummed thanks as she nuzzled down into the warm appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, Izzy noticed how Zayna seemed to be absentmindedly moving their entwined hands together over Isabella\u2019s still somewhat bloated belly. The belch at the restaurant, as well as a number of smaller ones later on, had reduced the size of her stomach, but not by much. It was still a bit plusher than she was used to, as was her entire body. She hadn\u2019t noticed at first when it started months before, but eventually she came to realize that she had put on some weight while she wasn\u2019t paying attention\u2014 a majority of it within the past month or so too. A trip to the bathroom scale had revealed a gain of about thirty pounds; quite a shock to her, but as her heartbeat started to slow, she thought it might not be too unwelcome a change. She hadn\u2019t been flat as a board or anything, but now she definitely had a respectable bust and butt, and Zayna hadn\u2019t seemed to mind at all; if anything the smaller but curvier woman actually seemed to enjoy it, if Isabella had read the situation correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough they were walking up the front steps to Isabella\u2019s home, a quick shake of the head dispelling her thoughts and bringing her back to the present. A few lights were on, she noted, including one in the living room at the front. Though the blinds were pulled, she could also see a bit a shadow moving in front of it; it looked like her mother at home again. Opening up the door and stepping in, the two kicked off their shoes before heading towards the stairs, stopping by the door to the living room. As expected, Isabella\u2019s mother was reclining on the sofa, reading a book with the television mostly providing a bit of white noise. She had the book propped up in front of her, further out than most might need, but requiring that due to her large breasts and far larger stomach; the latter of which was exposed to the air with her shirt rolled up atop. Isabella clearing her throat finally announced the presence of the two in the doorway, shocking her mother slightly and almost causing her to drop the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsabella, you\u2019re home. How long have you been back?\u201d she said, trying to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just got in,\u201d she responded, motioning towards Zayna who stepped out of the shadows behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Mrs. Greyson, how you are tonight?\u201d she said as she stepped up beside Isabella.</span></div></div>",

To do this, write an option chapter with two characters plus 'other' after the age has been selected. TV characters don't need this description, but the option chaper will still be neccessary. Always leave 'other' as a choice at the end of these 'option chapters', to allow for the creation of other characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't end this story, please.
