            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josie glanced at the clock for what she felt was the thirtieth time that Saturday.  Weekends never used to be this slow.  There always seemed to be so much to do with time in short supply, although now she couldn't quite remember why exactly.  Oscar, her ginger cat stirred on her lap for a moment to glance up at her, as though something interesting was going to happen and then proceeded to settle back down to sleep one he realised it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie sighed.  She wasn't exactly devastated that Joel had left - although admittedly his sudden move to the North of the Country was a bit of a surprise - but their relationship had been shaky for a while - they were both pushing thirty and no longer seemed to be the same people they had been five years ago.  Which was, of course, ridiculous.  Of course they were the same people.  They just seemed to want different things these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to dislodge Oscar, she reached for the pile of books on the coffee table and flipped through them.  They were the same kind of thing she usually read; thrillers, mystery.  Suddenly she felt tired of them, as though she had been reading the books she had loved as a teen for ten years without even stopping to consider why.  She looked down at her cat hair-y trackies, old slippers shaped like tigers and the blur of 80's comedy characters on the television in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I stay like this now Oscar, I feel I will end up like this forever\".  She said aloud.  The cat did not stir.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Josie, stood, sending the cat yowling from her lap as he sprung to the floor.  Marching to the bedroom she used to share with Joel, she abandoned her house clothes for a pair of nice jeans and a stripy sweater with some heeled ankle boots, pinning her blond hair back into a fashionably messy bun and adding mascara and blusher to her pale face.  Before she could think about it any more, she grabbed her bag and faux leather jacket and left the flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mission one accomplished\"  she thought triumphantly.  She would go to the library and get some books out - different books though, not the same thing she always read.  She would go to the horror, the Sci - fi and the romance sections and pick a book at random from each.  That would be a good start - after all, books could take you to places, other worlds.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was fresh and cold.  It was February which meant Spring should be on the way soon but winter was still holding on fast.  The sun was shining however and the sky was a gloriously bright blue.  The library wasn't far - about a twenty minute walk and Josie felt better for being out in the fresh air.  Shortly, she entered the modern library building, bright lights and rows of books accosting her as she entered.  Just as she was about to head for the fiction department something caught her eye on The Board - a notice section opposite the automatic entrance doors where people pinned up cards with furniture for sale, evening craft clubs or wanted lift - shares and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe A4 notice stood out for its bright colours and illustrations of aeroplanes and palm trees.  Josie moved closer to read the text<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b><div align=\"center\"><br>\r\nTHE HOLIDAY CLUB!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to travel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to meet new people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to experience new things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen join us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitement and adventure begin here!

The whole concept seemed bizzare - but it had an odd appeal.  Josie HAD always wanted to travel.  Joel had never been in to foreign holidays.  He hated the sun - and foreign food.  Usually they went to Cornwall or the Lake District for their holidays - which she had never minded, but now the seed had been planted in her mind, it seemed stuck fast.  Suddenly her thoughts were racing - what if life after Joel wasn't just nights in with Oscar and a good book?  What if she could be someone total different....live a different kind of life...?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josie heads to the fiction section, deep in thought. Joel would think she was crazy if she did this. But hadn't he abrogated any right to judge what she did now? Her family and friends would probably side with Joel. Not that she sees much of any of them. And what's the worst that can happen?  It's just a meeting, isn't it, nothing set in stone. <br>\r\nBut she still hesitates, chewing on the side of her thumb in that way Joel always used to complain about. Oh, stop thinking about him. She spins on her heel in the aisle of books, and starts looking at the titles on the spines. Her laughter barks out in the silence when she sees the book right in front of her. Love on the French Riviera. So the holiday theme is going to chase her through the library is it? It\u2019s a romance, which she had promised herself, so she picks it up and wanders to the sci-fi section.<br>\r\nSomehow, when she has had her books issued, she finds herself back in front of the poster. It does seem intriguing and life with Joel had become anything but. He was a man who even had his socks set out in order for every day of the week. Josie was lucky to even wear matching socks.<br>\r\nBefore she leaves the library, she finds the travel section. The selection is like a smorgasbord laid out before her, countries she has long forgotten wanting to visit, countries she has never even heard of, countries she knows snippets about from Geography lessons back in school. Tea-growing in Ceylon. Sri Lanka, rather. Windmills and tulips in Holland. She shrinks a little inside her clothes, that she has never known these places in any more than a cursory reading in a school text book. She hasn\u2019t smelled them, been touched by them, lived them.<br>\r\nShe gathers up an armful of random books, and takes them over to a reading desk. For the rest of the afternoon, she is absorbed, delving into book after book for facts about China, about Romania, Slovakia, Denmark. But facts, she thinks, are only a small part, a very small part of the story. As she leaves the library, she decides she must buy a passport.<br>\r\nWhen she reaches the pub later, it is immediately obvious which group of people she needs to join. Suspended from a wooden beam in the ceiling, above three tables grouped together, is a large beach umbrella, a beach ball, a few pairs of flip-flops and an A3 sized mock-up of a European passport. Josie smiles to herself, and walks over to the four people already assembled. <br>\r\n\u201cYou must be the Holiday Club?\u201d she said. All four look up at her with smiles, gesture her to sit down. One man leaps to his feet.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you drinking? It\u2019s always on us, first drink for new members.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, gin and tonic please.\u201d Josie asks. \"Makes me feel in the holiday mood.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what this group is about. I\u2019m Charlie, by the way.\u201d<br>\r\nJosie was a few minute early, but by six o\u2019clock, all the seats around the tables are full and Josie realises she knows a couple of people there. Charlie starts the meeting. The group are discussing a trip to France next month, for a fortnight. If ten people go, they can get a bigger gite, making the cost lower per person.<br>\r\n\u201cWe only need one more person. Josie, do you think you could join us?\u201d<br>\r\nJosie hesitates. It\u2019s short notice to take time off work, and she doesn\u2019t have a passport yet, but she has never been to France, and isn\u2019t it exactly the kind of adventure she signed up for, coming along to this group. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, sheesh, I don\u2019t know, Charlie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n668 words</span></div></div>",

Pondering the questions from the flyer, everything had a check mark beside it -- the excitement of meeting new people, travelling, and experiencing new things was just what the heart-break doctor order. <i>Take that, Joel!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened her hair in the hallway mirror and rushed out the door. The bus stopped at the corner of Palmeston Road and Main Street. She saw the sign, 'The Slug and Lettuce', waving back and forth in the wind. She lingered and hesitated before opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going in, or running for the hills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep voice came from across her shoulder and she glanced behind her. \"I'm not sure yet.

She glanced sideways and saw it was a man - about her age - looking at the same poster.  Instinctively she moved aside a little in order for him to be able to get a better look.  He looked at her and smiled, then gestured to the poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks interesting,\" He said.  \"I've always wanted to travel a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" replied Josie, surprising herself with the statement.  Yet once the words were out they seemed to be true. The man gestured again to the poster and then looked at his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's today,\" He pointed out. \"I guess it's now or never then.  What do you think?\"  He smiled slyly.  Josie stared at him, slightly taken aback at his confidence and his forward manner.  She was not accustomed to striking up conversations at random with men in the library - or anywhere else for that matter.  Nevertheless there was something appealing about him.  He was dressed slightly oddly in jeans and a vintage jacket which might have looked ridiculous on some guys but he seemed to carry it off.  He wore glasses with black plastic frames and his brown hair was slightly tousled as if he had tried to create the look with hair wax but a little unsuccessfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not doing much else,\"  Josie said by way of a commitment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Peter, by the way,\"  He said.  \"I've just moved down here actually - thought I would try and find out what's going on in the area - the library is always a good place to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  She exclaimed.  \"I thought your accent sounded unfamiliar.  Where are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Newcastle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh - you've come a long way down South!  How are you finding it in Portsmouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warmer.....\"  He laughed and then she did too.  Without thinking about it, she realised that she had wandered back out in to the late afternoon sunshine with him.  The two of them now stood, bookless outside the building.  Peter turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should I call you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie.\"  She shook her head apologetically and smiled.  \"My name is Josie.\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, walkable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not far.\" She responded, glancing at her watch.  \" About half an hours walk I suppose, maybe 40 minutes.  Or - we can get a cab.  There's a rank just over by the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind a walk, after all, sun still seems to be out!\"  He beamed, seeming genuinely happy or perhaps surprised at the fact.  Josie turned to lead the way down to Southsea.  She was surprised at how easily she found herself able to chat to Peter, a man whom just half an hour ago she had never seen before in her life.  He was outgoing and friendly and never seemed to let the conversation falter, regularly asking her about local landmarks they passed.  For Josie, who had few friends who weren't from the City, it was refreshing to be able to exhibit her local knowledge to somebody who was from out of town and she found that they reached their destination before she had even had time to wonder about what they might find there - and of course where this whole thing might lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you.\"  Peter said at the entrance, holding the door for her.  She smiled anxiously, suddenly very glad that she had not arrived here alone - if she had have done, she would probably turn around right now and head for the familiar safety of her soft furnishings and placid yet somewhat disinterested tabby.  Once inside they looked around for any sign of the group they were trying to find.  Josie had been to the bar several times, usually with some of the girls from work for cocktails on a Friday night and sometimes for dinner with Joel on a Monday.  She looked at her watch again. It wasn't quite six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're a bit early,\" She said, turning to Peter. \"Shall we get a drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed over to the bar and ordered their drinks which Peter kindly said he would get.  Whilst he was paying, Josie spotted a young woman dressed in a fashionable skirt and red high heels over at the other side of the bar near the sofas.  She had a pile of papers in her hand and was laying them carefully out on the table in front of her.  She nudged Peter.  \"Look, do you think that's someone from the club?  I think those pictures are photos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out!\"  Replied Peter, and started towards her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How are you?  Nice to meet you. Have you traveled far?  I'm Anna, I run the club - well, sort of.  Nice day isn't it?  Makes a change to see the sun doesn't it? \"  Josie shook Anna's hand gingerly, trying to remember all the questions and the order in which they were asked, then wondering if in fact they were rather more rhetorical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst she was still musing the subject, Peter took charge by introducing them both and delivering the story of how they had met an hour before at the library.  His easy confidence amazed Josie - he didn't seem to have to think of things at all before he said them, and yet everything he said sounded so natural.  She tried to imagine Joel in a similar situation but the idea of him bumping in to a random girl at the library and going to some strange travel club with her seemed preposterous.  The fact made Josie all the more determined.  Just as she was about to chip in to the story, there was a kerfuffle near the doorway and the sound of a glass breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!  I'm sorry!\"  A man's voice called out, then quieter, \"Jezebel, Jez, come here.  Stay here will you.  Sorry, sorry, he's a bit new to it all,\"  the man continued as a bartender made his way over to pick up the broken glass which had fallen off the nearby table which the guide dog had unceremoniously bumped in to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Charlie.\" replied the barman, placing a hand on the mans shoulder - the club's over there by the way, in the corner today, opposite the bar there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right!\" Replied Charlie.  Josie watched as the blind man approached, dog in one hand and stick in the other, which he used to navigate them both towards the group of three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Charlie!\" Anna exclaimed, \"How are you?  Got a new dog then?  He's a beauty isn't he.  Big dog! Or is it a she?  I love dogs I do.  Lovely day isn't it?  How's Rebecca? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie watched the somewhat one sided exchange with intrigue.  Was the blind man really a member of the holiday club?  How could you go flying round the World with a dog and a stick?  Were guide dogs even allowed on planes?  Just as she was plucking up the courage to ask, another person appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie turned round to look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Previously, she had only been up here for cookery books and once for a copy of \"King Lear\" when Joel had been thinking of auditioning for a play.  She had never really thought to notice all the other different categories - religion, history, photography, psychology, meteorology...how odd that the World was full of these things that she never really paid any attention to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe travel section was huge, spanning several bookcases.  There seemed to be a book for every Country she could imagine as well as some for places she had never heard of.  The pictures of beaches and rainforests, pyramids and cruise ships made her feel slightly giddy with a mixture of trepidation and excitement.  Could she be the sort of person who would go jetting off to Paris or Rome or Los Angeles?  The kind of girl who regaled friends at dinner parties with exciting stories of swimming with dolphins in the Caribbean or Flamenco dancing with a young Spaniard in Madrid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts still racing she selected a pile of books for places she thought she might like to go and could reasonably afford and turned towards the check out machines.

Feeling chilly in her jacket, she decided to take the bus down to The Slug - In any case, she didn't really fancy walking whilst carrying the pile of books.  Hugging them to her chest, she walked through the arch under the big screen which oddly enough was showing some footage of a sandy beach at that moment - she laughed to herself - was this some kind of omen? As she headed towards the stop, she saw the number seven rounding the corner and decided to make a run for it, dodging people and traffic as she jogged over the road.  She might not have caught it at all if it hadn't been for a woman fumbling with her change and apparently having some kind of altercation with the driver.  Josie stood behind her, slightly out of breath, half interested in what the problem was, half thinking that she should probably start making use of the gym membership her brother had paid for her as a Christmas present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The snail, \" The woman was saying to the driver in accented English, \"It's called the snail, you know, a Pub.  The seven.  To the snail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver looked bemused and began to reel off a list of road names, none of which the woman seemed to have heard of.  Josie regarded her - she was about the same age, but taller, and more stylish.  Her hair coloured two tone, red and black and she wore a cream coloured fake fur jacket.  In her hand she held a book.  It was a guide book of Ireland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie leaned forward towards the drivers cab,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sorry - I think she might mean \"The Slug and Lettuce\" - on Palmerston Road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!  Yes that's it!

She looked at the guide book.  It seemed a bit of a coincidence but something compelled her to ask the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may seem like an odd question but....you don't happen to be a member of \"The Holiday Club\" do you?\"</span></div></div>",

He missed hitting a small Austin mini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ... no  ... no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie looked at her new friend. \"What's the matter ... by the way, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Krista, and those men in that car are after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Business from Latvia.

As the bus driver talked with the two men, they ran down to Palmeston Road and into the The Slug and Lettuce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth out of breath, Krista grabbed Josie's arm hard. \"You have to help me hide, and I have to hide this too.

It was in the right hand pocket of her jacket and she had to maneuver the pile of books in her arms in order to retrieve it.  Distracted, she answered without checking the called ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause and she thought perhaps the person had hung up but then a familiar voice filtered through the handset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Josie, it's me.  It's...it's Joel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joel!\" Josie stood wide eyed, in the forecourt at the front of the library, the sunlight glinting of the cover of \"Discover the Greek Islands\" which topped the pile of books she held.  Momentarily, she was lost for words.  Since they had split in October, they had spoken a few times or sent texts, mainly to do with practical issues like sorting out bills or what to do with the money in the joint account.  It had all been fairly amicable and they had politely inquired after each others well being and sent good wishes to families and so on, but they weren't in the habit of calling each other for a social chat, and now most of the practical issues had been dealt with, there was little reason to call at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\"  She asked, fearing then that his call must be related to some kind of emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, oh yes, I'm fine, I just.....\"  He began to trail off before adding, \"Sorry.  Are you busy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie considered the books, which were becoming a slight strain on her arms.  Should she tell Joel about the meeting?  There was no reason NOT to tell him but for some reason she held back, feeling this wasn't something she wanted to share with her ex boyfriend.  She headed over to one of the benches outside the Guildhall and set the books down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine, I'm not busy,\"  She replied brightly, \"I just popped in to town.  It's a nice day here, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  It's raining in Manchester,\"  His tone was flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I.....look, could we meet up somewhere?  In London maybe?  Tomorrow.  I think we should talk.  I think we should meet up and talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet up and talk?\"  Josie laughed, \"What on Earth do you want to talk about Joel?  I'm not going to London tomorrow.  What's the matter?  Are you ill?  Has something happened to someone?  I haven't heard from you since Christmas and suddenly this?\"  She found herself getting irritated and it showed in her voice, \"What IS that matter with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we made a mistake Josie.\" He finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She added her location to the search and a link to the group showed up on the page. She held her breath and clicked the link.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group website was full of picture of smiling people in exotic locations. Josie was naturally suspicious so she wondered if it were a scam. <i>They probably want my credit card information to join the group and search the site</i>, she thought. She clicked on a photograph of a waterfall labeled Hawaii and waited for the pop up requesting personal information, but instead was pleasantly surprised by a page outlining the trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Maui, Hawaii<br>\r\n7 days of paradise<br>\r\nWhale watching, snorkeling, hiking and swimming during the day and luaus at night.
