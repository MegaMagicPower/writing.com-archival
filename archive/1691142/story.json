As you squeeze through and make your way to your room you meet Tony rushing down the hall way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man, hurry up get you stuff, the guys are getting the car.\u201d He says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and say \u201cJust let me drop my books in my room, I\u2019ll meet ya\u2019ll down stairs.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush to your room, throw your book bag on the bed, grab your stuff and take a moment to glance over you room to make sure you didn\u2019t forget anything, you smile and think to yourself, \u201cThis is going to be an epic week.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then close then lock the door and rush downstairs. When you get to the parking lot u sees the guys waiting for you around the car, \u201cCome on, Aaron we got to go.\u201d Nick says, you then jump in the car and head to the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you going for Spring Break?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you and your friends didn\u2019t mind, you were all single and looking for the spring break experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Baby!! How you doin?\u201d Tony says to a long legged Brazilian chick you pass on the road, she turns around smiling and keeps walking with her friends. \u201cSee she smile, so that\u2019s one for me.\u201d He says smiling, \u201cOh come on man, she didn\u2019t even stop.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friends had made a bet to see who could get the most girls by the end of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but that was only because ya\u2019ll were cramping my style.\u201d Hey says laughing, \u201cOh so were making you look bad?\u201d Nick says, \u201cLook at these.\u201d He says flexing his biceps. \u201cThere is no competition, I got this.\u201d He says, \u201cHey guys remember if you get slapped the girl doesn\u2019t count, give me two days and you\u2019ll see who the king is.\u201d You say smiling, \u201cHe\u2019s right guys, you\u2019ll see.

After spending all night at the bar, you all decided to take a break and rest in your hotel room, where an inebriated Tony half jokingly pointing at the mini-bar. A man named Leo who was at the concierge desk had to help you into the room and into the adjacent suite with Jordan, your roommate for the night, as you kept falling and complaining about your \"ass bone\". You apologized to Leo half-heartedly, which was responded by the utterly easy smile that some latin people are known for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Aaron, we're in the Honeymoon suite\" said Jordan, half joking and half obliviously. Leo smiled as you were \"tucked in\"(really just dropped on the bed, as it was too hot to be under the covers that night), and went back to the front room to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you, you'll be fine in the morning gentlemen. Sleep well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Drunken grunting*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the hotel clerk shut the door. It was 4:30 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicky, can I ask you a question?\" asked Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" Nick was breathing heavily, looking at the ceiling, then out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we should have got a bungalow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wtf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, relative pansy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight weakling. Anime lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sly Stallone look-a-like on crack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky laughed, and finally hit the sack with zero inhibition. Tony waited for a response that never was to com that morning for two minutes, and then went to bed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other room, Jordan mentioned something about iguana's to Aaron, who didn't understand anything since he was so stone drunk that night. Truth be told, Aaron didn't want everyone to know that it was his first time, which was why he fell on his ass so many times on the way to the room. Jordan, bemused, also went to sleep in his queen size bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight hours passed before the first of the Cancun four woke up, which happened to be Aaron. He noticed a girl in Jordan's bed with a shirt that said \"I will not love you long time.\" Confused, he looked inside the other room, and saw two other girls. One was a redhead still wearing her boots in bed, and the other was a Dominican girl in a bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did we get these hookers?\" he asked out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he noticed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" she whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they all look like now: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://picasion.com/pic28/1ea547c21fc289ed28d5e1a4d8e103db.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://picasion.com/pic28/1ea547c21fc289...</a></span></div></div>",

I'm starving!\" Nick says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your friends get dressed in their normal attire, you wonder what you're going to wear. You open your suitcase and find that your pairs of clothes have changed too. You have loads of bikinis, panties, thongs, tank tops, bras, shorts, and many other items of clothing. Not wanting to wear something too revealing, you decide on a tank top and shorts, with a bra and panties underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou change in the bathroom and when you walk out, your friends stare speechlessly at you. \"Come on guys, let's go!\" you say, trying to get them to stop staring at you. As you and your friends walk out the door, you feel your hips and ass sway and your huge breasts jiggle with every step you take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a strange, interesting spring break for you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was no such thing as magic, no matter what Joanne Rowling or Jim Butcher told you. This was some horribe nightmare that you felt you would never find the truth about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The drinks. What about something in the drinks?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that might work, Tony.

You gasp as you realize that you've been admiring a guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan looks over and then down at your breasts.  He laughs. \"See something you like?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to see what he's looking at and notice that your nipples are hard and very visible through your bikini top.  Blushing you growl, \"Fuck you\" and lay back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and and can't help thinking of that guy's firm ass.  Maybe a walk will clear your head.  Or now that you know that your 'female' body is reacting that way you can take another look and overcome it. </span></div></div>",

There are 15 of you on the stage, the announcer starts to ask for applause and cheers for the crowd's favorite. Based on the cheers, the announce settles on 3 of you.  One is a small sexy redhead.  The other is a blonde like you.  They are both pretty and have nice boobs but you are by far the bustiest.  \"OK, now, for the final selection.  Remember, this is for a $250 shopping card so lets go!\"  Pointing at the other blonde, he calls out \"Wendy!!!\"  A large applause erupts.  \"And Kelly!\" he says.  Her applause isn't very loud.  But then, to your surprise, She lifts up her bikini top and shakes her boobs.  The crowd loves it and gets louder.  \"And Erin!\" You realize he's pointing at you, you grin over at the other two girls and lift up your top.  Shaking your boobs, the crowd gives you the loudest response.  When you bounce a bit, you hear the announcer say, \"Who would have thought those were natural! But look at them jiggle and bounce!\"  You give him a grin, then look over at Roger.  He's yelling for you and gives you the thumbs up.  Something about all of this is making you tingle.  As you pull your bikini top down, you can tell your nipples are hard and really sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer goes over to a table, talks for a second with the people there and brings back the prizes.  Wendy gets a free massage for third place.  Then he smiles at both of you and says, \"For second place, and a dinner for 2 at our restaurant... Kelly!!! That means, Erin, you win our $250 gift certificate. Thanks for coming folks, stick around for more action.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually feel excited about winning.

A part of you is angry that he kissed you.  The larger part of you is angry that you enjoyed it and that you want another kiss.

Yeah!!! I'd like that so badly. I've wanted you so much since you changed yesterday!\" She replies. She takes your new face, beaming at you. She leans in and you press your lips against hers. You no longer care whether you are man or a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you know is that you are with one of the most beautiful creatures you have ever seen. You lose yourself in the moment as your kissing runs its natural course. You are no virgin, but the relations you experience today leaves all of them for dead. You have never felt so fulfilled, the actions, the ministrations, the delight coursing through your bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou separate from Jordan, kissing her neck tenderly. She moans appreciatively. Jordan watches you as you dress. You feel so much better now. \"What does this mean?\" she asked. \"What do you mean, Jordy?\" you reply, surprised. \"I mean...are we gay?\" she wondered. \"Well, we are two women who just had sex with each other. So yeah, we're lesbians!\" you respond. \"But what happens when we become guys again? I mean...you made love with me, Aaron!\" she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made Love? Jordan, babe, you sound like a chick!\" you remark, surprised at her comment. \"I am a chick! And so are you, aren't you? How are you not freaking out about this?\" she cried. You turn and hold her as she starts to cry. \"Babe! Jordan, darling, don't cry! Come on, sweetie! Whatever happens in the future, for now I'm your girlfriend and we're lesbians!\" you reply, rubbing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron...I don't want to be a guy again! I...I love you!\" she squeals. You hold on to her, pulling her tight to you, more confused than ever. Jordan is in love with you. She wants to stay a girl! Do you want to stay a woman? Whatever happened before, you are completely surprised by these turn of events. She pulled herself out of your grasp, looking at you. Her eyes are tear filled and slightly puffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jordan, I don't know what I want long term. But I know I want to be with you right now! So let's not worry about whether we will go back to being guys or will stay girls forever. Let's just enjoy being here together!\" you reply. Jordan nodded, but her lip trembled. \"Do...do you love me?\" she ask, fear in her voice. The truth is you don't know. Yesterday, she was a guy who was your friend. Now she has become your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I love you, babe! What kind of question is that?\" you reply. \"I mean...are you in love with me? Because I...I'm in love with you, Aaron! If we go back to being guys, I don't think that will go away!\" she answered, trembling. You press your lips against her again, holding her tight. You feel strange, not aroused but happy. Like a smile has been plastered on your face permanently. Your stomach feels weird, like its empty or full, you're not sure which. Your eyes feel weird, like you are about to cry, but there's no water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou separate and look at Jordan. You are sure now of what to say. \"Guy or Girl, you and me are forever babe! But between you and me, I'd rather be a lesbian couple!\" you state. \"Really?\" she expresses, happily. Her eyes are teary still, but in a happy and joyful way. \"Really, really, my soul mate!\" you reply. You gag internally at your statement until you feel Jordan's tongue entering your mouth. You feel that joy spreading in your belly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothes seem to melt off you as you two begin to express your love again. A knock on the door silences you both. \"Aaron? Jordan? Do you have a girl in here?\" asked Nick. \"Dudes, if you do; let us know!\" declared Tony. You yell at the top of your voices \"P*** off, guys! I have a super sexy girl with me!\" \"Ok, got it!

You feel that familiar feeling of joy seeping through your being. You lose yourself in the delights of Jordan's tender flesh.

You kiss the top of her head as she rests on your b******. \"I'm the girl!\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe, I don't get it. We are both girls!\" you reply. \"No, No, I mean in our relationship, I'm the girly one!\" she exclaims. You pause, thinking about it. \"Honestly, I just think you're my girl! I don't really care who the girly one is!\" you declare. \"But that's just it! Aaron...wait right before we starting...making love...\" she blushes as you beam kissing her forehead again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called yourself Erin. I guess maybe...we can't go back! Though I don't want to! I want us to be a lesbian couple forever! I...I just don't want this to end!\" she cried. You ran your hands through her hair, gently cooing at her. \"We will find out how this happened to us. Then we will make sure that we stay girls! As for our parents, we will tell them we are dating hot girls! And that will be that, babe!\" you state firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Jordan happily. She has stopped crying, her eyes closed. She is sleeping, her breathing gentle and soft. You lift her around the ribs, she giggled in her sleep. You lay her on the bed and taking out some clothes. You dress each other, despite the fact she is tinier than you. You lift her unto your right shoulder and step out. You use your spare hand to open and lock the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a little strange to walk down the corridor to the stairs. But you are determined to meet and explain the situation to the guys. You have no intention of letting them upset your girl. You noticed that its\u2019 dark outside. You realise that its night time and neither you or Jordan have eaten all day except for the obvious.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Tony are sitting down with some juicy steaks and beers. \"Hi Guys, sorry we're late!\" you explain. \"Aaron, man! Wait why are you holding Jordan on your right shoulder?\" asked Nick, confused. \"Guys, don't make a big deal about this! But Jordan and I are together!\" you reveal. Nick and Tony look at you confused. \"What do you mean together?\" asked Nick, again. \"We are dating. She's my girlfriend and I am hers! Be cool about it, when she wakes up!\" you declare, ice in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Aaron, what happens if you turn back into guys?\" expressed Nick. \"Nothing changes, Jordan is my girl! She's freaked about how you will handle it, so be nice! Both of you! And we will find a way to stay girls!\" you snap back, angry about Nick's reaction. \"Dude, I didn't mean anything by it!\" replied Nick, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have thought about it. Explaining to our parents, we are dating hot chicks. Getting our university records turned over to our new female personas. Getting new passports, though mine seems to have changed with my clothes, Jordan's clothes are still male as is her passport. But we are a couple and I expect you two to be nice to Jordan about it! I don't want my girlfriend upset!\" you exclaim, feeling angry that the two of them aren't cool about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, Aaron! What did you do to the table?\" gasped Tony. You look down and realise you have reduce part of the table you were holding in your left hand to splinters and rubble. You crumble the remainder in your left hand, releasing wooden dust to the floor. You look at your left hand, it is completely unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron...how long have you been holding Jordan in your right arm?\" asked Nick, concerned. \"Umm...I got her out of our bed and carried her here. I...uh...haven't let go of her yet!\" you reveal, not sure where this was going. \"Aaron...Jordan may be a tiny girl...but there shouldn't be any way for you to still be carrying her! I mean you haven't shifted her weight at any time, though she's tiny!\" Nick adds, fearful as you feel anger through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My babe is just tiny and perfect! And light, obviously!\" you exclaim. \"Aaron, man, calm down! We're not having a go at Jordan! It's just that you despite having the body of a cheerleader; you have the strength and emotions of She-Hulk!\" remarked Tony. \"Yeah man, even a buff stud like me, couldn't carry Jordan, though she is perfect for you and tiny, for all that time without at least flinching!\" admitted Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grow wide, when you remember lifting Jordan off you. She felt like a feather. What happened to you? \"Arm wrestle contest!\" suggested Nick, assuming the position. Despite your concern, you agree. \"One, two, three, GO!\" roars Nick, putting all his strength into it. To your amazement, you could barely feel anything. Nick began to struggle, unable to move your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick adds his second hand, while Tony added both of his. Neither of them could produce a stir. You didn't really notice much of a difference between one hand and 4. You watch both of them as they pushed as hard as they could. You decide to take pity on both of them. You gentle move your hand now. They both get up shaking their hands. \"Sorry guys!\" you state, a touch of smugness in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!Ha!Ha!Ha! What a bunch of wusses! I'll show you losers, how its' done! Hi hot babe!\" declared a muscle bound clod sitting in their place. You feel a hatred stir in your body. \"Watch it, buddy! Don't talk that way in front of my girlfriend!\" you roar. He grins even wider. \"How about dinner for three?\" \"Twenty bucks I can pin your sorry a***!\" you bellow, you're even seeing red. \"I'll take that bet, babe!\" he taunts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe offers his hand and you take it. You squeeze his hand, causing him to scream. \"Is that all you've got, tough guy?\" you mock him. He tries to use his other hand, to push yours down or at least free his. You smirk as you squeeze it hard, a cracking sound leading to a blood-curdling cry from him. \"Keep quiet, you will wake up my girlfriend Jordan!\" you smirk as you add a little pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood starts coming from his hand and you decide to show him mercy. You fling your hand to the table, breaking it and you suspect the other guys hand. \"You BITCH!\" he roars, swinging his good hand at you. You catch it easily and twist it down. Another scream emanates from  the jerk. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get an apology from you right now, I\u2019ll break this hand too!\u201d you threaten with all the menace possible in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twist and squeeze hard to make your point. He squeals, pleading and apologising to the 4 of you and everyone else. He begins to bawl like a baby as the pain burns through his body.  You release him, causing him to fall to the ground with a thud. You tower over him, menacingly. He crawls away, running away in terror. There is silence before a loud series of applause fills the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan stirs, slowly opening her pretty eyes. You beam at your darling girl. \"Hi gorgeous, did you sleep well?\" you enquire. \"'YAWN' Yes, sweetheart, I did! Oh hi guys!\" she squealed upon seeing Tony and Nick. \"It's cool, darling, I told them! They are cool about it!\" you reply, eyeing both your friends. \"It's no biggie!\" \"You're both lesbians!\" Nick and Tony state, somewhat nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what happened to that table?\" asked Jordan, somewhat relieved. The three of you look at each other, uncertain of how to answer. \"So, you guys are really cool about us?\" she repeated, nervously. \"Seriously Jordan, we are totally cool about it! I mean you two are lesbians! It makes total sense, you two would hook up! Besides you both make a good couple!\" stated Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at the two of them before pressing your lips against Jordan. Jordan relaxed against you, the familiar feeling of joy erupting in your body. \"Excuse me, can I just say that was awesome!\" exclaimed</span></div></div>",

Nick smirks \"Nick Rogers, but you can call me Nick!\" he responded suggestively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered something in his ear and walked away, winking at him. \"Excuse me, ladies and Tony!\" he exclaimed, running away to catch up with the girl. \"What a s***! She just wants to get laid and she just met him!\" she expressed with disgust. She suddenly looked at you with an intense look. \"Did you think that bitch was hot?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am not sure. I was just weirded out she just started talking to me then Nick. Besides it totally doesn't matter. You're the only girl I want to be with!\" you stammer, uncertain by this turn of events. \"So you do think she's hot?\" she snarled. \"Babe, the only woman who I think is hot is you!\" you respond, firmly. She relaxed at that, cuddling against you. \"You're my soul mate! I love you!\" she declared, pressing against you. You kiss her forehead as she purrs contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. So...can we please talk about why Aaron has the strength of a She-Hulk?\" expressed Tony. \"What do you mean, my Erin is perfect!\" retorted Jordan, angrily. \"Erin?\" asked Tony, slightly mockingly. \"Are you making fun of me, Tony?\" you demand, fury in your eyes. Tony shook his head vehemently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jordan, babe, there's something you should know. Why you slept I beat up some big hulking guy! I...I don't know how it happened!\" you explain. She looked at you, then at Tony. \"Wow, my big strong girl! You have to tell me all about it, after we've eaten. I...uh...need to eat something I can chew rather than slurp!\" she remarked, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night passed like a whirlwind when you and Jordan returned to your room. You quickly notice a thong, coming from Jordan's suitcase. \"Jordy, look at this!\" you exclaim. You both got through it and realise that Jordan's clothes and passport have revert to female. \"Look, I have a nice driver's licence for a change!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull her to you and embrace her tenderly. The rest of the night is relaxing as you feel your little soul mate at peace on top of you. \"AHHHHHH!!!!\" you and Jordan awake to the sound of a woman screaming. You leap up, holding Jordan in your arms. You free your left arm, opening the door and following the scream to ____________'s room.  </span></div></div>",

But Nick and Tony think she was hot, so she must be!\" you reply, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you didn't find her attractive?\" asked Nick, surprised. \"Jordan is hot and attractive. Honestly, she was okay looking but nothing on Jordan!\" you respond. Jordan beams at that, pressing herself against you.  \u201cDude, all joking aside, we\u2019re friends! I don\u2019t see you that way! But I sure as s*** don\u2019t want to go home as a chick! I mean we will be broke with no identity.

And if I turn into a girl, I'll lick your p**** dry! I'll r** my hot c*** for you for as long as you want! But Dude, until we can find out what happened to us, I have to stay a guy!\u201d explained Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just j*** off?\u201d suggested Tony, tearfully. \"The endorphins released as a result of intercourse from a human male is approximately twice that of the average m*********** session of that same human male. In other words, to combat a potentially evolving virus or chemical compound, Nick should indulge in the acts that result in the maximum endorphins being released.\u201d answered Jordan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't he just j*** off twice?\u201d she suggested. \u201cThat would not change anything. The more energy is exercised from the body, the more endorphins are released. Since intercourse requires more energy and exercise, it releases more endorphins. So to be on the safe side, Nick must experience intercourse from an available female!\u201d answered Jordan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, guys! I\u2026I want p****! I\u2026I can't!\u201d she wailed. Nick nodded. \u201cIf worse comes to it, I can get a Mexican prostitute! Don't sweat it, Tony!\u201d \u201cOk, glad that\u2019s settled! Tony, we will go shopping for you after Nick has called Dr Jacks and Erin Grant!\u201d you state.  \u201cWhat! NO WAY! I\u2026I don\u2019t want to be left nude and alone! I\u2019ll just wear my guy clothes!\u201d Tony replied, fervently. \u201cThey are too big for you, Tony. You are likely to have a public wardrobe malfunction if you wear them in public!\u201d remarked Jordan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want to be alone!\u201d squealed Tony. You want to be sympathetic, but Tony's constant squealing is getting really annoying. \u201cLook Nick will stay back with you while Erin and I go shopping!\u201d responded Jordan. Tony shook her head vigorously. \u201cNO, I will only stay here with Erin!\u201d she replied. \u201cAre you insane? Under no circumstances will I go anywhere without my soul-mate Erin!\u201d retorted Jordan, firmly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk at that, enjoying how your gorgeous lover gets so jealous every time anyone expresses the slightest interest in you. \u201cOk girls, there\u2019s an obvious solution. Nick, you will go shopping for Tony, while we stay here, keeping her company!\u201d you propose. \u201cI'm ok with that!\u201d nodded Tony. \u201cBrilliant idea, my darling!\u201d expressed Jordan, her beautiful eyes dream in their light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat suits me! Sundresses, tank top and shorts and bikinis, coming up!\u201d declared Nick as he left the room. \u201cNOOO!!! Jeans! Jacket! Jeans!

You want to hunt Nick down and murder him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God; that was so beautiful!\" wailed Jordan. \"I know, poor Shelby!\" cried Tony. \"Yeah...it was bad.\" you agree. Bad was an understatement. Why did you agree to watch Steel Magnolias? It was so boring. Even though Julia Roberts died, it was still dull. You realise you still don't like chick flicks.

It would be kind of weird to have two Erins, so we might refer to each other by second names. My full name is Erin Jade Grant!\u201d You pause before Jordan replies \u201cSamantha! Erin Samantha Thomas. I will soon be Jordan Thomas when we marry!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is so beautiful!\u201d declared Erin, beaming at you both. \u201cSo are you girls coming?\u201d asked Chelsea, her arm around Erin Jade. You hold Jordan in your arm as you follow Erin and Chelsea. It\u2019s weird because Erin Jade Grant was originally Aaron Jacob Grant. But she might have the answer about how to stay female, so you go with her. She and Chelsea aren\u2019t alone. A girl who could pass for Natalie Dormer was there with a Shakira Lookalike.

Jordan paused before replying \"Jordan Tr\u1ea7n!\" That wasn't her name of course, it was Jordan Trinh; but she could hardly use her real name even though Trinh was the Jones of Vietnamese surnames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, so is that Vietnamese like Nguyen?\" asked Erin. Jordan nodded. \"Yeah, my parents were born in the United States when my grandparents fled in the late 60s.\" she explained. \"Hi, I'm Nancy Porter and this is my beloved Tracey Wilkins. It's funny you mentioned that because its' similar story to a metro-sexual douche-bag I used to date!\" Jordan squeezed your hand, when she notes you're about to flare up. You don't like your soul mates' ex girlfriend trashing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's Tracey and Nancy. And that's my sister Eve Veronica Grant and her soul mate and my ex Jackie Bates. Okay now that we are all introduced to one another, I propose that we eat!\" proposed Erin. \"So Erin Sammy, tell us how you and Jordan met?\" asked Tracey, beaming. You calm down after Nancy's unintended insult and explain. \"Oh Jordan and I were best friends for a long time. We both liked girls for a long time and dated a few girls. One day, I realised that I wanted more than friendship. That my life couldn't be whole without her in it! I want to spend the rest of my life with this amazing woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan beams at you, cuddling against you. You can't help but feel both happy and a little teary as you press her tight to your breasts. \"Wow, that's so beautiful. You two are really cute, I'm glad you two have found the same happiness that Tracey brought me!\" remarked Nancy as Tracey sidled up to her. Tracey sucks on her neck, causing her to moan. You blush a little, focusing your attention on your soul mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey stops, lifting the smaller girl onto her lap. \"I remember how it was for me and Nancy. At the time, she was dating this jerk. What was his name? He was some metro-sexual douche, Jordan Trinh, I think\" \"My soul mate here has a cousin called Jordan Trinh who is a metro-sexual. He is a great guy, who I consider a personal friend!\" you interrupt, unable to contain your displeasure. Nancy giggles \"Is he 6 foot 2 inches and secretly gay?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, someone uncomfortable with this. Jordan pressed herself against you again. \"Sorry Nancy, I'm just really lucky! Erin loves me so much, she feels the need to defend my family as if its\u2019 her own. I am the same with her and her family. She has a cool brother called Aaron Thomas, who I also think of as a brother!\" explains Jordan. Tracey smirks, \"Is her brother Aaron, 7 foot 5 with red hair and hazel eyes?\" asks Tracey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother isn't that tall, nor does he have red hair or hazel eyes!\" you respond. \"Ironically I was dealing with my breakup with a depressing guy who clearly wasn't Erin's brother with the same name.\" You squeeze Jordan's hand and press your lips to hers. You feel Jordan was about to defend you with the same ardour. Fortunately she relaxes as you both hear the rest of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During our mutual commiserations; Nancy remarked what a shame it was we weren't a couple. The second she said it; my heart leapt and I kissed her. That led to the obvious and before we knew it; we were together for 7 months! And still going strong!\" concludes Tracey.  Nancy suddenly leaps up. \u201cI need to know right now, Ladies! I want to know what you think about my dress! Jackie Bates and her girlfriend Eve Grant; Erin Samantha Thomas and her girlfriend Jordan Tr\u1ea7n, I must know what you think! \u201d she demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as each girl gives her opinion. You whisper to Jordan \u201cI don\u2019t want to say!\u201d Jordan seemed as uncomfortable as you are, but nevertheless she gave her opinion on her ex girlfriend\u2019s clothes before adding \u201cNancy, you should know that my girl is a little nervous about giving her opinion. Despite being gorgeous, she generally followed my opinion around clothes. It\u2019s the advantage of having a scintillating, yet gentle girlfriend!\u201d You blush, cuddling Jordan tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waitress comes to offer your group a better table. Erin smiles and nods at her. You take Jordan in your arms and go with them to your table. The table is much larger and the chairs are more comfortable. \u201cMiss Thomas; on behalf of the restaurant; we want to thank you for clearing the place of that muscle bound clod. So as our way of thank you; we are happy to present you and your fianc\u00e9e Jordan with this complimentary dinner!\u201d expressed the waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely mutter a thank you; turning bright red and holding Jordan tightly. Jordan thanks the waitress for you, revealing your intense shyness. \u201cWow, a shy Super woman! You really are a good person; Erin Samantha Thomas! Glad we got a chance to meet you and Jordan!\u201d declared Erin. The other girls agreed. The topic shifted towards entertainment, specifically how much they all like Rizzoli and Isles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You are surprised how much easier it is to talk to them when you are all girls. You were never that great in truth, talking to girls. The discussion shift from Rizzoli and Isles to talking about coming out, and their parents come to accept them being a lesbian. Something you and Jordan can relate following your transformations. The food is delicious, though you are careful only to eat a salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are determined not to eat too much; you\u2019re a little sensitive about your weight. Jordan dismissed this description of yourself, describing you as the hottest woman on the planet. The dinner concluded; you all make your way to the pool. There is a change room; where Erin Jade hands you all 2 piece bikinis. You are slightly surprised and wonder when she had the time to procure them when she didn\u2019t leave the table or knew them at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless there is a private area with towels lay down for you. \u201cI asked the waitress to bring the bikini and secure this area for us! Clearly your status as a heroine benefits us Erin Sammy!\u201d declares Erin Jade. You and the 3 taller girls lay down first; while the shorter girls Erin Jade; Chelsea; Nancy and Jordan. You are relaxed as your angel quickly doses off. She looks adorable in her bikini. Erin Jade suddenly grins. \u201cI have to tell you both something.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Jordan dismissed this description of yourself, commenting that you as the hottest woman on the planet. The dinner was quickly concluded as you all ate very little. Erin Jade suggests that you all make your way to the pool. You note how there are very few people around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder to yourself about the time. It must be getting late. \u201cI wonder how Tony is going with her new friend?\u201d you whisper to Jordan. Jordan smirks and makes a cutting comment in reply. You giggle despite yourself. \u201cThere is a change room up ahead! I left some 2 piece bikinis in my locker! Let\u2019s go lounge by the pool!\u201d suggests Erin Jade. You all agree and make your way into the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is surprisingly empty and she makes her way to the locker room. She opens up her locker, handing out 2 piece bikinis to everyone. You are slightly surprised and wonder when she had the time to procure them when she didn\u2019t leave the table or knew about either you or Jordan. Jordan walks you into the stall, beaming as you undress. \u201cI love you; you sexy big b****** babe!\u201d she comments. \u201cRight back at you, soul mate!\u201d you respond. Jordan looks positively incandescent in her red bikini; forcing you to swallow your drool. She beams and gets you to turn around. \u201cLove that slim, tight, round r*** hidden by that skimpy purple cloth!\u201d she saucily remarked, making you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both leave the stall, having avoided a quickie narrowly. You follow the other girls as they make their way to a private area with towels laid down for you. \u201cI asked the waitress to put the bikinis in my locker and secure this area for us! Clearly your status as a heroine benefits us Erin Sammy!\u201d declares Erin Jade. Again you turn red with the mystery partly solved. You and the 3 taller girls (Chelsea, Jackie and Tracey) lay down first; while the shorter girls (Erin Jade; Eve Veronica; Nancy and Jordan) lay down on top of them. You are relaxed as your angel quickly doses off. She looks adorable in her red bikini. Erin Jade suddenly grins. \u201cI have to tell you both something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask nervously, concerned by her strange statement. \"I heard about you two after you beat up that thug yesterday! That\u2019s how I knew to get extra bikinis for you two. Luckily they fit. But weren't you travelling with two companions?\" remarked Erin, pressed herself further against Chelsea. A sigh left Chelsea as she dozed off. \u201cOur friend Tony; she is entertaining a new friend Isabella.\u201d You answer, cautiously. \u201cWow; its\u2019 awesome to have found some fellow travellers, who entertain the correct gender\u201d she states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her without a clue what she is saying. \u201cI mean its\u2019 nice to be around fellow lesbians! You can never trust those foul inferiors known as males!\u201d she exclaims, her eyes fierce. You don\u2019t respond though you are slightly surprised by her statement. After all Erin Jade was once Aaron Jacob Grant. Come to think of it; you don\u2019t remember Aaron having a sister. She notices you staring at her confused and you look away. \u201cI was violated you see. Hence why I wear this survivor ring!\u201d she explains, pointing to the large red ring on her left finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG; Someone r**** you? That\u2019s awful!\u201d you exclaim, horrified. \u201cIt\u2019s okay! Chelsea helped me through it. But since then I learnt that all men are inferior, evil beings! A lesson that can only be learnt once you have been on the other side!\u201d she informed you. You are again uncertain of what she means when she states \u201cI take it Aaron; you enjoy being a girl now that you have a girlfriend?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes almost bulge out of their sockets; when you realise she knows the truth. You stare at her, stunning that she was aware of your groups\u2019 transformations. She giggled at your reaction. \u201cI never learnt how I got transformed; but I knew who took advantage! That thug!\u201d she hissed. You watch her, trying to learn more. \u201cWhen I discovered that Dr Jacks was planning to do to you; what my rapist did to me; I knew I had to rescue you guys! That\u2019s how your IDs; passports, driver\u2019 licences, etc showed your new female faces. It wasn\u2019t easy to do it all, while you slept!\u201d she revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t\u2026.wait Dr Jacks!\u201d you cried. She nodded. \u201cHe wanted 4 sex slaves to compliment his relationship with Magnilla! He didn\u2019t figure I would find out about his plans. Now he has a sister he didn\u2019t know about!\u201d she grinned at her strange statement. \u201cErin, I don\u2019t understand!\u201d you whine, just lost by all this. She nodded. \u201cDr Jacks was working on a gender altering vaccine and used on the 4 of you during your trip to Miami. His goal was both to acquire a great deal of wealth; while acquiring defenceless sex toys! But I gave him a piece of his own medicine!\u201d asserted Erin Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou turned him into a girl?\u201d you enquired. She shook her head, beaming. \u201cI didn\u2019t! But Erika Jacks is dealing with HER new life!\u201d she expressed, the evil smile not leaving her face. You are still confused, but you understand that Erin Jade has been helping you. \u201cUm\u2026Erin? I\u2019m not sure how to ask\u2026.\u201d \u201cDo I miss being an inferior? Absolutely not! Life as a superior female is far better. Besides I am one of the most powerful physical beings I know!\u201d she states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll find I am stronger!\u201d you observe. \u201cI accept your challenge! Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll go easy on you!\u201d she arrogantly proclaims, offering her left hand. You pause, slightly uncertain from Erin Jade\u2019s confidence. Nevertheless you decide to attach conditions. \u201cOkay, but if I win; you explain in more detail!\u201d you request. \u201cDeal!\u201d she answers. You decide to finish it quickly as you can without hurting her. You begin to attempt to push her hand down quickly but nothing happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat surprised, you apply more force. Still nothing! You look into her grinning face. You decide to use full force, but despite your strain nothing. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d she teased. You use both hand, straining to do so; while keeping Jordan on your belly. She shakes her head, grinning. Erin Jade then gently lowers her hand, taking your two hands with her. You are stunned that she pinned both your hands with one of hers. She in response beams an infuriatingly smug smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing that same hand, she released a blue light from her hand. The light flew into the sky, exploding like fireworks. \u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re a\u2026you have\u2026\u201d you are unable to finish stammering; pulling Jordan to you as if you protect her. \u201cRelax, Erin Sammy! I\u2019m just an apprentice witch! I was given the assignment to protect and recruit you; Jordan and Tony by my employer. And had Nick became a superior being; him too!\u201d she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026your boss is a witch?\u201d you ask. \u201cWell her mother is a witch. Her father is half angel; half demon. So it\u2019s\u2019 sort of complicated. At any rate; my Mistress wanted to make sure that you didn\u2019t go through what I did. And so did we!\u201d she continues, indicating the other girls. \u201cSo they know too?\u201d \u201cWell they thought they should tease you both about hooking up. I couldn\u2019t think of a reason; why not. Honestly its\u2019 precious; you and Jordan found love with each other. And do not worry; no-one outside our little group remembers that you two were anything but lesbians!\u201d she reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did your Mistress want to keep us safe if you all hate guys?\u201d you inquire. \u201cBecause you are girls now! You have ascended beyond the inferior gender to take your place amongst the true beings of light! I am about to cast a teleportation spell. Why don\u2019t you rest while I do so? Tomorrow; you and Jordan can come to see us with Tony and hopefully she will be dating this girl Isabella. What do you think?\u2019 she offers. \u201cJordan, the others and I will be safe then? I mean you have used this spell before? You wouldn\u2019t risk your girlfriend or your friends if you hadn\u2019t; right?\u201d you squeal, slightly nervous. She nods, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I have done it before!\u201d she replies as light fell upon Tracey and Nancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as they seemed to shimmer, before disappearing. You stifle a yawn. \u201cW-wow! Th-that\u2019s \u201cYAWN\u201d\u201d you are unable to complete the sentence as you feel tired. As your eyes begin to close, you can see Erin Jade completely asleep. Eve Veronica and Jackie soon follow. You struggle to keep your eyes open as you realise that there is green barrier above you; a shimmering green light. You think how pretty it looks as you turn to see Erin and Chelsea disappears. You feel warm; you could feel Jordan pressed against you as if you were one. You smile at the thought as your eyes close completely.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stir, the world slowly taking shape around you. You realise that you are in your bed, still wearing the skimpy purple bikini that you wore last night; while you can see Jordan's adorable round r*** barely contained in her red bikini. You smile as you look down at the love of your life. Every time you see her, you feel this joy as if you will never be alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head trying desperately to remember what Erin Jade told you yesterday. It suddenly dawned on you like lightning. You were teleported here by Erin Jade's spell and Dr Erik Jacks turned you all into girls for his sick, sexual pleasure. Jordan made a gentle sighing sound. She looks so cute as she slept soundly, a darling smile plastered across her face. You smile at the sight of your soul mate before reaching for the phone. You aren't sure what to put it, before you notice a piece of paper. The paper reads Magnilla Larsson and Erika Jacks' telephone number ********.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a ringing tone and wait for a response. \"Hello!\" answered a girls' voice. \"Hi!\" you begin; a little unnerved. \"Erin Thomas! How nice to hear from you! It\u2019s Magnilla, how are you? How is Cancun? Are you and your girlfriend Jordan behaving yourselves?' she asks, giggling. The comment strikes you as an insult and you respond indignantly \"Things between me and my soul mate are as good as they have ever been!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled with her reply. \"Oh Erin, you two are just too adorable. I swear it\u2019s like you two little cuties were made for each other. I take it, you would like to talk to Erica?\" she asked. A smirk came upon your face as you remembered what Erin Jade had said. \"Yes, please Magnilla!\" you replied. \"Hello, this is...Erika?\" a timid voice stated on the other end, the last few words spat out. \"Hello Dr Jacks, its Erin Samantha Thomas!\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron! Oh thank God, it\u2019s you! You got to help me! I'm a woman now! And there's another me out there doing my job, my research; while I'm stuck working as a masseuse at Magnilla's beauty shop! Tomorrow, I have to go to that job, feeling up old ladies! Please you have to help me understand what is going on and why it's happening to me!\" wailed Erika. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it\u2019s Erin Samantha Thomas, not Aaron! I'm the lesbian soul mate of Ms Jordan Tranh, the future Ms Jordan Thomas. And perhaps you got a taste of your own medicine, Erika. Or vaccine as the case may be!\" you correct her, proudly. \"But that still\u2026I\u2026I was planning to turn you all back!\u201d she stammered, lying through her teeth. \u201cNo; that\u2019s not true! You were planning to use as sex toys! Well I\u2019m afraid Karma\u2019s a bitch, ERIKA!\u201d you quip, as you try to envision a female Erik Jack\u2019s reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV turned on in your room, by itself. To your amazement, you can see a Summer Glau girl, wanting to snarl at the phone but can't. Finally she picks up the phone, her eyes fiery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay fine, you little f**! So what? You hooked up with a man, imbecile, no matter how girly Jordan...'' ''I hope you enjoy life as a professional prostitute, Erika! Who knows whether your customers will be male or female? Thinking about that as you squeeze the b*** of old ladies\u2026or old men!'' you roar, slamming the phone down with a bang. You beam as you watch the terror of Dr Jacks as she stared at the phone. You have your soul mate, she has only fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she picks up the phone. The phone rings in your apartment. She looks quite scared; you can see her mouthing come on. ''Hello?'' you practically sing song. ''I'm sorry! Please help me! I'm sure you and Jordan make a cute lesbian couple!'' pleads Erika. ''You're right, we do! But Erika, you should enjoy your new life as a girl! I will call you back after Jordan wakes up and we can all discuss it! Bye!'' you answer, putting the phone back on the hook with a broad grin. The television turns itself off. \u201cIt must be Erin Jade\u2019s magic!\u201d you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan slowly opens her beautiful eyes, seeing your grin; she matches it with a sleepy one of her own. You feel your eyes tear up as you pull her to you. ''Marry me!'' you say. She takes your face in her hands and kisses you. Like magic, your bikinis fall in a heap as your love overwhelms you both. Lying back on the bed, her sexy r***, nestled in your fingers; you feel at peace. She relaxes as well, clearly sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''My love, I don't think we can stay in bed all day! We have to eat! Besides, we have to talk about what we do today! Did Erin Grant saw anything to you?'' she asked. ''Did she ever, beloved! Dr Jacks was the one who turned us to girls!'' you revealed. She said nothing, contemplating this information. ''He is a biochemist and geneticist. It makes sense that he was the one. Erin is a student of his, she could easily find out. She was the one who supplied us with the false IDs, wasn't she?'' enquired your brilliant honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yep! Babe, the girls Tracey and Nancy knew about us! They were teasing us, deliberately.'' you add. She looked at you, before shaking her head. ''Those jerks! Upsetting my precious girl!'' she states, lowering her head to your neck. You moan, as she gently massages your large b******. ''Anything else?'' she says, beaming, stopping her massage. ''A few other things that are really hard to believe but I swear they are true!'' you answer, not certain how she will handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's one of the many things I love about you, Erin. You're so sensitive and gentle despite your super strength. You're very pure. It\u2019s like your quietness makes you even more perfect. I am so in love with you, I only regret that we didn't realise we were meant for each other earlier!'' she states. You blush heavily, your eyes slightly teary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kisses each eye. ''I want to change my name to Thomas and move in with you as soon as possible! I don't want to miss another second!'' she declared. You look at her with the certain knowledge that this woman was the other half you didn\u2019t even know you were yearning for. \u201cI worship you, my love!\u201d is all you can say. \u201cI feel the same way about you, treasure! Now tell me these things, I will find hard to believe. Because if you say them, I know it\u2019s true!\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her everything about Dr Jacks, Erin Jade, her mysterious boss, the girls, everything. You conclude watching her; still worried she might not believe you. \u201cI believe you, darling! I know you wouldn\u2019t make this up!\u201d she stated, seeing your concern. You pull her tight to you, breathing a sigh of relief. \u201cI love you Jordan Thomas!\u201d \u201cAnd I love you Erin Samantha Thomas!\u201d You both dissolve into giggles following that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we go check on our friend Tony? After we dress of course!\u201d suggested Jordan. That provokes more laughter from both of you. Eventually, you manage to get dressed after surrendering again to your passion. Its\u2019 midday as you head into Tony\u2019s room. \u201cLooks like my plan worked!\u201d you state to Jordan, your arms around her waist as you see Tony and Isabella cuddled against each other, their clothes all around the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we go to lunch? Or should we wake them, do you think?\u201d asked Jordan.  </span></div></div>",

The phone continued to ring, forcing you to rush forth to the phone. ''This is Erin Samantha Thomas. To whom Am I speaking?'' you ask. ''Hello, my dear friend Erin Sammy! You had an interesting talk with Erika, I see.'' responded Erin Grant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You did the trick with the TV?'' you ask, your right arm now around Jordan. ''A spell I have been practising. I am still learning.'' admitted Erin Jade. ''So you cast some sort of sleeping spell on Jordan and me?'' you ask. ''Certainly not! The teleportation spell is tricky, so I cast a pain protection charm to ensure no-one suffered any pain. So did you ask Jordan to marry you?'' she asked, teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou can't help but redden. Since becoming a girl, you are often easily embarrassed. ''Kinda!'' you confess, somewhat ruefully. ''Well if you agree to work for us while studying for the first 3 months than I will send you a ruby ring for you to propose to Jordan with. The jobs will be counselling and clerical like I did when I first started to work for her. My immediate superior will be joining us tomorrow with her girls.'' offered Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Um...That sounds ok. Do I have to sign something?'' asked Sam. Jordan was looking nervous when you said that, so you took her hand, squeezing it gently. ''You should feel it about now.'' You felt something stick out of your skirt pocket, but you say nothing. ''Ok, meet us all at the lunch area and bring Tony and her paramour. I sense everything went well?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh yeah, Erin Jade! Tony and Isabella are here. Yeah, we'll arrange to meet you guys at the lunch area. See you there.'' You end the call and turn to face Jordan and Tony. Isabella is stirring, prompting Tony to squeeze Isabella's hand and lower her head, kissing the shorter girl tenderly. You and Jordan make teasing cooing noises; causing Tony to flush with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ok, so, you guys should get ready. We will meet Erin Jade and she will explain the full details of what happened with us. She offered me a part time contract job, so...if you want we can move into an apartment together when we get home.'' you reveal. ''I want that very much, but you are not signing anything till I get a look. I won't let them hurt my true love!'' she declared, fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony shook her head. ''And you two lovebirds were teasing me? Um...I told Isabella the truth. She saw my passport!'' admitted Tony. ''And she believed you?'' responded Jordan, incredulously. ''She said she believed that I believed I was telling the truth.'' replied Tony, her irritated tone clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sounds like she is humouring you.'' you observe. ''Regardless'' you begin, cutting her off, ''you need to get ready. We will be waiting outside.'' You take Jordan and you both leave Tony with her new girlfriend. Despite yourselves, you both giggle about what happened. ''Sounds like they are getting serious.'' suggested Jordan. You beam happily, hugging your girl. ''I hope so! Babe, we need to talk about Nick.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan nods in agreement. ''We haven't seen him for a day!'' she stated. ''Its more than, my love! Erin Jade said she would protect the three of us...but Nick is running around trying to get laid! Erin Jade hates men and especially womanisers. She has that big rape survivor ring. If he doesn't stop...she will leave him to rot!'' you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan paused to think about this. ''I suspect that Nick will not forget what we said about the release of endorphins. Nick is an exercise addict, so no doubt he will be hitting the gym regularly. If he does become female, I'm sure that Erin Jade will help her. But we have to ask her questions about all the changes. Eventually we will both go through menstruation and we will need advice on that and other matters. For now darling, I think we should watch some television while we wait. Ohhh; lets watch Gossip Girl!'' she suggested, eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the show was cancelled years ago, you still had to bear it. Your soul mate's tastes had clearly changed; you could still remember her making comments about how crummy she found girl's shows to be. Despite how boring it was, somehow it made the change seem more real. And it made you nervous again about whether you were effeminate enough. <br>\r\nWatching Jordan in her mini skirt reminding you that you needed a lot more underwear! Jordan wanted to see you in a thong, something you were somewhat opposed to. Your hands trembled as they rested on the edges of her skirt. She beamed at you, turning away from the TV. ''You know we don't have time....but we can make out!'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the invitation you needed, surrendering to your desire. You lift Jordan unto your body as you press your tongue in her mouth. Feeling Jordan\u2019s warmth against your body made your heart beat faster. You had never desired anyone the way you did with this beautiful Asian girl. How long had you been in love with her? Longer than even you realised, you suspect. \u201cHmm hmmm!\u201d came an interrupting sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jordan look up to see Toni and Isabella looking at you. \u201cHonestly can you two lovebirds go three seconds without giving in to yourselves?\u201d remarked Toni. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking!\u201d responded Jordan, indicating Isabella. Isabella simply beamed at the two of you. \u201cYou two are really cute! Toni wasn\u2019t exaggerating about you two being like Xena and Gabrielle!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t think any comment could have left you feeling so embarrassed, your face going red rapidly.  Jordan cuddled against you. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, babe! I think we\u2019re more like Willow and Tara from Buffy! Because we\u2019re loving lesbian soul-mates rather than angst laden bisexual honeys!\u201d she remarked. \u201cSo\u2026am I Tara?\u201d you ask, slightly more relaxed. \u201cHmmm\u2026.yeah, you\u2019re shy, quiet and protective! So yes, you\u2019re the Tara Maclay in our relationship without the getting shot part!\u201d she replied, the last few words spoken in a slightly frightened tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kiss her lips. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, Baby! And even if you do become addicted to magic, I\u2019ll stick around and get you through it!\u201d you respond, making you all laugh. \u201cEven after what I can only assume was your usual heavy make out routine, you and Jordan haven\u2019t smudge either your makeup, lipstick or mascara!\u201d pouted Toni. Isabella wrapped her arms around her, soothingly. \u201cYou\u2019re still my sexy Nubian princess!\u201d she remarked, making you and Jordan giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Isabella, I take it Tony shared her story with you?\u201d asked Jordan as you left your room, once again you held her in your arms. \u201cYeah, she showed me the passport of the guy then hers. Both had the same name!\u201d answered Isabella. \u201cBut you believe me, right?\u201d asked Toni, nervously. \u201cI believe that you believe that! And I know that you are no liar, even though we just met!\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n\u2003<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite yourself, you chortle as Jordan giggled. \u201cSo who are we meeting?\u201d enquired Isabella. \u201cA friend of ours called Erin Jade Grant. She and her sister are having lunch with their girlfriends and two of their friends. So for maybe the first time ever, 5 lesbian couples will have lunch together! Assuming that you are a lesbian, Isabella rather than just taken by a girl in distress!\u201d observed Jordan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been out and proud since I was 12. My parents thought it was a phase. Actually I think they still do!\u201d she stated, a little sadly. \u201cThen I will have to be the perfect girlfriend and win them over!\u201d declared Toni. \u201cAnd how will you do that, if you go back to being a guy?\u201d asked Isabella, teasingly. \u201cWell\u2026.maybe I\u2019ll stay a girl! You know just to see if I can make it work!\u201d suggested Toni. Isabella smirked and nodded. \u201cSure babe!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jordan giggle at that. You see Erin Jade ahead, the 5 other girls with her. After various introductions and a few glares from Jordan, you all sit down. \u201cNow who would like the mike?\u201d asked a man, holding a microphone. \u201cMy friend Erin Sammy does!\u201d yelled Erin, making you blush. Her voice rang through you, though her lips remain closed. \u201cThis is your chance to propose!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter encouragement by Jordan who wants to hear you sing, you relent. You take the mike approaching the small lunch crowd. You feel sweat run down your back, but you gather your strength, squash your fear and speak. \u201cH-Hi everyone, I\u2019m Erin Samantha Thomas! I\u2019m the woman who beat a thug that was threatening my girlfriend Jordan, she\u2019s the perfect girl in the blue miniskirt and pink top!\u201d you state, pointing out Jordan who gets up, waving at the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2026um\u2026is a song I want to sing\u2026to the girl I love! H-Here goes!\u201d you brace yourself and then sing \u201cOoohhh, I couldn\u2019t live another minute, living my life\u2026.without you in it! It suddenly clear! I will always; always need you here, need you here! Let me hold you in my arms and not let go, I want to stay with you forever, be closer to you each day, Jordan; you are my way!\u201d you conclude, dropping to your knee before Jordan, whose eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJordan Trinh\u2026.\u201d You begin, removing the ring from your pocket, making her gasp \u201cYou are my whole world. The day I found the courage to tell you that I loved you was the happiest day I ever knew. And if you accept this proposal, I swear on everything I hold dear, that I will not rest until I make every day, the happiest of yours! Jordan, will you take me as your wife?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES! YES, of course, I\u2019ll marry you!\u201d declared Jordan, kissing you tenderly. You lift her into your arms; she wrapped her legs around you. You manage to slip the ring across her left ring finger before you start kissing her again. \u201cTo Ms Erin and Jordan Thomas!\u201d cried Erin Jade. The same cry rang across the table, but you could barely hear. All that mattered was you and Jordan found each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you sat back down, Erin Jade began speaking. \u201cHonestly I have to say that I am thrilled to witness the engagement of these two wonderful people. So let's go for a nature walk to the waterfall.\" After everyone agreed..... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nVZX<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You take the mike, taking a deep breath. You look out, the small lunch crowd in front of you. You feel sweat run down your back, but you gather your strength, squash your fear and speak. \u201cH-Hi everyone, I\u2019m Erin Samantha Thomas!

H-Here goes!\u201d you brace yourself, focusing directly on Jordan. She beams at you encouragingly and you begin to sing. \u201cOoohhh; I couldn\u2019t live another minute, living my life\u2026.without you in it! It\u2019s suddenly clear!

You felt that wonderful sense of togetherness as she wraps her legs around you. You manage to slip the ring across her left ring finger before you start kissing her again. \u201cTo Ms Erin and Jordan Thomas!\u201d cried Erin Jade. The same cry rang across the table, but you could barely hear what they were saying. All that mattered was you and Jordan found each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick expression of your love through a long kiss; you take your seat, Jordan on your lap. Erin Jade began speaking. \u201cHonestly I have to say, I am thrilled to witness the engagement of these two wonderful people. I arranged a nature walk in the forest nearby to a waterfall. I brought spare bikinis if we need them!\u201d she continued. \u201cSo what does everything think?\u201d A unanimous yes was the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lunch conversation was brief as none of you seemed to have much of an appetite. You all leave your seats, waving goodbye as you hear the crowd continue their cheers and well wishing. Isabella shook her head, amused. \u201cI can\u2019t remember seeing this many people who are so accepting of lesbians!\u201d declared Isabella. Erin Jade smirked at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when are you going to propose to me?\u201d asked Chelsea. Erin blushed and couldn\u2019t find her voice to everyone\u2019s general amusement. ''So EJ, are you going to tell us what happened to us?'' asked Toni. ''Erin Jade Grant is my name, Toni Melanie White! So you can call me, Erin Jade!'' answered Erin Jade. Toni flushed in response, Isabella gave her a kiss to soothe her humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin Jade walked with confidence, while the rest of you followed. ''I think she will tell us once we are there!'' suggested Jordan. ''I guess you're right. I love you!'' you state. She beamed at you again, leaping into your arms. You hold her tight as you walk on. ''Better keep your eyes forward, Erin Sammy!'' suggested Chelsea, teasingly. Erin Jade giggled at that. ''Oh is that funny, babe? Maybe the tickle monster has something to say about that!'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin Jade squealed and took off at lightning speed. ''Hey!'' you cried as you race after her, Jordan in your arms. Chelsea must have magic too because she was right behind Erin Jade. Jordan gasps and whispers to you to not look up. You don't query it as you pick up the speed. You don't have super speed, its all from your Hulk like strength and you feel yourself getting wearier and wearier. You push hard as Erin Jade and Chelsea seem to get further and further from view. You decide that leaping high is your best bet and you go down and push up with all your might. You and Jordan squeal as you find yourself high into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can think about is how much you love Jordan. The air seems to whip around you as you soar through it. You hold Jordan tight to you shielding her from the blasts of wind. As the two of you rise high, Jordan looks out, noticing a beach near the waterfall ahead. She points it out to you more in hope than expectation. You are not completely sure how to get you both down. However that proves irrelevant as gravity demonstrate that your lack of knowledge doesn't matter as you begin to fall. You and Jordan declare your eternal love for each other as you fall towards the ground, the air whistling past you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees are far away from you as you fall towards the sand. You are glad you kept your legs straight for you land on your feet, without a jerk. You check on Jordan who like you is unharmed by your brief aerial adventure. Erin Jade and Chelsea are already set up on the beach. Erin Jade was in a white bikini resting on top of Chelsea who was wearing a red one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Practising for the long jump, Erin Sammy?'' teased Chelsea. ''You guys sure run fast!'' remarked Jordan, surprised. ''Well that's magic for you!'' answered Erin Jade, smirking. ''What about the others?'' you ask, concerned. Erin grins as she point upwards. There to your amazement are Toni and the other girls, floating above you. Erin lifts her left hand and lowers it, bring them all down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one of them is wearing a bikini, leaving you and Jordan overdressed. Jordan gestures towards an available towel near Erin Jade and Chelsea. You lower yourself to the ground, holding Jordan. Isabella is clinging to a pale Toni, neither of them able to comprehend what just happened. The other girls are far more relaxed, as if their flight was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What just happened?'' gasped Isabella. Toni couldn't speak, she was so freaked. ''What do you mean, Isabella?'' asked Erin Jade, calmly. Isabella stared at her, then at the rest of you. ''Ok, Toni and I are freaked. Jordan and Erin look confused, but the rest of you accept it. How can we have flied in the air and Erin do a Superman?'' expressed Isabella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Simple, I am an apprentice witch. And Erin Sammy is a genetical altered superwoman. Didn't Toni tell you that she, Jordan and Erin Sammy were deliberately infected by an evil chemistry professor and turned into superior females? Well that's how Erin Sammy can leap so high and Jordan's intellect is so staggering. As for the rest of us, we are all learning magic!'' explained Erin Jade. Isabella turned to Toni who was stunned at this revelation. ''Dr Jacks turned us into girls? Why?'' she managed to state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Money, fame and sex!'' responded Jordan, angrily. ''So....Toni, you were a guy?'' Isabella enquired. Toni quivered, before nodding. Isabella turned to face you and Jordan. ''And you two were boys and now you're an engaged lesbian couple?'' You and Jordan nod. ''A bit much, Isabella?'' asked Erin Jade. Tears were running down Toni's face. Isabella noticed this and embraced Toni. ''It's ok! Don't cry!'' she soothingly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Toni couldn't stop bawling. You tried to get up, but Jordan rested her hand on your chest and shook her head. ''Let Isabella help her!'' whispered Jordan. You nod as Toni continues to cry. You watch helplessly, your anger towards Dr Jacks increasing. You watch the other girls, all looking at Toni with sadness in their eyes. ''Erin Jade is glowing red!'' Jordan whispered into your right ear. You look up and can't see Erin Jade glowing red at all. But her eyes briefly flash red before yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n''I don't want to be a freak! I want to be your lesbian girlfriend, Izzy! I want to stay a girl! Stay with me, don't leave me!'' wailed Toni. ''I'm not going anywhere, darling. I am not the kind of girl who kisses and runs:'' she replies. Toni giggles a little, still a little tearily. ''I...I was a bad guy! I am so ashamed of what I was! I treated women badly, and I...I just wish I had never been one! Jordan and Erin are like good girls, they were never bad men. But all....all I wanted was sex, just like Nick! I'm so sorry! Oh I'm so lucky to have you Izzy! I know we just met but I love you!'' declared Toni. ''I love you too, pretty girl!'' replied Isabella. A tender kiss followed. Jordan beamed at you, tears in her eyes. You kiss her too, feeling a strange feeling.</span></div></div>",

They shouldn't even call it that though. All that they do is cosmetic. What I'm doing is complete and permenant. They will be the other gender and I'll be rich. It has taken me years, but now it works.

It's one of the reason I waited to test it till just before Spring Break. It was a gamble because Sexual intercourse will slow down the virus, but I was betting that guys like yourselves would not have much luck with that.

You push the other two and Jordan shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nick, Tony, and you all go sit on the couch. \"This is some fucked up shit\", Tony spouts off. Nick gets up, heads to the fridge, and grabs a beer. \"Dude, what are you doing? You heard what Jacks said\", you say to him. Nick opens the beer, takes a swig, and answers, \"Might as well just get it over with and enjoy spring break. I came here to have a good time and get rid of some stress not aquire more\". Jordan wanders out of the bedroom wearing an oversized tank top, pair of pants, and sits down beside you. \"So, what are we going to do\", she asks. \"Well Nick there thinks we should all get drunk, grow some tits, and have a good ole time as chicks at spring break\", Tony mutters. Nick salutes him with his bottle and takes another drink. \"Well I agree with the having a good time part. It seems there is nothing I can do about being a girl at the moment, so might as well, Jordan says with a smile. As she's talking you look over and can't help but stare at her. You can look right down her shirt at her breasts. You eyes then travel down to her legs which are just barely touching yours. Your body starts reacting. You have to remind yourself that this is Jordan, who was a guy just last night. As soon as you go to look away she looks at you with and smiles. You blush slightly thinking your caught. Jordan then looks back at the other guys. \"Jordan didn't notice of course. She was a guy last night and wouldn't expect another guy to look at her that way\", you tell yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nick cracks open another beer and anounces, \"It's settled then. Lets go out and have some fun\". Tony looks less than thrilled. \"Come on Tony, you heard what the Doc said. Getting laid will hold off the virus and unless Jordan is going to put out for you you're not going to get any sitting in here\". The look on Tony's face changes and he leaps off the couch. \"Since you put it that way, lets get going\", he says and heads back to his room to get dressed. Nick finishes his beer and heads for his room. You glance at Jordan and head for your room trying to conceal the hard-on you've got. After a few minutes you all meet back in the living room.</span></div></div>",

A lot of people down here go to the beach nude. Just man up and get something so we can get going\". Jordan isn't happy, but see's little else she can do. Latin culture isn't much for modesty. She grabs a skimpy two piece and goes to the dressing room. A few minutes later she steps out. She's barely out of the dressing room when one of her boobs falls out of the tiny top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://braexplosion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/micro-bikini-bra-covering-huge-asian-boobs.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://braexplosion.com/wp-content/uploa...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't think this fits\", she pouts.

Anyway it's all the wrong color for you\". Tony and you look at each other and then Nick. He turns red and shouts, \"Hey, I had three older sisters and Mom that I had to go shopping with. I picked up a few things, ok\". Tony and you hold up your hands and say in unison, \"Ok\". You both sit down as Nick helps Jordan pick out some clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Three hours latter Nick and Jordan are down shopping. All the bags have been delivered back to the house and you're all back out at the back looking over thousands of spring breakers. Tony smiles and says, \"Excuse me gentlemen as I go to work\". With that he disappears into a group of college girls. \"Well, you can find me at the bar\", Nick states and heads off. You start to step away, but Jordan grabs your arm. \"Aaron, could you please stay with me. I'm feelng a little scared right now with all these people. Alot of guys are staring at me\". You laugh and say, \"Yeh, and so are some of the girls\". You regret saying it when you see Jordan's face. She really is scared. \"Ok, I'll stay with you till you feel better\".</span></div></div>",

You don't have to\". \"No, no it's ok\", you answer and squirt some lotion into your hand. It's not like you guys hadn't done this for each other before. It was just never out in the open, not that there was anything wrong with it. It wasn't a gay thing. You were just helpinh each other out. Now that Jordan is a hot girl it is wierd. Not a bad wierd, but a good wierd and that's what wierd about it. As you work your way down her back you feel yourself starting to get aroused. You're doing a better job putting lotion on Jordan than you ever had before. \"Her ass is incredible\", you think to yourself as you rub lotion into it. You hands move to her legs.

Before you can make that move she says. \"Dude I don't know about you, but I'm going to take a shower and hit the hey. I'm beat\".

You not getting asleep the way you feel right now. You need to releave some pressure. You start working your cock. You picture Jordan on the beach as you were rubbing lotion into her back.

Her moans become louder and she starts working you faster. You can't hold back any longer and let go. At the same time she orgasms. \"Oh yes\", she screams. Shortly after she falls onto you panting. Your condom wrapped cock pulsates within her. Her ligs quiver and tighten around you. Her orgasm starts to subside. You move your arms to wrap around her, but she pulls away and jumps off the bed. \"Don't tell anybody about this\", she says giving you a look that could kill.

In the back of your mind you imagine that Jordan is going to come out so you can talk about what's going on, she never does. After a while you hear the door open and look over to see Nicky coming in. She's got several of bags with her. \"Hey Aaron can you help me with these\", she asks? You go to get up and then remember that you're still naked. You quickly cover up your crotch with a small pillow from the couch and stand there. \"Jesus Aaron, really it's not like I haven't seen you naked before. Now get over and help me with these bags\", Nicky says with a laugh. You drop the pillow and help her carry the bags into her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but get the feeling she's checking you out. You drop the bags on the floor of her room. You expect Nicky to make fun of your anatomy as Nick has done in the past, but instead she says, \"So how many time have you and Jordan slept together\"? Your face turns red and you stutter, \"How, how did you know\"? She smiles and answers, \"It was easy to figure out. So are you two an item now\"? You shake your head and just spill everything. \"I don't know what's going on with her\". Nicky nods and says, \"That's because you're thinking of Jordan as a girl. Jordan was a guy just two days ago. Her hardware doesn't match her software in geek terms. She still has a mind of a guy, but with the urges and desires of a woman. Jordan is using you to satisfy those desires just like a guy would do. She expects you to put out whenever she needs it and to shut-up, no emotional attachments\". You sit down on the bed as this rings true. \"Holy shit, I'm just a booty call\", you exclaim!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicky sits down and puts her arm around you and says, \"Yep, you are\". You look at her and say, \"It seems you adjusted pretty quickly to being a girl. Was Jordan right about that whole tranny thing\"? Nicky sighs and says, \"I've never talked to anybody about this before, but the whole tranny thing started long before Florida. You remember that I have three sisters. Growing up they were Daddy's angels. They could do no wrong. Me on the other hand couldn't do anything right. When I was six I figured that if I was a girl I could get his approval. I dressed up in some of my sister's clothes and put on my Mom's makeup. I felt great, I felt beautiful but, my Dad flipped out and called me a sissy boy. After that I tried being the Son he wanted. I went out for every sport and even got a Baseball scholarship, which was a good thing since he wouldn't pay for me like my sisters because I needed to learn responsibility. I never felt as good though as I did when I dressed up like a girl. Only then did I feel like me, so I kept doing it in secret. I'm really messed up\".  You smile, place you hand on her leg, and say, \"Nicky, you're not messed up\". You say even though you\u2019re thinking yes you are. That and look at those tits.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's screaming with pleasure begging for more. Then her voice changes becoming deeper. You look down to see Nick back to his old self with your dick up his ass. You pull out and jump back in disgust. He turns around and with a smile says, \"I guess it's my turn now\". \"Your turn for what\", you ask? He laughs and answers, \"My turn to fuck you, Aaron\". \"No way\", you shout back and then realize your voice has now changed. You look down at yourself to see that you now have a nicely shaven pussy that's view is somewhat obstructed by a set of very large breasts. You go to run for the door, but stop when you see Jordan also male again standing at the door. \"Hey Nick, can I get some of this to\", he shouts? Nick shrugs and says, \"Sure, I got heads you can have tails\". You try to fight them, but your muscles are jello. They throw you to the bed. Nick crams his cock into your mouth as Jordan shoves his dick into your pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then you wake up covered in sweat. You quickly check yourself and find that you still male. You then look over to see Nicki sleeping beside you still female. You get up, go to the bathroom, and splash some water on your face. You've now got chills. You recognize the symptoms, you've got something and you now what it is. You're still male but for how much longer. You've stayed away from alcohol you've screwed your best friends that are now girls, but how much longer can you hold off the change? You decide right then if it keeps you from changing you'll screw Nicki and Jordan every chance you get. You're positive they would do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You go to the kitchen and down another energy drink. While you're drinking it you notice Jordan's door is slightly cracked. She must have got up and didn't shut it all the way.</span></div></div>",

Well actually it was sleazy motel in town, but I figured what the fuck I'm going to get some. Well she fixes me a drink. I figured what could one drink hurt if I'm getting laid. I drank it and that was the last thing I remember. When I woke up my clothes, my money, and my dick was gone. I spent a good deal of the night trying to get out of the bad part of town wearing nothing but  sheet. I can assure you that looking like this that wasn't fun. I found this bikini hanging beside one of the resort pools. I got back here and some jackass locked the door. Since I don't have my keys anymore I was trying to break in\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nicki hands her and beer and says, \"Here since it doesn't matter anymore and you look like you could use one\".

After you all calmed down, Nick and you made another unfortunate discovery...all of your clothes had been replaced with girl's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter forcing Jordan and Tony from the room, Nick and you hesitantly looked through your new clothes.  Whereas you came here with shorts, shirts and bathing suits; now your luggage was full of skirts, shorts, tops, bikinis, bras, panties and sundresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding up one of...her sundresses, Nick said, \"Is this someone's idea of a prank!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Nick.\" Sighing, you said, \"I really don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was a knock on the door; followed by Jordan saying, \"Tony and I are going for breakfast; you guys care to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at you in horror; silently mouthing, \"No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the door, you said, \"Let us get dressed; then we'll be right out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over, Nick said to you, \"What the hell, Aaron! There's no way I'm going out like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't stay cooped up in here all week, Nick; besides I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you managed to convince Nick to leave the hotel room; the two of you slowly got dressed.  You both had to help each other with the bras; which was an interesting experience for both of you, since your breasts were larger than Nick's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of you were dressed; you joined Tony and Jordan in the main room.  They were both shocked by how attractive Nick and you looked; although they didn't say it.  In an attempt to end the awkward silence, Nick said, \"Let's go, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the 4 of you walked out of the room; you couldn't help but notice how differently your body felt now; your hips swayed with every step and your breasts jiggled as well.  As you walked, you realized this was going to be an interesting Spring Break.</span></div></div>",

As you sat down to eat, Tony looked at you and said, \"We were thinking; we need something to call you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we stick with Aaron and Nick?\"  Exchanging a glance with Nick, you said, \"Our genders may have changed; but we're still the same people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking to himself for a moment, Tony said, \"How about Erin and Nicole; or Nicky for short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't sit well with either of you; but you knew Tony and Jordan wouldn't let up until you agreed.  With a reluctant sigh, you said, \"Okay, fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of breakfast was uneventful; although the four of you discussed what could've possibly caused Nicky and you to become girls over night.  There were some wild ideas thrown around; from magic to something in the drinks from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you were all finished eating.  As everyone got up from the table, Tony said, \"How about you guys join us by the pool?\" pausing, he said, \"I know it's not the best idea; but you two could really use some relaxation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Nicky, you said, \"We'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in the room, Tony and Jordan got changed into their bathing suits while Nicky and you sat down on the couch.</span></div></div>",

After taking our time to find bikinis that we didn't find too revealing, Nicky went into the bathroom to change while you changed in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were satisfied that the bikini was arranged comfortably, you made your way to the bathroom to take at how you looked.  Staring at your reflection, you couldn't help but admit that you looked rather attractive in the bikini; it showed off your new figure rather nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter admiring your appearance, you decided to check on Nicky.  Cautiously walking to the door, you knocked and said, \"Are you alright in there, Nicky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a few moments until you heard footsteps approaching the door.  The door opened a crack; enough for you to see Nicky looking at you.  \"I-I'm not sure about this, Erin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the door open, you said, \"How bad can it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back, Nicky said, \"Don't you think this is...too revealing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a look at Nicky, you saw that the bikini was perfect on her; even if she was embarrassed about wearing one.

As you continued to look around, you noticed several girls lying on their stomachs as they worked on their tans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd seen your sister and female cousins doing that in the past; and had wondered how it felt.  Now that you were a girl, you were in a position to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering the back of the chair, you turned over and lay down on your stomach.  Aside from the sudden weight on your breasts; it wasn't that bad.  After seeing you, Nicky decided to follow suit; hoping that by doing so the boys would stop looking at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour you realized you'd worked on your back for long enough; you didn't want to get a sun burn.  You were about to turn over to work on your stomach when you heard a voice say, \"Hey there, beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it wasn't bad enough that some guy was using a cheesy pick up line on you; you happened to recognize the voice.  Turning over, you looked at Tony and said, \"Better luck next time, Tony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Tony's face was priceless as he realized who you were.  \"Erin!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me.\" Gesturing to Nicky, who was dozing in her chair, you said, \"We were getting bored sitting in the hotel room; so we came out here to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't believe you guys actually came out dressed like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to persuade Nicky; but she eventually gave in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\" Getting over his initial shock, Tony said, \"You both look great by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to make you blush; as you said, \"Thanks...I think.\"</span></div></div>",

As Jordan applied the sunscreen, you felt warmth spreading through your body; which you failed to understand at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds more of the feeling, you realized that you were getting aroused.  It was a different sensation then as a guy; with the warmth permeating your entire body.  You started to feel a wetness build between your legs as Jordan ran his hands up your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned to face Jordan, you were shocked to see that he was also getting aroused by the situation.  As several unmanly thoughts rushed through your mind, nearly panting, you said, \"I think you can stop now, Jordan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" looking down, realizing how close his hands were to your waist, Jordan said, \"Oh, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Nicky and Tony weren't around to witness the awkward moment between the two of you; as they'd gone to the bar to get a drink.  Sitting up, you said, \"Could you get me a drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan silently got up and walked to the bar to get you a drink.  Watching him as he walked off; you noticed Tony and Nicky standing at the bar with their drinks.  As you watched, you were surprised to see Tony place a hand on Nicky's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing that, you wondered if Tony and Jordan were subconsciously treating the two of you like girls.  Sitting up in the chair, you tried rationalizing what was going on.  The more you thought about it; the more you started to think it was the alien hormones coursing through your now female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment you started to become aware of every guy at the pool checking you out; making you feel as if you were on display.  You spotted Jordan walking back to your chair with a beer for each of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the chair, you walked over to him and grabbed the beer.  Looking at him, you said, \"Let's go for a walk; I'm sick of guys checking me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you silently waved to Tony and Nicky as you walked by on your way to the beach.  As you walked along the beach, drinking your beers, the two of you started talking.  You talked about how school was going; anything to keep your mind off your sudden sex change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a while, the two you decided to sit down and rest for a while.  As you finished off your drinks, you both passed the time by checking out the beach-goers.  While you were mainly eying the girls; you were shocked to find yourself occasionally staring at some of the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a glance at Jordan, you could tell he was conflicted about something.  He would occasionally glance at you; only to blush and turn away.  Turning to him, you said, \"What's wro...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish the sentence, Jordan pulled you close before kissing you on the lips.

Getting out of bed, you got dressed and walked out to the main room to find the others sitting in the kitchenette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you, Tony said, \"Look who finally woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at them, you said, \"What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost 10:30.\" Pausing, Nicky said, \"We've been up for almost 2 hours now; you must've been more exhausted than the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you talked for a while before heading down to breakfast.  As you stepped out of the elevator, you noticed a group of guys walking towards you.  Before you even knew what you were doing, without the others noticing, you smiled and winked at the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself rather excited to see them turn around to look at you as you walked past them; as if you were starting to enjoy the attention you were getting from guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout realizing it, you must've stopped in the middle of the hallway to look at them.  You didn't realize that until Jordan appeared next to you and said, \"Come on, Erin; let's get something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a quick glance at the boys before they entered the elevator, you turned and followed Jordan down the hall.  \"Sorry about that, I thought I saw someone I knew.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a quick breakfast; where you once again found yourself subtly checking out of the guys in the room; you and the others went back to the room to get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the bedroom, as you adjusted your bikini top, you noticed Nicky walking out of the bathroom wearing her own bikini.  Looking at her, you noticed that she seemed more open about wearing the bikini then she had yesterday.  In fact, you resisted the urge to chuckle as you watched her check herself out in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of you were ready, you joined Tony and Jordan in the main room before heading out for a relaxing day at the beach.  Walking onto the beach a short time later, you were surprised to see a row of tents set up on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four of you slowly made your way towards the tents, you remembered reading that the hotels on the beach were going to hold a fair for those that were here on Spring Break.  Walking amongst the tents, you saw most of them were supporting local businesses; while others were supporting other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were looking at a tent that was set up by a local para-sailing company; when you heard a voice come over a loud speaker.  You were too far away to hear it clearly, so you slowly made your way towards the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer, you realized it was a man representing a professional modeling company from the US.  Standing in the crowd, you heard him explain that he was looking for several girls to serve as models for their summer catalog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no contract to be signed; simply a waiver that allows us to use your image in the catalog.\" Pausing, the man said, \"Don't be shy; you're all beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see Tony and Jordan walking towards you.  Looking at them, you said, \"This sounds like fun; I think I'll sign up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" shocked, Jordan said, \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" shrugging, you said, \"The worst that happens is I'll get a picture to remember this crazy week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to prove yourself, Erin.\" Taking your arm, Tony said, \"Come on; there's other booths to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you saw the girl who'd called Nicky a tramp; and she was walking towards the announcer.  Thankfully Erin wasn't nearby; having wandered over to look at another booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she's entering, then I'm definitely entering.\" Pausing, you said, \"Someone's got to knock that bitch down a peg or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tony and Jordan could say anything else, much to the annoyance of the other girl, you walked up and signed up for the contest.   It wasn't long before you and the other girl were joined on stage by 6 other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the contest began, you were the first to be doused with the hose; watching as your bikini top became visible under your t-shirt.  After every other girl was doused with the hose, the judges came to their decision and handed the announcer an envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen; we have a winner.\" Speaking into the microphone, the announcer said, \"This year's local beauty is...Erin Thomas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't expecting that outcome. In a moment of shock, you said, \"I...won!?\" as reality sank in, you said, \"I won!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nClearly the girl who'd insulted Nicky had hoped to win; as evident from the glare she gave you as you were hosed off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pictures were taken, you were led off stage by the announcer; as he handed you a business card.  \"You'd make a fantastic model.\" Chuckling, he said, \"Give me a call if you're interested, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you said, \"I-I'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you a wink, the announcer said, \"Good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying yourself off, you rejoined Jordan and Tony in the crowd.  \"Are you happy now, Erin?\" looking at you, Jordan said, \"That guy's probably going to stalk you until you say yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Jordan.\" Giggling, you said, \"You guys can be so paranoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need I remind you that you were a guy too?\" getting nervous, Tony said, \"You might be one again...when whatever caused this reverses itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean <i>if</i> this reverses itself.\" Pausing, you said, \"I think I'm beginning to like being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tony and Jordan could say anything, you turned and left them visibly shaken.</span></div></div>",

As the only other person who knew what you were going through, you felt she was the only person you could fully trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to her as she was looking at some jewelry on a table.  Unable to resist, you said, \u201cYou buying for yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Turning to you, Nicky said, \u201cMy cousin\u2019s birthday is next week; I figured I\u2019d buy her something while I was here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked through some of the necklaces, silently wondering how you\u2019d look wearing them, you said, \u201cI noticed you didn\u2019t watch me when the contest; it felt good beating that bitch who insulted you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You</i> were Erin Thomas!?\u201d turning to you with a shocked expression, Nicky said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe you actually participated in a wet t-shirt contest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tony and Jordan appeared next to you; with Jordan say, \u201cJoin the club, Nicky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal is!\u201d trying to defend yourself, you, \u201cI was trying to have some fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve had your fun.\u201d Trying to take my hand, Tony said, \u201cNow I think it\u2019d be best if you toned it down a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to say something when suddenly you heard a voice behind you say, \u201cYou two will never get a date if you talk to girls like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, the four of you turned around to find three girls from school standing there.  Looking at them, you recognized them as Tracey Wilkins, Mia Sanchez, and Nancy Porter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at them, Tony said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you three stay out of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Tony, Tracey took my hand and pulled me aside.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cThose two mean well; but their knowledge of girls is pretty whack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing towards Tony and Jordan, you said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Tracey said, \u201cI\u2019m Tracey Wilkins by the way; these are my friends Mia Sanchez and Nancy Porter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to let on that you knew all of them; especially since you dated Tracey during your sophomore year, you said, \u201cI\u2019m <br>\r\nErin Thomas; and the silent one is Nicole Rogers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her hand out, Nicky said, \u201cBut everyone calls me Nicky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you both.\u201d Taking Nicky\u2019s hand, Mia said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two hang out with us; give these guys sometime to rethink their...strategy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting nervous, Nicky said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to impose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, the more the merrier.\u201d  Giggling, Mia said, \u201cBesides, you two look like you could use some time away from the boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to get nervous yourself, you said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning Nancy said, \u201cYou don\u2019t get out much, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say Nicky and I haven\u2019t had a whole lot of \u2018girl\u2019 time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2019s as good a time as any to start.\u201d Chuckling, Mia said, \u201cIt looks like we got to you just in time; you\u2019re both starting to take on some unladylike habits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to realize she meant Nicky and you were acting like boys.  You wanted to say that was because you were boys until yesterday, but decided against it.  Before you could say anything, Tracey and her friends led Nicky and you in the direction of the hotel\u2019s spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced back at Tony and Jordan to find they had bewildered looks on their faces as you walked off.</span></div></div>",

After they were removed, you were surprised by how clean and smooth you skin had become.  Walking into the room, having just finished her body wrap, Mia said, \"Now for our makeovers.\" Smiling, Mia said, \"How are you two enjoying yourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing.\" In a soft tone, Nicky said, \"I never knew how relaxing this could be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Nicky shudder slightly as the girls turned to you.

As the pair of you split off from Jordan and Tony, he confesses that he needed a little parental assistance to afford this little trip. Sharing his pain, and discomfort, you could only afford it because of your week-end job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot an issue for the others, who were studying for their degrees before getting a job working in the family business. You need your degree, for any prospect of a decent career. Nick too, blushing he admitted he'd pretended this was partly a study trip. So, his parents were expecting a few pictures from a local museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wants the trip out of the way as soon as possible, so he can relax and enjoy the rest of the trip. Somehow, you suspect his parents aren't as gullible as Nick imagines, but you play along. Following the directions on his phone, you head off to the museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at your destination, you regret coming, knowing it's going to be a horrific experience. The pair of you look up at the expansive plantation house. It's well manicured lawn, picket fence, and fresh coat of paint make it look immaculate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the sign on the front grass tells you the museum to the history of slavery on the island is still open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to put on a brave face, it looks like it's been modernised recently. Opening the gate, you walk up the path to the wide open front door. It's a perfect restoration or preservation, the electricity subtly placed to look like it fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of cases show the shackles and collars used for keeping the slaves. A local girl startles you as she emerges from a side room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine wearing that, and being considered less than human... treated as property?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding your head, you agree, but you see that Nick is less taken with the question, and more with the tour guide. With your head low, you sneak a sly look. She is young, stacked, fit and thicc. Straightening up, you focus on keeping your eyes on her face, and not falling into that incredible cleavage, or down to that taut tummy. Those incredible hips provide their own risks, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you a couple of the collars to examine as if you're an audience member at a magic show. They're surprisingly heavy, and simple. The simple hinge and the loop at the back to be sealed with a lock, or added to a coffle line. Nick is fidgetting with his, distracting himself with it's smooth movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... Are we meant to wear these for the tour?\" he asks awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently you curse him, you want to hand the damned things back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you can see if they fit you?\" The guide asks, her voice sweet, seductive and innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's is snapped in place before you can show any hesitancy yourself. And scowl to show your unhappiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you?\" the girl asks you. The pressure mounting, you don't know if she's the descendant of slaves, or if her forefathers worked on this plantation hacking down cane sugar in the heat. But, you comply, to be able to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her hands, you see two metal pins resting in her open palms. Like oversized rivets, they rest there. Swallowing nervously, you feel sick as she gestures for you both to kneel down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of the tour...\" you tell yourself, repeating it like a mantra. You feel as much as hear the soft clink of metal on metal as she drops the pins into your collars. Resisting the urge to inspect them, you see the same green look from Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start this tour now...\" she takes you to a couple of mirrors to inspect your reflection. It's bad enough seeing Nick collared, and feeling your own. Seeing it too, just adds to the rising nausea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what your role would have been on the plantation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guide stands a foot or so shorter than either of you. But, uncollared she seems to loom over you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the press of a button, she stands between you. A hand comfortably around your waists, \"For this experience, your mine... just relax and enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look at the mirrors, you start to spot differences. Staring intently, you hope the lighting returns to normal. Whether a cloud is passing by outside, your looking darker in the mirror. But the longer and harder you stare the more extreme it seems to become. As you watch your lips thicken, and your nose broaden you, raise a hand to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's still the same pale hand as ever. In the mirror it's reflected matching your face. Finally the penny drops, and you realise it's not a mirror, this is an app of some kind. A damned convincing one, a terrified glance from Nick tells you his reflection is shifting too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all traces of your real selves are erased from the mirror, you take in the look of dread and horror that remain. Your humanity still intact, buried behind new features and a very different hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, now?\" The guide asks. Both of you are eager to step away from these nightmarish reflections.</span></div></div>",

Your own bodies remain the same, but you still glance to your exposed flesh double-checking the projected images are fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing to Nick's mirror, you see a broad bared chest, hairy and muscular from long days cutting sugar cane. Her words snap your gaze back to your own mirror. Drawn to the lush cleavage on display there. The full, firm breasts inviting you to look deeper, are barely contained by the loose peasant top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand rising in shock, to lips that look too full and ripe for any duty beyond cock-sucking. The image is wide-eyed and horrified, her fear translated from your own. That damned app, is impressively terrifying. Now showing a dark, bare forearm reaching to a matching face, and the dread doubtless clear in both your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guide's introduction is interrupted as Jordan and Tony arrive, surprising you both. Smoothly, the guide produces another couple of slave collars, offering them to the new arrivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tour has just started, and you're free to join.\" she says smoothly. Their arrogance, and pride on full display. In numerous subtle ways, their clothes a degree finer, and more designer. Their watches a little more expensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a little worrying how easily the guide shrugs off their refusal to wear the collars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough to enslave.\" Jordan jokes, looking between the two of you. Tony looks a little more awkward with the light-hearted humour about slavery. But, he too isn't wearing a collar either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, you hope neither of them heard the part about you being a house maid.</span></div></div>",

You have all decided to start partying early, ordering beer after beer from the stewardesses.  One in particular continues looking at you with contempt.  She has dark skin and looks a little too wild to be working somewhere as plebian as a major aircraft.  As you touch down on the island airport runway, you can still somewhat feel her smoldering eyes burning a hole in the back of your skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, you all enjoy your first day of drinking and partying, and you all pass out wherever you drop in the hotel room.  But the curse of the island stewardess begins to affect you as you sleep.  Unbeknownst to you, your angular hard male body becomes harder and softer until it is completely female.

You scratch at your bed-head and fail to notice that your formerly short hair has grown a little longer.  You also have to reach down to pull your boxers up as they now slide down your legs a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is only when you look into the mirror that you notice your changes and scream.  Everything about you has now become feminine.  Your body is now smaller and thinner, your hair longer, but only just.  Having slept without a shirt, your new small breasts are plainly visible.  You instinctively cover them in a very feminine maneuver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour scream seems to have alerted someone, who comes to the bathroom door and knocks.  It's a woman, which surprises you.  As far as you know, none of your friends brought anyone else back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron?

He/she raised a hand in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan, who already looked vaguely feminine, hasn't changed much.  Nick, however, seems to have changed the most of all.  Along with his manhood, he had also apparently lost nearly a foot in height, dropping him down to 5 ft. even.   Now significantly less muscular, your former jock friend has now found himself swimming in his clothes.  He looked almost...cute now, struggling with both hands to hold up his boxer shorts.  You find it very hard to hold back your laughter as you converse with him/her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?  You okay there, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's new height and proportions also seem to have given him/her a bit of a Napoleon complex, as he/she immediately bites your head off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm not okay!  How would you like it if you got turned into a runt?  I mean, look at these arms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised up a skinny female arm, an arm now completely devoid of his years of weight lifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're like sticks!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA peek down his massively oversized tank top gave him something else to bitch about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't even have a nice rack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!

The moon now the only light in the sky, you head off to your hotel rooms for a sleep. Luckily, you were all in neighbouring rooms. You had 17. Matt had 16 across the hall from you. Steve had 15 on one side, and Jack had 19 on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night, John.\" Matt's words getting only a sullen grunt, and a half-hearted, \"Night, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching the small kettle on, you want a last cup of coffee before heading to bed. The inviting double bed will hopefully see a lot of action in the week ahead. The view from the balcony over the empty beaches, lets you see the length of the shore, as you imagine spending tomorrow walking it's boardwalk and seeing the available talent. Dumping your suitcase on the seat by the dresser, you pop it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kettle clicks off, you realise you haven't made up your cup. A yawn breaks free, and you find yourself eyeing the bed once more. Not bothering to unpack your bag, or even undress you collapse there, and fall asleep before you can really resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake to a terrifying surprise. The sunlight beams through your eyelids tinting your world red. You try to adjust your position, but it's intensely uncomfortable, with a groan, you realise you might as well get up. You're startled to see that you've woken out on the balcony the Sun peeking over the horizon seering your eyes. But that's a distant complaint. Hell, you aren't even sure how you went from the bed to the balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your highest priority is your clothes... well swimsuit....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, a bikini, and you fill it out in all the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/ef5ccb3a5866030adbd92a7b0aee8456/tumblr_oukjktzxxj1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/ef5ccb3a5866...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not thinking properly, groggy with sleep you pad inside. Wondering if you've lost a day, and if this is a prank, you want to wake up more so that you can get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounce of your bust in time with your steps is worryingly real. Or at least as you'd imagine it feels. Thoughts of Disney and prosthetics come to mind. But damn, this is a hell of an impressive illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half-interested glance at your suitcase shows this trick is all in. The open case revealing a range of shoes, heels, flats, dressy and casual. A selection of swimwear too. All tailored, you guess, for your new body. A smirk curls lazily from the corner of your mouth, it's impressive in it's commitment. Scratching your head, even the hair feels real. You struggle to recall what you did yesterday, to think how much you must have drunk to forget the entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a yawn, you turn the kettle on again. You really need to wake up. A soft snort coming from your lips as you see your reflection. You're Asian. A busty Asian girl. You hate to think you'd be racist, but you never saw yourself as Asian before. As the kettle bubbles towards boiling point you cradle your bust. The girls feel warm in your hands, realist, and very sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing your thumbs over those large nipples a shudder ripples down your spine. Your eyes widen in horror, glancing back to the busty girl in the mirror, gaping at the reflection. A quavering hand coming up in front of your face. You know it must be real, this is no trick, no prosthetic, no drunken gag. That hand is too small, that arm to skinny..... Hell, you notice you've lost several inches in height, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desire, the need to scream dies in your throat, as you don't want to be discovered, an unknown woman in<i> 'John's'</i> room. Unnoticed, the kettle clicks off the boil, as you head for the door. Feeling completely vulnerable, you head into the empty hallway, intensely aware of your bikini, what it covers, and leaves exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on the three doors. Your friends need to see this, you need to convince them of your true identity. Your blood turns cold, as you consider what'll happen if you can't convince them you're John.</span></div></div>",

She looks on the verge of a nervous break-down, her gorgeous body, is the most sexual of the four of you. The most purely sexual creature you've seen in the flesh.

The breasts that put even your to shame, and the full rump draws your eyes as she sashays past. Those wide hips, that tiny so mobile waist forcing her to walk that way. With a glance up and down the corridor, you see it's still empty. The cries of distress bringing no-one rushing to your rescue, no-one to investigate. The world feels a little harder, a little colder, worryingly indifferent to your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door clicks shut behind you, the final few inches aided by the press of your ass.

She glowers at the mirror, the full-length mirror giving her no respite from her own body, from the vacuous expression of bimbo-like naivety. She'll never convince anyone of her intelligence. Her clothes as girly and clearly distressing her, she too sits down. As her suspenders shift jerkily over her thighs,  and the barely there panties make her hands twitch fighting the desire to rip away the humiliating garments. Her whole being pleading for understanding, for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/9a0bda78855791edcd33a21bf7386846/tumblr_oraiz3MSCh1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/9a0bda788557...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a shrug and a sympathetic smile, you don't even have an explanation to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack kneels awkwardly on your bed.

You stroke her arm, to comfort her, but she flinches from your touch.<br>\r\n\"What's your name.... now?\" <br>\r\nYou keep your voice as friendly as you can manage, an uncertain, hopefully encouraging smile on your face. The silence draws on.<br>\r\n\"I'm Jane.

Your mouth quirks as you recall you too now fit in that category.
