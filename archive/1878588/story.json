Aaron turns around, \u201cWell thank you but it\u2019s not official just yet but\u2026 hey you look familiar, have we met?\u201d he asks the stranger, \u201cNot officially, Michael Owens I\u2019m a visiting sociology professor, you have probably seen me around campus.\u201d He says shaking his hand, \u201cI\u2019ve seen your work, very impressive. But hey if you have time I\u2019d love to hear your thesis.\u201d Michael says, \u201cSure I was just leaving.\u201d Aaron says putting his notes in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them continue walking and talking about psychology, sociology, and the general state of the work. After circling the campus the decide to rest by the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you believe that people are the way they are simply because of how they look?\u201d Michael asks, \u201cWell not exactly, it\u2019s a combination of nature vs. nurture, for example if someone is born into a rich family or a poor family, or if someone is born tall or short, or if someone is male or female. There are so many factors that contribute to who we become and how we see ourselves and the world. But for the most part I believe its how some people don\u2019t understand how others feel that causes so many problems.\u201d Aaron says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can respect that.\u201d Michael says smiling, \u201cBut how would you use your theory to help the world? I mean that should be the goal of sociology right?\u201d he asks, Aaron smiles, \u201cYeah I haven\u2019t figured that our yet, but imagine if you could actually show one person the world from another\u2019s eyes.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Michael says smiling as though he knows exactly what Aaron is fixing to say, \u201cWell take that guy over there harassing those girls.\u201d Aaron says pointing to an obviously drunk guy trying to hook up with every girl passing by. \u201cI know him, and trust me alcohol isn\u2019t making him act like that. He is as sexist as it comes, now don\u2019t ask me how someone could develop that attitude these days but he did, now imagine if he could see what it is like to be a woman and put up with guys like himself?\u201d Aaron says. Michael smiles and says, \u201cYeah that would defiantly teach him a lesson.\u201d Aaron laughing, \u201cYeah but fortunately for him we can\u2019t do that.\u201d He says  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then starts laughing, \u201cYeah too bad, so once you officially get your doctorate have you thought about a job?\u201d he asks smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell really the only thing you can do with a doctorate in sociology is teach, so I guess I\u2019m going to be a professor like you.\u201d He says, \u201cYeah a college professor is a pretty honorable position, you get to mold young minds and hopefully guide them so that they may change the world for the better.\u201d Michael says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how would you like to use your ideas to change the world a different way?\u201d he asks smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron turns to him, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asks, \u201cWell what if I told you I wasn\u2019t a professor, and I am actually part of a secret organization that teaches world about tolerance. And you have been selected to join us?\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron pauses for a moment and the bursts out laughing, \u201cWow you almost had me there.\u201d He says getting up to look around, \u201cWhere is everyone, is this some kind of sociology induction thing?\u201d he asks still laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then stands up with a straight look on his face, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone just believe me.\u201d He says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With this I can change anything about you down to the smallest detail and give you a whole new life to go with it. Your own mother wouldn\u2019t recognize you, but don\u2019t worry I can give you a new mother that can show you your baby pictures.\u201d Michael says laughing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing! But can you change me back now? I think the thong was a little much.\u201d He says adjusting his underwear. \u201cOh sorry, It\u2019s been a while since I have recruited anyone so you got the standard case attire.\u201d He says laughing as he types something on the control turning Aaron back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the whole secret organization job offer thing was true?\u201d he asks, \u201cThat\u2019s right, are you interested?\u201d Michael ask, \u201cOf course, but where did you get that kind of technology?\u201d he asks, \u201cWell you didn\u2019t seriously think they let you see how advanced the worlds technology really is do you?\u201d he says smiling, \u201cI guess not, so you work for the government?\u201d he asks, \u201cNo of course not, we are a completely separate entity that operates outside of any government, so that we may serve the world as a whole.\u201d He says proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe world, but how?\u201d he asks, \u201cWell it\u2019s just like you said, people grow up from a certain perspective and develop narrow minded believes. Our job is to find these individuals and show them different perspectives.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut wait if that\u2019s true how do you stay a secret?\u201d Aaron asks, \u201cWell that\u2019s simple, if someone sees something they shouldn\u2019t we just wipe their memories with this.\u201d he says showing him his watch, \u201cI know it looks like a watch but just set it like so and it will make everything within a certain time feel like a dream that quickly fades away, and you can tell them whatever you want. For example, if you\u2019re not interested in joining us I just press this button and you will forget everything we have discussed since we met and ill say something like congratulations on your doctorate and you\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d He says smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are you interested?\u201d he says placing his hand on his watch, \u201cOh, yes I\u2019m defiantly interested.\u201d Aaron says. \u201cGood, but there is one thing you have to take into consideration.\u201d He says with a serious look on his face, \u201cYou see this is not the kind of job that you can do part time, or can tell others about. So if you accept, your existence will be erased. Though you can go anywhere in the world with any temporary identity you wish when you are not on a case, Aaron Walker will no longer exist. Your friends and family won\u2019t remember you, you won\u2019t leave finger prints, and everything about you will be wiped from every database on earth.

Since we handle cases from all over the world we must be able to be anywhere fast.\u201d He says leading him through a larger open area that felt like the bullpen at a large company.

But working with it has allowed me to make many of my own breakthroughs.\u201d She says proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright enough flirting you two, show him the good stuff.\u201d Michael says, \u201cOf course, right this way.\u201d She says leading them to a strange machine, \u201cThis is one of those breakthroughs I have mentioned. In the past all the procedures to prepare new recruits for this job would take time and discomfort, but with this machine it is quick and painless. Now if you would be so kind.\u201d She says gesturing for him to step into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a little nervous at the idea that this was suppose to make something that sounded long and painful quick and easy but from what he had see he took a deep breath and decided to trust her. He then steps onto a platform beneath a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay now stand still, this will only take a second.\u201d She says activating the machine from a remote control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly lights started spinning around the platform as the light above it started to get brighter until Aaron was enveloped in a warm light.

That machine has removed your fingerprints and made your DNA unreadable by normal means, it also gives you a visually recordable signal so that our computers can either wipe or manipulate any picture or video that you get caught in, and you can now speak and understand any lanuguage.\u201d she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them then lead him to a table with different gadgets on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay now the fun part; this is your standard issue control pad. It allows you to easily manipulate a selected target or yourself if need be. You just select a target like so,\u201d she says selecting Michael on the screen, \u201cAnd then select a manipulation option, like age.\u201d She says adjusting Michael\u2019s age to six years old, you then watch as he changes to a six year old boy. Michael then turns so you can see the full transformation, \u201cAnd as you can see his clothes changed with him, and you can change the clothing options as well but they are on default right now. And to return the subjects to normal just press this button.\u201d She says pressing the button and returning him to normal, \u201cBut Mike will show you more about that later, next we have your memory band.\u201d She says handing you a watch like Michael\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow just like the control pad you can set this for a specific target, or a distance around you and then set it for a certain amount of time. Press this button and then their memory will be wiped.\u201d She says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright now that is all the beginner equipment you will need from me for the time being. But come back and see me sometime.\u201d She says winking at him. \u201cAh thanks.\u201d He says as Michael leads him out of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if this is beginner stuff, what do I get when I\u2019m not a beginner anymore?\u201d he asks, \u201cLet\u2019s just take things one step at a time.\u201d He says, \u201cNow next up is a brief rules and regulations seminar.\u201d He says leading him into a classroom with a man in a lab coat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We find that on the job is the best way to learn. Though if you would like to discuss different transformation strategies with other agents there is a meeting in conference Room A every Wednesday. But for now here is how it works; our system monitors the behavior of everyone within close proximity of any wireless device. And if someone displays intolerance of others that our system deems extreme and worthy of our intervention it is reported and assigned to an agent. The agent then decides how to handle the situation.\u201d He says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you must stay pretty busy around here.\u201d Aaron says, \u201cYes, but multiple cases can be assigned to one agent and this is only one instillation. Our organization is spread around the world.\u201d Michael says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd with your educational background and Mike\u2019s guidance you probably already have an idea of how you would handle certain cases, and you will be assigned cases of your own, though if you have trouble with one you can trade it or give it to other agents. And you will see that all of our cases are of eighteen years and older. Parents have the right to try and straighten their children out but once they are legal they are our problem.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo just listen to Mike and everything will be fine, though I will warn you that with the level of power and the task we are given comes great responsibility. And any agent caught abusing their power will face appropriate consequences.\u201d He says seriously, \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a good feeling about you, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d  He says smiling, \u201cNow if you ever need anything my office is always open.\u201d Dr. Reeves say as they leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow everyone sure is friendly around here.\u201d Aaron says, \u201cYeah, we found that it generally takes someone with a good heart to do our kind of work.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So much had happened in such a short time, Aaron\u2019s mind was racing but he decided to calm down and get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning he wakes up, puts on a pair of pajama pants and walks to the kitchen. Just then he realized that no one told him what time he had to be at work, or even how to use his front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoring, Coffee?\u201d he hears, breaking his concentration. He then looks up to see Michael sitting at his kitchen table drinking coffee and reading the news paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh he Michael, I didn\u2019t hear you come in\u2026\u201d he says awkwardly, \u201cHey we\u2019re partners now, call me Mike. So you want any coffee?\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks I\u2019m good, so ah\u2026 how long have you been here?\u201d Aaron asks, \u201cNot long, and sorry about that, but when I got back to my place I realized you don\u2019t know how to use your front door. So I had to get here before you tried otherwise you could have ended up in the middle of the dessert, or the ocean.\u201d He says laughing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow well in that case thanks, but wait you mean that door can send me anywhere in the world?\u201d Aaron asks, \u201cWell with the exception of a few dangerous or high security destinations, yes. But until you get the hang of it I would just keep it local.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow get ready, we have a long day and you have a lot to learn.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay ill go jump in the shower, so is there any kind of dress code or anything?\u201d Aaron asks, \u201cWell just put on something comfortable and ill explain.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron quickly jumps in and out of the shower, brushes his teeth, and sorts through his boxes of clothes for a pair of khaki pants and a collared shirt. He then walks back into the kitchen where Mike is just finishing his coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOkay do you have your tech?\u201d he asks, \u201cRight here.\u201d He says holding them up. \u201cOkay first off, headquarters is just like any other office building, corporate casual or business wear. They say it\u2019s a dress for success type thing while we are in the office. But the beauty of it is you can wake up and throw on pajama pants and a wrinkled shirt and just use your control pad to change your clothes. Here let me show you.\u201d Mike says extending his hand for Aarons control pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron gives him the pad. Mike then shows him how to choose the clothing option and select a target, he then selects a suit similar to Mike\u2019s and changes his clothes to match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that\u2019s awesome.\u201d He says, \u201cOkay now for the door, just think of a place in detail, open the door and imagine taking one step from here to there, here you try.\u201d He says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron then steps up to the door and thinks about the door he used to get here the night before. He then opens the door and steps through. And he was instantly standing in the office, he smiles taking a moment enjoy the victory of easily accomplishing what Mike said was hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty cool isn\u2019t it.\u201d Mike says standing right behind him, making him jump. \u201cAnd I know what you\u2019re thinking, that wasn\u2019t so hard, but if you lose concentration you could have easily ended up between dimensional space so baby steps okay?\u201d he says smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright now follow me to our desks and we will get things started.\u201d Mike says guiding you back to your desk. Yours was still empty but there were multiple folders on his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay these are all cases I am either working on or have just been assigned to me. If you look through them you will see all kinds of information about their issues, history, and the progress of their transformation. So pick one and we will go from there.\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron sorts through the folders, skimming the ones that caught his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you must stay pretty busy.\u201d He says, \u201cYeah, when the higher ups know you get the job done they keep finding work for you to do, but that\u2019s the price of being good at what you do.\u201d He says confidently, \"So you found one you like yet?\"</span></div></div>",

Wow we can do all of that?\u201d Aaron asks, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, and much more, You see for some an initial swap is the wakeup call they need but some cases require even more... motivation.\" he says smiling, \"Like take Jack the womanizer, first I made him a waitress thinking it would teach him a little humility, but I let him keep his nice apartment but that wasn\u2019t working so I had to move him to a less desirable neighborhood, and then when that didn\u2019t work I gave him double D-cups and put him of the late night shift.\u201d He says laughing, \u201cAnd that was a week ago so let\u2019s see how he is doing now.\u201d He says parking the car on the street in front of a small apartment building. They walk up stairs and knock on the door of apartment 213.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later a busty attractive yet exhausted woman opens the door, and the second she sees Michael she lights up with excitement and ushered us inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank god! Am I glad to see you, I\u2019ve learned my lesson, please change me back.\u201d She begs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Jack, I\u2019d like to introduce you to Aaron, he is a new agent with the bureau. And I was hoping you could tell him a little bit about what a profound impact we have had on your life.\u201d He says smiling  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You all have a seat around the coffee table.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay first off, did I want this? Hell no! But did I need it, yeah probably. I never thought something like this was possible but I mean I used to be the man, or at least what I though the man was supposed to be like. And I guess along the way I pissed a lot of women off, and after spending the past month as one. I see that for the most part they have a good reason to think that we are all assholes.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell kid I was hoping that you would have a chance to make things a little more interesting for Jack here but, it looks like he actually learned his lesson.\u201d Michael says smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then jumps up, \u201cWait does this mean you\u2019re going to change me back?\u201d he asks desperately, \u201cYes Sir, you did the crime, the time, and now you\u2019re good to go.\u201d He says taking out his controller. \u201cOh thank you so much, I won\u2019t forget this.\u201d He says, \u201cOh yes you will.\u201d Michael says pressing a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jack disappears and the apartment is completely vacant as though no one has lived there for months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what just happened?\u201d Aaron asks, \u201cI sent him back to his real life, rite now he is probably waking up in his office thinking that he just dosed off.\u201d He says, \u201cWait so he will just think it was all a dream?\u201d  He asks, \u201cWell sometimes they do.\u201d He says, \u201cBut then what was the point if he isn\u2019t going to remember?\u201d he asks, Michael then smiles and says, \u201cWell it depends on what you mean by remember, the conversation we just had may fade from his memory like a dream, but his heart will always remember that month he spent getting hit on by the same jerks that he used to be.\u201d He says, \u201cAnd if he ever forgets, I\u2019m going to make him a stripper with E-cups.\u201d He says smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron stands there for a moment looking at the vacant apartment still trying to wrap his mind around everything that just happened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, that\u2019s just one down, we\u2019ve got other appointments to make.\u201d He says, \u201cOh right.\u201d Aaron says following him out the door and back to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay where to next?\u201d he asks   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The main character is recruited by a top secret organization that uses transformations and body swapping to teach the inconsiderate, prejudice, and narrow-minded people of the world a lesson in consideration so that humanity can grow as a whole. And I know that sounds like a serious mission but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s the same TG experience as any other story just a different perspective on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as an agent he will visit different individuals in desperate need of an attitude adjustment and must decide how to teach him a lesson. Whether it be through a gender change, age regression, body swap, or anything else he can think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now I\u2019m not going to worry so much about rules but I do reserve the right to remove anything I believe to be inappropriate or just a pointless filler  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy :)<br>\r\n</td>",
