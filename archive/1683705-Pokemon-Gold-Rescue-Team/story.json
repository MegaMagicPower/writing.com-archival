Today was the last day of school, and your best friend, Artemis, had come over to your house to play video games. \"You boys behave yourselves!\" your mom yells back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush into your living room and turn on the Wii. You then turn on your DS, and connect to the Wii. You insert the \"Pokemon Battle Revolution\" disk as Artemis turns on his DS. You select your Pokemon teams and begin the battle. After an intense battle, you knock out Artemis's final Pokemon with your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a flash lights up the living room, and a hologram of a Beldum appears in front of you. \"Your skills are excellent, but we need your assistance in our world. Please help us!\" The hologram fades out as you turn to face each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we go?\" Artemis asks. \"We do.\" you reply.

I can't remember\u2026\" A male voice called out. He realizes he can't see anything, and slowly opens his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he sees is an abundance of trees around him, showing their green shine. He feels down on the soft ground he is laying on, which is grass. Then he sees the side of a small cliff, seeing a waterfall going into a small spring. He must be in a forest, or something like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where... am...I\u2026? What is this place?\" He tried to stand up, only to be bombarded by a headache, which forced him to sit down upon the grass and rub his head, praying for the pain to stop. \"Agh... My head is pounding\u2026\" Soon enough, for what it feels like an eternity, he felt the his headache lighten up enough to try think more clearly, only to find out that he can't recall any memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't remember anything\u2026 But wait, do I know my name?\" He concentrated, hoping to remember what his name was. Then it clicked. \"So I do still know my name, Robret\u2026 But why can't I remember anything? What's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was saying this, he felt his lips were dry, and realized he must have dried his mouth out. \"Thirsty\u2026 I need to drink some water\u2026\" Suddenly he looked at the waterfall with the small spring that is produced out of it. He crawled slowly to the edge of the water, only to close his eyes and dump his head in the water, trying to drink it as much as he possibly can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! That's so refreshing! I don't think I've ever tasted better water in my life!\" he exclaimed, praising how much he feels alive again. Woah, I gotta calm down. If I get this excited over water, I'd faint over food, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few deep breaths to calm down his nerves. He looked over to the water, looking at how it saved him from dying from thirst. But at the corner of his eye he sees some sort of reflection looming over the water below him, its image disturbed by the small ripples of water. \"Wait\u2026 There's something reflecting on the surface\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to take a closer look at the distorted image. The water started to calm down just enough to see a Pok\u00e9mon staring right back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? A Snivy!? But that's just a reflection! That means\u2026\" Robert looked at his hands to realize that they were small and green. He stared in disbelief as he looked at himself. He had the body of a Snivy, with a tail of leaves, striking red eyes, slender skin and a cream colored underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHHHHH! I've turned into a Pok\u00e9mon!\" He screamed out loud. \"But it's impossible! I should be a human!\" As he said this many new questions flooded his mind. Why? How? When did this happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beheem!\" Came out a mysterious noise loud enough to make the former human to come out of his stupor. He looked to find the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw three brown figures headed toward him, floating as they came closer to him. \"Beheem!\" They rang out before stopping short of the Snivy. They turned to each other and started flickering their lights to each other, communicating in a language he couldn't understand. What is that? He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the three Pok\u00e9mon turned towards the grass type, and one of them proceeded to charge at him. \"Woah!\" He yelped out as he backed away from the incoming attack. He stumbled back again as another proceeded to attack. \"What's the deal all of a sudden!?\" He yelled, hoping for some kind of answer. But the only response what that the floating Pok\u00e9mon were starting to surround him. Whoever they are, they're not friendly! I need to get out of here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to run away from the attacking Pok\u00e9mon into the small path in the forest. He ran as fast as he could, panting along the way. \"Somebody\u2026 Help!\" He screamed into the forest between gasps. He kept running along the path until he saw a figure walking through it. Over there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran closer to the walking figure he saw had a giant leaf on his head, a mask of grey with a pointed nose with short legs. The Snivy proceeded to halt right in front of the figure, panting madly in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what's wrong? What are you all in a fuss for?\" The Pok\u00e9mon in front of him spoke in concern. The grass type jumped in surprise, after hearing him speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid that Pok\u00e9mon just talk to me!? His mind yelled. The Pok\u00e9mon in front of him stepped back nervously. \"Woah! What did I do to you?! If then I'm mighty sorry!\" he said. \"I'm Nuzleaf! It's all right now, so just calm down,\" He tried calming the Snivy down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\u2026\" the grass type said, his mind calming down. Since I'm a Snivy, I guess I can understand Pok\u00e9mon! He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint rustling behind him caught both of their attention as the same three attacking Pok\u00e9mon caught up with the Snivy. Oh no! They followed me here?! He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floating Pokemon halted to flicker their hand once more at each other then attacked Robert again, causing him to jump back and Nuzleaf to step backward in surprise and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! What in the world?!\" Nuzleaf exclaimed. Another charge cause the both of them to reel back. \"Eek! I'm scared!\" The both of them turned around and ran deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to run until they reached an abnormally straight path, which caused Nuzleaf to halt and Robert to almost slip at the sudden stop. \"Why did we stop? They're still after us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of them mystery dungeons up ahead,\" Nuzleaf replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mystery dungeon?\" Robert questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuzleaf was about to answer his question until a faint \"Beheem!\" reached the pair's ears. \"Ahhh! There ain't no other way to go! Just follow me!\" He then proceeded to run into the straight path and Clyde followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even five minutes in this world and things are crazy! The grass type thought. I've been turned into a Snivy, and that's weird enough, but being attacked for no reason at all? Well, At least it isn't boring to say the least.</span></div></div>",

What happened? Why can't I remember anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes to see a _____________ standing over me, who immediately backs out as soon as I open my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake! Thank goodness!\" The _________ says to me, female by the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA talking Pokemon?... For some reason\u2026 this doesn't surprise me\u2026 Wait\u2026 I can feel some of my memories coming back\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where\u2026 where am I?\" I ask the ____________.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't know where you are?\" She asks me, tilting her head in confusion. \"You ended up on the beach here\u2026 you don't remember how you got here? Do you have amnesia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmnesia? Well, I guess I don't remember much at all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 I guess I might have had amnesia\u2026\" I reply. I try to get up, but my body refuses to let me stand on two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy can't I stand up? Wait\u2026 does this mean\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to get up on all fours, and succeed. I then look at the beach water, only to see the reflection of a Shinx stare back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've\u2026 I've turned into a Shinx!\" I say aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe _________just looks even more confused. \"'Turned into'?\" She questions. \"It shouldn't be strange that you're a Pokemon\u2026 You are in the Pokemon world after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than what seems to be my name, another major part of my identity comes back to me\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 Okay\u2026Well, you see\u2026\" Now I just need to explain this to the ____________ without trying to startle her too much. \"I\u2026 I know I didn't use to be a Pokemon\u2026 The only things I remember is that I remember my name and that I used to be a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A h-human?\" THe ___________  says, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's the pokemon that's worried about you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Darkness. Deep, black, dizzying darkness. Nothingness. Everything was black. The world had sunk away from her reach, and everything was gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was still black. Still dark. Still distant. But there was a slight buzzing noise now, like a waterfall or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes a little. Everything was dark and blurry. She felt sore and weak, really dizzy, and really tired. Not to mention the terrible, pounding headache that felt like her head was split in two. She tried to swallow but her throat was too dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrrrrgghh...wh-where am I...? She blinked, trying to get the dizziness to fade. She felt too disoriented to even think. I thought someone was calling me...but I'm not sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, and she could make out blurs of green and some blue. Her ears were ringing to go along with the roar of the waterfall. ...What's going on...? Ugh...I-I can't remember...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay there for a few minutes, trying to get her head to clear. She was starting to get her vision back, and while everything was still really blurry, she could tell she was in a lush forest-like place. There was a waterfall pretty close to her, judging by the coolness of the earth and the buzzing roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly coughed weakly, still confused. The coughing seemed to rouse her. \"W-where am I?\" she croaked hoarsely. With a squint she made out more details of her surroundings-green grass, rich soil, trees and sunshine. \"What is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke off, coughing again. \"Ugh...my head is pounding...\" She tried to think, but it made her head hurt more. Where was she? How had she even gotten here? She must have...wait, where was she last? Where was she even from? She shook her head again. Where do I come from? I can't remember! I must remember! It's me! I-wait, I don't even know what I do? Or who I am! I don't even know how old I am! I've forgotten everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't remember anything...\" She muttered, her voice still painfully rough. \"N-n-not even-...-not even my name!\" She gasped for air, panting a little, extremely confused. \"W-what's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm parched.\" She realized. Her thirst was intense, and she could barely speak. \"I-I need to find some water...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cloudy gaze flickered to the roaring blue waterfall. \"Oh, over there...\" She groaned, pulling herself to her feet. It took a few moments to remember how to move. She couldn't really balance properly, she was too dizzy. So she ended up half crawling, half stumbling dizzily until she felt the cool wetness of mud underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coughed again, and she leaned down and drank the water hungrily, letting the cool, delicious flow of the liquid touch her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she sank to the ground, eyes closed, and lay panting for awhile. Now that she had drunk, she felt much better. The headache was going away, and her senses and thinking were getting sharper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I feel alive again.\" She panted. \"T-that was incredibly delicious. Never has water tasted...so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a long sigh. She felt calmer now, and she was starting to calm down. \"Okay, calming down now...\" She murmured, relief replacing the confusion and panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes to look down at the water, it was sparkling like diamonds, the sun shining and the whole forest reflected on its smooth surface. And there was something else reflected on it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is that?\" She asked, staring down with her head tilted. \"I can see something reflected in the water...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned down, and ripples swarmed over the reflection, momentarily blurring the reflection. She crouched over the side of the pool patiently, watching as the ripples faded away to reveal the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened. Her jaw dropped. \"What!? W-what's going on?! C-could it be...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up at her was the shocked face of a silverish eevee with startled blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it even possible...? H-have become...a-a Pokemon?\" Artemis said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eevee started breathing in quick, panicked gasps, turning in circles and shaking her head. \"W-wh-why? I'm an eevee! A shiny eevee, for that matter!\" She stopped, panting, freaking out as she looked down at her blue-gray paws. She unsheathed her claws to hold herself steady, and then started freaking out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beheem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eevee turned as three odd Pokemon floated over to her. Beheeyem, She thought dully, taking a slow step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beheem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicker flicker flicker...(The little lights on the Beheeyems' hands flashed as they seemed to communicate silently)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-what is that? She thought in panic. She was already really panicked about being turned into an eevee, she didn't need this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one of the beheem knocked her sideways with an obvious attack. \"Whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shoved her away forcefully. \"What's the deal all of a sudden?\" She cried, panting. The three beheeyem surrounded her, their weird eyes oddly hostile. The eevee took a few cautionary steps backwards and ran into the woods, the three beheeyem pursuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran through the forest in terror, panting. \"S-somebody help!\" She called frantically, running as fast as she could. She twitched her ears and looked right. \"Oh! O-over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment, a nuzleaf was walking through the woods. He looked confused as the eevee skidded to a halt in front of him, gasping and panting. \"HELP!\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's wrong?\" He asked, tilting his head. \"What are you all in a fuss for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eevee's head snapped up, her eyes wide. D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-did that Pokemon just talk to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nuzleaf looked alarmed. \"Whoa! What did I do to you?\" He asked, still sounding confused. \"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eevee's alarm didn't go away. She was breathing quickly, her heart pounding. HE'S TALKING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...Calm down!\" the nuzleaf said, starting to get worried. \"I'm Jeffery! It's all right, so just calm down now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eevee obeyed, swallowing a deep breath of air and letting it out in a long sigh. However, her head was still spinning with panic. Okay...I'm an eevee now, so I guess I can understand Pokemon now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun around as the three beheeyem surrounded her and Jeffery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jeffery said, staring wide-eyed at the three beheeyem. \"Where'd you all come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicker Flicker Flicker...(The three beheeyem flashed their lights at each other)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the right swung a full-body attack at the eevee at once, knocking her sideways. She backed away against a tree, shivering with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Jeffery cried. \"What in the world!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle beheeyem smacked himself at the nuzleaf, knocking him back as well. \"Eek!\" Jefferey cried. \"I'm scared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Pokemon fled from the attacking group of beheem, sprinting through the woods in terror. Suddenly Jeffery stopped as they reached a narrow path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...!\" He cried, breathing heavily. \"Ain't that one of them Mystery Dungeons up ahead? Them places are supposed to be mighty dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behee! Behee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two terrified victims quickly glanced back. \"Ahhh!\" Jeffery cried. \"There ain't no other way to go! Brace yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eevee nodded, and the two of them raced into the dungeon.</span></div></div>",
