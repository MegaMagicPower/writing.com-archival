When he awoke he saw a group of individuals dressed in black. Among them was Prince Theodore dressed in black armor accompanied by panther who looked like she meant business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is this? Can someone please explain what this is for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you're awake. Now let's get to business. You will help us find the eye of Sarcous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never! I'll never help a power hungry tyrant like you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel hits Micah's pressure points. Micah starts suffocating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O... Okay... I'll help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel restores Micah's breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent to hear. If you refuse then I'll have Laurel execute you without a second thought. With the Eye of Sarcous my organization will truly have enough power to overthrow mother and her council members. Then I shall rule as king. Wahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get going Slim.\" One of the Shadow Knights said in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah grumbled to himself as he left the lair of the Shadow Knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he and Laurel set off the two didn't see eye to eye. Micah hated the fact that he didn't have a say in this. For years he knew that the royal family was corrupted, but he never imagined that the heir to the kingdom would want to kill his own mother. Despite the queen being a nasty witch she always took care of the army.

Micah gives a sigh of relief as he finds it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good now we're one step closer to fulfilling Lord Theodore's goal.\" Laurel in a surprisingly soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah was expecting Laurel to sound menancing as opposed to seductive, but since she is a trained assassin he should probably be on his guard. The two adventurers set off on the S.S. Girtha. That night a strange storm rolled in. Instead of rain, chocolate fell from the sky. Micah looks at the sight in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possible. You see Navoon was enchanted by Sarcous to be the most magical place on earth.\" Said a muscular dragon dressed in attire common to both a magician and warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Zarnok Billows. I'm here to study this land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool. Do you know any spells that can make certain people vanish.\" Micah said referring to Laurel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess girl troubles. I'm sure you're overreacting. Your girlfriend looks like a nice woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah gasps at the fact that people thought Laurel was his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not my girlfriend. She's a trained assassin who will kill me in a blink of an eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZarnok starts laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, for a knight you sure do have a sense of humor.

Little by little, his bags were carried off of the small barely sea worthy vessel docked at port. He watched bemused as his brother stumbled with a heavy bag of \"tools\" from the boat onto the dock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey would it kill you to help?\" said Jim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I paid for the boat you carry the luggage.\" Gabriel replied and took another bite from his apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on give me a break here, most of this is your junk anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That so called junk is our livelihood, I think you should pay it a little respect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim rolled his eyes and lugged the bags along. \"How about you, I don't know, get a job?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers began to walk to the nearest inn as the sun slowly began to settle into the horizon. Gabriel slid his hands into his pockets and watched the lazy town settle. It seemed rather ordinary, unsettlingly ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this works we won't ever need to worry about anything ever again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know this how?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just do, eavesdropping is one of my special skills.\" Gabriel took a few more bites of his apple and discarded the spent core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if this goes wrong?\" Jim frowned concerned. \"What if you end up in jail, or worse, dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please you think I'm going to screw up <i>the</i> biggest job of a lifetime? I've researched the town from top to bottom, all possible escapes, all possible places to hide. And if it makes you feel better there's people here that owe me favors. I always make sure somebody somewhere owes me a favor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim kept his mouth shut the rest of the way, knowing inside that the conversation was going nowhere fast. Lanterns were lit outside homes as the town eased into a lazy calm. Just outside of the Inn they could hear the idle chatter of travelers lodging there for the night. Gabriel sifted inside his homely looking satchel for a few gold coins and ventured inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inn was empty for the most part, most people there were unassuming and engaged in esoteric conversations together. This worried Gabriel slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabe, I don't mean to rain on any parades, but for a town rumored to have that treasure you're looking for, it doesn't seem people are clamoring to get here.\" Jim whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we beat the crowd here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped they had only beaten the crowd. Gabriel stepped up to the bar and set his coins out in front of him. The bartender instantly took notice and quickly went to greet his new customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How may I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just need a room for a few nights.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, might I interest you in buying some food or drinks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good.\" The vulpine nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about your friend here?\" The bartender gestured to Jim. \"He want anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim licked his lips and looked at Gabe. \"If you don't mind Gabe I think I'll hang out here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriel smirked a little and grabbed his bags. \"Well alright I'll just be in the room. Enjoy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly lugged his supplies upstairs and left his brother to keep all of the attention. Hopefully he wouldn't have too much to drink and blow his friendly facade. Quietly he searched his bags for a hood and several tools. Lock picks, multi-purpose knives, smoke bombs, and various other tools of the trade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go to work...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gabriel pulled a hood over his head and slipped a dark blue balaclava over his muzzle. He decided his best course of action was to figure out just what exactly he was up against. Rumors had brought him to the town of Kotora after all. The lithe fox opened the bedroom's window and crawled on through. His hooded cloak flapped in the sea borne winds. Gabriel peeked at the ground and then back up. His breathing hastened. This was always his least favorite part of his nightly excursions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gathering his courage, Gabriel readied his legs. He counted down from three. Taking each breath deeper than the last. On \"one,\" he leaped from the window. For a moment he was suspended in free fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid. I'm not going to fall.\" Said Gabriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis throat felt hoarse. His lips were dry. Yet he knew he was going to make it. He had to believe it. Wind picked up behind him. Warmth enveloped him as his plain looking cloak caught the wind. No longer in free fall, he began to glide towards the next roof top on the magical gust of wind. Within a few seconds, his paws landed atop another roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first leap was always the hardest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a hundred more times and I'm done.\" Said Gabriel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief jumped from roof top to roof top. More nimble and swift with each jump. From the market district to the aristocrat district he went. Gabriel's last journey to this place had been an invited one. He hoped they didn't mind him stopping by unannounced. Just when he thought he had gotten a feel for the jumps, the buildings had grown twice in size. Yet he persevered still. Fleeting dreams of riches and power filled his mind. No more scrounging for food. No more death defying leaps of faith. Whatever the Orb had in store for him, he wanted it. No matter the cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriel managed to reach the property of one Silus Mill. A rich senator with a seat high up in parliament. His chambers appeared to be empty from the courtyard. Perhaps he could bribe a servant into talking. The fox crept through past the trimmed hedges at the front of the Mill Manor house and around the side. Silus' servants were busy at work it seemed. Most looked too tired to stand. Gabriel smiled behind his balaclava. Getting by them would be no issue at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clambered through an open window by the service entrance of the manor house. The fox found himself in the middle of an ornate hall. Purple was the dominate color every where he turned. Drapes, carpet, wallpaper. Gold framed portraits of Silus adorned the walls. Ever vain, the dog morph in the pictures was painted in the poses of gods. His brow always stern and his body always naked. Copious amounts of artistic license had been taken on portraying his musculature, among other enlarged bits of anatomy. Gabriel scoffed and kept on walking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm in.\" Whispered Gabriel. \"Now just to find-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere on the opposite end of the hall stood a maid. Gabriel froze in place. This was it. He was going to get caught. Thrown in jail. Beheaded. Forced into public service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in the dining room, just take a right down this hall, can't miss it. His safe combination is 27-9-94. If you are thinking of poisoning him, his favorite wine is the Champerello. Whatever you do, I don't care. I quit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid threw down a towel. It hit the ground with a thick plop noise. Gabriel covered his mouth a little while the maid brushed past him. He stood still and tried to reflect on what just happened. Dumb luck was on his side once again. In no time at all, Gabriel was standing in perhaps the shiniest dining room he had ever seen in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suza? Come back to say sorry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirtless dog did not even bother to turn around. He just kept stuffing his face. Gabriel could not even begin to react at what he saw. Silus had changed quite a bit since they had last met. While the dog was merely plump last they met, now the only thing one could describe as \"plump\" on the engorged senator were his fingers. Large ponderous rolls sagged over the arm rests, while his fat neck wobbled with each bite of food. Either he was shirtless because none would fit or he was still clinging to some sort of denial that he looked like his portraits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe she just quit, and threw in the towel, so to speak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well damn. You know how hard it is to find a good toweling servant around here?\" Said Silus. \"You the replacement then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated dog let out a belch and continued to stuff his face. Gabriel rolled his eyes and drew his dagger. He walked slowly towards the dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Doesn't seem you recognize me much either.\" Said Gabriel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I do...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox grabbed the senator's meaty shoulder and held the dagger to his throat. Silus yelped and squirmed in his seat, but he was much too fat to do anything. How he survived the political battlefield so long was a mystery to Gabriel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you recognize this then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever sent you, I promise I can pay you double, triple, hell quadruple if it's cheap enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While that offer is tempting, I'm still rather offended you don't recognize me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriel walked in front of Silus and stabbed his dagger into the large bird he had been devouring. The dog furled his brow a bit, then nodded with realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Flying Fox! Why it's been five years now! I can't believe you're still alive.\" Said Silus. \"Did you have to do the whole assassin act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I'd need a bigger knife to get through that blubber.\" Said Gabriel. \"But I'm not here for chit chat, you owe me a debt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short pause, and a look of confusion on the dog's face. Then he began to laugh with hearty fervor. Sending ripples upon ripples through his fattened body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I owe you nothing, thief. If anything, you're lucky I didn't turn you in after I sustained my position.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so it seems that not only has your power gone straight to your waist, it's stuffed that head of yours too.\" Said Gabriel. \"I let you get away with it, Silus. You were useless to me until you gained power anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes. You forget, I have a certain incriminating will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I destroyed it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fake one of course.\" Said Gabriel. \"If that will falls into the right hands. Then you can kiss this lap of luxury goodbye.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admire your cunning, thief.\" Said SIlus. \"So what is it then? You need a pardon? Money?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The eye of Sarcous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the dog let out a hearty laugh. Gabriel folded his arms and kicked Silus in the shin. The dog gasped out a yelp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does a whelp like you want with Sarcous?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do know about it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. You think I'd let such a powerful little trinket evade my eyes and ears?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear it's in town.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilus shrugged and took a bite from the fat bird on his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partially true. It is on its way to town. The location changes every month.\" Said Silus. \"A secret circle of Mages called 'Sarcous' Acolytes'  transports it to different safe houses across the empire. It will be in town by the end of the month.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll sneak in and get it. No problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't underestimate them. They are trained in Sarcous secret techniques. You would be dead in an instant if you get caught.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps with some smoke and lights, I could ambush them on the road. Grab the eye in the confusion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not recommended.\" Said Silus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you recommend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infiltration. I've been studying up on these Acolytes for awhile now. If we can replicate the appearance of a member by the end of the month. Then you can snag the eye during the transaction.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...Acolytes have a very particular look to them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say, if I were more skilled in magic than politics, I could fit the role of grand master.\" Silus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe emphasized his girth by grasping it with his paws. Gabriel sighed and weighed his options. He did say power at any cost after all...</span></div></div>",

The sight revolted Gabriel, but he kept himself from turning away. He would not let this poor excuse of a senator see him flinch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha! You'll need to change your name to the 'Jiggling Fox', heh! I have to say, I relish the thought of you trading in your nimble quickness for cumbersome thickness. Are you sure you'll be able to go through with it, thief?\u201d Silus cupped a chubby paw underneath his several chins and scratched lightly, his brow raised as he waited with glee to hear Gabriel's lament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wait, you thought that -<b>I</b>- was...?\u201d, Gabe stopped mid-sentence and let out a short guffaw. He began walking around the large couch and heading towards the exit. Silus blinked in confusion, stammering unintelligibly before yelling out to the thief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold up! You said you were going to do it! How do you think you'll infiltrate the Acolytes without bulking up, you stupid thief?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriel stopped at the doorway of the dining room, and replied without looking back. \u201cI heard you, you pathetic waste of flesh. Blah blah, gain weight to infiltrate the circle of Mages, yadda yadda...doesn't have to be -me- though, does it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that he headed to the window he had come in from and ducked through it, disappearing into the shadows as Silus wasted his breath yelling curses at the Flying Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been around an hour since Gabriel had left his little brother alone at the portside inn. He was glad to see everything seemed to be in order as he stalked up to the front entrance. No broken windows, no yelling bargoers, and thankfully no Jim laying down in the mud with a broken nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he had some self-control tonight,\u201d Gabriel spoke to himself. \u201cOr...he's passed out in a pool of his own vomit.\u201d He was hoping for the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox pulled down his balaclava and hood and opened the door to the inn, relieved to see that Jim was right where he had left him. Gabe strode into the inn, noting there were fewer denizens than before, but those that remained were either drunk and drinking or sleeping. The fox pressed forward and clapped a paw on Jim's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I'm back from my walk. Did you get enough to-...\u201d Gabriel paused and stared at Jim's evening meal...or, rather, the remains. Well, technically, not even remains...Jim was still working on his third plate of odds-and-ends. Gabe wouldn't even try to guess how many drinks he had already guzzled down. With a sigh, he sat in the stool next to his glutton of a brother, waiting on Jim to notice he was there. Apparently his brother was too drunk to feel a clap on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Hurk...mmm....hnngh....sho good...hic!\u201d Jim finally swallowed and blinked his eyes lazily, his head turning to look at Gabe with a squinted gaze. <br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey...who...you w-want...you want shomethin'?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>By the gods</i>\u201d, thought Gabriel. \u201c<i>He's completely clueless. He's drunk himself stupid</i>!\u201d The sly fox grinned slightly as he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho, me? Oh, well, I was just wanting to buy you another plate, my friend! Surely you must have worked hard today to have such a great hunger! I would be glad to help sate your appetite. The hard working deserve the most praise, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe watched as his drunken brother worked through the offer in his hazy head, eventually realizing the offer meant more food. A big smile appeared on Jim's face and he nodded eagerly, giggling with glee as he watched Gabe slap some gold coins down onto the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarkeep!

Sure, his brother had always been a bit heavy, and honestly he might not even mind gaining a few more pounds.

Gabe's mouth twisted upward in a smile as he decided this was the right course of action after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his fingers impatiently for the hefty barkeep to bring another plate of food over, earning himself a baleful glare in the process.  He slid a few extra coins across with the payment for that one, he'd need this place, and likely any other food seller in the city, if he was going to make this plan work in only a few weeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe glanced at Jim's bloated stomach, his brother had put on a bit of weight in the last few months, but not nearly enough for him to pass for a Mage of Sarcous, 'I may have to resort to magic...' Gabe found himself thinking, especially when he noticed Jim slowing down halfway through the new plate of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jim-bo, sure you've had enough?  I don't want my little brother going hungry now, especially not in this cold.\" Gabe said, clapping his somewhat chubby brother on the shoulder as he said it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gettin...*urp*...too full, Gabe...I don- *hic*, think I can eat anymore...\" Jim burbled out, leaning back in the chair, groaning a bit.  Gabe now saw his brother's domed out stomach clearly for the first time.  It looked like Jim had swallowed a bowling ball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, c'mon, you gotta at least finish these plates.\" Gabe said cajolingly, beginning to feel dismayed.  'I'm definitely going to have to resort to magic...' He thought as his little brother gamely went back to stuffing the food into his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Gabe's subtle encouragement, and a belly rub which Gabe gave very reluctantly, Jim managed to eat every scrap of food on the two plates.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe helped his brother down off of the stool he was sitting at and half-carried him to one of the rooms they'd rented.  All the while thinking how he was going to manage to get a hold of some magic that would help him fatten Jim up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should...</span></div></div>",

I wonder who it was that found that 'Sarcous' eye' anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure we can find plenty of information here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood before a tavern, which was brimming with people. The hustle and bustle caused by the rumor of someone finding a long-lost sorcerer's pendant had caused many adventurers, both seasoned and new, to come out of where ever they hid to find the pendant. The two opened the door and entered, seeing the tavern filled with many patrons, either drinking, rough-housing, throwing darts, or even just sitting around their tables. Baz, the young sword-master, puffed up his chest with pride, wanting to look as tough and intimidating as he could. With his light leather armor and sword, he strode inside along with his sister. Saz is a competent spell-weaver, able to cast spells of the four major element of nature. With book in hand, and flowing green robes on, she walked closely beside her brother. The two were twin siblings, both otters. Around the age of 18, they set out from their home town in search of adventure. With the spreading news of the 'discovered' Sarcous' eye, they saw it as the perfect adventure to go on. In case you're wondering why the two are so young, let's just say that they're care-free, happy-go-lucky, and very naive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Saz, there's a lot of people in here.\" Baz said, turning to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Baz. I wonder if they're all like us.\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first thing's first. We should go get something to drink.\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat adjacent to each other at the counter as the bartender was cleaning another mug. The burly wolf anthro eyed them before approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what can I get you two?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some apple juice, if you've got any.\" Baz ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a tall glass of milk?\" Saz ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf eyed them again before getting their drinks ready. As he set the two down, he smiled as he leaned on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you two a little young to be adventures?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes we are.\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for asking.\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf chuckled as the twins downed their drinks. With their thirst quenched, Baz set down a few gold coins, which the wolf pocketed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any particular reason why you are out adventuring at such a young age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we always wanted to set out on an exciting journey!\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we heard about this Sarcous' eye thing being found, we thought it was the perfect adventure to go on!\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh, every damn adventurer is out and about, thanks to the rumor. You two will obviously find some competition on your way. It'd be better if you two just give up and find a smaller prize to look for.\" the wolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? N-no! We agreed to go on this one!\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! We may have just started out, but we're going to see it through to the end!\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was both mildly surprised, and rather impressed by the twins' bravery, or stupidity. He chuckled lightly as he returned to cleaning used mugs.</span></div></div>",

They weren't rich, they weren't particularly well armed. They were just a couple of kids with a few skills to their name. It reminded him of better times, before his crippled leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this here town has a rich history. Perhaps you should check the library for a little info. I suggest occult and wizardry. It's off limits to tourists, but you can get in with this.\" He said. The wolf pulled a ring from his finger and dropped it in Baz's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaz weighed it in his hand a little. It was quite heavy, for such a small object. The band was encrusted with precious gems, and the center stone was surrounded by an intricate insignia.  In fact the band itself was quite odd. Gnarled and twisted like the roots of an ancient oak. Baz looked up at the bartender, but he was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where'd he go?\" Baz said, panicking a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, he went to take care of those guys over there while you were oogling that ring.\" Saz replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaz smirked a little and slid the ring on his finger. He was shocked at just how loose it was. It dangled ever so slightly off of his ring finger. He slid the ring off of his finger and placed it into his pocket. It would be safer there, he figured. With that business taken care off, he stretched and stood from his seat. Ready to leave. Saz grabbed his arm and pulled him back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a minute. You see that guy over there?\" Saz gestured to a hooded figure in the corner of the bar. Staring at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he's good news.\" Saz frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, just because he looks scary doesn't mean he is. You shouldn't profile like that.\" Baz tried to stand again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he saw us get that ring. What if he tries to take it from us?\" Saz whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we fight back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he's really tough?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we run.\" Baz dragged his sister up. from her seat. \"Let's get to that library he was talking about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooks surrounded them left and right and towered above them in heavy oak book cases. Some were pamphlet thin, others were doorstop thick. The librarian glanced over his desk at the twins. Long, spidery limbs reached around to grab at books laying out upon the hard wood desk. He cleared his throat a little and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No such section of this library exists. I'm sorry to say you have been given false information.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the bartender said it was here, look I have the ring to prove it.\" Baz pulled the ring from his pocket and held it up for the librarian to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lanky elder adjusted his glances and rolled his eyes. If he had a gold piece for every time Argo gave someone else his own membership ring, he would not be a librarian. The librarian grasped the ring from Baz's hand and placed it in his pocket. Grumbling as he grabbed a ring of keys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should just revoke his membership...\" The librarian said under his breath. Just loud enough for the twins to hear. \"This is the last time I let just any ragamuffin kids into stuff like this. They knock everything out of place and get things sticky.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're 18, not 12.\" Said Saz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And no respect for their elders...\" He removed a few books from their perch and pulled the shelves down. Leaving a door in their place. The librarian fumbled with the key ring and unlocked the door. It creaked and moaned as it opened, Saz felt as if she was staring into the maw of some beast. The darkness seemed to go on forever. She conjured a small ball of light and watched it float around her. Hopefully that would be enough light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Both twins said before dashing inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long they...</span></div></div>",

It's like we're inside some kind of ice-monster's stomach...\" Saz said, clinging closely to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb of eldrich light floating above them glowed brightly, but brought no warmth to their water-proof fur and skin. Baz hung an arm over his sister as he held her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sis, just...Imagine that we're in a dungeon, searching for untold treasure! And best of all, it will contain books that can tell us where to find the Eye of Sarcous!\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, that's right...That's right! And no monster will stop the terrible twins!\" Saz said, finally feeling relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued down their trek until the stairs ended, the floor leveling out. They continued to peer down the hall, unable to see anything beyond the engulfing darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the only way is forward.\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two walked on. After what felt like days to them (it was really just 15 minutes), the passage widened out, and the two continued walking on in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baz...I'm getting...A bad feeling here.\" Saz said, clingy closely to her brother again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Don't worry, maybe this place is just the...Storage room?\" Baz suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, he was just as unsure as Saz was. Soon, the passage behind them disappeared as well, swallowed up by the darkness of the underground. The two stopped walking, looking back at where they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where did the exit go?\" Saz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh...Don't worry, it's still there...\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you won't make it there...\" a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness was suddenly expelled as the entire room became brightly lit as a sunny day. All around them, they saw various robed figures glaring at them. One of them moved to stand at the exit, blocking it. Baz and Saz stood back-to-back, sword raised and magic at the ready. There must've been about a dozen of them! Two dozen, even!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are intruders like you doing in the secret halls of the Sokrass Guild!?\" one of the robed figures asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we were looking for information about this rumor, about the Sarcous-something!\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! The bartender gave us a ring and told us to go to the library. We showed the ring, and the librarian guy let us come here.\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robed figures looked back at each other, moaning things like \"Argo again\" or \"Why does this keep happening!?\" The figure who spoke to them approached the two, removing the hood to reveal a male red panda anthro, looking to be about his mid-40s. He had a somewhat rough-looking face, but was still good-looking. \"Sorry about that. Argo, the bartender who led you here, is a member of ours. The problem with him is that he keeps allowing complete strangers here, just because they happen to be spirited adventurers. Honestly, half of our members joined us only because they were led here, just like you two.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaz and Saz lowered their armaments as they calmed down. \"Oh. So, does this mean that we're going to have to join too?\" Baz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you two came here to learn about something related to magic and wizardry. The only way you will be allowed to search through our archives is if you are members.\" the red panda explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So, I guess that means we'll be joining anyway, then.\" Saz concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you two seem to be rather calm. Very well. To join, you must make a vow to never reveal these secrets to anyone outside of the Sokrass Guild. First, your names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. My name is Baz, and this here is my twin sister Saz.\" Baz said, holding Saz's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" The guild members then converged on the two, forming a circle around them. The red panda then held out a hand to the two, speaking in a tone similar to when the twins first arrived. \"Otter Baz, and otter Saz. Do you swear to uphold our laws, never to breath a word of our knowledge to those of outside the Guild? To share your knowledge with us, your brothers and sisters? And lastly, to accept any punishment should you ever betray us?\" the red panda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we vow to uphold your laws.\" Baz said confidently. \"Me too!\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. You two are now official members of the Sokrass Guild. Remember this day, and never tell of our secrets to outsiders.\" the red panda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the members left the room, passing through one of the walls. Baz was amazed to see it, until Saz told him that it must've been an illusionary spell, making a wall appear there, when there was no wall at all. The member came back, carrying a pillow with two rings that look exactly the same as the one Argo the bartender gave them. Baz and Saz took one each, wearing it on their ring fingers. However, they were a little loose. With this little ceremony over, the other members took off their hoods, revealing their own faces to the two. There were quite a number of anthros there, including a blue-scaled dragon, a raven, and one that looked like a white shark. The red panda mumbled something as the walls all shimmered and melted away, revealing a large library that looked as big as the one on the surface. the various members began going about in their own business, either chatting with each other or reading a book. The red panda was the only one who remained with Baz and Saz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, we don't get fancy robes?\" Saz said, mindlessly pulling at her own green robes. Her robes looked old and worn out compared to the members' robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are home-made. Now, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rasputin, although everyone here calls me Raz. I am the guild master, which basically makes me the leader. Now that you two are members, you are welcome to peruse through our books and scrolls.\" Raz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well thank you very much Raz, sir! But, we only came here to learn more about this Sarcous' Eye thing.\" Baz said. \"Yeah! We thought that this would be the perfect journey! So we decided that finding this Sarcous thingy will mark our first step as adventurers!\" Saz said eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you mean to say that you two are still novices?\" Raz asked, slightly dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technically, yes...\" Baz admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I suggest that, for the sake of your lives, you search elsewhere for your first adventure. The Eye of Sarcous is too dangerous for novice adventurers such as yourselves.\" Raz said, turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We agreed to set out for this, and we're going to stick to it!\" Baz said, getting worked up. \"We didn't leave our hometown just to turn our tails and run like cowards! We're gonna stick to this journey, and we'll stick to it until it's finished!\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Perhaps, Argo may have seen something in you two after all...Very well. Roger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven anthro looked up from his scroll before walking up to them. \"Yes Raz? You need me for something?\" he asked. \"Roger, fill these two in on what we know of the Eye of Sarcous. I will...Fetch something from the vault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Raz left them. Roger looked at the two newest members, who just smiled and waved at him. Roger rolled his eyes and told them to follow him. They went to a nearby table and told them to sit and wait, which the twins did. Roger began going through several books in one of the shelves, finally pulling out the one he wanted and set it in front of the two. It was thick, or should've been. The cover was meant for thicker tomes, but the book itself only had several pages in it, and most were really old and worn-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took the guild quite a few years of searching to find this, and find this we did. This is a journal kept by one of the mage companions of Sarcous himself.\" Roger said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is from one of this Sarcous guy's friends? Then they must know about the guy himself!\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but sadly, it was badly damaged when the mage disappeared. It contains a few things about what Sarcous researched. Here...\" Roger opened the book, showing a page that showed a very unrecognizable creature. It was humanoid in shape, and had something that looked like clothing. \"This is a picture of Sarcous himself. The only picture, in the entire world. And here...\" Roger flipped the book to a page with a picture of a pendant. It had some kind of eye on it. \"This is the Eye of Sarcous, what you two are looking for. You see, it's believed that Sarcous found magic meant only for gods and immortals. When he disappeared, this pendant and a message were the only things left behind. 'The eye will lead you to the orb' it said. So now, we search for this Orb of Sarcous, and use its power to better this world. That is the purpose of the Sokrass guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger closed the book, leaving the twins in awe. Raz soon returned, wearing something over his robe. The twins looked at it, and it looked like the pendant in the book!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...\" Baz said. \"The Eye thingy?\" Saz asked. Raz nodded his head. \"Yes, that is correct. We have indeed found the actual pendant. However, no matter how hard we tried to keep it a secret, there is just no stopping the rumors from spreading. But when we obtain the Orb of Sarcous, then we can use its power to heal this world from its suffering.\" Raz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool...So, where is the Orb?\" Baz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, allow me to explain...\" Raz began. \"We found out that, in a place where there is a high concentration of magic, we can use the pendant to take us to where the orb hides.\"</span></div></div>",

They were almost squealing at each other, unable to wait for the time to come. Raz and Roger just looked at the two, unsure if they were mentally ill or not. They were about to ask when they suddenly looked up to Raz and exploded with a series of questions about what will happen. Raz managed to calm them down long enough to tell them that he has no idea what will happen once they use the pendant. Even so, Baz and Saz began imagining what will happen when the time comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a huge door will open up!\" \"Yeah, and it'll take us to a room filled with all kinds of cool things! Like a bunch of spell books!\" \"Or a dozen swords made of solid gold!\" \"Or a pile of scrolls big enough to fill up the guild!\" \"Or even a mountain of treasure! We'd all be rich!\" \"Yeah! And maybe, everyone in the village will see how right we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaz and Saz gave a content sigh as they began remembering their village. Everyone tried to talk them out of the adventuring business, but they were too dead-set on it. They finally relented and allowed them to go off on their own. They even saw them off as they left the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that last part about your village?\" Roger asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Well, everyone back in the village said that we're getting too full of ourselves, wanting to go on a grand adventure.\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But once we complete this adventure, we'll show them that we have what it takes! We aren't just a couple of kids way over our heads!\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, we're 18...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaz just smiled and reminded them that their first adventure won't start until tomorrow. He then led the two through the library, reaching a door. There, he opened it and revealed a large room full of beds. This must be where the guild members sleep in. Raz told them that they can take the two beds by the window. Baz and Saz then walked up to the two beds, setting their stuff down on it. Raz told them that they're free to do as they please until then, leaving the two by themselves. Baz and Saz looked out the window, seeing the sun still high up in the sky. With that, they decided to spend the time getting to know the other members of the guild. They started out with Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Roger. We were wondering...Have you always been a member of this guild?\" Baz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, yes. I joined the guild when I was studying Sarcous and I first found the old journal I showed you earlier. I guess you may consider me as the co-founder, alongside Raz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, cool! Well, alright. See you later!\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two moved on to getting to know the other members. They talked with the blue dragon, who was named Dorcas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, were you always a member of the guild?\" Saz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. I'm an adventurer, like you two. I've been traveling for at least a year by now, and I wound up here thanks to the rumor, and that bartender Argo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was adventuring like, then?\" Baz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was fun! I got to fight bandits, explore dungeons, solve traps and riddles, it was the life! Though a lot of times, I do miss the town I left behind. I don't regret it, really. I'm sure they miss me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaz and Saz nodded to each other as they moved on. They began talking to the white shark. His name was Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Marcus...Were you an adventurer like us?\" Baz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Except I've only been adventuring for about a few months. I've explored a dungeon or two, but that's about it. Wound up here thanks to a 'fateful' visit at the tavern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're still pretty new to adventuring then?\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Not as green-horned as you two, of course, but I still don't know that much. Anyway, shouldn't you two be reading a book or something? You'll wanna know what we're facing when tomorrow comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaz and Saz looked at each other before bidding Marcus goodbye. They talked about Marcus having a point, so they looked at the vast collection of books in the library. They both took a book to read, flipping through the pages. Baz was reading some mage's study of Sarcous, and why his research is actually fake, or something. Saz managed to pick out a spell book, and was now looking through the vast number or spells she could learn to use. The two spent hours reading through their books, not noticing the time they've spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two, I think it's time to rest.\" Raz said, walking up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh? How long have we been reading?\" Baz asked, rubbing his tired eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, several hours. It's already sunset, and we all have to get up early tomorrow. We wouldn't want you two to sleep through it, now would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're right! Saz, come on! We need to get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just a minute! I need to know how to speak the incantation for this flame-pillar spell.\" Saz said, still reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you've taken quite a liking to our spell books, young mage? You can bring that to bed, if you wish. Just remember not to overdo it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks Raz!\" Saz said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed to the sleeping area, seeing some of the members already on their beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some members want to stay in the guild. Others prefer sleeping in the town's inn. With over a dozen members, it's understandable some of them want privacy.\" Roger said, looking up from his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaz and Saz slipped into their beds. Baz looked out the window, seeing the last traces of sunset before night fully sets in. Saz was still reading through the spell book, muttering some incantations under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Baz, check this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaz extended her arm out before muttering something. Baz looked on expectantly as her hand glew red. Suddenly, a pillar of fire shot out, scorching the ceiling. Roger, along with every other member present, looked at her. Saz coughed a bit as she apologized before closing the spell book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Saz, bedtime.\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two otters were shook awake as Roger stood before them. They rubbed the sleep out of their eyes as they looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? I want five more minutes...\" Baz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ceremony's about to start! Raz will use the Eye of Sarcous to open the gateway! Right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shook them fully awake. They scrambled to tget their stuff ready as they followed Roger to the center of the guild. There, everyone was standing behind Raz as he held his arms out to his sides. He looked back to see the last three arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good of you to arrive. I told you two to go to sleep early.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry. We were so excited, we couldn't get much sleep.\" Saz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright. Now, we will begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaz began muttering a long string of arcane words, the kind that only mages like Saz could understand. The pendant around his neck began to glow as an orb of light appeared in front of everyone. The orb grew larger and larger, pulling itself wider until a glowing, swirling portal appeared in front of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone prepared?\" Raz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were murmurs of approval as they stared into the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Let us go retrieve the orb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, everyone stepped through...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two figures, adorned in simple leather armour, weapons at the ready, stood back to back in a warzone. Not your traditional setting for such fanfare mind you, at a humble townsquare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe township of Katora was under attack! It had been for several days now. How quickly it had turned from a quaint and picturesque home for the moderately rich and educated into a twisting pile of fire and rubble would astound the most hardened warrior. The place was anarchy! All the civilians that could flee had done so, brutish thugs pillaged houses and clashed on the street constantly, enterprising bandits were smuggling weapons and claiming territory, while thieves treated the place like a playground. Any poor guard still standing were running around like headless chickens just trying to keep themselves alive, waiting for the cavalry from the capital to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two figures in the townsquare were none of those things. Rubin and Crom, travelling hunters, red kangaroo and white rabbit, they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>\r\nFriends since childhood, they enjoyed a simple life of fishing and sometimes slaying minor wild monsters, living for months in the seclusion of nature, though nothing made them more cheerful than returning to their home village to see friends and family, and to get drunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir drunken antics were the cause of why these two had not made a hasty leave as soon as the conflict started, like so many others. Locked up for disturbing the peace and brawling (each other), they were unlucky enough to be put behind bars just before all the pandemonium started, and woke up to find a grisly scene had become of their warden, who had the key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent two days behind bars, and soon feared they might perspire of thirst if not for some stupid bandit who entered the jail to loot it, and was tricked into opening the cell door by their combined jeers and taunts about his portly visage. Even in their weakened state and without weapons they adeptly took out the fat thug. Crom, the more serious and thoughtful type, thought it might be best to off him, but Rubin, the more cocky and relaxed one, felt it was morally wrong to do in a collapsed enemy, even if he did just try to kill them. So they looted his swords, left him in the cell, locked it, and threw the key through the bars into the waste bucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they kept low, broke into a nearby pie shop that seemed mostly untouched by the madness, and managed to find some supplies in there and recovered for a few hours. After having starved for days both hunters abandoned sensible restraint and ate stale abandoned food until they were both sickly bloated. But it was better than being hungry they agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they heard a noise, and quickly figured out their hidout was not actually abandoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey readied their weapons, though anxious, neither feeling ready to battle so soon after their gorging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smug feminine laugh was heard, but its origins not seen, \u201cLay down your dinky weapons silly boys, if I wanted to smite you I\u2019d have killed you each before I\u2019d come inside.\u201d A black arrow shot from the darkness of an upstairs loft, it hit the wooden floor by Rubin\u2019s feet and he let out an embarrassing yelp as he hopped away. \u201cI- uh, state your business then! Or let us leave!\u2026 please?\u201d Crom spoke, trying to not let intimidation creep into his words, but knowing he was at this shadow girl\u2019s mercy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI choose neither\u201d she flatly refused, \u201cI don\u2019t dignify petty thieves like you with my mission.\u201d She shot another arrow, it flew in-between Crom\u2019s long ears, intentionally missing, and it was Crom\u2019s turn to foolishly duck and cower while whimpering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u2026 but I don\u2019t intend to kill you\u2026 not directly anyway\u2026\u201d the figure spoke again, deliberately pacing her words in a slow and chilling manner, \u201cdo you simpletons even know why there is such calamity that has befallen Katora?... No of course you wouldn\u2019t\u2026 an artefact\u2026 of great value\u2026 was recently discovered here\u2026 the fools\u2026 put it on display\u2026 heh heh heh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh get on with it!!\u201d Rubin finally yelled out, his fear being replaced by impatience.<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet Rabbit\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m not a bloody rabbit! HE\u2019s a rabbit lady, I\u2019m a proper kanga-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d An arrow shot out dangerously close to Rubin\u2019s neck, and Rubin shut up. <br>\r\n\u201cAnyway simpletons, I will let you live, but you must deliver an item for me- and don\u2019t get any ideas of stealing it or running off because it\u2019s hexed!<br>\r\nTake this letter to the grand library, heh, the place were the pendant was stored, it is where a great bandit leader is. The letter is for him. He\u2019s\u2026 a wild one\u2026 heh\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll let you live if he receives it quickly and in one piece\u2026 if anyone stops you say you\u2019re a messenger from Perralace, that may save you\u2026\u201d for a brief moment the woman leaned out of the shadows and their hunters saw a beautiful jaguar woman before she concealed her face with a purple scarf and turned to leave out the loft window into the night, \u201cnow go thieves\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as was established at the start, at the town square, under the threat of hex, Rubin and Crom have a package to deliver before they can get out of this crazy town. The town square stands opposite the great Katora Library, now half smouldering ruins, half bandit encampment. The grim threat of walking into that den seems almost as bad as any hex, even making the hunters pause to consider.</span></div></div>",

They were lucky to have attracted minimal attention on their way here, only a few times having to defend against wayward attackers and once escaping a gang of nasty warriors down some side streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now was how would they get inside?  The place was heavily guarded by devious looking rouges, all camped outside the perimeter, \u201cguarded\u201d being a term used very loosely. They were drinking, fighting and singing old pub songs like they were having a wild party, neither Crom nor Rubin wanted to approach, but at least these guys seemed less bloodthirsty than the average cutthroat they\u2019d see so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrom tucked his sword into his belt and held his arms up, palms open to show he was no thread as he hailed them. \u201cHey! Hallo! I need too, ehn\u2026 I need to speak to whoever is in charge here!\u201d he yelled, grabbing everyone\u2019s attention. The festive attitude instantly dissipated as angry bandits glared at the intruders with hate and weariness. Rubin counted at least three crossbows pointed at him, he could feel a nervous sweat on his brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monolithic tiger man stood up, arm clutching a spiked club and heavy shield, wearing nothing but battlescars over his muscular chest, \u201cWhat inspires two runts like you to approach the fearsome Basalt Brigand Gang, do you have a death wish?\u201d He finished with a menacing growl that sent shivers up Crom\u2019s spine, \u201cI-I\u2026 have a delivery! Oh I was sent by Porice... Pearlice?\u2026 Perralace!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Crom spit out her name the great tiger man\u2019s expression softened, then he burst out with raucous laughter! \u201cHAHAHA-Hahaha, surely another soppy love letter for Herc no doubt, well let me see it and you may come in brothers, and stop shaking in your boots you\u2019re in good company here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrom fumbled for the letter and presented it to the grinning tiger; he inspected a sign on it and waved to his men to open the large oak library doors. Rubin let out an audible sigh of relief, now they just had to give this \u201cHerc\u201d guy his letter, thank him for not cutting them up, and say goodbye before they could get far away from here and end this story. Should be easy enough he thought! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large tiger escorted them through the total mess that was once a library, a large bonfire of books burned in the main hall, lighting everything with a sinister glow. As they climbed a passage of ruined stairs to a special tower room Rubin tried to strike up some conversation, \u201cSoo eh, the lady who sent up, who mistook us for thieves \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cmistook?\u201d the Tiger interrupted, \u201clooks like thieves to me\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026? Well sorry we aren\u2019t, we\u2019re actually fine upstanding citizens man, great hunters and traders\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cPerra doesn\u2019t bother normal citizens, mate.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes well she did\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre those your swords? They don\u2019t look like your size\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cUhh, well no but-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cKnew it\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey that no fair, we-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cSave it rabbit, we\u2019re almost there\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a stinkin rabbit! See this great tail, its full blown kanga- oof!\u201d Crom punched Rubin for being an idiot and insulting his kind. <br>\r\n\u201cHahaha\u201d the tiger spoke, \u201cyou guys are alright, my names Bart, friends call me Crusher, you can call me Bart.\u201d <br>\r\nRubin and Crom exchanged a sly glance. They were heading down a long hallway now; they had to be heading to the very back of the library. \u201cSoo Bart...\u201d Crom spoke, \u201cwhy are you here? I mean, why does it seem like every criminal and mercenary in the country has descended on this place, the lady who sent us here seemed to know\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d Bart spoke with surprise, \u201cThe darn Eye of Sarcous is here, you damn fool, its worth a kings fortune to the right people, stupid magic folk who think a spell is better than a weapon you can hold\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this would cause everyone to descend at once on this town?\u201d Crom inquired in disbelief, trying to divert the fact he was totally ignorant of what an \u201cAii of Sacouus\u201d as Bart pronounced it actually was.<br>\r\n\u201cArgh, there be darker forces at play here, we came cause we were commissioned... I\u2019ll not say by who, but Herc suspects most of the other big factions were payed off too. Long standing rival feuds boiled over and suddenly a simple raid escalates into all out war! And then the opportunists like you two joined the fray. <br>\r\nIt\u2019s a damn disgrace, we lost a lot of good men last night in an attack *sniff*\u201d Suddenly sounding sentimental. <br>\r\n\u201cWell if you have the uh.. I of Sadus\u2026 why don\u2019t you just leave?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat? And lead everyone back to our base to ruin? We wouldn\u2019t even make it back alive, fucking Cobalt Gang... And besides the boss says we still have stuff to do here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why is it, dear Crusher, that you are telling these strange strangers our plans?\u201d A cool but authoritative voice spoke out. They had arrived to finally see Herc, the bandit leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc was a white wolf, with piercing amber eyes, lounging lazily on a plush leather armchair with his large metal tipped boots resting on some expensive looking desk. Dressed loosely like a bandit, but wearing lots of gold and jewels, incredibly gaudy. The most prominent gold piece he wore was a large and highly decorative pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, sorry boss, I didn\u2019t tell them anything important sir, honest! They have a message from Perralace!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Give it to me, now!\u201d Herc sat up intently and held out his hand demanding. Crom quickly handed the letter over, \u201cWell uh, you got what you wanted so I guess we\u2019ll be going now? Nice to see you, bye-bye\u201d he grabbed Rubin by the arm and tried to walk out but Bart stood in the doorway and wouldn\u2019t let him pass. Crom\u2019s ears drooped as his spirits lower; of course it wouldn\u2019t be that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Herc finished reading the letter, a sly grin slowly grew over his face (and a slight blush, there must have been something dirty written in that letter\u2026), \u201cKeh heh heh heh, she found it! She found the door! Crusher, tell our men to pack up, we\u2019re heading out\u201d Bart nodded intently and ran off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, as for you two, you know too much\u2026\u201d Herc lifted a frighteningly large cutlass up from under the table with on arm, the two hunter\u2019s hearts skipped a beat, and both were seconds away from pulling out their own comparatively crappy swords, though they were clearly outmatched. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got two options, I kill you, or\u2026 you work for me!\u201d He declared and plunged the cutlass into the desk. Rubin and Crom shot each other a surprised and confused glance. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, if I wasn\u2019t currently so low on men the choice would be clearly to kill you, but dire circumstance dictate otherwise.<br>\r\nI just need you for this one job, then I\u2019ll let you go, heh, I\u2019ll even give you a great reward if you don\u2019t fuck up. <br>\r\nBut if you even think of betraying me I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll WISH you picked death right hear and now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters were speechless, after a moment of processing what was asked of them Crom nodded furiously, then nudged Rubin to start nodding too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, take these and get out of my sight\u201d he threw them each a token from his pocket, it bore the gangs insignia, a sign of membership, \u201ctalk to Crusher for orders, maybe he\u2019ll even have some spare weapons to replace your sorry excuse for butterknives.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrom and Rubin left Herc with a heavy feeling of dread hanging over them; they were in way over their heads.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Herc had a large party of bandits working for him, even if he said he was understaffed, back at the door was Crusher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to loudly brandish their new membership tokens all the way, Rubin and Crom walked over to him and explained what they had been told. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart was happy to exchange their improvised weapons with a fine sword and shield for Rubin and a spear for Crom, made from the groups own blacksmith, a buff golden brown scaled dragon nicknamed FireHammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly met quite a few other members of the group too, including an older alchemist bear called Loagi, two jokester assassin cats called Jin and Jang, a lusty fox mage named Bruce, a wise Druid zebra named Alec, a young archer pandagirl name Liz and a meanspirited sharkmorph named Rex. But there were many others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey helped move boxes and load wagons until Herc himself descended down the stairs into the main room; he walked with a stride like he was king of the world. \u201cRight men, I trust we\u2019re ready to move out, we\u2019re not going far, to the cemetery ahoy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bandit group made their way through the streets swiftly, as quick as they could. <br>\r\nCrusher was keeping his eyes firmly on Rubin and Crom to make sure they didn\u2019t try anything funny in the transit. <br>\r\n\u201cSo \u2013huff- why are we going to a grave yard again? \u2013huff-\u201d inquired Rubin to the watchful tiger as they jogged.<br>\r\n\u201c-huff- Not that it concerns you \u2013huff- but Perra has found an opening to \u2013huff- Sarcous\u2019 tomb! \u2013huff-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d inquired Crom, \u201chere in Katora? But... that zebra fellow who explained all this Eye of Sarcous nonsense to me, said he disappeared thousands of years before Katora even existed, hell, he said he disappeared, not died, why would he even have a tomb??\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo stupid,\u201d Bart replied, Crom glowered, he hated being called dumb, \u201cIt\u2019s not Sarcous\u2019 own tomb \u2013huff-, it\u2019s called that because it\u2019s to tomb of anyone who enters it. \u2013huff-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI see, but that doesn\u2019t explain why it\u2019s in Katora\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in Katora, ugh, difficult to explain \u2013huff-\u2026 it\u2019s in another realm, pocket world created by Sarcous, we\u2019re heading to a portal \u2013huff- to take us there\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay why is there a portal to a magical realm in Katora and nobody ever heard of it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cArgh, we\u2019re summoning the portal there, -huff- it\u2019s the only place in this stupid town that has the right summoning conditions \u2013huff- you ask way too many questions long ears\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough overwhelming force the bandit group dispatched any who dared get in their way on their march to the graveyard, but the group as a whole was nervous, they had been lucky to not run into any other large gang or ambush. <br>\r\nThey were sure they were being watch though, after all they had the prize most of the warmongers in the town were after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe graveyard was a hilly place, unkempt, gothic, largely untouched by the strife engulfing the town. On the tallest hill was a church, and the jaguar woman, Perralace, stood outside of it waving a lantern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bandit group reached her the first thing Herc did was embrace her for a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was a few other figures standing alongside her, a princely looking coyote, flanked by guards and a few robed members who appeared to be wizards. <br>\r\nHerc\u2019s oddly respectful demeanour towards the coyote told Crom that he was the group\u2019s mysterious commissioner Bart had mentioned earlier. He looked like the typical spoiled brat evil heir to a vast fortune, if he could, Crom would be slaying this guy on the spot for the damage he\u2019s caused, sadly circumstance did not permit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone went right to business like true professionals. Orders for several skulls to be collect, a bucket of water, flowers and other such things to be scavenged for the summoning. Alec, Bruce, Loagi and a few others were setting up the spell, drawing markings around the church door, sometime squabbling between each other about if a symbol was right or wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all it took less than an hour; a sliver of sunlight was rising on the horizon, signalling morning had come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gathered around to watch the wizards recite an ancient incantation. The doors before them, started to transform, from a plain old dirty wood door, it turned deep red and intricate carvings of fruit and vines appeared, it even actually grew in size a little, fracturing the surrounding wall. In the center a lock appeared, in the shape of an eye. When the process was done it positively glowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone was done being amazed by old magic Herc stepped forward, he was clutching the pendant around his neck in both hands. Crom noticed it also had the image of an eye on it. \u201cThe eye will lead you too the orb, the eye will lead you too the orb\u201d the wizards chanted. Then the rabbit realized the pendant so many people were after was infact a key!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc pushed the pendant into the pupil of the lock\u2019s eye, there was a loud bang and suddenly the double doors opened, slowly at first, creaking awfully. When it had fully opened it presented not the inside of the church, but a swirling red wall of light, smoke billowed out and covered the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry everyone inside\u201d Perralace spoke, ushering the crowd with her hands, \u201cremember! This door will only be open for one full day; if it shuts while we\u2019re still inside then we\u2019ll be stuck. We can\u2019t bring the pendant inside, and we can\u2019t rely on it being reopened any time soon if it closes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d Rubin muttered to Crom, \u201cthey didn\u2019t mention this before! I don\u2019t want to be trapped in some dank tomb forever, I\u2019m too young and handsome to be a mummy!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShh Rubin, we\u2019ll make sure we get out of here alive, I know we can, we\u2019ll just look out for each other.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that they had a choice, the pair of hunters walked to the door like everybody else, finally when they stepped inside they saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a strange sight to behold; they stepped inwards and entered outwards, into a huge open world distinctly foreign to their own. A pink sky canvassed the landscape, a forest of blue and purple plants encircled their clearing. Some strategically placed rocks with strange patterns carved into them dotted the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the last of them were inside Crom stood on one of those rocks to command his troops. Relaying various orders but Rubin and Crom weren\u2019t really listening, they were too busy taking in the sights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Crom, this place is amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know, how could that Sarcous guy make all this\u2026\u201d suddenly a pair of black paws landed on both of their shoulders, startling each of them. \u201cWith that ultimate magic he encountered boys; even with just a little bit he created all this place!\u201d it was Loagi the alchemist, \u201cbut be wary, it\u2019s not called Sarcous\u2019 Tomb for nothing. So few have entered and ever returned, none with the fabled orb of power. Their historical accounts of this place are sketchy at best, describing it as corrupt and perverse, nothing to be trusted, so young ones like you best be careful, eheheheh\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cand you two best stop slacking and help carry some supplies, rabbits!\u201d Bart yelled at them, Rubin scowled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group then proceeded to follow a path out of the clearing; apparently it was the right way because the magic folk could read the special stones scattering the path. It was pretty exhausting work, ontop of everything else the hunters had dealt with that day already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when they were trudging by a long canopy of oddly coloured fruit that the first incident that marked the strangeness of this place presented itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead of Rubin and Crom there was suddenly a commotion, Jin, the jokester cat assassin, was being wacked over the head by a pissed off Alec with his druid staff, \u201cOw! Hey, ow stop!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou fool, why did you consume the fruit, you could have been killed!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOw! Jang dared me! Ow! And I\u2019m not dead, or I might be if you don\u2019t stop hitting me with that damn stick!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell how do you feel?\u201d Liz asked with concern. \u201cRrrgh, besides some bumps on my head now\u2026 I\u2026 I actually feel kind of great!\u201d Jin said, \u201cWow, but\u2026 I do feel different, everything feels\u2026 lighter?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou feel lightheaded! That\u2019s not good\u201d Liz replied. \u201cNo, no. I mean everything feels lighter!\u201d he suddenly grabbed the kind of chubby panda girl and lifted her over his head with ease. \u201cWaaa, put me down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some brief testing, it was confirmed that somehow the fruit had made the lithe cat boy somehow as strong as the giant tiger Bart! The group mage performed a simple detect sickness spell on the assassin, and determined that he was in perfect health. <br>\r\nThere was one odd drawback however, whereas before Jin had been skin and bones, there was now a small dome of chub centred on his belly. He was very displeased he now had a small potbelly, and his brother Jang teased him mercilessly about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a difficult question was posed to the group of bandits, should they partake of the strange fruit and make their journey easier, or stay weary (and totally skinny)? They had to decide soon though; they had waisted enough time on this distraction already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRubin,\u201d Crom spoke to his friend, \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, it\u2019d be great to be super strong, but I really don\u2019t think we should eat these things, you heard what the alchemist bear said earlier, this place can be really dangerous\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBuddy come on! Super strength! And guess what? That odd bear guy is eating one of them fruits as we speak.\u201d<br>\r\nCrom turned around to see it was true, the black bear was greedily chowing down. \u201cUgh, that\u2019s not the point, I get a\u2026 a bad feeling about them. Plus they\u2019ll make you fat\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, firstly Crom, scientific magic has assured us they are perfectly safe, and secondly it\u2019s only a little bit of pudge, I could work it off in a week if I tried! Well, I\u2019m going to try it, with out without you\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cCertainly without, I just hope your right about this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nRubin plucked one of the pear-like fruits off of an overhanging branch, there were hundreds of them, all icy blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little hesitation Rubin opened his maw and took a big bite out of it. It tasted very sweet, like custard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair waited a few seconds with bated breath. \u201cHa ha!\u201d Rubin declared, \u201cyes, I can feel it!\u201d he picked up the heavy crate he was carrying like it was a feather. \u201cYes Rubin, and I can see it\u201d Crom said, pointing at the roo\u2019s gut, almost as fast, the previously trim and fit abdominal was covered in a layer of soft fat. \u201cs-Shutup!\u201d Rubin snapped back and blushed. Crom wouldn\u2019t mention it, but he was sure Rubin\u2019s backside had also just plumped out a little bit, it was hard to stifle his laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group was pretty evenly split on if they tried the Strongfat Fruit, as they had uncreatively named it. Bart was quite happy to eat one, but Herc was far too vain to even let an ounce of fat get on his frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNethertheless before they left they stocked up on a large pile of the fruit, who knew how long the effects would last after all, and super strength could always be handy in a bind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little more walking\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The second incident of strange happenings in this realm occurred just a few miles down the twisted path they were travelling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of them was a river, cradled in black sand, flowing with a bubblegum pink substance not translucent like water but more like milk or cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as the bandit group could tell it stretched on indefinitely in either direction, though how they would pass it was not clear, their course was clear, they simply had to pass the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the party would dare traverse the gooey waters, sensibility prevailing. But Herc was growing more frustrated by the minute; they were on a tight schedule, on rout to a goal they knew not how far it would take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coyote commissioner, whose name still remained a mystery to Crom and Rubin, seemed equally upset, he was fiercely chastising his wizards for not being able to do something like simply levitate them over the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Alec the Druid cried, \u201cEureka!\u201d He had been quietly performing a spell to sift through the black sand of the riverbank, and he found was he had expected was hidden there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one of the special rune stones had been unearthed. Bruce the mage was asked to read it, lo and behold it described how to cross the river. There was a passage, a bride to lead them over it. The reason none of them had been able to find it was simply because it was invisible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAralek\u2019 mohabi no, tralina sen\u2026\u201d the fox finished reading, \u201cThat means, eh, if I did read it right, heh heh\u2026 there is one special condition needed to pass the bridge, anyone walking across canNOT look at the water below, not one glimpse, or else they\u2019ll just fall straight down into the waters below!\u201d the mage emphasized dramatically. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDoes it say what might happen if we fall into the water? How do we know we can trust this stone, it might be a trap!\u201d the blacksmith inquired worriedly. \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t say, but we\u2019ve been following these stone instructions all the way here, it\u2019s a little late to be wondering if they\u2019re misleading! Besides, unless you can think of some other idea it\u2019s all we have.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe right\u201d Herc spoke up authoritatively, \u201cwe don\u2019t have any more time to waist, where is this invisible bridge?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cRight there sir, it should be between the two silver palm trees, and I don\u2019t see any other!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you\u2019re so confident about this, you try it!\u201d shouted the brutish cyan sharmorth Rex, who grabbed the fox by the neck of his robe and pushed him towards the bridge, almost right into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey stop that!\u201d FireHammer the dragon shouted, \u201cI\u2019ve had it up to here with your shit, I\u2019ll turn ya into sushi if you don\u2019t back off!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSILENCE, both of you fools!\u201d shouted Herc who drew out his cutlass threateningly. <br>\r\nTensions were high, the stress was getting to the team, \u201cI\u2019ll go first\u201d Herc volunteered, \u201cafterall, I\u2019m the leader, I lead.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white wolf approached the gap between the two silver trees. Took a deep breath, stared up into the pink sky and took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked! It appeared like he was walking on the surface of the river. Herc let out the tiniest sigh of relief and quickly marched straight across. \u201cCome on men, follow your leader\u201d Perralace yelled, and copied exactly as her lover did. Without needing to be told twice soon everyone was making a quick procession line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the problem happened, after almost everyone had passed FireHammer was making his slow way across, making sure to look anywhere but below. The auburn dragon was actually quite fearful of water, never learned to swim, not that he could with all the heavy armour he constantly wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had almost made it across, when behind him was Rex, grinning like only a shark could, he had timed this just perfectly. Without warning he lunged forward, walking straight into the burly dragon with enough force to make stumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFireHammer tried to correct himself, he tried to keep his eyes closed, but alas for a split second he saw the milky pink goo and then he plummeted under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were gasps from the crowd, Herc let out a stream of profanities. Rex just calmly waked to the otherside offering hollow apologies to his leader, pretending he didn\u2019t see him because his eyes were closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile FireHammer was thrashing about in the water; luckily for him it turned out the river was not deep, only going up to his elbows at most. But he was still in a panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiped the pink fluid from his eyes as best he could, he wasn\u2019t far from the riverbank. He tried to get over the initial shock since he wasn\u2019t dead, and started to wade through the goo as quick as he could, but it was so thick, and the riverbed was muddy and sticky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRex when I get out of here I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d he roared, \u201cEh?... I feel, ulp, funny\u2026 is this making my armour shrink!?\u201d the dragon asked, but he was wrong, it was not the armour shrinking, his body was growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon stopped to take off his plate armour before it constricted him to death, exposing more skin to the odd pink water. <br>\r\nAs he took off his breastplate a large globular belly flopped out, the type of belly you\u2019d expect to see on an heavy ale drinker, a huge difference to the washboard abs FireHammer had sported just a few minutes ago. <br>\r\n\u201cWhaa!?\u201d he yelled in confusion, tentatively poking his still swelling stomach. It was so soft, it felt so unnatural to the blacksmith, to his most surprise though\u2026 it actually felt kind of good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he inspected the rest of his body and found to his horror the same was happening everywhere else. His ass was becoming fat and lardy, tail becoming thick and meaty, he had moobs growing larger than most well endowed women, his thighs were touching, soon he would only be able to manage a waddle.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang could only look on in amazement as the dragon fellow grew well obese and beyond that. Until Herc snapped out of his stupor and yelled, \u201cKeep moving you idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat snapped FireHammer out of his shock too, and with a great deal of effort he started moving forward again. By the time he finally reached the otherside he looked like a beached whale. He collapsed on the sand still slightly growing as his body absorbed the last of the goo still on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErrghgh\u2026\u201d he just groaned, exhausted. \u201cC-can you move?\u201d Crusher inquired, clearly concerned for his friend. <br>\r\n\u201c\u2026too\u2026 heavy\u2026\u201d the dragon moaned, face in the sand. <br>\r\n\u201cAww crap, what are we going to do, we can\u2019t just leave him here!\u201d the tiger yelled, \u201cGoddamnit Rex I aught to cut you down right now!\u201d<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence, nobody could think of anything to say, would they really have to leave him here? What other option was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Perralace suddenly exclaimed, \u201cDo you think uh.. he hasn\u2019t tried one of those special fruits has he? Maybe if he eats one he\u2019ll be strong enough to stand, and Crusher and Rex\u2026 and goddamnit Rex you will help, could help him walk!\u201d <br>\r\nAfter a little debate and threatening Rex they all agreed, and fed the mountain of a dragon one of the fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, it\u2019s working, I feel like\u2026 like I\u2019m even lighter than I was before!\u201d, FireHammer thankfully exclaimed. Be he certainly didn\u2019t look it, as he noticeably swelled out just a little fatter. <br>\r\n\u201cUgh! You don\u2019t feel like that to me lardarse!\u201d shouted Rex, who was trying to help him to his feet with Bart, who was having no problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s cause you haven\u2019t had any fruit, asshole!\u201d Herc spat out, and shoved a large one into his hands, \u201cand don\u2019t you dare bitch about the weight gain, or I\u2019ll throw you in the river myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex grumbled and consumed the fruit whole, a chubby little gut swelled up, the bottom of which pocked out from under his shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec the zebra then spoke thoughtfully, \u201cI do not think it\u2019s a coincidence that two size altering, though not directly related objects would exist in this land, especially in such proximity\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d asked Perralace<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that\u2026 it is the theme of this realm, maybe some sort of insane joke by Sarcous, or maybe some corruption\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? So instead of normal traps trying to kill us, this place will try to fatten us to death? I.. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Perra, this is all just my assumptions so far, though I should note that neither trap has actually been deadly when they easily could have been, the fruit is even proving somewhat helpful\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit gang could spend little time dwelling on those thoughts though; they had to press on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trail seemed to shrink as they trekked onward. Or rather, everything on the trail was just getting much too big. The further along they walked, the larger things seemed to get. Trees with soft and ripe trunks closed in on them on both sides. Meaty vines thicker than spring sausages adorned the canopy above.Even the leaves themselves seemed over encumbered with weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new trial did not slow the gang of bandits, swords made short work of the blubbery plants. A standard steel cutlass sliced through the bark like warm butter. Though our crafty heroes had decided to follow a less strenuous plan. Rubin and Crom stood a short ways behind Firehammer, his new found girth and strength forced the meaty foliage apart. Leaving a much wider trail for them to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do this all day, if not for the view.\" Rubin grimaced at the sight of bulbous sweaty dragon rolls. \"What do you think this Sarcous guy's deal was anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he had a sick sense of humor.\" Said Crom. \"But it makes sense to me in a way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Rubin raised a brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you think about it, the standard adventuring crowd loves to show off their hard earned adventurer bodies. The fastest way to turn them around would be to fatten them up a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a bit.\" Rubin gestured to Firehammer's back rolls. \"But then why the fruit that makes you stronger too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...you know what maybe he was just a weirdo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the caravan of burglars came to a halt. Crom tried to get a peek around Firehammer, but he was much to large to see around. He glanced up at the Dragon and took a moment to muster up some courage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey up there, you know why we stopped?\" Asked Crom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bart says we've found something.\" Said the dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the head of the trail, Alec was pondering over their latest find. It stood maybe four feet tall, and a little over three feet wide. Giving it the comical proportions of a berry. Its colorful fur and stubby appendages did not help at all. It had a long tail with a fluffy nub at the tip. It seemed to be a very round over sized chinchilla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...moko Alec una du?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he talking to me like that?\" The round creature looked out among the startled bandits. \"And why are you looking at me like that? You guys are the freaks not me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just that, you're the first thing out here that speaks a lick of the native tongue out here.\" Said Alec. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take you guys aren't from here.\" Said the chinchilla-like creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" Alec replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop meandering with it and do something. We are burning daylight here.\" Herc snarled under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Would you mind helping a few strangers out? We're looking for something called 'the Orb of Sarcous.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature scratched its chin. \"I might have heard of something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec looked at Herc and shrugged. This was getting them nowhere. Herc gave Alec an urgent look, the zebra shrugged a moment. Herc simply took charge and stepped in front. It was his turn to negotiate. \"Alright, do you know where you might have seen it last?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the creature gave Herc an impish grin. \"I don't think a bag of bones like you has any business with the orb.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne part confused, another offended. Herc drew his sword and pointed it at the fluffy creature. His lips drawn back in a snarl. \"I'll show you what this bag of bones can do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature held up his paws and shook its head. \"You don't understand. You don't match the criteria to be an orb bearer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at each other. Further dumbfounded by the creature's words. What an interesting pot hole in the road they had encountered. Herc stroked his chin, now intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who does then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature looked out among the crowd of bandits. His tongue sticking out while his eyes were deep in thought. They immediately lit up when he saw what he was looking for. Herc was now on the edge of his toes, searching the crowd for the proper orb bearer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big fellow over there. He's closest out of you all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were now on Firehammer. The weight of attention on his shoulders was much more unbearable than any amount of fat he now hoisted around. He wanted to hide, but he was literally the largest of the crew in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, dragons are the key?\" Herc folded his arms. \"Only he can hold the orb then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it? At his size he might be able to get within a hundred paces of its room without being completely destroyed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on Herc what the creature was trying to tell him, and he did not like what he was hearing at all. The wolf squeezed his hand into a fist and growled. \"You're joking right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'fraid not. Eat up little guy. You've got a long ways to go.\" The creature chuckled and took a seat on his rock. Herc was fuming.. The nature of Sarcous' realm had been revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Herc, if I'm hearing this right, one of us has to more than double Firehammer's size to even stand in the same room as the orb. I can't fathom what size one must be if they want to hold it.\" Loagi whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy enough, we let someone soak in that river until they get big enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At that point I don't even think any amount of fruit from those trees could get someone strong enough to even sit up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah but there is a way.\" The creature spoke again. \"A way to give you the size you want and the strength to handle it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening, you overfed rodent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for name calling. I'm here to help.\" The creature smiled. \"There are several pathways throughout the land. Only one is the true way to the size you desire.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but we could easily just follow the stones for such a path.\" Said Herc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me give you a small hint, it is not about the end of an adventure that matters. Rather, it's the journey. Only the strongest can walk this trail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc snarled a little and looked at his crew. The coyote commissioner looked annoyed by this sudden development. The creature before them seemed to know what he was talking about. But he could easily be leading them into a trap. They were told not to trust anything about this realm. What made this beast any different? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we follow him.\" Said Perralace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we don't...\" Herc shook his head. \"This has bad news written all over it. Doesn't seem just a little convenient that at a fork in the road we find someone trying to sway us one way?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew was becoming restless. They knew their time was running out and if someone did not decide soon, they would lose valuable time in actually getting the orb. Bart could sense the general unease from everyone around him. It was time for someone to decide. He took a few steps forward, but someone had already beaten him to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! All of you. Does it matter what this guy says to us if we have true power in our grasp?\" Rex called out to crew. \"I say we go with the creature. It knows more about this land than anyone of us and besides, our leader here can't even handle a little bit of chub on him. How do you expect him to make decisions that lead us to the orb?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, the crowd was nodding in agreement with the sharkmorph. Things had suddenly become a power struggle, and Rex as leading it. Herc felt the need to strike down the shark, put him in his place, but his crew was already feeling a little mutinous. The promise of power at the cost of body image seemed fine to plenty of those bandits. He sheathed his sword and looked out to them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But don\u2019t come crying to me when you walk straight into a death trap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared scornfully at Rex, who countered with a challenging smirk; the jerk had always been a backstabbing traitor, that\u2019s what the shark such a successful bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me\u201d Rex said smugly, \u201cthen when we have the orb it\u2019ll just mean one less ego mad puppy to share it with. Who\u2019s with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of bandits only briefly discussed the matter, nearly all of them agreed; they were heading with Rex and the chinchilla-ish creature. \u201cHee hee hee, I guarantee, you won\u2019t regret this!\u201d The little round critter chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially picking to go with Rex, Crom and Rubin were ready to leave with the rest of the gang, until Crom got cold feet, \u201cPsst, Rubin. Hey Rubin! I think we should stay.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, what?\u201d The roo questioned confused, \u201cCrom, why would we want to stay here, with Herc, aka they crazy bandit leader, or ex-leader now\u2026 Anyway he\u2019s crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShh! I know I know, but\u2026 the more I look at that little native guy, the less I trust him\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? But he\u2019s nice! He\u2019s a cute little helpful bowl of jelly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHave you seen the way he looks at everyone, with that creepy glint in his eyes.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just being paranoid Crom\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not, listen, Herc is right, his story doesn\u2019t add up. Please Crom, you ignored me on the fruit\u2026 and I\u2019ll admit you seem right about that one, but I\u2019m getting seriously bad vibes here.\u201d Rubin sighed, and relented, \u201calright, we\u2019ll stick with the crazy we know.\u201d Crom was very pleased Rubin had listened to him this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time most of the disloyal bandits had left with Rex down the Right Path, there were only eight bandits left with their group, not counting Rubin, Crom or Herc, that was down almost twenty men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerralace had decided to stay, even if she thought Herc was wrong she wouldn\u2019t leave him. Alec and Loagi decided to stay too; they seemed to see what Crom felt about the little chinchilla. Bart was Herc\u2019s righthand man, surprisingly loyal. Firehammer was certainly not going to leave with Rex after what he did to him, and Bruce felt the same, though he probably decided moreso to stay because he had a thing for Liz who also chose to stay.<br>\r\nThere was one quiet Husky bandit the two hunters had not spoken to yet that stayed as well, for who knows what reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coyote commissioner and his small group of men were another faction, they didn\u2019t follow Rex, but now they didn\u2019t exactly need Herc\u2019s men either. They stood away from them and discussed things in secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What are you two still doing here?\u201d inquired a brooding Herc to the hunters as they approached, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just run back to the portal door? Missions over.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cYeah well about that\u201d Rubin replied, \u201cwe were kinda hoping\u2026 we could head back with you? We kinda didn\u2019t pay much attention to what direction we were heading in to here cause our view was blocked by a big fat dragon butt\u201d Crom sharply nudged Rubin to not insult anyone, especially not their best bet out of this place at the moment.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc was about to respond with ire, but he was interrupted by one of the commissioners wizards, a dark looking antelope with large horns, \u201cI\u2019m to inform Mr. Hercawitz that indeed \u2018the mission\u2019 is not \u2018over\u2019. Our liege payed for this operation, and only he gets to say when it in fact \u2018ends\u2019. He says the mission will go ahead, despite your woeful inability to command your troops.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWha, why you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSilence, you\u2019re on thin ice already. You know if you renege on the deal you signed you\u2019re a dead wolf.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cArgh, let me talk to him!\u201d Herc yelled, and marched right over to the commissioners group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rubin and Crom tried to make conversation, \u201cSo uhh, do you guys still have that sack of StrongFat Fruit?\u201d Rubin asked sheepishly, \u201cI know it\u2019s only been a hour or so, but I\u2019m feeling kinda hungry, and I think the strength effect is starting to wear off.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRubin!\u201d Crom scolded, \u201cHow can you be thinking of food at a time like this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey actually I\u2019m feeling kinda hungry too?\u201d Bart interjected. \u201cMe third\u201d Loagi agreed, \u201cand after all it should be past breakfast time, let\u2019s sit by this rock here and eat.\u201d<br>\r\nCrom could only roll his eyes, \u201cWell do you at least have some normal food that won\u2019t make you fat? I might have some of that.\u201d <br>\r\nLoagi searched their supplies, \u201cHmm, sorry bunny, only fruit, I guess Rex\u2019s crew took the rest.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHmph\u201d Crom replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone but Crom, Perralace and the quiet Husky boy who seemed a bit of a loner, decided to join in on this impromptu brunch. \u201cOh wow\u201d Liz remarked, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t try this before, it feels amazing! And tastes great.\u201d She took another bite and her tightly corseted chest seemed to strain against the fabric a little more. \u201cMmm, yeah, I think this somehow tastes even better than before!\u201d Bart declared, his once toned abs now replaced by a chubby beer gut, \u201cI wonder if I eat two will I become twice as strong?\u201d and reached into the supply bag for seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, pigs\u201d Perralace muttered under her breath, Crom was kind of surprised to hear her talk that way about her own party; though with their bandit tablemanners he could hardly disagree. <br>\r\nAfter they were done Rubin got up and stretched, and then gasped and blushed as some of the studs on his leather armour popped off, a squishy tan-red furry belly pushing out. This time it was obvious the rest of his body had been affected too, his pants now looked one or two sizes too small for his butt, he had the making of love handles and a small muffintop.<br>\r\n\u201cI bet it\u2019ll take you longer than a week to work that off\u201d Crom chided, and poked him in the exposed belly. Rubin instantly swatted Crom\u2019s hand away, \u201cUgh, I am never eating one of these darn fruit again\u2026\u201d his statement had started strong, but ended sounding very hollow as his eyes laid back on the food sack, he unconsciously licked his lips. \u201cHmm, well I\u2019m glad to hear that\u201d Crom said, \u201c\u2026Are you alright buddy?\u201d he asked since the roo was seemingly ignoring him, eyes transfixed on the food. \u201cHuh? Yeah yeah I\u2019m fine, those fruit are taste but they sure aren\u2019t very filling\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Crom could respond to that a much more cheerful Herc strode up to the group, \u201cGuess what, missions not over boys, our fine sponsor had a few ace up his sleave it turned out. Pack up your tea party time\u2019s a wastin\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout bothering to elaborate the wolf started hiking up the Left Path, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be rich!\u201d he yelled back to them and started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerralace ran to catch up with her paramour, \u201cHuh, so what is it? How are we not stuffed right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKeheheh, as we suspected that bastard Maxwell had sponsored some other bandit groups than us, for insurance, and yesterday in the battle we fought, it was with one of them, fucking Cobalt Gang. Keheheh, it turns out we accidentally shot a stray arrow through the eye of their leader, and Maxie says they\u2019re looking for a new one.\u201d<br>\r\nIt took a second for all the information to sink in to Perralace, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019m going to be the new leader of the Cobalt Gang! Maxwell has already organized it though one of his weird wizard\u2019s crystal communicating balls.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou? But-but we hate the Cobalt Gang?\u201d Perralace looked more than a little upset.<br>\r\n\u201cShh, calm down doll I-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRrgh, I\u2019m not your bloody doll\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes you are and I\u2019m your snow white teddy bear\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026That name suited you better when you were a little fat kid\u201d she replied coldly, \u201c\u2026ugh, how will this even work? We can\u2019t just wait for reinforcements to arrive. And why you? I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t impressed with how almost all of your command just abandoned you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEh, you know how family is; one moment they\u2019re hiring you\u2019re cousins\u2019 mortal enemies, next they\u2019re handing you the keys to the castle\u2026<br>\r\nAnyway, the plan is we press onward at a slower pace, avoid any traps like pros, and since Maxwell sent my new crew the info on how to get here they should catch up by luchtime, or later I guess\u2026 we grab the orb and haul it back to Katora and rule like fucking kings, or queens, whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 about that, look, I don\u2019t know if that strange chinchilla guy was a trap or not\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPerra, it was totally a trap\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, that\u2019s not the point, what about what he said about actually touching the orb? I can\u2019t get fat! And I know you won\u2019t. And anyway what he was describing was impossibly large.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKeheheh, doll, he was lying. A ruse to try and convince unwitting fools like my dirty good-for-nothing ex-crew.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHerc, maybe I sensed there was something a little\u2026 off\u2026 about him, but that part where he talked about the requirements to touch the orb really did seem sincere.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to believe it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUghgh, Perra how can you buy into such crap?! Seriously, who ever heard of fatness being a magical shield?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know about magic Herc.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know enough. And I can tell when I\u2019m being bullshitteded. Seriously, if the key to stealing the Orb is getting fat, why would all the all the traps in this place be fattening? Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to make you skinny? Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026 but this whole realm doesn\u2019t make much sense\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two walked slowly now, the rest of the group caught up, Herc relayed his ideas about the Orb back to the group and they didn\u2019t disagree, his details about their new gang membership most found highly disagreeable though. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs they walked up the sloping path\u2026</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re the one who suggested we ask them to take us back instead of just figuring out a way back for ourselves, we could be out of here by now if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOr we could be even more lost than we are currently, face it, unless you suddenly learn how to read ancient stone language we\u2019re stuck with these guys.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI still say we could have figured it out\u2026 I wish I had something to eat right now\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, again?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them were Alec and Perralace, discussing various theories about this land, and what to think of their sudden change in affiliation from the Basalt Brigand to the Cobalt Gang. They didn\u2019t like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them was Maxwell the commissioner and his gang, all the mud seemed to be a little too much for the pompous coyote, who was in shoes more fit for waltzing than for hiking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them was Firehammer, who was having trouble keeping up with the rest of the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him was\u2026 there should have been the Mage Fox, Panda Archer and Loner Husky, but they were all missing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes ago they were all there, but when Loagi went to ask Bruce about their current path direction it suddenly became apparent that they were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u2026 just fucking great!\u201d Herc cursed at this new distraction, \u201cWhere could they have got to? They better have not fucking turned back!\u201d shouted the wolf infuriated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can use an old tracking spell I know to lead us too them, if they wandered off the path\u201d Alec spoke, and started to wave his druid staff over the ground muttering a strange language. \u201cKu lo ra, rama si skai, misapek \u2018Liz\u2019, misapek \u2018Bruce\u2019, misapeck \u2018Rocky\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly three small orbs of light arose from the ground, \u201cThey will take us too them\u201d the zebra said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey only had to backtrack for a little while before they saw their direction diverged from the group. In to a less dense area of foliage, but strangely less well lit, there was an odd amount of flowers and vines draping the trees that surrounded this place. And for the first time they saw weird red coloured vines, which pulsed like they were alive, it grossed Crom out. There was an odd aura about this place, it was different than the rest of the forest, it even smelled different, faintly sweet thanks to all the yellow flowers he guessed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light orbs vanished back into the ground. \u201cTheir path\u2026\u201d the druid spoke confused, \u201cends here?\u201d But there were nowhere to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc gritted his teeth, he looked like he was about to blow a gasket. Crom rested his back on one the surrounding trees, this was really tiring work for those without superstrengh. That odd smell about this place, it was pretty sickening Crom thought, but also\u2026 enticing in a way? He took a deep breath; it actually smelled pretty good on second opinion. It was making him more hungry than he already was. If only he could\u2026 find the source of that smell\u2026 then everything would be fine\u2026 everything would be perfect\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the thick bright red vines was circling all around Crom, wrapping around his arms, legs and even his ears! After it had finished binding the intoxicated rabbit the end of the vine slid easily into Crom\u2019s eager mouth, which began sucking as if on cue, drawing a sap like substance out of the tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrom!\u201d a frightened Rubin yelled out, as soon as he noticed what was happening to his buddy. He drew his sword, and moved to cut down the wicked vines, but nimbly the plant hoisted the white rabbit up in the air, high up above them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the group realize that the reason this area was worse lit than the more densely crowded forest was because their three missing crewmembers and now Crom were being suspended from the treetops, each sucking contently from a pulsing red vine. The missing crew were almost as hopelessly fattened as Firehammer by now, and the skinny Crom was already not so skinny anymore, sporting a gut that was bloating larger with sap by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something!\u201d yelled Loagi, who drew a dagger and started cutting the surrounding trees franticly. <br>\r\nHe sliced a nearby red vine, it burst with a spray of intoxicating smell and sap. <br>\r\nThe black bear was hit by the brunt of it, and almost instantly became as complacent as the other trapped team members. The two cut ends seem to come alive, and shot straight down the alchemist\u2019s throat, pumping gushing sap into his belly. In his sudden haze he didn\u2019t even try to stop it as it shoved him onto his butt and started filling his belly at more than twice the speed of the others. Not even having to suck like the others, the two cut vines just gushed into him like a large hose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck\u201d yelled Herc, witnessing this and realizing simply cutting the vines wouldn\u2019t be effective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sap in Crom\u2019s swollen belly was turning into pure fat now. He was already surpassing Rubin\u2019s weight. But he was nothing compared to the balls of fat were the others. How the vines even had the strength to lift them was astounding. The husky \u201cRocky\u201d was the lightest of the three, but that was not saying much, he had triple chins and a huge grey fur dome like belly, his over taxed tunic would surly give any second now. Liz\u2019s corset had popped a long time ago, large triple D breasts wobbled about and were squeezed by the twisting vines, she looked like she had a expression of pure bliss on her face as she sucked down the gooey amber. Her tremendous panda tush was the largest part about her, like two big white moons in the sky. <br>\r\nBut poor Bruce, the once so lean fox, was the hardest hit. By now he looked well beyond Firehammer\u2019s weight, his busted robe was no match for such a massively overstuffed belly. He was just a blob of orange and white, dangling in the air by a few red strings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoagi\u2019s gut was now spilling over his sides; it was forcing his meaty legs apart as it brushed the floor. He just murmured in delight like a total zombie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubin jumped about the battlefield, trying to keep track of Crom and trying to avoid the red vines which were suddenly much more active, perhaps sensing the intruders. Everything was a pandemonium; some wanted to retreat to safety, other to save their teammates. <br>\r\nBy accident Rubin landed on one of the numerous yellow flowers that populated his area, crushing it. <br>\r\nSuddenly the vines in the surrounding area seemed to spasm, then they slowly dropped to the ground, dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a second to realizing what he\u2019d done Rubin yelled, \u201cThe flowers! Kill the flowers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the battle was easily won, in mere moments the vines suspending their grossly fattened comrades began to descend gracefully, thankfully, it would be a right mess if it just dropped them out of the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo grabbed the rabbit as he landed, and effortlessly ripped off the limp red vines and tattered leather chest armour. Crom\u2019s droopy eyes slowly returned to dilation, and he yawned like he had just been put under a deep sleep. \u201c\u2026Uhh, what happened?\u201d he drowsily inquired, but his eyes opened wide in shock as they travelled down past Rubin\u2019s face and to the white expanse of fat that was his belly. \u201cAhh ahh, w-what happened?!\u201d he yelped, and grabbed two handfuls of doughy flesh, jiggling them about. \u201cHeh heh, long story, but I\u2019m guessing this will take you over a month to burn off, fat-butt\u201d the kangaroo sniggered, now more worried about giving a scaving teasing payback now that he knew his friend was okay. \u201cLook Crom you even have the start of little moobs.\u201d And he poked his chest. <br>\r\nVery shortly Rubin got a sharp fist to the gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec inquired about the health of his teammates, they had mobility, but only just, and Rocky had to be force fed one of the Strongfat Fruits despite his instance he could still make it without them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the path, the group really just hoped that would be the last hassle they encountered before reinforcements arrived. But luck was not on their side today, for almost as soon as they began moving forward again did they hear a terrified yell for help, coming from up ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jang, one of the twin cat assassins, by chance heading straight in their direction, but there was one huge difference from normal Jang, this cat was almost unrecognizably fatter! He had wide puffy cheeks, a big black belly that sloshed about with every step he took, his assassin top had ridden up that plush furry dome and nestled in his large cat moobs. He wasn\u2019t looking where he was going and almost ran (or more like fast waddled) right into Herc. When he actually saw everybody he was so startled he slipped face first into the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-boss?\u201d he whimpered, apprehensive to be looking right at the bandit leader he just deserted, but also seemingly relieved to find anyone in this wild. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHerc grinned a with deep satisfaction, \u201cKeheheh, so what happened?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The newly fattened assassin took a moment to stand again. His limbs shook and trembled under his new weight. He panted and huffed, trying to catch his breath. It took way longer than he was used to for his stamina to return. Jang wiped the mud from his face and looked behind him, partially relieved that he had somehow managed to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...here's the story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex and his crew obeyed the rodent's every command, every step of the way. In fact all went well for awhile. No traps, no monsters, nothing. The chinchilla revealed its name to be \"Bal,\" which brought forth some laughter. This did not bother Bal at all, he only continued to lead them on through the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they reached a small village. Everywhere they looked were those adorable berry shaped chinchilla things of all colors. Most were a little amused at the sight, but not Rex. He was quite annoyed. As far as he knew, they were not getting any closer to the orb. He could tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are wasting time, those others could find it before we do.\" Rex said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBal assured everyone that without his help, finding that orb was going to be no easy task. The other guys were stupid for leaving. Rex wasn't satisfied. He wanted to leave and keep going. Bal wanted to rest. Then Rex did something he really shouldn't have. The shark morph struck the chinchilla creature on the back of the head, this brought forth the ire of the entire horde. In an instant a flurry of these creatures had pounced on Rex. No longer adorable, but quite frightening. Rows of sharp teeth and their claws were incredibly long. They were no match for Rex's strength, at least while he had it. After a few bites from the creatures, the shark began to tucker out. The change was slow, but he was definitely getting bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else tried to run, some were lucky and managed to get away. Others not so much. Jang was caught by surprise on the trail out of the village. Two ambushed him and bit him on the arm. He managed to toss the thing aside, but it didn't take long for him to feel the effects of the venom. It took a good hour before he really started to notice it, and it wouldn't stop. What really terrified the cat, was the fact that Rex had taken multiple bites. Jang only got, at most, 3 bites, and he was huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I ran into you guys, I dunno how far I ran but you know I'm glad I'm out of there.\" Said Jang, slumping down on his rear and wincing. His legs were starting to feel the burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc glanced at the feline's arms, noticing a bite mark or two. Just like he had mentioned in his tale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you guys had a little trouble too.\" Jang panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had a run in with malevolent foliage.\" Herc shook his head. Half of his crew was hardly recognizable at this point. A nagging fear at the back of his mind pervaded his thoughts for a moment. Was he next? He shook his head, no, he had worked too hard for it to be that way again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party surrounded Jang, he felt nervous, now that he was back again with the crew. They all seemed too tired to really care that he had ran out on them. Bart was first to grab some of the strong fat fruit and offer it to the cat. Jang shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll help, the last thing you should be worried about is your figure at this point.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I feel stuffed, I couldn't eat a bite.\" Jang grimaced as he tried to stand again. Bart helped him up a little, Jang's legs wobbled as he spread out his stance. But for the moment he was fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Herc and Perralace were talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if that thing was taking them somewhere before Rex pulled that stunt.\" She snapped. \"Now we're stuck with our rival gang, half of us are blobs or well on the way, and we have no idea where we're going.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and let me think.\" Herc glared. \"We'll keep with the stones, after a short break to let our reinforcements play catch up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we wait while anything could happen? Do you really want to risk that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're really starting to get on my nerves.\" Herc's hackles raised a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting on <i>your</i> nerves? I thought we were partners. You know, watch eachothers backs and make decisions together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we went with that little rodent we'd all be like Jang right about now. So how about you quit the bitching and just accept that you were wrong and we figure something else out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerralace glared daggers into Herc. She let out a humorless chuckle and took a seat. \"You know I'm starting to miss the days when you were a fat kid, not as good looking in bed, but you know what, not such a bastard either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc's eye twitched a little, his hand gearing to strike, when a loud groan shook them from their argument. Jang was leaning up against a tree for support, moaning about his stomach. His eyes grew wide as the sounds of stitches giving filled the air. What was left of his clothes were starting to tear. Fur and flab peeked out from the stretched seams.  His legs trembled as they filled out more and more. Pushing his stance wider and wider. Eventually the weight was too much and he collapsed on his rear. He tried to stay sitting up, but his mountain of a gut pushed back into him. His limbs flailed around, his cries starting to become muffled. His cheeks puffed up more and what was left of his neck disappeared beneath another chin. A loud \"snap\" sounded off as what was left of his clothes tore apart. His constricted moobs bouncing free. The added weight was running out of places to go, now it was simply pooling around him, limply settling in every direction it could. Anyone listening could hear his body gurgling and his skin literally stretching to accommodate his growing size. His gut rose and fell with his breathing. It had stopped for now, but no one knew how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The venom must still be working in his system!\" Loagi gasped, grimacing as he stood, his new weight proving a bit of an annoyance as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do? We leave him like that and he's going to...well...drown in himself.\" Perralace shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I can make an anti-venom. I held onto my alchemic supplies, if I had a sample of the venom we could at least try to stop it...what say you Herc?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc glanced down at his former crew member. His panicked eyes glanced all over the place. It seemed like the only thing he could do was breath and move his eyes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Declared Herc, after a few seconds of quiet contemplation. The White Wolf was being surprisingly merciful, especially to a uselessly fat assassin-traitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat assassin heard the white wolf mention feeding him some food and immediately moaned in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh uh nnnnnooooooo!\u201d He whined, \u201cSooo full\u2026 *hic*\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was attempting motions that resembled rubbing his taut belly, but his arms were far too heavy and pillowy to succeed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTuff biscuits, kitty. Consider this the start of your punishment\u201d The wolf replied with a nasty grin, and grabbed some fruit from the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubin and Crom watched with fear as the sadistic Herc leaped up onto the belly of the beast, ignoring his jaguar girlfriend\u2019s protests against rushing into things, and Bart volunteering to eat enough fruit so that he could carry Jang by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat boy tried to resist, but only lasted a few seconds before Herc shoved a cyan fruit into his maw, grabbing the lard encased chin and forcing him to chew the whole thing at once. He covered the mouth, and pinched the cat\u2019s nose, not letting him breath until he swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desperate cat thrashed around for a bit, but in the end he had no choice and with a loud gulp the food went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey ya go, that wasn\u2019t so hard, cry-baby.\u201d Herc teased in a biting tone, \u201cNow let\u2019s have the second!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc was about to shove the other strongfat fruit down his gullet, when suddenly a LOUD gurgle rumbled from the cat\u2019s stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was loud enough to startle the wolf, and he quickly jumped off of the cat, who\u2019s expression was a mix between emotionless, half-lidded eyes, and looking like he was about to puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started growing, just a tiny bit, like the men who ate the fruit normally grew. And it then it stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group let out a sigh of relief, for a second there it looked like something horrible was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a second later something horrible happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJang started swelling again like before, but he wouldn\u2019t slow down. The air was filled with the sound of a cat howling, burping, and a few hiccups. He tried to speak but he was simply incomprehensible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group took a few cautious steps backwards, half unsure if he was going to explode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, for Jang, he didn\u2019t. His poor stretched dome of a belly just kept expanding, quite soon literally pushing the trees that lined the path to bend. He was firmly wedge in there, globular black butt (with the hint very fat tail poking out) exposed to the bandits. Huge belly blocking their path, still slowly oozing out in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHerc you IDIOT!\u201d Perralace yelled, punching the dumbstruck wolf in the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAck!\u201d though not really hurt, \u201cWhat the hell? I didn\u2019t expect that to happen? Why the hell did that happen??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter you shouldn\u2019t have forced him to eat when he was like that!\u201d she yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf huffed, and then rolled his eyes, \u201cI was half considering cutting him in half for being a rotting traitor, would you have preferred that? My Queen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerralace glared daggers into Herc, who then turned his attention to Loagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey bear, I thought you said this fruit was safe?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tubby bear shrunk down into his robe, he didn\u2019t want Herc\u2019s wrath, \u201cUhh, well\u2026 I think it is, it just must have\u2026 must have had a bad reaction to the poison that\u2019s inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, you can hear the cat is alive and well\u2026\u201d He was cut off by a thunderous burp, \u201cmaybe a little gassy\u2026. But by all rights he SHOULD be dead at this size\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart the tiger cut in, \u201c\u2026You\u2019re sure that it\u2019s reacting to the fruit, I don\u2019t want to blow up like that if I eat another of these\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d the bear looked a little apprehensive, \u201cI\u2019m sure. But, if we\u2019re still planning to go for the antidote\u2026 right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc looked ambivalent, \u201c\u2026yeah, I feel it\u2019d be good to investigate this little village cat-blob was talking about, they\u2019re probably hiding treasure there, and the way to Sarcous!... Aaand this path is blocked anyway\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, while you plan to investigate the village, I think it\u2019d be wise if anyone here who has eaten the fruit stay at the fork in the road. As we\u2019d be especially vulnerable to becoming like poor Jang.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! But that would only leave me and Perralce to face the village, you slackers!\u201d Herc yelled indignant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd bunny boy\u201d the jaguar said motioning to Crom. With all eyes on him, suddenly Crom really felt stupid for not partaking in the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike hell Crom is going anywhere without me!\u201d Rubin spoke up. Crom motioned from him to quiet down, he didn\u2019t need both of them putting their neck on the line for no good reason. But the roo wouldn\u2019t hear it, and they immediately got into a little squabble about who would stay and who would go in front of everybody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough all the attention was stolen by Maxwell, the classy coyote speaking up, \u201cAnd I shall attend this village, perhaps they have a chief with whom I can negotiate. If not, if they can\u2019t be reasoned with, well I expect my wizards and your gang of barbarians, no matter how small, should be able to easily take of them, they were the mere size of large rodents afterall\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but you\u2019ve seen how they annihilated the rest of out gang!\u201d Loagi cried out exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerc glared daggers at the bear, and motioned to strike him before being stopped by the coyote\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-heh, no cousin, let him speak to me, just this once. I am beyond reasonable if nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattle is all about strategy, my plump, herb mixing simpleton.\u201d The bear jostled at such overt rudeness, but didn\u2019t dare step out of line, \u201cTo win battle is all about strategy, and surprise. Even a village full of rats can win against the mightiest foe with such tools. The fool Rex didn\u2019t know what he was getting into, but we shall come prepared, so we have the advantage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coyote smirked, full of confidence that only years of experience backstabbing and lying could build. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGentlemen, lets make haste, we\u2019re wasting precious sunlight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about Jang?!\u201d Bart protested, the cat boy had finally seemed to stop growing, but it hard to tell, his belly was basically just a big black boulder blocking the path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErg, was that an invitation for all of the \u2013help- to speak to me? We\u2019re leaving him, that should be obvious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heartless \u2013\u201c Bart was quickly shut up by Herc putting a hand over his mouth. \u201cShut it! No, the commissioner is correct, it\u2019s not even possible to do anything for Jang now, we\u2019ve got a deadline, so lets now dwell on it. We\u2019re going, and that\u2019s final!\u201d He said sternly to the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone begrudgingly accepted, except for Crom and Rubin who were still too caught up in their tiff. Rubin eventually prevailed in that he would come if Crom was forced to, damn the risks. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A magic that may have even created the universe, a magic that Gods possessed. However he tapped too far and fell in too deep. He discovered the hard way that normal mortal bodies are nearly destroyed when exposed to the magic for seconds, to counter this he discovered a solution to ready his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly this sorcerer, who called himself \"Sarcous\" disappeared from the world. All that was left of him was a message and a pendant. Discovered by his fellow magicians. One cryptic hint was left behind. \"The eye will lead you to the orb.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs years passed, the pendant was lost to the sands of time and Sarcous' discovery was forever hidden. Until rumors of Sarcous' \"eye\" being found caught wind and were spread to daring adventurers ready to make the power their own. Unbeknownst to them that they will be changed forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Ground Rules</font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Plot without porn! Keep the sexual content to a minimum, while I do not mind romance I don't want this to go into an all out porn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Use your imagination. Flesh out the weight gain of this story, terrible pun definitely intended. It's a major plot point that the characters need to get bigger so have some fun with it, rather than have them reach whale-like proportions within two chapters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. I'm not by any means a grammar nazi, but if your chapter is an incomprehensible mess then I'm afraid I can't keep it around. Also I would like to keep submissions in prose format. Script format will be frowned upon in my interactive and is strongly discouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that said time to join the adventure...<br>\r\n</td>",
