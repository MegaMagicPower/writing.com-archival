Maximous turned towards the body, realizing it to be a male, slender fox, completely stripped down. However, firmly grasped in his hand, is a key. Maximous grabbed the key and tried it on the door to his cell. It fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unlocked the cell and exited. Not wanting to take any chances, the wolf unsheathed his broadsword, just in case anyone tried to get frisky with him. As he passed through the hallways of the prison, he heard the thumping of the demon watching over the prison, preventing any undead from leaving. Their stomping alone caused a ruckus, but each swing of their hammer kicked up a lot of dust in the hallways. Maximous continued forward, the groans of undead and the sounds of the Asylum Demon's stomping being the only thing he heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, he noticed some undead creatures seemed to ignore him, opting to stare absentmindedly off at some wall or feeling the ground below them. He stood behind one that was just looking at a wall, not paying any attention to him. This undead was a cat lady, stripped down to rags, one around her waist, one around her chest. Maximous could easily strike her down, but this was once a thinking being like him. Should he stop to stabbing a mindless drone in the back? Looking her over more carefully he notices that the Catgirl was in fact armed all be it with a broken sword hilt with barely any blade to it, The girl would probably pose no real threat to him but there could always be a chance.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't bring himself to strike her down, least of all considering her mind seemed to be somewhere else. He started to walk away, when the cat lady turned towards his blindside. She had been killed over and over again, and she lost a bit of herself with every death. Few thoughts came to her mind, but one thought that still existed within her was \"fresh meat.\" Another being just turned their back towards her, and all she knew was that someone was exposed to her.

She flipped the broken sword around such that the blade pointed downwards instead of upwards like one would normally hold a blade. She raised her hand, and slammed the blade down on Maximus. The wolf howled out once he felt the blade dig into his flesh. He shivered as he heard the blade slide out of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat repeatedly stabbed him, all the while tearing at his armor. Soon, his upper body was completely exposed to the world. He tried to lift himself up, but each strike of the broken sword made him weaker and weaker. Meanwhile, the cat was working his leggings off of him. By the time the cat was finished stabbing, his lower half was exposed. Maximus felt his life draining from him, but the cat wouldn't let that be the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted herself a little bit, and hovered over Maximus' crotch. The wolf, meanwhile, could only look on in horror. She lowered herself, and he felt the curves of her underwear wrap around his dick. She began grinding back and forth, which was more torturous for Maximus than enjoyable. He felt the blood rushing to his member, which made him feel faint due to him losing so much blood. He felt himself burning up, which didn't help his peril at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the cat felt the appendage she sat on grow stiff, and began to quicken her pace. Maximus was panting, which only made him get closer and closer to passing out. She kept rubbing and rubbing, and soon, the pressure was too much for him. He shouted as he ejaculated. With that, he couldn't keep himself awake anymore. It wasn't bad enough that he was dying, but she was also humiliating him in his final moments. He shed a tear as she continued rubbing him down, and he succumbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus woke up, very surprised. He distinctly remembered the cat killing him, but he didn't see any wounds from the encounter. It was as if he woke from a dream. However, the lack of armor told him he wasn't dreaming. He realized he was in the cell he was before, it being locked. He refused to let himself stay here. He walked forward, and saw a purple cat looking at a wall. He didn't want to take any chances, so he ran up behind her and stabbed her in the back. She slumped down, the life draining from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus felt the souls leave her body and go into his own. He looked around, and didn't notice his armor. He walked to the path forward.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maximous wouldn't dare let himself fall to this glutton's broken blade. He gripped his broadsword, and swung behind him, striking the cat lady in her right shoulder and shoving her off of his body. He got up onto his feet, and turned towards the cat, to see a sight that shook him to his core. The cat he pitied, the one he took for a fellow soul wandering this realm like him, stood up, the fur under her right shoulder caked with crimson. He swore he saw chipped bone in the gash his sword created, and yet the cat didn't seem to mind it at all. The only expression on her face was hunger, hunger for whatever power she could yank from Maximous. She was nothing more than an animal, searching to satiate her desire for power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat charged at Maximous again, howling as she ran, but the wolf wouldn't be taken off guard. When she got close enough, she swung the broken blade, and Maximous brought up his shield. When the blade struck the shield, her arm shot back from recoil. Maximous swung his blade, slashing from her right shoulder to her left side. The slash was fatal. The cat lady's right leg crumpled under her, and the rest of her body fell, collapsing onto the ground. Her expression didn't change between her attack and her dying, she just had the look of hunger on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the souls poured out of her and into Maximous, he started to catch his breath, trying to stomach what he did. This cat looked like she could be anyone just walking through the village, and he killed her. But it wasn't anyone, it was a power hungry beast! Right? He contemplated this as he continued down the hall, shaking as he walked. He noticed an undead, male fox, staring mindlessly at a corner, kind of like that cat that he struck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, that would've struck me down!</i> Maximous tried to justify in his head. As he got close to the fox, he decided not to take any chances. He ran the blade through the fox's back before he could even think to attack him. The fox slumped down in front of him, his life escaping him. These aren't people he could talk to or get friendly with, they were monsters, ready to kill the first chance they got. As the fox's souls were absorbed into his body, Maximous decided he wouldn't pity these undead. They would only stab him in the back if given the chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk, Maximous made it to a field in the middle of the asylum, separated from the prison cells. The only thing between this garden and escape was the one creating the pounding sounds echoing through the asylum, the Asylum Demon. In the middle of the field was a bunch of debris with a rusted blade stabbed into the center of it. Maximous approached it, placed the palm of his hand over the hilt, and the debris lit up in a fire, like magic. Maximous was surrounded by a comforting warmth, that almost felt revitalizing. He sat down in front of the fire, letting the warmth of the bonfire caress him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth of the fire comforted him enough, and he felt it'd be more comfortable to take off his helm. He took it off, and was immediately struck by a horrid smell. While the inside of his helm smelled of sweat and rust, the asylum around him smothered him in the horrid stench of blood and decay. <i>This asylum housed only monsters. Horrid, stinking monsters, that only wanted to feed their basic instinct to get even more powerful.</i> That's all Maximous could think as the overpowering stench of death covered the field. He reached up to his nose to cover it, but the first thing he felt was thin flesh. He took a steady grip, and pulled, only to be shocked at the ease with which he could pull the flesh around his muzzle of the bone. He unclenched his fist in shock, and tried to catch his breath. <i>No... No!</i> Maximous thought as he stared at the fresh blood, his blood, decorating the palm of his gauntlet. Was he undead too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I... I can't be... I'm not them!</i> Maximous shouted to himself as he punched the ground beneath him. The shock of this transformation took Maximous' mind off of the smell entirely. He wasn't one of them. They sought out power, they wanted to kill just to get stronger. He could think past the limits of these guys, he's not one of them. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could contemplate it any further, he felt his muzzle, only to feel the flesh on his muzzle reattached to his bones. <i>How?</i> He felt his lower back for the stab wound the cat left on him, only to feel nothing. Was it this bonfire? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned towards the fog gate separating him from the Asylum Demon. This place held only the undead and demons. He couldn't get any answers in this asylum, but maybe there were a few outside. And the only way outside was through the demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximous placed his helm back on his face, and steeled himself for whatever this demon had in store for him. He marched towards the fog gate, stuck an arm through it, and walked through it. The fog remained behind him, forming an impenetrable wall. Meanwhile, in the marble covered ruins of the Demon's chambers, there seemed to be nothing. No demon, no undead, just a bloody message he couldn't see from where he stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cautiously approached, and read. \"Run\" was all it said. He whipped his head upwards as he heard something fall through the air. Up above was none other than the massive form of the Asylum Demon. Her size was comparable to an elephant standing on its hind legs, except her skin was more reptilian. She bore bat like wings, horns shaped like some mangled crown upon her head, breasts as large as Maximous, and pupil-less eyes, along with the massive hammer held in both of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximous darted backwards as the demon smashed, rear first, upon the marble he stood on. He turned to face the titanic form of the beast, getting to her feet and staring at him with pure malice, malice that could only be deciphered from her large mouth, contorted into a toothy frown. She was the only thing standing between him and freedom, and yet he felt he was horrifically outmatched in front of this being. He looked behind her large hips, and spied a door, far too small for her to go through. Maybe if he were quick enough, he could run through there and find some way of getting strong enough to take this beast!</span></div></div>",

The massive demon raised her hammer, and began to swing horizontally. The head began to scrape across the ground towards the knight, who rolled forward, barely dodging under the swing. He swung at the demon's stomach, damaging her a little. Maximous didn't have a lot of time to celebrate his victory, for the demon's gut suddenly slammed into his face, tossing him backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get up to his feet, but his vision was suddenly filled by a large, reptilian butt. Before he could react, he was slammed with tons upon tons of Asylum Demon butt. Maximous' armor felt like it was compressing under her, squeezing his body. The Asylum Demon got up onto her feet, the knight straining from the pain. He got up onto his feet, but was struck in the back by the demon's large hammer. He flew across the ring, colliding into a crumbled pillar. Maximous was panting from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was suddenly overtaken by a large shadow. Maximous looked over his shoulder, and then rolled away, just in time for the demon's hammer to miss him. Maximous ran at the demon, ready to strike. However, before he could strike her, she used her wings to fly away, dodging the knight. She landed a few feet away, and got ready to strike him with her hammer. Maximous was still recovering from his strike, and as such, was struck by the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he couldn't even lift his sword. He looked down at his arm, trying his hardest to lift it. He tried to lift his shield arm, but he couldn't. He couldn't fight against the demon any more. The monster approached, prepped to finish him off. His only hope was to escape out the opening.</span></div></div>",

She at least got to keep her gear; her old set of hard leather armor reminded her of simpler times, and was probably the only thing that has kept her from going hollow completely by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeagyth was suddenly jolted from her misery by the sudden slam of a body being dropped onto the cold, stone floor in front of her. She looked up, startled, just in time to see another knight peering down at her from the hole in the roof before he walked away. Probably just delivering another unfortunate undead to the asylum. Heagyth backed up against the wall in terror, horrified by the thought of being stuck in a cell with one of the hollows\u2026 only for it to just lay there, unmoving. Was it already \u2018dead\u2019? What\u2019s the point in locking up a dead hollow? Heagyth nervously stared at the body from a safe distance, her hand gripping the handle of her sword in preparation. Surely enough, the corpse didn\u2019t move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeagyth didn\u2019t wanted to approach the hollow, but she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the corpse held anything useful. Her hunger drove her to search the body \u2014 maybe she\u2019d find some bread or something. However, as she dug through the old, ragged robes of the hollow, she actually found something much more useful; a key. Her heart almost leaped in her chest. Could this\u2026 could this be the key to her cell? Could that knight be an old friend of hers, here to help her escape. She tried not to get her hopes up, but still, the canine was almost bursting with excitement as she tried the key on the rusty cell door. Surely enough, the latch slid unlocked with a single turn of the key! She was wide-eyed, almost unable to believe her luck as she pushed the old cell door open, peering out into the dark hallway beyond. She clenched her eyes shut, bracing herself, before she finally worked up the courage to face the outside world\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><div align=\"center\"><i>\u2501\u2501\u2501<br>\r\nNorthern Undead Asylum<br>\r\n\u2501\u2501\u2501</i></div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely illuminated by the scarce light of the torches, Heagyth came upon the eery sight of an undead wolf man standing in the hall, looking even more far gone then she was. Most of his fur had fallen off, revealing the pale, wrinkled skin beneath, and he looked deathly skinny, his ribs showing clearly through his chest. He seemed to be leaned up against the wall weakly with one arm, his snout practically pressed against the bricks. As she walked by, she noticed the wolf making strange grunting and groaning noises under his breath, and despite herself, Heagyth grew a little concerned for him. Was he injured\u2026 in pain? Did he need help? She decided it couldn\u2019t hurt to check to see if he was okay. She sneaked closer, trying to figure out what he was doing with his other hand\u2026 only to see a flash of pink for a moment, and blush when she realized what the hollow was up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe undead wolf was sending his skinny, pale hand up and down his surprisingly long shaft, panting in pleasure as he pawed himself off. His bloodshot eyes were glazed over, too distracted by ecstasy to even register the knight\u2019s presence. Heagyth couldn\u2019t help but watch until he finally reached his climax, bucking his hips and howling as he covered the wall he was leaning against with another helping of hot jizz. Apparently hollows don\u2019t have much of a refractory period, because the wolf just went back to beating himself off unabated, his addled mind unable to think of anything more than primitive pleasure. Heagyth decided not to stick around for the show this time, and nervously snuck past the wolf, letting him continue with his \u2018business\u2019 uninterrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, the once noble citizens of the kingdom had fallen. As they gave up on their real hopes and ambitions, anthros seemed to revert to the most profane sorts of debauchery. Heagyth herself had been feeling some strange urges and intrusive thoughts as the curse wore down on her willpower. It was only due to the discipline that she had learned as a knight that she hadn\u2019t already given in to her primitive instincts. Still, she had to be constantly diligent, and cling to her ambition of restoring the glory of the kingdom, no matter how hopeless the situation seemed. She repeated various, comforting mantras silently to herself as she wandered the halls, her paws clicking against the stone floor, her footsteps echoing down the halls. She kept her sword and shield readied, never knowing what horrors might lurk around every corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around her, she heard the moans and sighs of her fellow prisoners, and even came across them every once in awhile. They seemed harmless, though they were a morbid sight. For example, while passing through a knee-deep section of water, Heagyth passed by an undead hyena woman who was sitting in the brine, idly fingering herself with a vacant expression. Heagyth was tempted to send her sword through the hollow\u2019s heart for the souls, but decided not to stoop to such a level. Eventually, Heagyth finally came upon a ladder, natural light seeping down from above. This must be her way out! She eagerly climbed up with what little strength she had left, feeling the sunlight against her pale, sickly skin. She collapses on the ground once she was finally outside, basking in the warm sun, finally freed from that cursed prison. Or at least, so she assumed. When she looked around, she realized that, while she at least wasn\u2019t underground anymore, she might just not be on the home stretch just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in some kind of small courtyard, walls and locked doors surrounding her on three sides. Her only option, it seemed, was the massive cathedral-like structure waiting before her. Before she continued, though, she decided to light up the bonfire there and warm her hands. Something about the fire comforted her. It was the only thing she could rely on in these times\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><div align=\"center\">Bonfire lit!</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive, steel double doors creaked loudly as she slowly and weakly pushed them open, exhausting even more of her strength. The cathedral beyond was eerily stoic\u2026 until Heagyth heard that familiar, huge stomping noise from above. She had heard that stomping coming from outside the asylum every once in awhile, and she never wanted to meet its source. Panic filled the canine\u2019s heart as she realized the sound was coming this way. She looked down at her feet, only to see a message written in soapstone, Get away! Before she knew it, her sensitive ears were suddenly deafened by the thunderous sound of something huge landing on the stone floor in front of her. She clutched her ears in pain as she backed away, her eyes wide with fear as she faced her aggressor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foul creature looked like it must have been a regular bat anthro in life\u2026 but now, it had been twisted beyond recognition by dark forces, into an unrecognizable beast. She \u2014 for the demon was obviously female \u2014 was morbidly obese and stood at over three times Heagyth\u2019s height, and easily wielded a twisted, thousand-pound hammer in her sickly claws. The beast\u2019s cloudy eyes seemed agonized but diligent, as if it was dutybound to face you. Heagyth had fought monsters of this size before, but that was back in her prime, long before she became undead. She was so weak now, her muscles so atrophied, she\u2019d have to collect an incredible amount of souls to return to her former strength. Heagyth definitely wasn\u2019t in any shape to be fighting such a disgusting beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to flee\u2026 but the demon moved with shocking speed. Heagyth just didn\u2019t have enough time to scout out her surroundings; she just had to pick a direction to run, and pray she came across her salvation. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to be killed again, and brought one more step closer to becoming hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sprinted...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There wasn\u2019t any time to think this through. Heagyth\u2019s heart sunk when the demon lunged through the air towards here with incredible speed, hoisting her huge, savage axe in the air. The canine was just barely able to dodge, escaping by a hair\u2019s breadth as the demon smashed her axe into the ground behind her, breaking even through the tough stone that composed the floor. By this point, Heagyth was operating entirely on instinct, letting her intuition guide her to sprint towards the left side of the cathedral. It wasn\u2019t long until she saw the answer to her salvation; a wide open archway, which looked like it\u2019d be far too small for the demon to pursue her. She rushed blindly into the darkened hallway, knowing that whatever lies within couldn\u2019t possibly be worse then the creature she was dealing with here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive, sliding steel gate closed behind her as she rushed into the hallway, sealing her in \u2014 and more importantly, sealing the massive demon out. Just when she thought she was safe, in the darkness of the hallway, Heagyth ran into an obstacle she hadn\u2019t noticed; a simple set of stairs. Before she could celebrate her escape, she accidentally sends herself flying down the long staircase, rolling and bouncing off the stone steps as she descends into the darkness. She screams when she finally hits the bottom. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAh, f-fuck!\u201d</b></span> Heagyth cried out in pain, sitting up and clutching her foot in agony. Her hands were shaking as she slid off her boot, revealing her swollen ankle and slightly limp paw. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cMy a-ankle!\u201d</b></span> She had definitely sprained it or something. Not a terrible injury \u2014 she\u2019d definitely dealt with worse pain in the past \u2014 but still, it would definitely slow her down for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she worked up the willpower to stand. She could still walk, but with a severe limp, and it hurt quite a bit every time she took a step with that foot. Still, she knew she had to get out of this asylum as soon as possible, now that she had apparently attracted the attention of its warden. With some diligence, she goes hobbling across another pool of knee-high water, heading towards the sunlight once again. The second she stepped outside, though, she heard a sudden, loud twang just by her ear. She turned to see that an arrow had splintered into the wall just inches away from her head\u2026 and in distance, she could see a hollow with a longbow, readying another shot! She managed to duck into an alcove just as yet another arrow went whizzing by. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d</b></span> She was in a dire situation here. She just wasn\u2019t fast enough to dodge his shots; the second she emerged from her cover, he\u2019d be able to put an arrow through her easily. She had to be clever about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear the hollow growling and taunting her in the distance, the string of his bow probably pulled taut, ready to fire whenever she revealed herself. As she sat there, pondering her situation, she noticed there was actually a corpse lying in the alcove beside her. Some kind of rabbit lady, it seemed, who had taken an arrow right through the heart\u2026 one of the hollow\u2019s previous victims, perhaps? Either way, the body seemed to still have some equipment on it, and while she weren\u2019t a big fan of stealing from the dead, she were in a bit of a desperate situation here. As Heagyth rolled the body over with her paw, she immediately spotted just what she was looking for; an iron tower kite shield! <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYes!\u201d</b></span> Heagyth felt like she could jump for joy. She had trained extensively with these back during her prime, and even now, she felt like she could pretty reliably deflect the hollow\u2019s arrows long enough to close the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hid just around the corner for a few more moments, working up her courage\u2026 before finally emerging into the open, raising her shield in front of her head and torso. The moment the hollow saw movement, he let loose his arrow aimlessly, sending it flying straight towards Heagyth\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Heagyth braced her arm, absorbing the force of the impact with her shoulder as the arrow simply bounced off her shield. She kept the shield in front of her upper body as she sprinted forward with renewed vigor, trying to close the distance before he could fire off another shot. With her limp, though, she just couldn\u2019t make it fast enough; by the time she peeked over her shield again, she just got a brief glimpse of the hollow fleeing, disappearing around a corner. Heagyth groaned, lowering her shield. The hollow was probably trying to lure her into a trap or something\u2026 and even if she does catch him, what would she do? She doesn\u2019t have much in the way of weaponry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was trying to come up with another plan, Heagyth stumbles upon another body, this one lying on the ground near where the hollow had once been standing, an arrow in its belly area. Just like the Heagyth she had seen before, the once-beautiful wolf anthro seemed to have been mostly stripped of her armor... and, judging by her position, the hollow had had his way with her before she passed. Now Heagyth knew why the hollow had attacked her without provocation. That was a favored tactic among the hollows; mortally wounding their targets in battle, so they\u2019re too weak to resist the hollow\u2019s wild lust or hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeagyth was about to simply pass the body by, too disgusted by what had happened here\u2026 until she noticed a flash of steel; the familiar glint of a fine iron weapon! Surely enough, lying on the ground a few feet away from the corpse was an impeccably designed broadsword, pristine in every sense except for the drops of dried blood on the blade. Heagyth took the broadsword excitedly in her free hand, swinging it around and getting a feel for its weight and balance. It was exactly like the swords she used as a knight, and felt natural in her grip. Imbued with confidence, Heagyth took one last glimpse at the cloudy, gray sky, before disappearing back into the dark hallways of the asylum, chasing after the depraved hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeagyth sighed in exasperation as she was forced to hobble up yet another long set of stairs, trying not to lose her footing beneath the dim lighting of the asylum\u2019s torches. Still, she kept her shield raised, knowing that the hollow that attacked her was probably lying in wait at the top of the stairs. Sure enough, the second she emerged into view at the top of the staircase, she felt another arrow bounce harshly off her iron shield, taking her by surprise and almost knocking her back. She looked up in surprise to see the hollow quickly reaching into his quiver, trying to ready another shot. Not this time, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the hollow could prepare another shot, the former knight was upon him. The hollow groaned loudly as Heagyth sent her longsword slashing diagonally along his chest, staggering him back and causing him to drop his arrow. Heagyth gave the undead no quarter, striking again before the hollow could regain his composure, slashing so ferociously that her blade bounced against the stone walls of the hall, throwing up sparks. With a dry gurgle, the hollow fell to his knees, his expression unchanging as he collapsed to the ground. Heagyth stood over him, panting with exhaustion as the adrenaline rush wore off. That was the first kill she\u2019s had in awhile. It felt good to absorb his souls, knowing she's avenged his unfortunate victims...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">+20 Souls!</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, the asylum\u2019s been pretty claustrophobic\u2026 but this next building seemed pretty refreshingly expansive, with multiple stories to explore. Just as Heagyth was about to get down to business, she was startled by the crashing of what seemed like a part of the roof collapsing, followed by a pained groan. Heagyth peaked into the room, seeing the knight from before lying battered and wounded on a pile of collapsed bricks. His clothes were torn, and his pants had been ripped off completely; apparently, the asylum demon had had some fun with the poor knight. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cY-you?\u201d</b></span> She asks, curiously stepping into the room. Heagyth didn\u2019t trust the knight, but with his current state, he didn\u2019t seem to be in any shape to attack her. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWho are you? Why did you rescue me?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight coughed loudly, his voice sounding dry and raspy through his helm. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cJust\u2026 wanted to assist a fellow knight\u2026\u201d</b></span> Heagyth\u2019s fluffy ears perked up at the sound of his familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cO-Oscar?\u201d</b></span> She said, wide-eyed as she dropped her sword and shield on the ground beside her and lifted off her helmet, letting her long hair flow freely down her back. She kneels down by the defeated knight, sadly inspecting his wounds. Hearing him cough again, she decided to slide his helmet off to give him some room to breathe, revealing the face of a familiar fox. Indeed, even though he was undead now, Heagyth easily recognized him as that legendary warrior from Astora, whom she had looked up to when she was just a squire. Despite the pain, the fox couldn\u2019t help but smile slyly when he looked up at Heagyth\u2019s beautiful face. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cSad we had to meet again in such\u2026 dreary circumstances,\u201d</b></span> Oscar said sadly, in that same suave voice. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m already so close to hollow\u2026 I fear that, in a few moments\u2026 won\u2019t be myself anymore.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeagyth\u2019s heart sunk. Oscar was one of the few warriors she knew that she respected; if he went hollow, she might just lose all hope. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cJust\u2026stay with me,\u201d</b></span> the fox begs, averting eye contact as if ashamed to even ask. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI know it\u2019s\u2026 dangerous, but I beg you, in my last moments of sanity, I don't want to be\u2026 alone.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOf course,\u201d</b></span> Heagyth nodded, dutifully sitting cross-legged by the fox\u2019s side. It was actually a relief to be able to take a break from all the walking, finally able to give her sprained ankle a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYour ankle\u2026\u201d</b></span> Oscar frowns, observant as ever. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAre you injured?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI, uh\u2026 might\u2019ve fallen down the stairs,\u201d</b></span> Heagyth admits sheepishly, feeling a little embarrassed although Oscar looked completely understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re undead, right?\u201d</b></span> He asked, weakly reaching into one of his bags. Before she could respond, the fox pulled out a long, stone flask, glowing with some kind of vibrant orange liquid. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cHere. You\u2019re undead, right? Have a sip of this.\u201d</b></span> Heagyth accepted the flask, finding it felt strangely warm in her paws. She trusted Oscar enough to just throw her head back and take a swig, without even asking about the contents. The liquid felt pleasantly warm in her throat, and tingled in her belly, sending tiny spasms of ecstasy up her spine. She giggled a bit, almost wriggling in place at the delightful feeling of the flask\u2019s effects\u2026 and by the time it wore off, Heagyth realized her ankle didn\u2019t hurt anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d</b></span> Heagyth smiled, her tail wagging involuntarily as she realized the flask must\u2019ve been some sort of healing item. She tried to hand it back to him, only for the fox to push her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cKeep it. It can be refilled repeatedly, as long as you have access to a fire,\u201d</b></span> he insists, and Heagyth obliges, attaching the flask to her belt. Oscar tries to sit up, though he seemed to struggle. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 been trying to make it away from this place, but that demoness\u2026 hrgh!\u201d</b></span> He groaned as a sudden burst of pain swept through his body, as he grew progressively weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThere, there, Oscar. I'm here, I'm here\u2026\u201d</b></span> Heagyth immediately take him gently into her arms, trying to soothe his pain, resting his head against her chest as she held him closer. He didn\u2019t have long now. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cJust rest\u2026 everything will be okay\u2026\u201d</b></span> She whispered gently into his ears as she tried to comfort him in his final moments as best she could. Eventually, though, Oscar grew a little bit uncomfortable with the close contact. It had been so long since she had been intimate with a woman, and his undeath has been driving him to lecherous thoughts. He tried to pull away from her, but Heagyth didn\u2019t even notice his struggles. She only noticed his predicament when she looked down to see the fox\u2019s impressive shaft, fully unsheathed and exposed to the cool air. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</b></span> She says in monotone, as Oscar\u2019s blood runs cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI-I\u2019m dreadfully sorry, miss!\u201d</b></span> Oscar apologized profusely, although Heagyth wasn\u2019t offended in the slightest. The fox was just about to desperately explain himself, until he was taken aback by the sound of the woman\u2026 chuckling? The fox looked up at her in confusion, only to find they were both blushing profusely. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cEven in undeath, you are a\u2026 sight for sore eyes\u2026\u201d</b></span> Indeed, undeath seemed to have strange effects on the libido, and the two former colleagues both found eachother a tempting sight. Perhaps Heagyth could try another method of soothing the poor fox\u2019s pain?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Heagyth smiled a bright, radiant smile as Oscar shivered in embarrassment, unable to move as his burning, rigid shaft was exposed to the beautiful knight. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, Oscar,\u201d</b></span> she giggles, a little excited herself. While she had been chaste in life and genteel in life, ever since her death, Heagyth has had\u2026 licentious desires she\u2019s never been tempted by before. It was a strange feeling, to have your libido suddenly spring to life after having been so dormant\u2026 like a fire had been set inside her. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI hope I may give you some comfort in these dark times, if you\u2019d be willing\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOscar was conflicted. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be noble for a knight to indulge such carnal pleasures outside of wedlock\u2026 but he wasn\u2019t really a knight anymore, was he? He was one of the undead, now, ostracized from respectable society and discharged from his chivalrous service. Besides, Heagyth had always been admirable for her beauty. Sure, in undeath, the canine woman\u2019s fur had fallen out in patches, and her skin had become pale and sickly\u2026 but her body was still just as curvy and beautiful as it had been in life. It had been so long since he had felt the touch of a woman, especially one as dashing as Heagyth. He closed his eyes, nodding silently in humiliation\u2026 only to hear the ruffling of the canine sliding off her gauntlets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOscar watched silently, his inquisitive eyes glowing through the darkness as she watched Heagyth disrobe. Just how far was she planning on taking this, he wondered? Heagyth had been the picture of modesty in life. He had never seen her act so\u2026 unladylike. The sly, sultry smile on her face surprised and excited him in equal measures. Heagyth sat on her heels, slowly sliding off the boiled leather sleeves of her armor, and letting the steel pauldrons slip to the ground with a dull clank. With her natural flexibility, she had no problem unbuckling her leather cuirass, slipping it over her head and tossing it aside to join the pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost half-naked, now, besides the thick cloth sash wrapped around her chest, binding her breasts for ease of movement in battle. Her body was as sylphlike as it was athletic, her apparent, well-maintained musculature almost at odds with her thin, feminine shape. Instead of seeing her as she was, Oscar couldn\u2019t help envision her as the woman she used to be; youthful, alive, covered in that pristine, silk-like fur he so missed. Still, he counted his blessings. Heagyth giggled, seeing his reaction, as she lifted one arm and gripped the binder by the bottom with the other, lifting it up and over her shoulders. Oscar was wide-eyed as the canine\u2019s breasts finally slid free, still as youthfully perky and full as they ever were, despite their impressive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cNow we\u2019re on even terms, no? So there\u2019s no need to be so shy\u2026\u201d</b></span> The canine chuckled, flattered when the fox couldn\u2019t help but stare, enraptured\u2026 but eventually, he caught himself and looked quickly away, trying to retain some misguided sense of class. Heagyth frowned. Oscar was obviously just as excited as she was, but it didn\u2019t seem like his heart was in it. Perhaps his code of chivalry required him to have a modicum of chastity, but Heagyth just wished he could be open and honest about how he felt\u2026 it was no matter, though. She just had to try something he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOscar watched as she leaned over, her elbows bracing against the stone ground as she parted her lips just inches away from the fox\u2019s manhood. Excitement rose in her chest as she admired it; it looked healthy then the rest of him, vibrantly pink with a bulging knot. She held there for a second, making it obvious what she was about to do\u2026 and when the fox didn\u2019t protest, she took that as a sign of consent, and quickly slid her tongue up along the length of his shaft. He tensed up by instinct, as if surprised by her move, but did not complain. The fox was breathing a little harder now as he looked down, and watched the beautiful canine bathe his manhood with her tongue, her eyes filled with reverence beyond what he even deserved. His heart melted at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a canine, Heagyth was quite skilled with her tongue; she could probably finish him off right here and now, if she so desired. Instead, though, she moved slowly and deliberately, her real intention being to simply lube him up. Soon, his shaft was glistening wet with saliva, and dripping bits of pre onto the fur of his belly. Satisfied with the results, Heagyth crawled upwards and laid down beside Oscar, curling up by his side as she tried to get comfortable on their \u2018bed\u2019 of cold bricks. With one hand, she pulled Oscar closer, letting him rest his dizzy head on her soft breasts as she cuddled him against her; at the same time, she wrapped her other hand around his waiting shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy to slide her hand up and down the fox\u2019s impressive lubricated length. Painfully slowly at first, until the fox was burning with anticipation, before \u2018rewarding\u2019 his patience by gently twisting her wrist as she brought her delicate hand down from his tip to his knot, making him gasp slightly. All of his inhibitions had faded away as he started humping against her hand instinctively, without even realized it; she giggled at his eagerness, stroking him off with gradually increasing vigor. It didn\u2019t take much to get an undead off; Heagyth was almost disappointed when he reached his climax after only a couple of minutes, his body tensing up against her\u2019s as his seed was sprayed all over the stone floor. She quickly remembered, though, that the undead also apparently have no refractory period\u2026 and seconds after his orgasm, the fox was thirsty for more. Heagyth smirked, setting herself to a new task of making the desperate fox cum until he simply couldn\u2019t take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox was panting outwardly at this point, exhausted as the canine rocked him with orgasm after orgasm, his grunts and moans muffled her pillowy breasts. Having the handsome fox so wrapped around her finger was exciting to Heagyth. Though while she felt a distinct wetness between her legs, her priority at the moment was simply to comfort the fox; her own needs could be handled after she was finished escaping the asylum. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cShhh\u2026 I\u2019ll take care of you, Oscar\u2026\u201d</b></span> Heagyth whispered soothingly whenever Oscar seemed to shy away from her touch, ashamed of his own desires. Her tail wagged in excitement behind her, always eager to see the blissful look that arose on his face every time he came. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026 everything\u2019s going to be okay\u2026 there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after jizzing all over the floor in front of him for the sixth time in the same half-hour, Oscar finally stopped bucking his hips, going completely limp as exhaustion overcame him. Seeing that he had hit his limit, Heagyth pulled away, her hand absolutely soaked with cum. Oscar was breathing deeply and hoarsely, his eyes clenched shut as he lies limply nuzzled against the canine, his cheek resting against her breast. Eventually, he slides open his eyes to see the beautiful, enchanting face of Heagyth smiling back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two of them had cleaned off and gotten their bearings. The floor in front of Oscar was still covered in a truly prodigious amount of jizz, which neither of the two was going to bother cleaning, as the halls of the asylum were already encrusted with dried cum already. With all the undead running around here, this was just a drop in the bucket. Heagyth seemed to be in bright spirits as she slipped her armor back on, while Oscar just laid there in complete silence, as if contemplating something. Eventually, he spoke up for the first time since this started. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYou should go.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhat?\u201d</b></span> Heagyth frowned, kneeling down by his side. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m not just going to leave you.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough f\u2019r me,\u201d</b></span> he says grimly,<span class=\"corange\"><b> \u201cbut if it\u2019d be true you care that much, I wilt ask of you\u2026 one final wish.\u201d</b></span> Oscar sits up with a shiver, ignoring the pain, to talk to the canine at eye-level. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI came here on a mission\u2026 but it seems I must pass the torch. I was on a pilgrimage\u2026 to the land of the ancient lords. You must go there. Ring the Bell of Awakening. From there, the path will be clear\u2026\u201d</b></span> He reached weakly into one of the bags clasped to his armored breastplate, and pulled free a brown, rusty key, holding it out for the canine. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cAye, but take this. You\u2019ll need it in your escape\u2026\u201d</b></span> Heagyth hesitated, sadly, but eventually accepted the key, slipping it into her own bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</b></span> Heagyth asked, the concern obvious in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOscar let out a deep chuckle. <span class=\"corange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I think you\u2019ve\u2026 given me some hope,\u201d</b></span> he reassures her, although they both know this would be the last time they see eachother. Heagyth stares into his eyes for a few, quiet moments, her expression unreadable\u2026 until she suddenly leaned forward and kissed him, taking him into her arms as she was overcome by passion. Oscar was surprised by this, but quickly melted in her touch, closing his eyes and wrapped his arms around her back as they locked lips. Eventually, the fox had to pull away, having to lie back on the cold ground out of sheer exhaustion. Heagyth gave her one last, sad look as she backed away, slipping on her helm and picking up her gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201c... I\u2019ll miss you,\u201d</b></span> Heagyth whispered, the fox remaining silent as he laid there, eyes closed, a smile on his face. Eventually, Heagyth brought herself to leave him there, trying to refocus on escaping this cursed place. Now that her injury had been healed, and she had a few charges of estus, the rest of her escape should be much easier. For this, and many other things, she would be eternally grateful to that handsome fox...</span></div></div>",

One look at her healthy, lush red fur and voluptuous body would make it abundantly clear she takes care of herself. Her breasts are impossibly large and perky, their hefty weight bouncing with each of her steps, and her wide hips and juicy ass give her a perfect hourglass figure. In one hand she holds a Dark Silver Tracer, a cruel, barbed and poisoned weapon for stabbing the unwary, and strapped to her opposite hip is its partner, the Gold Tracer, a beautiful curved blade that causes profuse bleeding as it effortlessly rends flesh. She has traveled far across the dangerous landscapes of this decrepit world to acquire such treasures, especially for one at such a low soul level as herself. But that's forgetting Selina's favorite weapon of all: her Dark Hand, a malevolent energy clutched within her palm that allows her to grab other Undead and suck the Humanity from their body as they still live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she, too, was once a scrawny, cowardly thief desperately crawling her way out of the Undead Asylum, Selina has since evolved into a ruthless traveling assassin. Somewhere along her journey she discovered an affinity for invading other worlds to have her way with the unfortunate souls within, Undead just like her struggling to find their way. For this existence is not a merciful one. The weak and empathetic are crushed under the feet of the strong, becoming stepping stones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite all the power that has come into her possession, Selina desires no greater place in the world. After singlehandedly murdering the ghostly Four Kings, she met a serpent who bade her to travel the land and collect the souls of Lords to usher in a new age of Darkness. Selina was barely listening as the thing flapped its gums, but she happily accepted its gift of the Dark Hand and a Red Eye Orb, which she now uses to freely invade the weaklings in worlds neighboring her own. She has stolen many souls from the fallen, but she has no desire to use them to obtain any more power; no, she is happy right where she is, among the pitiable fools just beginning their journey who are so easily beaten and dominated. The males, especially, when not frozen in terror of her, are easily coerced into becoming her plaything; with her plump, fuzzy breasts and scrumptious ass barely contained within her black leather armor, who wouldn't be tempted? But those males rarely understand what they're signing on for until her trousers come off and they meet the throbbing black fox shaft eager to violate their inner sanctum. Her cock stiffens slightly just from the thought of all the males she's rutted. Oh yes, being a world-invading Darkwraith suits Selina perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon enough the orb vibrates wildly and she closes her eyes as she is transported across realms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ominous screech-like noise resonates through the air as a deep red pool of spirit energy coalesces in the ground. From that pool slowly arises the ghostly form of the voluptuous fox with daggers in hand. The owner of this world, wherever they are, has surely just been made aware of the dark spirit's invasion and been instilled with dread of what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina smirks, glancing around.

No matter how they run or hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invading fox casually trots across rooftops, down hallways and around corners, passing by all the hollows shuffling about who pay her no mind. Soon enough she hears a clashing of steel in the next room, followed by the wet <i>thump</i> of a body hitting the floor.
