You go to open it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" you say in an annoyed tone.

This is where I'm letting you out. You'll be nothing but shit for me to drop in some stinking hole.\" You sit down a little harder, and he struggles wildly to try and force you off, mainly because you're suffocating him now. You crane your head back to look at him, weak and helpless, unable even to stop your butt from overpowering him. You smile wickedly, licking your lips. His face feels pretty good on your smooth backside, and his screams are stimulating, not to mention how good it feels to put him in his proper place. You start to feel pretty aroused, and sit a little harder before lifting up, his red face gasping for air. <br>\r\n\"You like it? Huh? Answer me, you little shit!\" You sit down again, and his renewed cries are even more pleasant now that he got some fresh air in his lungs. The next time you rise up, he answers quickly.<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! It's the best ass I've ever seen! It's fantastic! Please, please let me go! I'll pay for a White Mage to fix your tail! You can sit on me anytime you like! Please don't eat me!\" He's crying now, what a pussy!<br>\r\n\"Ha! You little queer! You like my ass, huh? You wanna be my seat? Fag!\" You sit down again, rubbing your butt up and down on his sobbing face. The next time you lift yourself up, he grabs your tail and starts licking it. You raise a fist to break his skull for hurting your already injured tail, but then notice that it does feel a little better now. The more he frantically licks and soothes it, the less painful it is. When he sees that you look slightly less angry, he lets go of your tail and reaches into his pocket pulling out a bag of money. \"See? I can pay for a white mage! I'll do anything!

It started when you were playing around with a human friend named Zan, wrestling together in your house. Teasing him, you pretended to catch him with your ears, then your mouth. But it was much easier to hold his arm in your mouth than you expected. And before either of you knew what was happening, you were swallowing him down, and he was squirming in your stomach. You treated it like a joke, though he was worried; and yet the longer he was in there, the more he seemed to enjoy it. It was easy to hear what he was saying with your very sensitive ears, and he described it like being in a sauna, hot and wet and comfortable. Eventually, he fell asleep, and was peacefully digested by your stomach. You were upset at first about losing your friend, but you noticed the next day that you had grown just a little fatter. It had always been your dream to be seen as less scrawny, and now you had a way to do it. You began to get friendly with other humans, becoming a drinking buddy to many. At the end of a lot of nights, you would be the one to walk some poor drunk home. They usually made it there, but sometimes they would simply disappear. No one suspected you, as you were careful to only meet your marked meals halfway to their house before you lured them into a dark alley and swallowed them. Every one of them contributed to just a little more muscle mass, and they were always too drunk to care that they were being eaten, so there was no guilt.

Soon you swallow his shoulders which makes it so your jaws and go closer together since all that is left is smaller parts or this large male. Within a minute all left of him outside of you is his tail, so you finally get a chance to savor his flavor for a few seconds before the last swallow sends all of the guild leader into your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on your side and look at the bulge in your stomach and too your surprise it is stretched at least three times the size as your body and the prey is still asleep.
