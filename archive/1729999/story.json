His dad's giant cock was in him and felt like it was tearing him apart. The cock hit a spot inside Simba and made him yell in pleasure. Mufasa made sure to keep hitting that spot and got Simba panting and moaning in pleasure.<br>\r\n\"Dad. More. Faster.\"<br>\r\nMufasa complied and went faster.With a final thrust, Mufasa roared loudly as he ejaculated inside Simba while the cub released on the ground. Mufasa teleased so much that Simba's stomach started to swell and overflow so some was coming out of his mouth. Mufasa pulled himself out of his son after his high had died down and Simba swallowed all the seed in his mouth as he clenched his butt to make sure none escaped. He panted and looked up at Mufasa.<br>\r\n\"Dad, can you punish me more tomorrow?\"<br>\r\nMufasa smiled as everything worked exactly as he had planned.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"</span></div></div>",

He tried to shrug off the added weight he was walking around with, though being tired very often didn't help and neither did this new bug diet. Pumba was thinking that the young lion was just eating a lot of bugs, too much for his size, but it wasn't a problem with how many were available.

Do you guys know what I could be sick with? Has this ever happened to you two before?\" Simba asked, hoping for some answer to his predicament.<br>\r\n\"Never in our lives. You've been eating the same bugs as we have, and none of them made us like...\" Timon points to the round and profound stomach of Simba \"that,\" Simba gulps in fear.<br>\r\n\"Now I may not be the smartest pig in the world...\" Pumba says<br>\r\n\"That's for sure,\" Timon imterupts.<br>\r\n\"But the clues tell me that Simba could be pregnant!\"<br>\r\nSimba and Timon stood there in shock in what the warthog just said.

What you have must be...\" Timon rubbed Simba's hard belly, trying to think up something to make the cub feel better, \"congestion or something\" This did not make Simba feel better.

I don't know how, but you are,\" Timon just couldn't correctly convey any emotions, his mind being mixed up with too many at the moment to say anything. Until he just thought up of a different question. \"Hold up, hold up here,\" Pumbaa stopped dancing around to hear what his buddy has to say. \"If you're the.... the mother, then who is the father?\" Pumbaa also now wonders that too.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it couldn't have been us. Could it Timon?\" Pumbaa glances at Timon with the evil eye, wondering if he did anything naughty.<br>\r\n\"Of course I didn't!\" Timon yells out.<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Pumbaa looks away from Timon, and looks back at Simba, changing his face from questioning to concern.<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Simba thinks back, and comes up with one possible explanation. \"Well, when I used to live in the Pride Lands, before my father died, he used to <i>punish me</i>,\" Simba stated punish in a way to make sure they all knew what he's trying to get at.<br>\r\n\"Punish you? What do you mean by that? Were you a bad kid or something? What could that possibl-oh. Oooohh. OHHH!\" Timon feel back by accident, but didn't want to get back up and stared at the sky.<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't get it. What does you mean Simba?\" Pumbaa looks at Simba, but Simba puts his head down, looking away from his companions. Pumbaa changes his eyesight from Simba to Timon. Pumbaa crouches down and whispers his question to Timon. \"Uh, so what does he mean?\" Timon places his hand on the side of his mouth an on Pumbaas ear to whisper back to him.<br>\r\n\"OOHH! So your daddy's there daddy!\" Pumbaa says and points with his hoof to Simba's 'large exterior.'<br>\r\nSimba nods and hides his face from his friends. He remembers the many times he was <i>punished</i>. Oh that amazing feeling it was, his fathers large erect penis entering his holes, in and out, in and out. He wishes it was done again so, but knew the wrongness of it all in hindsight. But still.<br>\r\nThe three stayed mostly quite for the rest of the day, as they were looking for extra food to give to the swollen Simba for him and the child he carries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night now, all three were asleep in close proximities of each other, but Simba slept slightly farther from his friends than usual. Simba dreamed of the days when his father was around. The good times he had, the bad, the sexual, and his death, his dreams turning into dark nightmares with his friends mocking him constantly, the ridicule he'll get if he returns to the Pride Lands. His last image of the dream was of the baby, giant and monstrous, swiping at Simba with big boney claws, biting him with ferocious teeth, furless and dark-eyed. He wakes up in fear, his heart beating quickly due to the nightmare, he new this couldn't be good for the baby.

That'll be wrong, plus you're our friend. Friends don't abandon friends!\" Simba stopped munching and remembered what he could of done last night. And they were right, friends don't abandon each other.<br>\r\nA few days later, it felt like it was back to normal in the Oasis. Everyone eating bugs, relaxing, saying 'Hakuna Matata' and what not. It was fun, it felt great, and Simba felt happy. But there was one thing bugging his mind. The Pride Lands. His old home. How was it? Do the people know what happened to him? Do they think he's dead? Who's running the pack? Is it Uncle Scar? All these things running through his mind, no worries turning into great worries. Simba went to Timon to tell him of his troubles.<br>\r\n\"Simba, calm down. Hakuna Matata! All this stress is not good for the baby anyway,\" Timon places his hand on Simba's round and big stomach.<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...\" Simba got into total silence, he felt pain in his belly, a great deal of pain. \"OWWW!\" <br>\r\nTimon takes his hand off Simba's stomach. \"Simba, are you alright? Did I hurt you? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\nSimba roared back in pain. He did not know this, but he was feeling some contractions right now, a pain no cub should ever feel. Pumbaa heard the roar and ran to his friends, and Simba eventually got to talking again.<br>\r\n\"My belly hurts. I don't think it was you Ti-argh!' His pain came up spiking as high as it could, but Simba had enough strength to talk still. \"I think this is pregnancy pain, maybe. I remember one time a pregnant lion at my old pack feeling strong pain,\" The poor cub's voice sounded weak with each passing word. \"Besides, I don't think my body can take this pregnancy at my age,\"<br>\r\n\"Do you know how they helped ease the pain?\" Pumbaa asked.<br>\r\n\"There was this monkey that had some strange powder with him and he rubbed the powder on the lionesses belly. I think that helped a bit,\" The little lion said.<br>\r\n\"Okay then, Timon, rub his belly,\" The pig ordered.<br>\r\n\"What are you crazy? The kid said we needed a powder, we don't have a powder, or anything that could help, I don't know how to help him anyway!\" Timon cried out. Simba roared in pain once more, and Timon decided that maybe rubbing could help.<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay I'll do it,\" Timon places his hand on Simba's stomach and rubbed slowly as possible in a circular motion. Simba felt the rubbing and calmed down a bit. The rubbing didn't stopped the pain, but he felt so much pleasure from it that it counteracted against the pain. Oh did it feel good for Simba, he started to moan in pleasure instead of roaring in pain. Coincidently, the pain went down, but he didn't tell his friends just yet. Simba hasn't felt this good since his punishment sessions with his father.<br>\r\nEventually the cub told Timon to stop and said that it helped, saying that if he's ever in pain like that again, he should rub his belly.<br>\r\nA few days have passed, and there wasn't another contraction incident. Instead the cub looked up to the blue day sky, wondering what he should do. Stay here or go back to his old home? Simba decided that he should go to the Pride Lands at least one more time to show everyone that he was alive, and that he was with child. So he went to his friends, both had mixed feelings on this because of the fact that they would look delicious to the lions, but Simba guaranteed their safety. Timon and Pumbaa huddled together to make a decision.<br>\r\n\"So this is a crazy idea,\" Timon stated.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, he wants to make sure to his family that he's okay,\"<br>\r\n\"We don't see our family, plus he may be okay, but we're a second course lunch to any beasts where he's from,\"<br>\r\n\"He guaranteed,\"<br>\r\n\"He's a bloated balloon,\" The two stayed huddled and quite, both thinking what's better, all of their safety or Simba's mental welfare.

He only seeks power, and with that power, such feeble things as happiness, love, and respect, all will come once he reaches it. However, there are two obstacles that are in his way, his brother, and his nephew. He sometimes tries to teach his nephew his ways, but alas there is a bird that tires to get in his way. Still, after a failed attempt to at least get the boy out of the way with the help of some hyenas in the Elephant Graveyard, he thought of a new plan. A dastardly plan. All he needed is some time alone with Simba...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the day after, and Scar lured Simba into coming with him to the middle of a gorge. Scar's new plan involved ordering his hyenas to cause a stampede with horde of Wildebeest, that will hopefully kill the boy, along with his brother, who he will inform of the stamped and die with his son. Oh yes, it was absolutely perfect! Though, there was an urge Scar couldn't handle well. An urge that drives him to think terrible thoughts An urge that could be a non-issue if only he took up his brothers offer to mate with any of the lionesses that are ruled under him. Scar pinned his eyes on Simba, and he decided to pull one last trick before his plan takes action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Simba, your farther-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, where is my dad?\" Simba interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar sighed, \"Your father will be coming soon. But I do have a question. Did he punish you for the trouble you caused yesterday?\" Scar gave Simba an intense look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba huddled back slightly, \"Not-not really. He scolded me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?! A little talking to? Oh my oh my, maybe I shouldn't have invited you here since you weren't punished,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Scar, please, I'll make up for what I did, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure you will... for I will have to punish you myself,\" Scar grinned sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba gulped, \"What, what will you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around and life your behind in the air,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was shocked and confused at this request, but he still did it, \"Okay, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay still,\" Scar's heart was pumping rapidly, his limbs were shaking, his emotions were steaming of passion, \"Good, good, now stay quiet as I punish you!\" Scar got on top of Simba and shoved his slowly hardening cock in Simba's tight asshole. Simba was surprised and cried out in pain, \"I said keep quiet!\" Scar ordered, to which Simba tried to keep as quiet as possible. Scar proceeded to deflower his nephew. He moved his hips in a rhythmic motion, back and forth in Simba, who was crying silently, his eyes watering, feeling shame for what he did. Scar only went faster and harder, tearing up Simba's little butt-hole, roaring in passion as he was fucking him. Though this wasn't enough, his ego demanded he saw his nephew's eyes in pain. Scar took out his hard cock, throbbing, ready to blow a load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba, now I need you to roll on your back for the second half of the punishment!\" Scar's voice was more excited than usual, more energetic and lively. Simba obeyed and rolled, his eyes looking dead-set in his uncle's. Scar licked Simba's face and whispered in his ear, \"I do this because I care for you...\" Scar lied to Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil lion then slowly inserted his large member into the young cub, seeing his nephews eyes squirm as his dick was being forced inside his nephew's just made Scar's day even better for him. He started the motion again, starting out slow, to really drag out Simba's 'punishment', and with each passing minute, he goes faster, and harder, and faster, and harder, and faster, and harder into the cub. Simba couldn't hold back his tears at all, and Scar was laughing all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time, time for Scar to understand what happiness was. He blew his load into the cub, causing both of them to feel wet and sticky. Inside Simba, something strange will occur. Simba was special for reasons almost no one knows. He was the only male in his pride to carry a cub, and now, he will carry Scar's child, whether he wanted to or not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scar finished, he huffed and puffed, and felt dirty. He felt terrible. He saw Simba crying with blank eyes, and he ran far away. He commanded the hyenas to start the stampede and he dashed to his brother to continue on with his plan.</span></div></div>",

He didn't mind the hornbill's devotion to his duty or the bird's expectation that he'd be devoted to his, because he'd found of out late that although he was a pompous, highly-strung worrier, he was also possessed of a good if biting wit, and a great many anecdotes that helped while away the long hours.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nDays passed one after another, filled to the brim, but with little of note. Simba had given little thought to the feeling of a weight in his gut since the first day, waiving it off most of the time as a result of eating too much the night before. This wasn't to say it wasn't noticeable, indeed several of the lionesses had noticed a certain rounding of the king's stomach quite early on, which confused them slightly as he was not a particularly big eater. The more time passed though the more lionesses began to take notice, until eventually his mate Nala decided that the issue needed mentioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been feeling unwell lately,\" Nala asked Simba quietly one morning, still unable to bring herself to criticise her mate and the father of the cubs growing within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, no,\" Simba replied, \"why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just that some of the lionesses have noticed you seem to be getting a little round in the belly,\" Nala replied, \"I just wondered if you had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until now, no,\" Simba replied, looking back and trying to examine himself closely, he couldn't see anything obvious, but perhaps it wasn't visible from this angle, moving his paw back over the supposedly offending area, he suddenly thought of the odd weight he'd been feeling in there for a while, was that the cause of his supposed expansion? \"I'll go and see Rafiki first thing this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing,\" Nala asked, a slightly rakish smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the first thing when I set out at least,\" Simba replied.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"An unusual weight you say,\" Rafiki asked gravely, as he examined Simba's abdomen, noting carefully, the unusual, slightly swollen area. This was worrying him though he didn't show it for the swelling was too solid to be simply excessive flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and then this morning Nala said some of the lionesses thought I was looking a bit, um, round in the belly,\" Simba replied, \"could it be just that I'm eating too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlikely,\" Rafiki replied, \"but what it is I'm not sure, and to be sure I will...\"</span></div></div>",

This wasn't a particularly comforting scene though, because this was exactly how the dream had started too. He wondered for a moment whether it had been a dream at all, then waved it off, yes it must have been a dream, a particularly vivid one, but still a dream. He shuddered, the memory still very vivid in his mind...<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<i>Scar awoke fitfully, feeling something was wrong, but unable to place what was wrong. Looking up at the doorway, he thought he saw movement, and so picking his way carefully between the slumbering lionesses, he went to investigate. Once outside he looked around, but could see nothing unusual, at least until he turned to re-enter the cave, and suddenly found Mufasa standing there, \"M-Mufasa, b-but you-you're.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead, yes,\" Mufasa said severely, \"by your paw, brother, by your paw.\" Scar tried to speak, but found himself unable to utter a sound, though his brother made up for that, by saying, \"you will come with me.\" And suddenly the slim lion found his body to no longer be under control as he followed his stout, powerful brother down into the silent grasslands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes he tried to ask, \"what-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be silent,\" Mufasa replied, And Scar suddenly found himself unable to utter a word. The further they got from Pride Rock, the more confused the dark lion became, where were they going, and to what end? At length, they came upon the gorge, and he began to get an inkling, did his brother intend to get revenge for the murder by doing the same to him here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought was proven false when Mufasa led Scar down into the gorge, right to the spot where in life his body had landed. Once there, he said, \"ancestors, I have brought you my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar looked around fearfully as the walls began to change, becoming faces, some of which he recognised instantly, his mother and father, but most he took longer over before realising who they were, and some he didn't recognise at all. Suddenly, the air seemed filled with whispers, 'evil, crime, punishment, murder, restitution, fiend'. He tried to shout out, to deny the words, but found himself still unable to utter a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother,\" Mufasa said, bringing Scar to face him as the whispers continued, \"what you did was wrong, and so the you will be punished.\" There was a pause as the slender lion tried desperately to speak, but only his brother was able to, \"but the gods don't demand death, only restitution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis puzzled Scar for several moments, so that he just watched as Mufasa walked around behind him. Then suddenly his brother was on his back, bearing him to the ground. He struggled feebly at fist, then more strongly as something warm and wet began probe her rear beneath his tail. But it was too late, for even as the dark lion struggled, his brother found his mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar wanted to scream as Mufasa thrust into him, but all that emerged was a pitiful mewl. Scar continued to struggle for a few moments, before a new situation was brought to his attention, that of his belly. At first it was just in the centre, but as the moments passed, it began to spread outwards. As this continued, his brother said, \"you will be my restitution brother, you will bring me forth again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar struggled futilely for several minutes as Mufasa continued to thrust, inflating his belly, and then suddenly the dark lion felt his brother step away from him and thump to the ground. Getting up, the dark lion was taken aback to see that his brother had fallen over into exactly the posture he'd died in. Noth that this was the only change of course, for looking back at himself, he saw his normally slender frame sporting a bloated belly, and then to hammer home the situation, it suddenly gave a kick.</i><br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nScar ran a paw down his flank, admiring its slender profile, and imagining with some distaste, the thought of it being bloated out as in the dream. He quickly threw the thought aside, no, it had been but a vivid dream, that was all. Even as he lay down again so sleep though, he couldn't rid himself of a slight feeling of doubt, but that mattered little, it wouldn't prevent him from sleeping.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nA week passed, and then another, and for Scar things were going well, at least until...</span></div></div>",

With his father, Ahadi, entering the latter stages of middle-age, and he himself rapidly approaching adulthood, Mufasa had been given the duty of patrolling the lands in place of the King. The elder lion\u2019s idea had two benefits. It gave the heir some much-needed experience for when the crown would eventually pass to him, and it also allowed the King and Queen to spend more time together in the evenings than they had in years. Admittedly, his father\u2019s intelligent diplomacy had left the Pridelands with few unfriendly faces, so his task was relatively easy. In fact, Mufasa had only been sent out this particular evening because a rogue had been scented in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly, Mufasa would do a good job of intimidating any interloper into second-guessing himself. His golden body was very large and stocky, blessed with great strength that caused his haunches to bulge with each step. Despite being a season or two from leaving adolescence, his thick, red mane covered most of his head, neck and shoulders, framing his broad face and equally wide muzzle. He was truly an impressive sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept his amber gaze vaguely over the horizon, but his eyes were not focussed. Instead, his thoughts were concentrated on a certain lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sarabi.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking of her name caused a great warmth to flood his chest, and yet simultaneously send innumerable tingles dancing down his spine. It was no secret that he utterly adored her; after all, they had been in love with one another for well over a year, ever since he had revealed his feelings to the dark-tan lioness during a late visit to the waterhole. Since then, they had been almost inseparable, even more-so than they had been as cubs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was an\u2026unusual choice for his affections, considering that most lions his age would consider her friend, Sarafina, to be more attractive. He had to admit that the light lioness was certainly very pretty, and had an infectiously happy outlook, but he found Sarabi much more enticing. It was the image of her strong, graceful form that elicited great desires from deep within, some of which he almost felt the need to chastise himself for they were so decadent. It was her deep wisdom and intellect, and the way that she never seemed bored when he discussed the aspects of his upcoming kingship with her. It was her understated sense of humour, and lingering cubbish mischievous side that would more often that not break up a monotonous time and bring a smile to their muzzles. It was her capacity to care for almost anyone, and to brighten his day with tender licks and nuzzles. It was that gentle smile of hers, and her soft voice that could be either sultry or regal with the merest change of emphasis. But, most of all, it was the way that everything just felt so much more complete when they did it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd one thing that felt <i>most</i> complete was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa shook his head violently, and re-focussed his eyes on the landscape ahead. As much as he would have liked to visit those particular memories, he had a duty to attend to. It would be difficult to ward off rogues with his mind in a loving, lustful haze. With a sigh, and a stationary moment to fully cleanse his thoughts, he ploughed on to the very corner of the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was almost embracing the earth once again by the time he reached the furthest reaches of the Pridelands. The large adolescent was just about to turn around, when he noticed a brown form in the distance. A brown, leonine form with a darker patch. A brown, dark-maned lion that looked to be his size, though probably a little older, dining on what appeared to be the remains of a plump gazelle from a herd that Mufasa remembered passing not too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince felt his breath catch in his chest. As he watched the lion continue to eat, blissfully unaware of his presence, he felt something brewing deep within him. It was a\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For just a moment he cringed slightly and thought of running, but then realised that the roar, though loud, was a fraction high to be a mature lion, so this was likely a young one, or perhaps a male who was slighter than usual, neither of which would be overmuch trouble to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa's ire only rose as he approached the rogue, the male was just standing there instead of running, which he considered unforgivable, rogues were cowards after all weren't they? So full of self-importance was the prince that he wasn't thinking straight, and thus he didn't realise until for too late that the rogue was in fact a little larger than he, and quite mature, perhaps half way between Mufasa and his father Ahadi is terms of age. Even then, this didn't stop him from saying, \"who are you, <i>rogue</i>, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Jaali, youngster,\" the rogue replied coolly, \"and as for what I'm doing here, that should be obvious, even to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your meal ends right now, understood,\" Mufasa replied, \"if you haven't started running by the time-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youngster, if I was you I wouldn't be trying to make demands right now,\" Jaali cut in, \"I'm bigger than you, I'm stronger than you, and I'm a more experienced fighter than you, so buzz off and let me finish my meal, and I <i>might</i> just let you live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa was silent a moment as he realised that the rogue, Jaali did indeed have the advantage, \"a-and if I were to leave you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me,\" Jaali replied, then paused, \"except you're not another rogue are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why does that matter,\" Mufasa asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the last thing I want is to be run out by the local king,\" Jaali replied, \"and if I let you go now then you'll run straight back to him and tell him exactly where I am, and that's something I'm not about to let-hey, come back here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa ran as fast as he could, terrified of what the rogue might have planned for him. Unfortunately for the young prince, his relatively sheltered life mean that he hadn't yet developed the taut, hard musculature needed to run down prey on a regular basis, and so despite the head start it wasn't long before he found himself on the ground, with Jaali atop him. Though he was fearful of his fate, the young lion was too busy gasping for breath to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now normally I'd do something nasty, possibly even lethal at this point,\" Jaali said, \"and indeed I'm going to leave you with something permanent today, but you're lucky, because you've caught be when I'm not in a killing mood.\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nMufasa felt queasy as he stumbled home, not only was his shoulder throbbing from the deep gashes, but his rear was not much better, the rogue really had been rough with him. Not that he was keen for anyone to know <i>that</i> had happened, losing to a rogue who was larger and older than he was hardly shameful, but the 'punishment' he'd been dealt was shameful in the extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Kings of the past, Mufasa, what happened,\" Ahadi said, when he saw his son's condition, \"are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apart from this shoulder, fairly much,\" Mufasa replied, \"as to the 'what', I met a rogue who was bigger than I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this rogue still around,\" Ahadi asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't manage to kill him, so I suppose so,\" Mufasa replied, \"I'm not going to be up to much for a while though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" Ahadi said, \"will you need to get Rafiki to look at that shoulder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think it would be best,\" Mufasa replied.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"I heard what happened,\" Sarabi said, coming forward immediately after Rafiki left, \"I'm sorry-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" Mufasa replied, \"it was my own stupid fault I got into that fight, not yours or anyone else's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi was silent a moment, then said, \"well, you know I'll always be here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for that I'm eternally grateful,\" Mufasa replied, wondering if perhaps he could reveal the <i>other</i> outcome of the encounter to her, he didn't want to carry the knowledge alone - apart from Rafiki, and the mandrill didn't really count on that score - and he didn't dare tell his family, but just maybe she was trustworthy enough?</span></div></div>",

Be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd crept cautiously into the den, a zebra haunch in his jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he approached the other two hyenas, before laying the peace offering down at Banzai's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, now ain't that sweet?\" Shenzi grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd sat with his head cocked slightly to the side, looking at Banzai expectantly. He was hoping this would get him off the hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get lost.\" Banzai growled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd frowned and mumbled something sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go.\" Banzai growled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's ears drooped down and he slunk out of the den with his head down and his tail tucked between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that just ain't fair, Banzai.\" Shenzi sighed. \"Ain't his fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't his fault!?\" Banzai demanded. \"How ain't it his fault? He's the one that did it ain't he? You see me lettin' any other males climb on top of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi rolled her eyes then rolled over onto her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it make you feel better if I let you mate me?\" She asked with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Banzai admitted, digging into the zebra haunch Ed had left for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure he hadn't exactly accepted the peace offering but he had to eat something. After all, he was eating for two now. Or three, depending on how many pups there were growing within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi rolled back over to where she was sitting up again and laid her head down on her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are a hard one to please ain't ya?\" She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanzai rolled his eyes. It was true though. Shenzi had tried almost everything she could think of to cheer him up but so far nothing had proved affective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Eddie didn't mean for this to happen.\" Shenzi told him then. \"He loves you. Just like I do. Now why ya gotta treat him this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His fault.\" Banzai growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but it ain't so bad is it?\" Shenzi tried. \"You always wanted to be a Dad right? And it'll be nice to finally have another girl around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanzai muttered something under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, tough guy?\" Shenzi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said it's a boy.\" Banzai muttered louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure. Cause you know that don't ya?\" Shenzi chuckled, putting a paw to his belly to feel the pup's little movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit it.\" Banzai blushed, embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Think I'll just keep feelin'.\" Shenzi grinned. \"What're ya gonna do about it, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanzai put his head down and looked away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd whimpered from outside the cave, desperately wanting to join his mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanzai rolled his eyes, frustrated still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him come in.\" Shenzi pleaded. \"Poor thing's had enough of your torture already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd whimpered sadly again from outside. It was starting to rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanzai sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in before I change my mind.\" He called to Ed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damaged Hyena wandered into their den slowly, shaking himself off near the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commere' Eddie.\" Shenzi urged him. \"Feel our little puppy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh.\" Banzai growled in protest until Shenzi growled back at him, silencing the upset male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd slunk forward cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, sweet thang. Come on over here.\" Shenzi assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd chuckled softly and approached his two mates, laying down next to them and putting a paw out to feel Banzai's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup was strong. That much was certain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gave a delighted giggle when their unborn little one nudged his paw from inside Banzai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other male laid with his ears drooped and a frown on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured he'd just have to accept this and move on. There really was nothing else he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, it wouldn't be totally bad to have another little male running around the den. Especially now that they'd been allowed into the pridelands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though, why did anything everything always have to happen to him? And only him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breathe, honey.\" Shenzi nuzzled Banzai's face while the laboring male panted in pain on the den floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't...\" He grunted in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd frowned and gave a worried whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Hun. He'll be fine.\" Shenzi assured her other mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanzai groaned as his belly contracted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot of fluid and nasty stuff involved in this giving birth thing and he didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the worst of it though. The worst of it was the unbearable pain he was currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenz I want it out....\" He growled, pain clear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's coming.

I want to take care of what you're carrying in these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm... I mean, after last night I think they must be empty, if you want some more well I'm sure I shot enough around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuka looked around the oasis. It seemed like wherever he had spilled his seed, the buds and blossoms and grass had grown thicker and more hardy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no\", Nazuri blinked with heavy lids and looked over the side of his new lover. \"Did you not know of this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, no,\" he said, smiling sheepishly and looking at Nazuri with a bowed head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is a land of the highest fertility, such that even those without natural ability to bear will still do so. I think that maybe,\" he said, gently rubbing Nuka's balls, \"You might be pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuka's eyes went yellow his pupils tightening in a thousand yard stare. \"I, I'm, you mean, you put,\" He looked down at his swollen balls and rubbed his inner thighs... \"I'm pregant?! How did you, how did they end up in...\" His heart raced and his breathing was erratic. \"What's going to happen to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure, but they'll develop in these things getting bigger and bigger and then eventually you'll have to shoot them out this massive cannon,\" Nazuri rubbed the length of Nuka's member, adding pleasure to his terror. \"In fact, if I can hear them right, it seems like you have...\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe even more. Obviously an even number, but I can just feel them grow here in my paws...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that means I'm gonna... how am I even going to walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, eventually I'll do all your walking for you.

Nazumi rubbed along his full balls every day, and they seemed to double in size every few days. By his lover's estimates, though, even the advanced pace of the Oasis meant he was only halfway along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the increase in size in his manhood had given his body strength all over. Perhaps the increase in flow of hormones and manliness, and no small part due to carrying around such a heavy weight, had added thick muscles to his legs, back, and neck. His mane was growing in with a silky form, still maintaining it's scraggly edges looking like a black cloud in the slightest breeze. But His eyes seemed to strengthen as he looked out on the horizon, like he could see a more glorious day when his pack would rise strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paced around the lake in the middle of the oasis, his balls swinging against his thighs, feeling the heavy kicking within. They had each grown such that they dragged along the ground gently as he moved, his cock growing thicker and longer in preparation of the massive load he was about to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his claim, his lover Nazumi was a fantastic hunter, and he had eaten his fill of the choicest game; hippo, rhino, all wonderful meats to give his ample supply of protein even more weight in his balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday Nazumi came home late, bringing with him... </span></div></div>",
