Both Kyle's dad, who is very tall and largely built, and Brads dad who is similar in stature however slightly shorter, are helping the boys to move in. <br>\r\n'We will be needing these' Brad says holding up some scales which he had decided to bring with him.<br>\r\n'Huh, oh yer, i suppose' says Kyle with a more 'huh, yer right!' attitude inside his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boys are finally done moving in, Kyle's dad suggests a quick stop at Imperion, an all you can eat-all food restaurant which is just down the street from the new boys apartments. Kyle's eyes light up at the suggestion so he turns to Brad to catch his suggestion.<br>\r\n'Erm, i really don't think that we should Kyle, after all we have our first football practice in ages on tuesday and i feel like i've gained a good 3lbs since last term!'<br>\r\n'3lbs, big deal, anyway you can lose that after school tomorrow mate!' says Kyle, 'We can go for a run or something!'<br>\r\n'Errrr, well' Brad is so tempted his mouth starts to water, 'No, sorry Kyle but we can't.' Brad resists his urge for fatty foods.<br>\r\n'Ohh damn, look dad, cheers n all but i guess Brad is right, don't wanna end up like you do i dad!' Kyle says cheekily and receives a playful head-lock from his larger dad.<br>\r\n'Suppose not son. Well if Brads dad doesn't mind we will go and get you some shopping, give you guys time to settle in.' says Kyle's dad letting go of Kyle.<br>\r\n'Sure' replies Brad's dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dads go and Brad and Kyle spend an hour sorting out all their stuff with Brads stereo on full blast. It only took that as their wasn't much stuff to sort, the apartment came with most the furniture anyways. It is situated in a new 'dorm-block' which will house all the new school teens until the end of their two year course. Brad and Kyle are situated on the 5th floor of a 7 floor building, room number 57. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 Minutes later the two dads return and say their goodbyes with a hug n a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had gone Kyle puts the shopping away: Vegetables, Mineral water, Fruit, pasta, chicken, pork and 2 litres of ready mixed athlete weight gain formula - Obviously Brads bag Kyle figure. The next bag had some fruit, some vegetables, one bottle of mineral water, 4 microwavable burgers, fries, chips, 5 bars of your favorite chocolate, 3 milkshakes and a six-pack of beers. 'Good old dad' he murmers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn't realise that Brad was over his shoulder and saw him smiling at the bag of 'goodies'. As quick as a flash Brad pulled Kyle's t-shirt up and over his head, and took his own off. <br>\r\n'LOOK' he said, first mine, describe my stomach!'<br>\r\n'It's tanned, kinda hairy, bit . . . ohh shit Brad your six pack is going.'<br>\r\n'Correct' said Brad in reply, 'Now look at your own!'<br>\r\nKyle looks down and begins 'Tanned, hairy, tone... crap i have lost my six pack! No wait, here it is' Kyle flexes his abs showing slightly through a small layer of softness. 'And here's another' Kyle pulls his beer out of his shopping bag and opens a can. ' Lighten up Brad, its time to chill, and party!' We can keep an eye on our weight every week, but for now lets just enjoy ourselves!'<br>\r\n'Errrm, oh, well what the hell, gimme a can.' Brad grabs a can of beer and the two sit on the sofa, still t-shirt less chugging on the beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is going to be a great year' they both think as the cool beer flows down their throats.</span></div></div>",

He is sat on a chair in front of the TV playing a computer game for 10 seconds then shoving in another chocolate, whilst returning to his game. He has taken off his shirt and put on some shorts, which you have to admit look a little tight on his slightly larger framed body which he still didn't fully admit to have developed. As you realize that you're staring you snap out of it and walk over to the kitchen bit of you apartment, as you do Kyle shouts over to you while having a chocolate break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dude, this was such a goo idea to have a good chill out and forget about having to stay trim for a while.' He eats some more chocolates this time three at a time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh and go and have a chocolate for yourself, they're pretty good. Then you head back over to the kitchen and pick up your 12 pack of beer, potato chips and large popcorn and deliver them over to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here you are chubby guy.' You say and drop them on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oi.' he says with a stern face and then smiles. 'I don't care what you say now Brad, or should i say bit of chubby guy! Tonight at least i'm going to forget all about healthy eating and i'm going to chill out until i'm so comfortable i could fall asleep!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure, whatever!' you reply and go to the toilet. As you're peeing you realize that Kyle's plan isn't a bad idea, and it has been a tough day moving in. You decide to go and join Kyle. Hey, you might even order a pizza!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk over to Kyle you see that he has finished the chocolates, started the popcorn and the chips, and has already drunk 1 beer. He burps out loud, and looks pleased at the attempt. He continues eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere going to need way more food! you think to yourself as you go over and join Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you?</span></div></div>",

I'm feeling pretty hungry, how 'bout you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am mind of hungry\". Brad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stood up, his hot dog-stuffed belly leaning over the waist of his tight trunks. \"Lets go and get ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The two returned to their dorm to shower and change into their regular clothes. With a bit of effort, Kyle pulled on a pair of cargo shorts. 'Whoa,' Kyle thought, 'I am getting thicker'. The cargo shorts that had once drooped a bit below his waist now hugged snuggly against his stomach, and slightly against his butt, sides, and thighs. Meanwhile, Brad took a look at himself. 'Still in pretty good shape' he thought. Suddenly, he began to feel small layer of flab that wasn't there before. It covered his abs, and for the first time in years, Brad felt softer than usual. \"Hmph, must be water weight\" Brad said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     When the two friends were ready, they hopped in the car and drove off to a nearby Chinese Buffet called The Lotus Lantern, the best of Chinese cuisine and the cheapest among the all-you-can eat buffet restaurants in town. When they arrived, they eargerly sat down at a table after the hostess had guided them to the open spot. Grabbing a plate, Kyle happily loaded his plate with mounds of greasy fried rice, big, juicy chicken fingers, heaps of lo mein noodles, and a couple dozen dumplings to finish off. Brad looked at the food hesitantly. 'Better watch what I eat if I'm not going to be playing football or working out this year', he thought. But Brad thought twice. 'I don't gain a lot of weight anyway. I have a great metabolism, I can always work it off when I feel like it.'<br>\r\n      With the same foods and quanitities as Kyle, the two sat down and began to chow down on their array of food. Kyle literally swallowed his dinner, gulping down spoonfuls of rice and noodle combined. Brad was off to a slow start, but began to feast on the plump dumplings that awaited his mouth. Before the two knew it, they had second and third helpings. All the fun was interrupted when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From his pants, the button had popped right off, leaving behind pieces of thread that once held it. Towering over the waist of his pants loomed a mound of belly, packed with the plates of Chinese food that had been jammed down his throat, and pushing against the walls of his tight stomach. His t-shirt stretched uncomfortably over his paunch, his pants still tugging around the bloat. Kyle was shocked-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what happened to your pants!? Forget when to stop eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was about to make a remark about Kyle and his massive pig-outs, but then he looked at the table in front of him. Five plates, totally empty and licked clean, lay piled in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think you're right. I did go overboard a bit!\" Brad replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked around. \"Lets get out of here, before anyone sees you with your pants like this.\" They hurriedly paid the bill and stealthily left the restaurant, without anyone noticing Brad and his buttonless pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you should stick with the sweat pants, man,\" Kyle began, \"I think I should start to stick with them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get some new pairs,\" Brad said, \"But do you still want to come here again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Kyle exclaimed, \"I love Chinese! And nothing can beat all-you-can-eat! How about every other night? If you don't get sick of it too fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding!?\" Brad chuckled, \"Who doesn't love Chinese?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed, driving away from the restaurant. In the meantime, Brad was ready for some more dinner. \"We'll top the night off with a pizza or two, sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me!\" Kyle replied happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the eating and the big appetites began as the two roommates continued to hit their favorite restaurant three to four times a week, with late night snacks of pizza. Nothin' like living the good life!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     The sun had risen, the light beaming through the window of the dorm. After another night of Chinese and pizza, Kyle and Brad had slept in. No class today, fortunately. Brad stirred, awakening from a long night of food and sleep, getting out of his bottom bunk. Brad was feeling fatigued lately, probably from just staying up so late, he thought. Meanwhile, he had a bit of a wedgie problem. His boxers had begun to ride up a bit, and he tugged at them angrily to rid himself of the uncomfort. He was about to wake up Kyle and have breakfast when he thought about checking his weight. \"Haven't done that in a while,\" he said to himself. Brad walked lazily into the bathroom, grabbing the scale from corner of the room and placing it on the floor. Cheerfully, stepping onto it, Brad looked down at the scale. The needle shook slightly, and landed on a number unfamiliar to Brad. Puzzled, he got off and went back on. <br>\r\n     All of a sudden, a sharp feeling of surprise came over Brad. He had gained 12 pounds, almost a pound a day since Kyle and his first night at the Lotus Lantern. Worried, he began to take off his wifebeater, which had held on to his torso more tightly than before. Looking in the mirror, Brad noticed that his abs were gone, replaced with an even thicker layer fat. His once hard pecs had now grown softer, moving slightly as Brad began to shake his body. Turning around, he also noticed a rounder, plumper set of cheeks that were also once hard like his pecks. Now, they had become slightly rounder, and equally softer, pushing against the back of his boxers. Even his face began to lose its prominent jaw and cheek bones, as it started to fill out a bit. <br>\r\n     Meanwhile, Kyle had gotten out of bed, climbing down the ladder from the top bunk. Sluggishly, he walked into the bathroom, also in boxers. His boxers had grown snug as well, but started to strain under Kyle's thicker waist. His butt had fattened up, more prominent than usual. His sides began to grow small flabs of fat, as well as his chest and arms, that also began to grow softer witht he packed on pounds. His white,short sleeve v-neck exposed the growing, flabby gut that Kyle began to grow, his stomach peacking out from underneath and beginning to create a slight overhang. With effort, he took off his shirt, also preparing to step on the scale as he walked through the door.<br>\r\n      \"Whoa, Brad, you've gotten bigger!\" Kyle remarked. Not seeing him shirtless ever since their last day at the beach, he realized that Brad had moved up a size or two, judging by his new, softer waist.<br>\r\n      \"I could say the same about you, Kyle! Try the scale.\" Looking at Brad, Kyle walked onto the scale, the needle also reaching an unfamiliar number. With a few tests, the puzzle was solved. <br>\r\n      \"Wow, I put on 14 pounds!\"<br>\r\n      \"Just 2 more than I did,\" Brad said, \"This is incredible!\"<br>\r\nThe two patted their guts, gazing at each other in awe at their new bodies. They definitely thought.....</span></div></div>",

Kyle gulps and stares at the obstacles. His already stuffed stomach groaned and settled. The crowd cheered a singular, unintelligble cheer. He scanned the many faces; there, just past the front, was one he recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had joined the audience, and, while not cheering, looked... happy. Some sort of happy. Was it pride? Or admirance? He couldn't tell. But here was someone who genuinely cared for him, not just his gastronomic tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle furrowed his brow and sat up straight, now determined. He ripped off his shirt, and only barely recognized the hooting from the audience. He couldn't even remember what the prize was, only what the challenge was. He reacted instantly to the announcer's shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed each hotdog and snapped them with bun in two, and swallowed each hotdog half whole. He furiously ravaged the first pyramid, reducing into half it's whole when the first pain struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle rubbed the side of his engorged stomach and started to wonder if this was really possible, or if he could really end up hurting himself. He ate through the pain and finished the first pyramid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach had spilled into his lap by now, pressing up against the table as he began the second heap. It helped, he found, to consider himself 3/4 of the way there, not 1/2. Then it helped not to think of anything as his bare stomach stretched in accomodation. He was almost halfway through the second pile and on the home stretch when he was sure he couldn't do anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a voice from the crowd, singular at first, chanted 'Kyle! Kyle!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, Kyle knew it as Brad's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chant gained momentum until it was singular, Everyone staring either at Kyle of his large stomach. He regained another wind and started eating the hotdogs as fast as before, thinking of nothing. And with a single gulp he finished the last of his challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great wave spread over the crowd as Kyle lifted his arms in triumph. Brad rushed over to his side as he tried to stand up, finding his now shifted weight took getting used to. Kyle thew his arm around Brad's shoulders, and was handed the $100. There was much cheering as Kyle walked awkardly away, supported by Brad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the dorm (and after a lot of funny looks on the way) Brad helped Kyle back onto his bed. \"Easy, easy does it,\" Brad said, easing Kyle down. Kyle rubbed his stomach in an attempt to calm it down, and, eventually, got onto the side of his bed. Brad took a step back. \"So, how are you? You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle rolled onto his side, and then onto his back. The contents of his gut settled again. \"I'll be fine, as long as my stomach hold up.\" He breathed deeply and rubbed his middle again. \"After all, I'll just digest it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad didn't really respond, but acknowledged the question with a gesture of his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just have one more question, Brad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"</span></div></div>",

The initial shock to his system from the massive introduction of food was wearing off and he was starting to feel more like his old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until he swung his legs over the edge of the bed, intent on raiding the kitchen now that it was clear Brad had gone to bead early. The jolt in his midsection was nothing like anything he'd ever felt before. His whole centre of gravity had shifted yet he was trying to move like he used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting quickly to the change, Kyle made his way down the hall. 'I don't want to loose this feeling.', he thought to himself, recalling the faces in the crowd chearing him on. 'I feel more alive, somehow. This is fantastic, don't know why I never tried anything like this before.' But he was starting to loose the buzz, his midsection nolonger pulled away from him like it had done half an hour before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it to the kitchen just in time to satisfy his returning hunger, Kyle saw a note on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stopped by while you two were out. Must have been one hell of a party you guys threw, there's not a scrap of food in the place. Took care of it for you, Dad.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle opened every cupboard and both the fridge and freezer feaverishly. He was in heaven. The freezer was full of icecream and frozen pizzas. The fridge had gallons of full fat milk, pies and cakes, and everything else he could have asked for. Not a hint of green among it. The cupboards had loaves of bread, dozens of packets of biscuits, most of them cream filled, endless bags of chips and one shelf devoted entirely to chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occured to Kyle that Brad hadn't seen any of this yet since he practically went straight to bed.

He breathed in and out, his still sculpted chest rising and falling; if anything, the muscles of his pecs appeared larger with the fat that was swelling him up, as did the round large of his muscled arm. He clamped a hand to his mouth before he released a massive belch that would surely have woken up everyone in the dorm. He could feel the churn of his stomach as it gurgled with all the food he was ingesting, but it quieted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smacked his lips. \"What's a little milk without something nice and sweet... like some pies.\" He drooled a little as he picked up the uncut pie, and chomped huge bites out of it, bites so big his neck almost bulged out from the size of them, as they dropped into his round and swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne pie, two, three, four were all gone. \"Hmmmm,\" said Kyle, idly rubbing his stomach, not even paying attention to it's size. \"What's a little pies without some more milk?\" and took out another gallon, and downed it just as he had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went in cycles like that, a gallon of milk justified eating all the cakes, making him bigger and bigger in his stomach, in turn justifying more milk, in turn packets of cream-filled cupcakes and snack cakes, dozens of them, as his belly just groaned and kept expanding. He looked nine months pregnant, a smooth round belly coming underneath his huge strong chest muscles. When he found that the waistband of his shorts were cutting into his lower gut, not even daring to go up around his waist, he simply took them off and stood in the middle of the kitchen buck-naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swung around, his stomach making it hard to stop turning. Kyle silently cursed Newton's laws as his stomach swayed in front of him, perfectly round and hanging down in front of him, covering the front of his nudity if not his perectly round and strong butt cheeks in back. He patted his stomach and licked his lips, and looked around again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chips went into his belly next, then all of the ice cream, without utensils, simply peeling off the cardboard and diving into it face-first, and then licking the containers clean. It took some resistance not to simply eat them, too. \"Lord knows I'm gonna need the fiber,\" he said, pressing into his belly, now looking like he was ten, maybe twelve months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy two in the morning the kitchen was entirely empty of every crumb, even the food that Brad had bought had flown through Kyle's gullet and now rested heavily in Kyle's gut. He held his belly in both arms while sitting against the cold kitchen floor, trying to figure out what to do next.</span></div></div>",

He breathed a sigh of relief, realising that at least he wasn't fully exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to see Brad staring down at him with a smug smile on his face, Brad was wearing only a pair of shorts, and his exposed washboard abs and toned and sculpted body seemed to be mocking Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, what the HELL did you do last night?

He felt awful, so bloated and full he could hardly move, his stomach still tight as a drum with the mounds of food he had consumed last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I coudln't stop myself,\" Kyle said, staring down at his massive round belly. \"Once I started...I just kept going, it felt really good at the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shook his head. \"You need to control yourself buddy, you'll end up fat, go get yourself cleaned up...and put some clothes on, I don't want to have to stare at your fat ass all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt ashamed, and groaned in pain as he raised his overstuffed belly off of the floor.

After 4 shakes each due to your re-entry into the conversation of gaining, you decide that the shakes are working and move onto the beers. When they're gone it's getting quite late, Brad feels satisfied and you feel almost full. You both decide to open out your hi-tech sofa-beds and strip to your underwear. You lie on top of your beds for a further 30mins, just talking about random stuff when all of a sudden . . .</span></div></div>",

You get back in the bed, and wait for about 15 minutes, then when you hear Brad snoring, you slowly get up, and without turning on the lights, you look around for a shirt and some pants. You find some shorts, but them on (they are a bit tight on you) but you can't seem to find a shirt of your to wear. You remember thatt you have not yet unpacked your shirt, so you go over to your suitcase and start to unzip it, as you do, you hear Brad rolling over in bed. You are afriad you will wake Brad if you keep unzipping. So instead you get one of Brad's button up shirts that he had haning up. You get to the last 2 buttons, and have to suck in your gut to button them. The shirt looks kinda tight, but you shrug it off and creep out the door to room 70.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finnaly get to the party and the door is open. You walk on in and actually see a few football teammates at the party. They challenge you to a beer/pizza eating contest. You accept the challenge and bet 20 bucks that you'll win. The other 2 teammates also put a 20 on the table and one of them brings out 4 kegs - one for each challenger. Then another person comes through the door with 15 large pizzas from Dominoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules are simple, who ever can drink the most beer and eat the most pizza is the winner. If you pass out or throw up, you are disqualified. Each player now has 5 boxes of pizza in front of them, and 2 kegs. The first to finish all the pizza and both kegs is the winner. An alternate way of winning is if 2 of the 3 players are somehow disqualified during the competition.\" explained the teammate. \"On your mark, get set, go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, each of the men tore open their first box and started devouring the pizza. You have Michael who was a little scrawny guy, one of the smallest players on the team. Then Carlos, a muscular beefy guy, he and Kyle were about the same size, but Kyle was arguably fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes into the race, Michael had eatin 1 1/2 boxes of pizza and about 2/5ths of his first keg. Kyle had eatin 2 boxes and had drunken 4/5 of his keg. And Carlos had eatin 2 1/2 boxes, and about 1/2 of his keg. The buttons on Brads shirt were straining, and you could see Kyle' belly in the oval like holes inbetween the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later, Michael had passed out and only eatin 2 1/2 boxs and 3/4 of a keg. Carlos had eatin 4 boxes, and 1 1/4 of his kegs. And Kyle had managed to eat 4 boxes and 1 3/5 of his keg. With so much food in Kyle's gut, the bottom two buttons of Brad's shirt popped right off and Kyle's stuffed gut fell out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 5 minutes later, Kyle had to eat 4 more pieces and about 1/5 of his 2nd keg, and Carlos passed out in his pizza. <br>\r\n\"Congradualtions Kyle! You're the winner. But how about we make a little deal... if you can finish off the last for slices and the rest of your keg, I will throw in 20 more bucks!\"said the one of the roomies.<br>\r\n\"Idunno, I am so stuffed, I feel like I will pop!\" Kyle said looking down at his huge swollen gut. \"But I need the money pretty bad, so I guess I'll do it\" <br>\r\nAnd Kyle finished off the last 4 slices and keg in no time. Everyone was clapping and he stood all the way up, and the button on his already tight jeans flew across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle, feeling quite drunk and embarressed, collected his money and stumbled back to his room.<br>\r\nHe sobered up enough to know not to make a peep while reentering the dorm. He put away his money, put Brad's shirt back in place, hid his shorts in a safe place, and collapsed onto his bed and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning he awoke with a terrible hangover. He stayed in bed for a while just watching TV and finally Brad came in to the room, he had boughten them some Hardee's. <br>\r\nKyle gets up and immediately notices that his gut is sticking out about 2 inches. He is in shock, but he can only imagine what Brad would say if he found out. So he attempts to hid his new distended gut but putting on some sweat pants and a sweat shirt. <br>\r\n\"I got each of us a Sausage biscuit to eat and I bought a few extras to keep in the fridge for other mornnings.\" says Brad.<br>\r\n\"Ok, then give me mine.\" Kyle commands.<br>\r\n\"Wait, only if you promise me that you and I will go to the gym today and start a workout routine before the season starts,\" says Brad.<br>\r\n\"uhh...\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He waits until Brad leavs the room and looks in the fridge, because he is craving more food. \"That little binge last night must ahve made my appetite bigger, and I am starving now!\" Kyle thought to himself.<br>\r\nIn the fridge he sees 4 Hardee's Sausage Biscuits. 2 of them are labeled 'Brad' and the other 2 are labeled 'Kyle'.

When I took out on of my shirts, 3 of the buttons had come off. I guy they got couhgt on something..\"says Kyle. <br>\r\nBrad simply shrugs it off, and Kyle resumes watching TV. About an hour later Brad comes in and asks him if he is ready to go out for some lunch. \"Am I ever!\" Kyle exclaims, even though he is not really that hungry. \"I better just go along with the meal, and not let Brad know what's up\" Kyle thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys grab there gym bags and walk out the door to Brad's car. Brad decides to stop at a Wendy's. He says \"I don't think a lil' burger can hurt us, especially when we're about to go to the gym.\" <br>\r\nThey go through the drive-thru, Brad orders 2 Double Cheese Burger combos and 2 Frosties. But before Kyle can object to the Frosty, Brad is already pulling ahead. They grab their food and eat in the parking lot of the gym. <br>\r\n\"I think both of us deserve a Frosty, don't you? I am sure were are probably the only two guys on the team actually going to the gym..I bet the rest are hitting late night parties, like that one we were invited to last night.\" says Brad. \"Yeah, uhh...go us\" Kyle says with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guys grab their gym bags and head into the locker room to change. Brad takes off his shirt and start complaining about how fat he has gotten. \"Look at me, I can't believe I let myself go like this! I can hardly see my abs when I flex!\" \"Oh come on, you've only put on like 5 lbs since last year.\" Kyle says.<br>\r\n\"I think I am gonna weigh myself...lets see I was 177 last year, I hope I am not too heavy now.\" Brad says getting onto the scale.<br>\r\n50...100...150...181. <br>\r\n\"Oh man! I can't believe this! A 4 pound gain!\"<br>\r\n\"Come on man, it is hardly noticable.\" Kyle says.<br>\r\nKyle takes off his sweat pants and put on his gym short only to find that they feel very uncomfortable, and he can actually feel his bloated belly sticking out.<br>\r\n\"How much have you gained, Kyle?\" says Brad. \"I am not sure..\" Kyle says, trying to turn away from Brad while he changes clothes. \"Well look at me, I wanna see if your damage is worse than mine\" Brad says. <br>\r\nKyle takes off his sweat shirt, and his gut plop down as a result.<br>\r\nBrad's eyes widen as he see's Kyle stomach.<br>\r\nAt first Brad thinks it is a trick, so he leans in and pokes it. Well, sure enough, it jiggles more than ever. \"I can't believe you Kyle, you must have had to eat non-stop to get that fat! You need to be weighed right away!\" Brad exclaims.<br>\r\nBrad grabs Kyle by the arm and pulls him over to the scale. \"Now you were exaclty 185 lbs last season, correct?\" Brad asks. \"Yeah,\" Kyle says getting onto the scale. <br>\r\n50...100...150...190- but Kyle jumps off the scale before he goes up all the way. <br>\r\n\"Oh no, you get right back up there and face those numbers like the chubby person you are!\" Brad says.<br>\r\nKyle gets onto the scale for the second time.<br>\r\n50..100...150..197. <br>\r\n\"197!

But I guess I'm the only one that cares about my shape for football.\"<br>\r\n    \"Hey, I do care about my shape, I just dont care enough to be obsessed with it,\" Kyle remarked and went to put his bathing suit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    That was a workout in itself.  After all the beer, pizza, and chocolate, Kyle's 197 pound body struggled to wrangle itself into a too-small bathing suit.  Once on, his gut flopped over the front and his butt was about to burst out the back.  \"Now he can't see me from where he is, so all I have to do is just LOOK like I've been swimming to fool him,\" Kyle thought to himself.  \"Thats it!  The hot tub is lookin pretty good right now if I do say so myself.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     25 minutes later, totally relazed from the hot tub, Kyle jumped in the pool to swim laps to look like he did something with that time.  Brad came down sweating a little and then saw Kyle.  Kyle realized that he was a little put-out after only 5 minutes of swimming and came to Brad out of breath.<br>\r\n     \"Well, I guess you did work-out, you proved me wrong.  Get changed so we can go and do weights,\" Brad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     They both went upstairs again to do weights and Kyle started thinking, if he just managed to do nothing but weights when he came here, then most of the eating would turn into muscle anyways so Brad would never know if Kyle pigged out or not.  Kyle just had to make up some excuse to avoid running around on the treadmill, and then just lift weights to keep Brad at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the gym Brad said, \"We should go to the grocery store and get stuff, we are almost out of food.\"  So when they got there...<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On his way to the grocery store, Brad considers what he should buy.  Not being the most patient man in the world, his immediate thought is to go find some weight gaining supplements to use and abuse for some quick results.  He had taken some for a short time before, but this time he would just be laying around instead of working out.  He'd definitely gain weight, but this time it would be fat instead of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he decided that he would rather do things the old fashioned way.  It might take a little while longer, but a bunch of fattening junk food would help him pack on the pounds just like any weight supplement.  Brad had always preferred instant results when it came to working out and maintaining his buff body, but he knew that growing his small gut would involve a much more enjoyable training regimen.  He would just sit back and be lazy and worry about stuffing himself with all the delicious snacks he had always denied himself.  He was looking forward to enjoying the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked a cart and immediately headed to the bakery section at the side of the store, not even concerning himself with the fruit and veggie area that he usually went to.  Brad stacked several containers filled with cupcakes, cookies, and donuts in the bottom of the cart, placing two pies on top of them.  These would be his more high quality food group, he thought as he made his way to the aisle containing the snack cakes and other junk food.  Before he knew it, the rest of his cart was full of boxes containing every snack cake imaginable, along with a respectable selection of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still some room left in his cart, and Brad knew that he had about 25 dollars left to spend.  Without a second thought, he went to the freezer section and began examining the selection of ice cream.  He picked out five different flavors before heading up to the cashier.</span></div></div>",

Brad walks in as discreetly as possible, grab a 12 pack of Guinness as Kyle distracts the lady at the counter and both of you are out of there before you know it.  Walking back to the hotel with beer in hand was pretty tiring, \"man I forgot how long its been since I did some real excercise\" Brad says all winded.  Kyle is as bad as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Brad sneaks the booze up the elevator and before you know it you are in your room.  \"This place is so damn hot,\" Kyle says as he strips to his underwear.  He pulled his shirt off to reveal a smooth layer of fat covering his muscles so they could no longer be seen and some developing handles.  Not to mention a very delicious bubble butt that filled his boxers well.  \"Whoa look at this stomach, I cant even see my abs anymore!\"  \"Well, thats what all that food gets ya,\" Brad said, who immeditately was met with, \"you aren't this fittest either my friend\" from Kyle and Brad looked down at his roll of fat.  He also stripped to his underwear, hot from carrying the beer.  Room service came and along with it a truckload of food was met with two college boys with big stomachs and big appetites.  The server looked them up and down as if to say, \"well you've been eating well havent you?\" and thanked them and left.<br>\r\n     On the food cart was an appetizer of clams casino, thai chicken skewers, and bacon wrapped scallops.  Each of their entrees consisted of an 18oz Porterhouse steak with a large bakes potato covered in sour cream and butter.  After that, the next course consisted of a 1.5 pound lobster for each of them with butter and the final course led them to Tiramisu, Chocolate Cake, and ice cream.  \"I'm ready,\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n     It took the boys about 2 hours to polish off every last crumb of $200 worth of food that was placed in front of them.  Their guts were totally filled to the max and each of them laid in his own bed with a beer in hand, watching TV and digesting the food.  \"Wow, I think that was the most food I ever ate,\" Brad said.  \"Yeah but it was damn good though,\" replied Kyle.  \"Well get back into a fitness routine when we go back home.

Brad pointed towards a large, 7-foot tall slot machine, surrounded by a myriad of dazzling technicolor enticement. But it wasn't the mere size that interested Brad, and then Kyle, it was the subject; Football. It was a football themed slot machine, with a rotating display above it that changed gaudily from football phrases to encouragement and, eventually, to the jackpot cashout - $18,187,177. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go check it out!\" Brad said. Before Kyle could respond, Brad was already on his way. Kyle rolled his eyes and followed, admitting to himself that he, too, was interested.

He grabbed the lever firmly and held his breath as he gave it one big pull. A flurry of wheeling football players and pigskins and cheerleades and referees with 'touchdown' hand-signals whirled and whirled. Kyle turned to Brad and said, \"Wait a minute. You were never in the scouts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad didn't have a chance to respond because the slot machine started blinking and hollering in a great cacophonous celebration.

Brad and Kyle went and explored the strip and unknowingly ate seven hot dogs, three ice creams, two huge nachos, two beers and six sodas each by the time they had seen the strip.

The tailor took their measurements and brought out some pants for them to try on. Brad and Kyle stripped their clothes off until they stood together in the fitting room in nothing but their underwear. Kyle noticed his underwear was uncomfortably tight and that his muscles were no were to be seen he poked his stomach and found no resistance. He had a small pouch that feel over his tightened underwear. Then Kyle looked over at Brad and saw that he was in the same situation. They both picked up their pants and tried them on. The fit very well and they decided to get them. Then Brad looked at the size, they were 38's, and he didn't need a belt.

Then the tailor brought in button up shirts for them to try on Brad put his on and it fit nicely. Brad paid for his clothes and waited in the waiting room for Kyle. Kyle tried his shirt on and found it to be a bit tight. The silk shirt showed a small pouch of fat and his softening chest he got a size bigger and paid.

Brad and Kyle both got up and started to fill their plates with food. They got back to their seats and began to eat, how could they have been so hungry after all that snaking this afternoon? The waitress returned and brought their sodas and a pitcher of beer. Kyle began \" We didn't order be...\" but before he finished the waitress winked and walked away. Brad and Kyle began eating and drinking. They finished their first plate and went up for more. When they returned they saw their sodas and beer pitcher refilled. They thought nothing of it and continued eating. This went on for another five plates of food. In total they ate seven plates of food each and drank four pitchers of beer and three sodas. By now they were rather drunk and the dessert tray was brought out. Kyle slurred to Brad a dessert eating competition. Brad gratefully accepted and they began on dessert. After three pieces of cake, two pieces of pie, four bowls of ice cream, and seven cookies each they called it a tie and got up to pay for their dinner. When Kyle stood up his pants button popped off and his zipper flew down exposing his bloated belly. Brad's shirt buttons gave way and exposed his belly allowing it to fall causing his pant button to pop. They walked to the counter totally hammered not noticing what has just happened.

Sitting on the bench are a couple of other people - one of the fattest guys you've ever seen, licking an ice cream, and a chubby girl with great curves.  You watch the cars going by - limos, SUVs, big sedans - and Kyle pokes you and says, \"Look at that one!\"  You follow his gaze and spot a Mercedes convertible, top down, with a completely vast fat guy behind the wheel.

It's killing me to keep up with you, but there's no way in hell I'm letting you beat me on this one.\" Kyle responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's comming up on 10:30 and the place is starting to clear out. The food in front of you went stone cold a half hour earlier, but nothing was going to stop you. Not with the determination in Kyle's eyes to compete with. You can barely concentrate, but the last of the food is finally gone. You run your hands down the side of your belly, taking stock of the damage. They only make it half way down when your wrists land on the edge of the table. There's no room to go any further. You vaguely remember something about how big these booths felt when you first sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle is in much the same situation, though his eyelids are starting to droop. He's clearly exhausted from the effort. Slowly inching your way out of the booth, you stagger over to his side and help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the door, you and Kyle lean on each other for support. Both grinning ear to ear. Satisfied that they'd be back to take advantage of this sweet set up again tommorow night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rolling over you see Kyle lying on the bed next to you, a huge grin on his face even though he's still asleep. Your eyes go lower and you notice that the bottom of his shirt is being suspended a good five inches away from his waist. Then is hits you, The Buffet last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can barely move as you make your way into the bathroom. Spotting scales on the floor you step onto them and hear the needle ticking upwards. It takes a long time for it to come to a stand still. Looking down, your eyes still bleary from sleep, you notice that you can't see the reading over your stomach. You laugh to your self and lean forward to get a better look, but loose your ballance slightly. Guess having all that weight in the one spot has at least one downside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake Kyle awake and drag him into the Bathroom. \"Get in here and tell me what this damn thing says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ticking stops. \"I remember I was about 180 before we came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it could be busted, but it says here you're 197.\" Kyle stares in amazement, pushing you out of the way. \"Come on, my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look in the full length mirror and see why you had such a hard time reading the scales. In nothing but boxers, you can see that your arms and legs haven't changed at all. In fact the only difference since the last time you saw a mirror is that you now have a completely distended gut pocking further and further away from the rest of your body. If you didn't know any better you'd think you were in full term pregnency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel Kyle's equally massive stomach pressing hard against the small of your back, his hands come round the full length of your waist and lock in front of you. \"Hey, I can't read the damn scales!\" He squeezes you and leans back lifting you off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not you idiot, why the hell did you think I needed you to read them for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot listening, Kyle is staring into the mirror now that you're out of the way. Slowly rubbing his exposed twin belly. \"Hey I don't care what I weigh after being in this town for one day, I'm wondering what it'll say after we've been here for two weeks!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks passed, two weeks in which you and Kyle had partied hard in Vegas. The last few days were something of a blur, as all you could remember was gambling, eating and drinking - and having a fantastic time all the while. As you woke up, you opened your eyes and saw your belly staring back at you, still bloated from the all you can eat buffet you and Kyle had visited last night. You had actually started getting proud of just how much you could eat, sitting at your regular boothe stuffing your face every night had become a ritual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat up, you swung your legs out of your bed and noticed how tight your boxer shorts felt. Your bloated belly fell into your lap, and you rubbed it's bulging sides as you stood up and headed for the bathroom. It had been two weeks since Kyle had said \"I'm wondering what it'll say after we've been here for two weeks!\" and you were wondering how much weight you had put on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you headed for the bathroom, she gave Kyle a shove. Kyle was lying under the bed sheets snoring, and your prodding woke him. He yawned and rubbed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you wake me up so early?\" He asked miserably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's been two weeks, I wanna find out how much I weigh and you know we can't see the scales anymore!\" You say, eager to get on with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right,\" Kyle groaned and pulled back the sheets, exposing his recently developed pot belly. Kyle was wearing a pair of briefs, which you noticed had become rather tight around his growing ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both headed into the bathroom and went to the scales, Kyle stepped onto them first, which annoyed you, since this had been your idea. Kyle grabbed his belly and held it still as you bent down and read the number underneath his hanging girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked at the number. \"Woah...Kyle...this says you weight 220!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Kyle shouted. \"That's not possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Kyle, you were nearly 200 before, and we've been eating like pigs every night,\" You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stepped off the scales. \"I can't believe I've gained so fast...you see how much you've gained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped onto the scales, and Kyle read the number. \"Oh boy...looks like you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little worried by that - surely you weren't any bigger than Kyle? \"How much?\" You asked quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"226,\" Kyle replied. \"So that's a 29 pound gain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked by just how much weight you had put on, and all of it seemed to be gathering in your belly. You and Kyle both looked like you were pregnant, your huge swollen bellies sticking out from your bodies - which had remained pretty trim all things considered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad,\" said Kyle, looking at himself in the mirror. \"I think I'm starting to put it on in other places as well. My ass is getting bigger, and I think I'm losing muscle definition...\" Kyle was poking at his once perfect biceps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood beside Kyle and looked at yourself in the mirror, and noticed yourself looking a little bigger than Kyle. You could see the effects on your muscles too, though your boxer shorts kept your ass more concealed than Kyle's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're getting so big...\" Kyle said. \"I don't think we're going to stay like this for much longer, every day we wake up bloated from the night before - but soon, all this fat is going to travel to the rest of our bodies. What do you think we should do?\"</span></div></div>",

Weighing over two hundred pounds was pretty worrying, you had never been that big in your whole life, and you were afraid if you continued with this lifestyle of binging every night then you would soon reach three hundred pounds, and then there would be no turning back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's a good idea,\" Kyle said, rubbing his big belly and looking at yours. \"I think we should be able to lose these bellies, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed. \"We should just eat as much as we can today, and get it out of our system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Kyle. \"If I can find a shirt that still fits me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were worried about the same thing, your belly had become so big that all of your clothes were riding up and exposing it, which was pretty embarassing. You were also having some problems with your jeans, which had gotten tighter and tighter these past two weeks. Every time you put them on your belly bulged over, which luckily disguised the fact you couldn't actually do the top button up anymore...and the zipper was pretty hard to get up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get changed...if I can...why don't people just walk around in there underwear? It's much more comfortable anyway...\" Kyle grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed, picturing you and Kyle walking around with your bellies hanging out and people staring. Only a little while ago, people would have been drooling over your perfect bodies...now, not so much. You pulled out your jeans and forced them up your legs, they still fit okay, and had been pretty loose when you bought them. You lifted your belly and let it drop down to cover the open button at the top of the jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was struggling to get his jeans on, he seemed to have put on more weight around his ass and thighs than you. But he finally managed to get them on, though they looked extremely tight. His belly was more firm than yours, and he had been able to fasten his top button, letting his belly bloat out ahead of him like a balloon, while yours had started to sag down slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kyle then began to look for shirts that would fit you...</span></div></div>",

Kyle had a similar shirt, and it looked like you had both found the solution at the same time. You pulled the shirt on, noticing how much your arms now filled out the sleeves. Then came the awkward part, you had to carefully button up the shirt over your big belly. Luckily, this wasn\u2019t too hard, but the shirt buttons were pretty strained, and the shirt clung to your chest and made your protruding belly rather obvious. Still, at least you were covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had also managed to get his shirt on, and was sucking his gut in to get the buttons done up. Finally, he exhaled, letting his stomach bloat back out and push against the shirt, which looked almost as tight as yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I think I\u2019m ready to go,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cDamn this shirt is tight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, mine too,\u201d You said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to buy some new clothes soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember when all the girls wanted to see us without clothes,\u201d Kyle said, and you both laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both exited your room and headed downstairs to the all you can eat buffet, which was fairly empty around this time. You and Kyle sat down in your usual booth, as an attractive, blonde waitress headed over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d she said, with a smile. \u201cHere for the all you can eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both nodded and smiled. \u201cWhat else?\u201d Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such a hot girl in sight, you began to suck in your belly and try not to look quite so big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, help yourselves guys,\u201d the waitress said, and she headed off back into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed out as she walked off, and Kyle laughed. \u201cWhat?\u201d You asked, frowning at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw you trying to suck in your gut,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cAs if a girl like that is going to want to rub out fat guts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Kyle was right. You wished you had your old body back, as your well-defined muscles and incredibly six-pack abs would surely have appealed to the waitress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, once I lose this belly\u2026\u201d You said, placing your hands on your stomach and shaking it from side to side. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have a better chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kyle got up and headed over to the buffet, and began loading up your plates. As usual, you were grabbing at everything in sight \u2013 sausages, chicken, pasta and anything that looked remotely tasty. When you had piled on enough food, you headed back to your booth and dug in \u2013 shovelling the food on your plates into your mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frankly amazed at how much food you were both able to put away now, your belly wasn\u2019t filled easily, and even though you could feel it bloating and filling up \u2013 you felt compelled to eat more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was eating just as hungrily as you, even though the two of you were still a little full from last nights binge, it didn\u2019t appear to slow either of you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026so good\u2026\u201d Kyle murmured in between mouthfuls of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunted in reply, not stopping to open your mouth, and carrying on stuffing your face. Your plate was already beginning to get empty, and you were looking forward to filling it up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, both you and Kyle put down your forks, and stopped for a breather. Both of you had cleared your plates, and you could feel your stomach bloating bigger and bigger with the amount of food stuffed within it. Kyle seemed to be equally full, and you noticed that a button had popped open at the bottom of his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore?\u201d Kyle asked. </span></div></div>",

This time, you decided to take double the amount, and by the time you returned to the booth, your plate was overflowing. You had taken a few different items this time, such as Pizza slices and burgers. You greedily tucked in to your newly full plate and began munching down on the delicious food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to eat, you felt the zipper of your pants unzip, pushed down by your expanding waistline. You didn\u2019t really care right now, and carried on eating, your belly would cover the gap anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a popping noise, and looked down, expecting to see your shirt buttons popping off, but the noise had come from Kyle. His jeans were wide open, and his bloated gut had spilled into his lap. He had also lost another shirt button, exposing more of his bulging belly. He seemed to into his feast to care, and continued shovelling food into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carried on with your own meal, cramming pizza slices into your mouth in-between burgers. You realised all too well that this made you look like a pig, but if this was to be your last trip to the buffet, you wanted to make it a good one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys all right?\u201d a girls voice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kyle looked up, and saw the blonde waitress looking down at you with her pretty smile. You wiped the crumbs from around your mouth and opened your mouth to speak, but as soon as you did, you were shocked when a loud \u201cURRRRRRRRRRP!\u201d made its way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, you quickly covered your mouth. \u201cOh god, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d You blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress simply laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, you work here and you get used to people getting gassy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt pretty ashamed of yourself right now. \u201cYeah I guess you must\u2026but still\u2026\u201d You looked at her nametag, and saw that it said \u2018Erica\u2019. \u201cSorry about that Erica.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d she smiled. \u201cYou want a drink or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I get a beer?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah me too please!\u201d Kyle chimes in between bites of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica heads off back into the kitchen, and a moment later she comes back with two bottles of beer. She smiles as she places them down, and then walks off again. You find yourself watching her go, admiring her slender body as she walks away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Kyle has barely slowed his pace, and his plate is about half empty, you decide to finish what you started and tuck in to your food again. You begin slurping your beer as you go along, which adds to the bloating in your stomach and the pressure being put on your tight shirt. You can feel your belly bulging out with each bite you take, but it didn\u2019t slow you down, you were determined to clean your plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone!\u201d Kyle suddenly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked across at your friend\u2019s plate, to see it was totally empty. Kyle had devoured everything he had piled onto his plate. He leaned back in his chair and rubbed his enormously bloated stomach as he began to groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so stuffed\u2026\u201d Kyle moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to catch up with Kyle, you forced the rest of the food you had left into your mouth, swallowing and grunting greedily as your belly bloated out even further with each bite. Finally, you had finished, and had caught up with Kyle. You leant back in the booth like your friend and let out another loud belch. Kyle did the same, as you both tried to relieve some of swelling in your guts. </span></div></div>",

He continued to struggle, trying to hide the exposed lower part of his belly, but his struggling wasn\u2019t helping matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother button popped open, leaving Kyle with only three left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap, we have to get out of here!\u201d Kyle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother button popped open. \u201cOh no\u2026this isn\u2019t good\u2026dude\u2026we have to go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stood up, and gasped as his shirt ripped completely open \u2013 the two remaining buttons unfastening themselves with the pressure put on the shirt by his gut. Kyle turned bright red, and other customers turned to see what was going on and started staring at his exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad come on lets go!\u201d Kyle said, and he waddled out of the booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t really feel up to moving at the moment, and were afraid of what would happen to your own shirt if you stood up. But Kyle was getting impatient, and you knew you had to get up quickly before things got much worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuffled along the booth chair and swung your legs out, just as you spotted Erica coming over. Kyle spotted her too, and made another desperate attempt to fasten his shirt buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys leaving now?\u201d Erica asked as she came closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to move quickly, and stood up to speak to her, but as you did, there was an almighty \u2018RRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!\u2019 and your shirt burst open just like Kyle\u2019s had. Every button burst off, leaving the shirt hanging wide open and your bloated belly bobbing and bulging in front of Erica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap!\u201d You gasped, turning red and trying to pull your shirt across your stomach desperately as Erica stared at your enormous gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Erica said. \u201cI guess you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle hoisted up his jeans, which were almost falling down without the buttons and zipper fastened, and he hurried off back upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d you said to Erica. \u201cYou must think me and my friend are fat pigs. But we didn\u2019t used to be like this. Believe it or not, I used to have an awesome six pack\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Erica smiled. \u201cEveryone overdoes it in Vegas.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI better get back to my room,\u201d You said, wanting to get out of there now, but feeling a little better after what Erica had just said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d Erica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, this is going to be my last visit \u2013 me and my buddy are going to lose the weight we\u2019ve put on and go home,\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026well\u2026how about you meet me for a drink later?\u201d Erica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were totally shocked. Even with your naked belly sticking in her face, she seemed to be pretty interested in you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to, meet you here about eight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d Erica smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned, happy with the way things had worked out, and walked back up to your room, getting some odd looks and people pointing and laughing as you went past. You entered your room and found Kyle pulling his jeans off and pulling his briefs out of his butt crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess who got a date with the hot waitress?\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, that is awesome! But right now\u2026I just want to rest\u2026that was the most embarrassing moment of my life\u2026all those people staring at my gut\u2026I\u2019m a fat mess. I\u2019m going to start exercising first thing tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have a bath and get ready for my date,\u201d You said, letting out a loud belch as you entered the bathroom. </span></div></div>",

Your shirt fit a little better now too. You were eager to begin your date with Erica, and hurried downstairs. You spotted Erica waiting outside the entrance to the buffet place, wearing a sleek black dress, which showed off her hot body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she saw you approach, and you grinned back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Erica smiled. \u201cYou look good too.

You hadn\u2019t really thought much about it, but you would probably be getting dinner as well. You guessed she must be hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if we get a bite to eat do we?\u201d Erica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d You replied. But you were secretly worried about stuffing yourself in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe burgers are good here, much better than the all you can eat burgers,\u201d Erica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you allowed to say that?\u201d You laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica laughed, and when the waiter came round, you both ordered a cheeseburger. When the burger arrived, you felt your stomach rumble as you saw how little it was compared to the huge feasts you were used to. Erica began to eat hers slowly, and you took a huge bite of yours \u2013 it was pretty damn tasty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, you were finished, and Erica was only a quarter of the way through hers. <br>\r\nYou suppressed a belch, and patted your belly as you waited for her to finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally done, she looked up at you with a little surprise in her eyes. \u201cWas that enough for you?\u201d She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe?\u201d You asked her, rubbing your belly absent-mindedly. \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m already pretty full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Erica said. \u201cBecause I would have loved to see your big bloated gut rip out of your shirt again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d You asked, shocked by her admission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026it was pretty hot\u2026\u201d Erica giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d You asked, still in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually go for that kind of thing, but when your belly exploded out of your shirt and hung there in front of me\u2026I got so turned on\u2026\u201d Erica admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026you like fat guys or something?\u201d You ask, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Erica answered. \u201cI like you. I like that your belly is the biggest part of you, and that the rest of your body is still so slim by comparison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou only like me for my belly?\u201d You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think you\u2019re a hot guy, and you seem really nice\u2026you can even go ahead and lose weight if you like\u2026but can you let me watch when you stuff yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I guess so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica smiled. \u201cAwesome.

She must be a feeder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" You reply, wanting to prove Kyle wrong. \"She just wants to see my belly get big and bloated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, she's fattening you up, can't you see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she wants to make me that fat...\" You say, unsure of yourself. You move forward and pull out a pair of boxer shorts from by the bed, and Kyle turns away as you slip them on. You felt more dignified with your lower parts covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" said Kyle. \"I tried to do some sit ups earlier but I couldn't even get my belly off the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to give it a go, and lye down on your back on the floor with your hands behind your head. You go to sit up, but find the size of your girth is too much, and before you know it, your head falls back down and you are our of breath. Determined, you try again, but you can't sit up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...\" You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" said Kyle. \"We need to hit the gym fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go home, if we stay here we're just going to carry on like this,\" You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day...</span></div></div>",

The couple who had originally bought the seats were placed in coach, so it wasn't the most luxurious flight imaginable, but you were both relieved to be heading back.

Not even the tiny, unappetizing in-flight meal was able to dampen your spirits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight landed late and when you finally returned to your apartment the two of you wanted to do nothing more than go to bed.

When you looked over at your bedside clock, you saw that it was already 11:30, which, considering you had slept until later in the afternoon back in Vegas, wasn't too bad. With a tired groan, you turned over onto your side, but as soon as you shifted your weight, you felt an immense rumble come from your stomach. With another tired groan, you turned to the other side, but your stomach protested even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm gonna have to get up and feed you...\" You mumble, running your hand over your bulging stomach beneath the covers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have stayed in bed all day, but your appetite would never have allowed it. Your hunger was definitely growing each day, and your less than satisfying feast last night had been little more than a snack - a far cry from the elaborate buffets of Las Vegas. As you sat up, swinging your legs over the side of the bed, your belly filled your lap, hiding your boxer shorts from sight. You ran your hands along the sides of your ever growing belly, your six pack was now long gone - completely covered by a thick layer of flab which formed a very big, very round gut. The rest of your body had fared a little better; your muscles were still visible but seemed to be losing definition, your legs were lean but seemed thicker, your once rock hard pecs had softened and were gradually turning into starter man boobs and your butt had definitely gained some padding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...this thing is getting huge...\" You mutter, grabbing a roll of flab from your bulging stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith yet another groan, you got to your feet and walked up to the full body mirror on your wall. You had once spent hours admiring your sculpted physique in the glass, but now you hardly recognised yourself. You stood there for a moment, assessing the changes to your body, hands rubbing your ball shaped belly. There was no denying it anymore...you were getting chubby...or at least, your belly was. Most of your weight had gone straight to your big, bulging gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away, you left your room. On your door was a note from Kyle, it simply said, <i>\"Brad, I got up early and went to the gym. When you get your fat ass out of bed, come down for a workout, we need it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned at the \"fat ass\" comment and threw the note in the bin. Kyle was at least as big as you, maybe even bigger. He was right about hitting the gym though...maybe you would go for a late night session...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your belly rumbled again, and you clutched at your stomach in discomfort. It was time for breakfast. Walking to the kitchen, you could feel your flabby belly jiggling...it was a strange feeling. You had spent so much time stuffed, you had never really felt your gut when it was soft. As you opened up the cupboards, you spotted some cereal, eggs and a loaf of bread that seemed fresh. Kyle had probably been shopping this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly dumped a few eggs in a frying pan and cooked up an omelette, snacking on the bread as you ate. In no time at all, you had finished your first omelette and your stomach still felt empty. Wasting no time, you got up from the table, grabbed the box of eggs and dumped the remainder of them into the frying pan, adding nearly an entire pound of cheese. This would be a mega omelette! You smiled at the idea and stuffed another piece of bread into your mouth while you waited. After a few minutes, your massive omelette was ready and as you served it up, it barely fit on the plate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" you grinned as you stared down at your mega-meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly tore into the huge, thick, omelette, snacking on bread in between each bite. It was incredibly tasty and pretty dam filling, and in the next half hour, you had finished every last bite and devoured an entire loaf of bread. Licking your lips, you realised you were now feeling pretty thirsty. Rising from the table, you nearly toppled over, weighed down by your hugely bloated belly. It was absolutely huge! Probably packed full with bread. Steadying yourself against the table, you waddled over to the fridge and pulled out a large bottle of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, you pull the bottle open and press it to your lips, quickly guzzling down the white liquid, greedily sucking every last drop from the container, even as it spilled out and dripped down your mountain of a belly. You knew you must have looked like an absolute pig right now, but you didn't care, your gut needed to be satisfied!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter downing the entire bottle, you let out a loud, rumbling belch and made for the sofa, where you immediately collapsed on your back with a long, pleasured moan, completely stuffed by your king sized breakfast. Too bloated to move, you weren't sure what to do next...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were just happy that college had been put off for another week. Unfortunately, it looked like you would be back in class next Monday, which only gave you a week left to enjoy. Still, it had been a damn good break, with two weeks in Vegas and a week to do whatever you wanted at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URP!\" You let out another loud belch, they were definitely getting noisier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing your hugely bloated stomach, you began to consider the coming year at college - you had spent most of your time with Kyle lately, and your friends hadn't seen the newer, chubbier you.

You glanced at the clock, and realized you had slept for four hours! You had only expected to take a nap, but that meal had made you extremely lethargic. That seemed to be a pattern these days - eat a big meal, get tired and sleep it off. That was definitely causing you to gain weight faster, but you just couldn't bring yourself to move after your huge meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced down at your belly, and saw that it was just as bloated as you remembered. Your \"nap\" hadn't done much to reduce it's size. With a groan, you sat up, spreading your legs so that your stomach could rest comfortably between them. Giving your perfectly round belly a short rub, you got to your feet, scratching at your larger ass absent mindedly as you walked back to your room. You walk inside and take a look at yourself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mannnnn....\" You gasp, rubbing the sides of your engorged belly. \"I look absolutely freaking huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, you felt a strange sense of pride whenever you packed away such a massive amount of food. Your favorite feature of your new body was your rapidly developing pot belly, which you liked to keep stuffed full of food at all times. It felt, and looked, much better when it was full. It was almost like a replacement for your rock hard abs. When you first returned from Vegas, you had entertained the idea of losing this new belly before college started up again, but looking at it now, you knew that was impossible. It was here to stay...at least for a while. You would get to the gym eventually...</span></div></div>",

Realizing that Kyle had returned, and that the kitchen was still a complete mess, leaving all evidence of your gigantic meal on display, you panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad? You home?\" Kyle called, closing the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze for a moment, wondering if you could hide under the bed or something...but realized that hiding from Kyle would be pointless. You would never be able to pull it off. Instead, you decided to at least put some clothes on. You had devoured your super omelet while wearing only your tightening boxer shorts and didn't want Kyle to see what a pig you had been in his absence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute!\" You called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this mess?\" Kyle called back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored him and bent over, scraping up a pair of sweat pants from the floor and your large hoodie from last night. You were about to pull them on when you looked up and saw Kyle standing in the doorway, his expression a mixture of shock and disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh...hey Kyle, good day at the gym?\" You asked, blushing red as Kyle stared at your exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, really worked up a sweat...\" Kyle trailed off. \"What the hell happened here? I thought you were going to come to the gym and work out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...planned to...but uh...\" You struggled to find the words to explain your situation. \"Thought I'd start the day with a good breakfast...you know...energy...and all that stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle did not look impressed. \"Brad, seriously, we have to try and lose weight. They'll never let us on the football team with our new guts!\" Kyle pointed to his own bulging stomach for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...I completely forgot about the team,\" you admit, staring down at your dome of a belly and realizing that you can't even see your feet. \"Do you think we can still make it on this season?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it!\" Kyle said. \"Look at us! They want muscle, not fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was right. Your football career wasn't going anywhere this semester, not with your newer, flabbier, figure. The other guys on the team wouldn't be too happy about the way you had let yourself go either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did you eat today? It looks like you emptied the whole cupboard!\" Kyle said angrily. \"I've been working my ass off all day while you've stuffed your face like a pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what to say...Kyle was pretty angry, but did he really have a right to be? He couldn't force you to exercise night and day just because he wanted to regain his old body. Having some extra pounds wasn't really all that bad, and while it was humiliating to be caught, you enjoyed making a pig of yourself and watching your stomach grow and grow. Then again...this could spiral out of control if you weren't careful, and you might never get back on the football team...</span></div></div>",

No Erica, no Kyle and no clothes meant you were seriously in trouble - you couldn't keep dodging people all day, it was early now, but as soon as lunch time rolled around in an hour or so it would start getting pretty busy around here.

At the thought of food, you looked down at your belly, which was still looking pretty bloated from last night.

If only you still had your toned abs, you would feel a little better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a ping from behind you. It was the elevator.

Kyle says, \" you sure we should do this because this only our first date and I want to take it easy.\" Brad says, \" but i really want to try this out and give us a try.\" The both start making out then both nude on the bed making hot love then skip to 3:00am Kyle, \" that was AMAZING!\" Rubbing brads belly and brad smiling to himself said nonchalantly, \"yeah I was so want us to be public with this or keep it hidden for a bit longer hm?\".</span></div></div>",

But even when he pulls the hardest, the two ends are a good 2 inches away from each other. \"Forget this!\" Brad yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you can borrow some of mine, but I doubt even those will fit you tubby\" Kyle snickers. Kyle throws Brad a pair of jeans that were pretty loose on him. Brad pulls the jeans up and struggles a bit but he gets them buttoned. His new gut hangs over the side of the pants and jiggles when he moves. He goes in his closet for a sweat shirt to wear. He doesn't even want to try on one of his other shirts, knowing that they were obviously too small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I will tag along\" says Kyle, \"no need in ending up like you, is there?\" Kyle puts on a shirt and some pants, grabs his gym bag and follows Brad to his car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gets into his car and actually has to move his seat back some because his newly found baunch is rubbing up against the steering wheel. <br>\r\nWhen they arrive at the gym, they head to the locker room to change into their workout clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had totally forgotten that he had outgrown his gym clothes. Kyle (and the rest of the locker room guys) couldn't help but laugh as they saw Brad in a pair of nylon shorts and a white undershirt that exposed a good inch of his jiggling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firs thing Brad gets onto is the treadmill. He starts off pretty slow, but then gets up to a good speed. But his exposed gut is jiggling with every move, and people passing by can't help but notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n45 minutes later, the two guys finished their workout. \"I am starving!\" said Kyle, \"I haven't even had breakfast\" \"Me too, I guess I deserve a little something after that workout\" says Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe I need to just skip breakfast and eat a light lunch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They walk inside and take a seat. A waitress comes up to them and asks for their drinks. She studies Kyle's figure and says 'I bet you play on the college team'. \"Yep\" says kyle, \"me and my buddy here have been working out, and we're ready for a big breakfast\" he says patting his flat paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am on the football team too,\" Brad says. The waitress studies him, he is wearing Kyle's pants which are still very tight and his gut is hanging over causing 2 rolls to form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress laughs to herself as she walks away.<br>\r\nShe brings back their drinks, and Kyle orders a stack of 4 pancakes without syrup, while Brad orders a stack of 6 pancakes with heavy syrup, butter, and some toast with jelly, grits, eggs, and sausage and 5 strips of bacon.<br>\r\n\"Coming right up,\" the waitress says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happend to your diet?\" Kyle asks. \"Oh I am gonna go on a crash diet tommorow, and stay at the gym most of the weekend and Monday, so I can atleast enjoy myself for one last day. Plus, my matabolism is pretty high, the only reason I got this belly was because that pizza has some weird crap in it that made it really really fattening.\" Brad explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guys talk about football until the waitress return with their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slowly eats his meal, while Brad drowns his pancakes in syrup and butter. About 20 minutes later, Kyle is finishing his 4th pancake, and Brad is almost done with his last strip of bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I have never seen you eat so much so fast in my life!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't get used to it either, come tommorow, I will probably only eat an apple until Tuesday.\" says Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two roommate leave the restaurant and head back to the dorm. On the way back, Kyle asks Brad to stop at the market for a second. He tells Brad to wait in the car, while he needs to do some shopping. About 10 minutes later, Kyle comes out with a ton of stuff. He has everything from beer to twinkies, to frozen pizzas, to ice cream. <br>\r\n\"What's all this for?\" Brad asks.<br>\r\n\"Well, if you are gonna starve tommorow, we can have one last night of fun tonight. Just a party for me and you. Whaddaya say?\" asks Kyle.</span></div></div>",

Brad notices that Kyle has bought someting called 'Bulk Up 3000'. \"What's this?\" Brad asks. \"Some a friend of mine reccomended,Kyle says, \"they said it helps build muscle really fast, but you have to take it over like 2 or 3 weeks for it to work.\" \"Oh, cool, maybe we will have to try it,\" Brad comments. \"Well, I think we should start off this party with a few beers!\" Kyle yells. \"Way ahead of you man\", as Brad is opening a beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guys just sit around telling each other stories while munching on junk food. Then they start to play some video games, and Kyle can't help but notice Brad's excessive eating. Kyle had eatan half a Nutter Butter bar, but Brad had eatan the rest of the box, and Kyle didn't even get to eat a sinlge twinkie because Brad ate them all. He had also become very drunk, he had consumed about 8 beers before Kyle took them away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about lunch time and it was burning up outside and inside. They didn't want to pay for air conditioning, so they opened a window and took off their shirts. Kyle instantly noticed that Brad's belly had popped the button off Kyles pants. \"Oh great Brad, just take my pants off before you cause more harm to them!\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n\"OK, fine!\" Brad said taking Kyle's pants off and almost falling over. \"Well, what do you want for lunch?\" Kyle asked. \"Lets cook up a couple of those pizzas.\" \"Will do\" Kyle said, as he got up to fix the pizzas and Brad just sat there eating a whole bad of chips and watching TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 40 minutes later both the pizzas were ready. Brad jumped up and raced to get the first slice. But Kyle was faster, and got there first. Well That didn't stop Brad, he ran into Kyle and knocked him down. The two then wrestled on the ground fighting to get the first peice, then Kyle let out a yell of pain, screaming for Brad to get off and that he was too heavy. Well Brad got off, and Kyle sat down to rest. When Kyle awoke from his nap, to was dark outside, and both of the pizzas were gone, so was all of the snacks and beer he had bought that day. Brad noticed Kyle get up and said he was hungry for dinner, and that they needed more snacks. \"Well I didn't even get lunch!\" Kyle complained. \"Hey, it is survival of the fittest\" Brad said. \"More like survival of the heaviest,\" Kyle said. \"Ok, if you want to get heavier, go get some McDonalds, and some beer. \"Ok, ok, I am going. Be back ina little bit\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 15 minutes later, Kyle returned with the food. The first this he said was 'now listen Brad, don't take my food, I got you your own food. ok?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah ok, I understand.\" Brad said.<br>\r\n\"I didn't know how hungry you were, so I got us big Macs, 3 Double Cheeseburgers, and 3 Double Quarter Pounders.\" Kyle sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as you can guess, Kyle managed to eat 2 Double Cheeseburgers, and 1 beer, while Brad ate everything else and 5 beers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was outraged, he said \"I can't stand you, you are nothing but a damn pig! Just don't bother me for the rest of the night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Brad yelled, and he sat down to watch TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 3 hours later, Brad was awakened by a knocking at the door. He opened the door with he chain lock still intact, and it was one of his felow team mates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Brad of Kyle in there?\" the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick, you idiot, I am Brad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I...uhh..didn't recognize you..you've grown a bit.hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked down and noticed that his belly was poking through the opening in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah well, I will work it off before the first practice\" Brad said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I am here about, you see the coach wants us to get a head start this season, and he moved the practice up to tommorow at 10:00 A.M. sharp. Make sure you tell Ky-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that had already slammed the door shut. He was going crazy, he didn't know what to do. Then he remembered the Bulk Up 3000. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he chug it all and hope to get nice and bulky before the practice, or just forget the team this season?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My Dad would kill me if he knew I quit the team because I got fat\" Brad thought. <br>\r\nSo he went the the fridge and got out both 6 packs of the Bulk Up 3000.  Took them to the sofa and layed down, and began to drink them. He realized that they tasted just like candy, they were very sweet. Brad didn't realize it, but before he knew what was going on, he had drunken all 12 cans of the Bulk Up 3000 and fallen asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Brad opening his eyes, and the first thing he saw was a big lump of flabby flesh sitting on his abs. And then he remembered...last night...the food...the muscle drinks. And on his belly was a post-it note, which read \"Dear Brad, I went to do a quick morning workout before the practice at 10:00. Meet you at the practice. Kyle. PS- nice job on the eating...It sure paid off!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sat all the way up, feeling very dizzy and almost forgetting where and who he was. He look at the clock, it read 9:42 A.M. Brad realized what was going on, he looked for his football uniform and put it on. But the last time he wore it, he had been 177 lbs. He didn't even know how fat he was now. He crept into the bathroom, and looked at the scale with grimace. He looked down at his new giant gut which stuck out about 4 inches. He slowly walked over the scale, and stepped onto it. The numbers rolled up, 170....180....190...200...211 lbs. He had added 5 lbs to his body since the morning before. He was stunned, but he remembered that the weight gain formula was supposed to increase muscle size, so he figured most of the weight was from his muscles getting bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to lose he grabbed the shirt he had bought yesterday, grabbed some sweat pants put them on, raced to his car, now having to push his seat all the way back, and his belly still rubbing up against the steering wheel, he went the the local sporting  good store. He walked in, not realizng that his 'new' shirt was a bit too small for him his belly was hanging out of it. Whent he store owner saw this, he started quietly snickering. Brad tried on 4 different pant sizes and was only able to get a pair that was 2 sizes too small, but he could still get them buttoned. Brad bought the pants and an oversized hoody to cover his new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived at the field on time, when everyone else was arriving. The coach blew his whistle for everyone to come into the weight room. Brad had been walking slowly accross the field, while everyone else was running, so he started to run as well. Well, when he was the last to arrive at the room and was completely out of breath. Everyone was looking at him and seemed very impressed (because with the hoody on, he looked pretty buff). One by one, everyone was called to get their height, weight and maximum bench press measured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick...5'11...180 lbs...max bench: 180 lbs.<br>\r\nFrank...6'0....186 lbs...max bench: 190 lbs.<br>\r\nand so on and so on...then it came down to Kyle's turn. <br>\r\nKyle....6'1....184 lbs...max bench: 185 lbs.\"<br>\r\n\"Well done Kyle,\" said the coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, and now we have Brad...who looks like he is going to beat all of you out of the max. bench spot this year. <br>\r\nBrad....5'8....211 lbs! Wow, brad, you really have put on some muscle! You are 20 lbs heavier than everyone else here! <br>\r\nOh wait, brad, I need a correct measurement, you need to take off your hoody. Let's see those muscles! <br>\r\nBrad was reluctant at first, but then he finally pulled off the hoody. Everyone was shocked as his big giant jiggly gut was hanging over his tight pants. Everyone was astonished. <br>\r\n\"What the hell...\" everyone said. And they each walked closer to Brad poking and jiggling his new belly, and laughing histarically at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, that's enough!\" Said the coach. \"Brad, please take your max. bench measurement.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of now, there were 180 lbs on the bar, he tried and tried and could'nt budge it. \"Ok, take off 5\" the coach said. and Brad still couldn't <br>\r\nmake the bar move. \"Ok, another 5..\" and Brad was barely able to move it, but he did.<br>\r\n\"Well, well..Brad, you outweigh every person here, and you are the weakest, so I think that is a definite clue that you don't need to be on the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But coach!, let me give it a shot...I know I can be a good player....or maybe I shouldn't embarrass myself infront of so many people again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes were even a bit misty, remembering the laughing and struggle to lift the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Damn them.  Damn coach.  And Kyle...\" his voice trailed off.  He sighed again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Flashback----<br>\r\n  Brad and Kyle are both nine years old messing around in Kyle's backyard.  They're tossing a miniature football to eachother laughing because the muddy ground was very slick from the rain last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Kyle!  Catch!\" Brad called in a squeeky voice.  Hadn't yet reached puberty.  He heaved the ball over to his friend who was slightly taller and slightly rounder than himself.  Kyle took a few steps backward and caught it, but the force caused him to lose balance and he fell back into a huge mud puddle, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Haha!  Dude, you're a mess!\" Brad chuckled.<br>\r\n  \"Speak for yourself!\" Kyle laughed.  He got up, ran over to a surprised Brad and tackled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Aagh!\" Brad hollered, falling to the earth with him.  The two kids laughed and rolled around on the ground trying to pin one another.  After about five minutes, the two were out of breath and laid upon their backs looking at the clouds.  Kyle broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Brad, you're my best bud.  Let's be buds forever,\" Kyle smiled.  Brad grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ok!  Heck we can even go to the same college!\" Brad laughed, tossing the ball up into the air.  Kyel caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yea!  Heck, I'll bet if we try hard enough, we'll both make it to the college football team!\" Kyle answered.  Brad got excited at this.  His large eyes shot open and he rose to his small feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well then we better get practicing!\" Brad declared and they went right back to passing the lemon-shaped ball, laughing and both hoping their commitement would pay off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----end flashback----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Brad smirked.  Some dream.  He trudged to the pantry and snatched out a small bag of chips.  He ripped it open and started munching on them.  Then a smile came to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hmmph.  Well if coach won't give me a chance now....\" he started, grabbing a handful.  \"Then I can't wait to see the look on his face when he sees me in a few days.\"  It was then and there that Brad decided to stun everyone.  There would be no more criticizing or laughter at him.  He wouldn't let them.  He would simply laugh along and be like \"Yea!  I am fat, aren't I?\" He snickered.  Kyle can give him all the crap he wanted, but he wouldn't be laughing if Brad ate all his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"They haven't seen fat yet,\" Brad smiled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...Kyle comes back to the dorm....</span></div></div>",

Maybe go to the gym and loose your gut?\" he chuckled and Brad just smiled and replied \"Actually, I won a month trip to Cancun, and I was hoping you'd go with me?!\" Brad pulled out more fake papers. \"Kyle, the only thing is that we would have to leave today, I understand if you don't want to go.\" \"No man,\" Kyle said \"that would be awesome. I'll just pack and we'll go!\" Brad and Kyle packed and they left, but not before Brad grabbed the weight gain powder out of the cupboard.<br>\r\n They arrived in Cancun a few hours later and got off the plane (thank God Brad could get tickets at such a late notice). They arrived at the hotel and Brad and Kyle decided to go to the beach. They got dressed and went and hung out at the beach drinking the whole day Kyle didn't know, but Brad had been slipping the powder into his drinks along with some appetite increaser. Kyle got up and felt his distended belly for the first time and looked at Brad's \"Oh, well\" he thought \"this is a month of relaxation and at least I don't look as bad as Brad.\" Brad got up and run down to the water his flab hanging over his very tight swimsuit jiggling the whole way. Finally, they decided to go out partying. By now Kyle was starving and he ate the fattening party food all night.  </span></div></div>",

Kyle walked into the bathroom and for the first time in a long time saw his belly. He was about as big as Brad now. His shirt rolled up exposing a good two inches of his expanding gut. He turned to the side and saw that it hung over his straining waistband. Kyle hopped on the hotel scale... 175...180...185...190...195...200...204! \"Holy crap 24 pounds in two weeks! This damn scale must be broken!\" Kyle thought. He went to his room and pulled out a clean shirt and put it on. It hardly covered his chubby gut, but it would do. He pulled out his shorts, but couldn't button then. Kyle jumped on the bed struggling to get the button together but the flaps stayed a good three inches apart. Kyle snuck into Brad's room and pulled out a pair of his shorts. They fit quite nicely, why hadn't he noticed this before? Oh, well Kyle was starving and had to eat. He and Brad left the hotel, but not before Brad grabbed the powders and noticed Kyle wearing his shorts. Brad's plan was working quite nicely.  </span></div></div>",

Brad orders three donuts for himself and Kyle get a dozen donuts, three muffins, five cookies, and two loaves of italian cheesey bread. Kyle pays for his food and the clerk, Jena, notices the amount of food he bought. She smiles at him then looks at his belly and gives him his change. Kyle and Brad walk down to the beach and hang out. In less than an hour Kyle has finished his food he feels the shorts becoming a little more snug, but pays no attention because Brad walked up to him and handed him a couple of beers. Brad and Kyle hang out the beach all day drinking and eating by now the shorts are getting to be way to small and Brad has unbuttoned his. Brad had been gaining a bit on this trip too, though not as much as Kyle. Brad took off his shirt and Kyle noticed how much Brad had really gained, his swimsuit was untied and un buttoned and his gut hung over the waistband. His pecs were no where in sight and his thighs made the suit seem like spandex. Kyle decided not to say anything because he noticed Brad's shorts were starting to feel very uncomfartable on him. Kyle kept eating until Jena the bakery clerk walked by. Kyle notices how hot she looks in a swimsuit and tries to suck in his gut. She walks over noticing it's him and asks if he wants to play some beach volleyball. Kyle says yeah and they walk over to the court together. She stops at the food court first and orders what seems to be an extremly large amount of food for a girl her size. Her and Kyle sit down and they begin talking and forget about volleyball. By a half hour Kyle has finished two prezels, three nachos, two sodas, and three ice creams, while Jena has eaten none of it. Kyle's suit feels way too small even while he is sucking it in, he says he has to go, but not before they exchange numbers and she pats his belly and walks away. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Brad was sitting on the beach chair eating a grande nacho with about seven other plates askew the floor beneath him. His shorts were completely undone and his waistband was stretched to the limit. Brad got up and his belly flopped audibly over his waist and his gut hung three or four inches down. Kyle decided to stop sucking it in now that he was with Brad and as soon as he did the button on his swimsuit popped off and flew a few feet onto the beach and the tie ripped off. His belly pushed over the waistband and fell down about as far as Brad's. Kyle and Brad walked to the car and Brad noticed how soft Kyle's body had gotten and how it jiggled with every step he took. It seemed his face was filling out a bit too. When they got back to the hotel Kyle changed, but had to borrow some of Brad's clothes which were a struggle to get on, and decided he would call Jena. Jena invited him over for later that night. Kyle went to the cupboard and got out four aspirin for his hangover. Kyle didn't know that he had just eaten four weight gain pills. Brad then came out of the kitchen and  handed Kyle a milkshake with another four pills crushed in it. Kyle chugged it then took a nap before going to Jena's. Kyle woke up extremely hungry, but didn't want to be late for Jena's so he grabbed a few slices of cold pizzas and got in the car. He arrived at Jena's apartment and smelled some wonderful dessert foods. Kyle opened the door and found two tables filled with every kind of dessert possible. There were cakes, donuts, cookies, pies, candies, muffins, and every other dessert possible. Then Jena walked and gave Kyle some instructions. Kyle walked into her bedroom and found some clothes that had his name on them. he put them one and walked out to Jena. He was wearing a black leotard with some spandex shorts. They were quite roomy but still showed off his now large belly a lot. Jena gave him a shake, which had another four weight gain pills in it. Kyle drank it quickly then began eating it was amazing what the two weeks in Cancun had done to his appetite and metabolism. Kyle could eat like a horse, but his metabolism had slowed down so much it seemed that every piece of food ended up showing in his waistline. Kyle finished all the food a few hours later and fell asleep. <br>\r\n     Kyle woke up at Jena's house and smelled pancakes, waffles, bacon, eggs, sausage, and French toast. Kyle was starving so he went into the kitchen and began eating. Jena kept giving him orange juice filled with weight gain powder. Kyle finished the food within hours. By the last piece of French toast he felt the spandex and leotard pushing hard against his expanding stomach. Kyle went into the bathroom and took a shower. Kyle felt how soft he had gotten and when he flexed not a trace of his once hard body showed. He rubbed his protruding gut and felt the crease where he gut meet his waist. Kyle washed himself but felt himself getting turned on. Kyle realized he had started to like his body and was getting hard. He got out of the shower and got on the scale to see how much he weighed. The scales moved past 185...190...195..200...205..210 and stopped at 212. He weighed more than Brad did at weigh ins for football, but Brad had put on quite a bit of weight since their trip. Kyle went to put on his clothes and found they fit great. Then he looked at the tag and saw they where two sizes bigger than he remembered. Kyle didn't put it together then, but Jena had bought him bigger clothes. <br>\r\n     This regiment continued at Jena's for another two weeks until the end of Kyle and Brad's trip. He spent the night and mornings at Jena's and the day with Brad. Both trying hard to fatten up Kyle. Kyle was beginning to like his growing belly, but didn't catch on to either's plan. Kyle also didn't want any of them to know how much he enjoyed it. On the final night Kyle went to Jena's house put of the now very tight leotard and spandex and walked into the kitchen to find a naked Jena covered completely in the desserts with a giant layer cake laying on her flat stomach. By now Kyle didn't need any pills to eat this much food and began digging in. He had exposed Jena's body in a manor of one hour and left only a few spoonfuls of whipped cream. Jena got cleaned up then walked into the bedroom and called Kyle in. He walked over to her and found the room decorated with rose petals and very dim light. She watched as his belly jiggled greatly with every step and how the spandex and leotard was stretched to its breaking point across his large body. He jumped on the bed and the bed shook greatly and so did his body. Jena slowly took off Kyle's tight clothing. Kyle's body shook as she did this then Jena jumped onto his large gut and began fondling him. She gently caressed his large belly and moved her way up to his soft swollen tits. She slid her body up his and rubbed his tender nipples she rubbed hot message oil over his body slowly and rubbed every inch of his expanded body. She kissed his face softly then made her way down to he leg and slid her soft oily hands down his massive thighs. Kyle was getting so turned on and loving every minute of this. Jena made her hands trace their way to his inner thigh and they made their way up and she grabbed him. Kyle instantly got rock hard and she moved her head down and began to massage his rock hard penis with her mouth and then slid back up to his face and the made out passionately and then Kyle felt his body explode. He cummed long and hard all over and Jena continued to message his penis with her hands making Kyle just continue. She rubbed the sticky cum all over Kyle's body and tenderly grabbed his tender nipples with her mouth. Jena continued this for another half hour. Then both of them fell asleep. <br>\r\n     In the morning both of them got up and took a shower together. Jena washed Kyle's body and he felt himself get hard. Finally when they were finished, Jena made Kyle step onto the scale. The needle wavered past 195...200...205...210..220...235... and stopped at 243. His gut hung far over his waist and his face had also filled out, there was no sign of his once 185 muscle football frame left. Kyle went into the bedroom and put on his clothes. The were a bit snug, his belly hung over, his love handles protruded, and his thick thighs filled the legs but they were fine. His shirt clung to his emphasizing his large gut, love handles, and tits. Kyle ate a large breakfast which didn't make his clothes situation much better, but nothing broke so he said his good byes and went to his and Brad's hotel to pack to leave. Brad was all ready when Kyle arrived so while he packed Brad decided to weigh himself. The scale moved 185..195..205..211 (his old weight) ... 220 and stopped at 234. Brad had gained 23 pounds on vacation, but that was nothing in comparison to Kyle's 59! Kyle finished packing and he and Brad left for the plane.     <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

After he finished them off, he went to the fridge for something to snack on; after all, if that stuff worked, he could eat whatever he wanted. He grabbed some leftover pizza and beer, and within 20 minutes they were both gone. It was late, so Brad decided to crash on the couch with a beer, watching T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke at about 6:30 the next morning. he felt strange, almost dizzy, but as soon as he sat up, his mind came into focus once again. He tried to stand up, but fell backwards. He now looked down, his stomach had grown out overnight. He must have gained 10 lbs! What did that stuff do to him? terrified, he ran to the kitchen, where a couple cans of Bulk-Up 3000 laid on the floor. He grabbed one and read the warning label to himself. 'WARNING! Possibly dangerous if taken in large amounts. Do not take more than one can every 12 hours. For best results, follow each dose with at least 45 minutes of constant exercise. Lack of exercise may cause lack of muscle mass or gain of unwanted weight.' He threw the can on the floor, and walked into the living room. If that was true, that means that he was getting weaker. He walked over to the couch to try and lift it up. Just a few days ago, it was as if he was lifting a feather, but now, he could barely get one end a foot off the ground. He had no choice; he couldn't stand being humiliated in front of the entire team. He called the coach and told him he had to quit, because his doctor told him to avoid overuse of his legs. He walked to the bathroom after getting off the phone. He decided to weigh himself, to find out what his next action should be. He stepped on the scale. the numbers rolled around ...</span></div></div>",

He drank a 2 liter and a couple cans of beer as well.  As he lay there on the couch, pizza box resting on his bloated stomach, he belched his way to sleep.  Kyle was all over that and put on a very snug shirt that barely covered his chubby midsection and went out for a real meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"He can shove this up his ass,\" Kyle thought as he went through his first pizza and 2nd glass of soda at the pizza shop.  By then the next one came around and the next one after that.  The waitress was amazed at his ability to put away food and said, \"If you finish that third one, its on the house.\"  And so he did.  By the time he left, Kyle had eaten 3 pizzas and drank 7 glasses of soda.  His shirt was crawling up his body as his gut was pooching out the bottom.

He has a totally expected hissy fit and went to tell Kyle but then he noticed that Kyle was really looking heavy.  He had grease all over his shirt from the three pizzas and Brad was yelling at him instantly.  \"You think you can eat like that and be an athlete?  You are too lazy to be worth anything to this team!...\"  Kyle shrugged it off, looked down and noticed his belly was really hanging over a good 4\" from the 12 pound gain, not to mention the heavy, fatty food he had devoured the night before.</span></div></div>",

Despite the shrill ring of their mutual alarm clock, Kyle woke up sluggishly, mostly conscious though still curled up in the sheets on his bed, even under that sweat pants and a long-sleeve shirt, when Brad shook him to wake him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle only murmured a response until Brad rolled him over the side of the bed, letting him crash on the floor. Kyle screamed as he fell. He sat up, rubbing the back of his head, saying \"Ah, jeez criminy son of a...\" He looked up at Brad, wearing boxer shorts and a tight muscle shirt. \"What in Howl's Moving Castle was that all about, You crazy dumba-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember what today is?\" exclaimed Brad, clearly with the enthusiasm of a morning person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break your roomate's head open day?\" he said, clearly with the enthusiasm of a normal person who thinks morning people should die. He looked at the palm of his hand, then rubbing his head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just kinda reboot for a second of something. I think You'll get in 3... 2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH CRAP IT'S FOOTBALL TRYOUT DAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And 1 (basketball) how good of you to remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stood up and threw his blanket back on his bed. \"Well, do you think our hair-brained scheme has actually worked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed a little as Kyle stepped onto and over his bed to get close to him. \"Well, I don't know about you, but check this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad took off his A-shirt (note: also called a wifebeater) over his head to show off his muscled midsection. His pecs bulged from underneath strong shoulders and between two large, perfectly round biceps. They pulsed a gentle heave as he took a breath in, then out. Brad ran his index finger from his collar bown down the middle of one of his chest muscles, then ticked as it moved down each ab... tick slide over the first... tick slide over the second... tick slide over the third, and stopped at that fourth abdominal muscle that angles so sharply downward, his boxers a little jauntily crooked hugging his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was staring. Though Brad visibly enjoyed the attention, Kyle shook his head out of it and just mumbled something about it. He turned and walked away, in the first of many actions in muscle memory for getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't leave so fast there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I showed you what I got. Now you gotta show me you! I mean, I can't exactly guess what you got underneath a sweatsuit, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle bit his lower lip. He walked, head lowered back to where Brad was standing. In all honesty, Kyle didn't remember what his own body looked like; he had spent all of his time noticing Brad's improvement and just figuring he was doing as well. Of course, you have some idea what you look like, so it wasn't as much a surprise to Kyle as it was to Brad when he took off the long-sleeved shirt and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked at his broad shoulders, thick arms, sculpted pecs, and six pack abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah dude!\" Brad said. \"Nice! When did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had been too busy noticing Brad's new physique to see his own changing. \"Man I don't know! This is awesome!\" Kyle said as he flexed his arms and showed Brad his wide back. \"All that working out and eating really paid off!\" He pulled off his sweatpants standing in just his boxers to show off his legs. His thighs were big powerful redwoods and his calves were like footballs on the back of his legs! \"I can't believe this. I'm even bigger than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed. The two of them had always been about the same height and size. True, Kyle was a little heavier back before they got ripped, Brad was sure he was bigger and stronger than him now. \"Please. If anything we <i>might</i> be the same size. Just look at this.\" Brad said. He then flexed an impressive bicep. Kyle flexed his too and put it right beside Brad's. Brad couldn't believe it, but Kyle's bicep was about an inch bigger than his!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA!\" Kyle said poking him in the chest. \"I told you I was bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad flexed his quad and said, \"Whatever man, I can tell from here my thighs are bigger than yours!\" Kyle flexed his and sure enough Brad's legs were a few inches bigger than Kyle's. \"HA!\" Brad said pushing Kyle. \"What did I say?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle frowned and ran to the other room. In a second, he was back with the scale. \"Let's really see who is bigger!\" Brad was nervous. Kyle was always about 5-10 pounds heavier than him. Even though it used to be fat, Kyle was ripped! He already proved he had bigger arms and Brad personally thought Kyle's pecs might be a little bigger, but Brad's abs were more shredded. Brad stepped on the scale and watched as the needle went up and up and up, passing his old weight (when they first moved in) of 177, then even passed his fat weight of 200 to stop at a massive 210 pounds of muscle. \"Yeah baby! WOO!\" Brad yelled flexing. \"Hop on up there!\" He said to Kyle smacking him on the back. Kyle stepped up and watched as the needle climbed up past his original weight of 185, past his fat weight of 207 and stopped at a whopping 213. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHA! YEAH! In your face Brad!\" Kyle taunted him. \"Bigger and stronger! Look at these guns!\" he said flexing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah we never said anything about stronger! Let's prove that right here, right now!\" Brad said pushing Kyle. Kyle smiled. The two of them had wrestled plenty of times. This should be fun. They went to the living room and moved the couch and table out of the way and went at it. Neither of them had put a shirt or pants on so they got to feel every rock hard muscle. Brad was surprised at how thick and broad Kyle was. Kyle was surprised at how strong and quick Brad was. They went at it for a while, neither showing signs of giving up. Kyle would have Brad pinned, but Brad would get out and put Kyle in a hold. After about 20 minutes they had worn each other out. They paused to take a break when Brad noticed the time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" he shouted. \"Kyle we have to hurry! Tryouts start in like 10 minutes! They ran and grabbed their gear and threw on some athletic clothes before racing off to the football field. The coach was surprised to see how big the two of them had gotten! </span></div></div>",

Jim pointed at Kyle's belly and said, \"Just make sure you stay in shape bro! Looks like these last couple weeks have started to take a toll on ya.\" Sure enough, Kyle's rock hard abs were starting to be replaced by a soft flabby belly. He was still pretty muscular but he had obviously gained weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guys smiled a little. \"Dang Kyle! When did that happen? You should have kept working out like I was!\" Brad said flexing. He had continued to work out along with the eating and partying so he still had a pretty solid body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guys hope to see y'all around! We have to meet up with coach!\" Tyler said as he and Jim walked off. Brad and Kyle walked back to their dorm room and sat on the couch with a beer watching TV without their shirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle frowned and put a hand on his small belly. \"Boy I'm going to miss having abs,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked over at him and smiled. \"Dude you can still workout and get them back! They're under here somewhere.\" He laughed patting Kyle's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I think I'm just going to take it easy. Besides it's not like I have anything to stay in shape for!\" Kyle said relaxing and grabbing another beer. \"I think I'm going to order a pizza. You want some bro?\" Brad shook his head and said he'd settle for one more beer, but Kyle persisted. \"Aw come on! Just have a couple slices.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad flexed his six pack abs and bounced his pecs before deciding a couple slices couldn't hurt. Besides, it's not like he had to worry about football practice! He would just work it off in the gym later. \"OH alright. Just a couple slices!\" Brad said grabbing his second drink out of the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys ended up eating two larges and finished an eight pack by themselves! Brad ate half of one and Kyle at the rest. They had fun just hanging out like regular old college students and just lost track of how much they were eating and drinking.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks had passed since the guys had been cut from the team, and in that time they had both begun to adjust to their new lifestyles. Brad had decided to keep up his normal routine and was still working out most nights of the week, spending a regular few hours down at the Gym - he had been eating more, due to Kyle's influence, but was converting any extra pounds he might have gained into pure muscle, resulting in him looking more and more buff. Most of Brad's clothes had become uncomfortably tight as his muscles grew larger and larger. At home, he rarely wore a shirt, and often paraded around admiring his toned physique in whatever reflective surface he could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was starting to think all Brad's showing off was a joke at his expense. With no practice to train for and no team to keep in shape for, Kyle had become a little aimless in his weekly routine. He had quit going to the gym, justifying to himself as saving money. But the money he had saved was quickly being spent on food. Every night he ordered a takeaway, and he had developed something of an addiction to Pizza. Not two days would go by without him ordering an extra large Pizza of some kind, which he would usually eat to himself. When he wasn't eating Pizza for dinner, he was visiting McDonalds for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this junk food had had an effect on Kyle's once trim waistline. His abs were no longer visible, and his stomach had begun to take on a round, bloated shape, even when he hadn't been eating. When he wasn't in classes, he had taken to just sitting on the couch snacking, usually with a beer in one hand and an X-Box controller in the other. His pants had become uncomfortably tight, so he mostly just sat around in sweats or underwear, only changing when Brad got home. He frequently had to scramble to get dressed whenever Brad would return from the gym, sometimes just retreating to his room with a jumbo bag of Doritos and a six pack so he wouldn't have to see Brad flexing his pecs. He would never admit it to his room mate, but he was embarassed by what had happened to his once sculpted body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRP!\" Kyle belched as he placed his beer down on the coffee table. He pulled his T-shirt up to expose his stuffed, beer filled stomach and gave it a slap. It jiggled slightly and he sighed. He was getting bigger. He pulled the top off over his head and stared down at his shirtless body; his stomach was a full blown beer belly, and his once firm pecs had grown soft, on the verge of becoming man boobs. He groaned as he brought himself to his feet and walked over to the fridge. He knew he shouldn't, but he really felt the urge to finish last night's leftover Pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the box, he quickly devoured the remaining slices and went back to the couch, rubbing his firm, full belly in satisfaction. He missed his abs, but having the belly was strangely satisfying - he felt proud when it was full, and, actually, wanted to show it off the same way Brad showed off his muscles...</span></div></div>",

His guilt driven binges and constant snacking were causing his to fatten up at a much faster rate than before, but he was so focused on trying to avoid thinking about Brad's accident that he hadn't really noticed his shirts getting tighter, his pants starting to tear the seams and his underwear shrinking around his ballooning ass. Further contributing to his gain was the fact that whenever Brad ate, he ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the month and a half that Brad had been in his bandage, Kyle had gained almost twenty five pounds, most of which was going to his ever expanding gut. </span></div></div>",

Brad saw Kyle struggling with his shirt and smiled. Brad had tried to warn his roommate that he was blowing up, but Kyle wouldn't listen. He looked at his own body and his smile grew. While Kyle was out partying and stuffing his face, Brad was serious about getting on the football team. His shirt was also tight. Except Brad's body was ripped! His broad shoulders and thick arms stretched out the sleeves while his buff pecs and wide back filled the rest of his shirt. In fact, his shirt couldn't cover his bottom row of abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Brad yelled pumping his fists in the air. He had made the team! Kyle finally gave up looking for his name. \"Better luck next year buddy.\" Brad said patting Kyle on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats Brad!\" the boys turned around to see the football coach. \"Wow you two really bulked up since tryouts! That's great.\" He looked over Kyle and frowned before looking at Brad and smiling. \"Son you got buff! Looking forward to having you at practice.\" Coach walked back into his office as Kyle and Brad walked back to their dorm room. Brad was beaming while Kyle looked bummed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked back in their room, Kyle plopped down on the couch with a beer. \"Whatever man. I bet it will be more fun to do what I want and not have to go to practice all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was still excited. \"Aw come on bro don't be like that! This is going to be awesome! I can't wait for practice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Brad had a quick workout while Kyle went and had pizza with a couple other guys. The next day Brad showed up for practice still giddy. Brad was buff but there were plenty of guys still bigger than he was! Practice was a lot harder than he thought it would be. They ran the whole time. Brad made some great catches and ran the ball well but he got hit pretty  hard several times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter practice, Brad was walking back up to the locker room with some other guys when coach stopped him and said. \"Look son, you did great today, but we think you are going to have to put in a lot of work if you want to get any playing time. You are going to really need to bulk up! See ya tomorrow.\" With that he patted Brad on the butt and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad walked up to the locker room. Most of the other guys were already on the way out. Brad was just in his compression shorts as he walked over to the mirror and looked at himself. He was ripped! His bulging muscles were rock hard. His thick neck, boulder shoulders, softball biceps, barrel chest and cinder-block abs were perfect. His thin waist, tree trunk thighs, football calves, and sporty butt filled out his shorts. He flexed some more and adjusted his big package before showering and going home. Brad was proud of his gains. Now he'd have to work even harder to get bigger. He just hoped he didn't get as fat as Kyle was getting.</span></div></div>",

He kept eating healthy, but he increased his calorie intake and worked out harder than ever while taking protein and other supplements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks coach. It feels great being big and getting to play and all. I'll see you tomorrow.\" Brad said leaving. He smiled as he drove home. He loved his body. All the working out and eating had put several pounds of rock hard muscle on his body. He naturally lost his eight pack, but he still had a thick six pack. He had broad, boulder shoulders and a wide muscular back. His pecs and arms were thicker and fuller than ever. His lower body was even more impressive. He had a nice bubble butt and massive thighs. He swore even his bulge was bigger. He definitely seemed hairier. Brad had been able to make significant gains in his size and strength while maintaining his ripped physique and football speed and agility. He was getting a lot of playing time thanks to being able to give and take big hits while still being able catch and run the ball well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brad got home, he peeled his tight, sticky tank top off of his sweaty body to reveal his bulging muscles. He then walked in the living room to see Kyle on the couch playing X box also shirtless; however, they couldn't look any more different. Kyle had completely given up working out and had started to eat any and all junk food in sight. His body was much fatter and softer. His beer belly pushed out over his waist and he was getting man boobs and multiple chins. Kyle's lifestyle was great motivation for Brad to continue to work out and eat right. Brad couldn't help but notice Kyle had a half empty large pizza box beside him and a few empty beer bottles by his feet. Brad would usually get a couple pieces or a couple beers before Kyle finished all the food off but not this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't wait for me to have dinner?\" Brad asked as he made a protein shake. He grilled a couple chicken breasts and some asparagus for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle frowned eating more pizza. \"Cut me some slack bro. I have to feed this bad boy!\" He said slapping his belly. Brad chuckled as he watched Kyle shaking his belly. Since the two guys were so large, there was not room on the couch for both of them, so Brad sat in the recliner- filling up the entire chair- to eat and play X box with Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad thought about the transformation he and Kyle had gone through. Kyle used to be ripped! \"Hey man are you happy being this big?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah bro. It's so much easier than having to work out all the time to maintain a physique like you. Besides, I get to eat whatever I want, whenever I want! I love it. I mean, it's not like I could've been on the football team anyway.\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you probably could have! All you had to do was keep working out like I did!\" Brad said. \"It's probably not too late, you can start working out with me again if you want to get back in shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled. \"Thanks but I seriously like being this big. You wouldn't think it but its a lot of fun. When you are off partying with the football team and with those sorority girls, there are a few other guys that will come over and hang out. There are even a few girls around here that like their men big!\" He winked and shook his belly again making Brad smile. </span></div></div>",

His once rock hard abs had taken the hardest hit; fading away completely and bulging out into a large, round belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad emerged from his room one morning wearing a pair of sweatpants. His new-found gut bulged over the waistband, but remained surprisingly firm and round. He had begun to walk around the apartment topless recently, after noticing his shirts were getting a little too tight. He had always preferred tight clothes that showed off his toned body, but lately that had become a disadvantage, and he found he could barely fit into a lot of his old stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked into the kitchen, absent mindedly rubbing his stomach, he heard Kyle's door creak open and turned around to see his roommate emerge from his bedroom in unbuttoned jeans and a shirt that was obviously a size too small. Kyle had been gaining weight since they started back at college, and it was starting to become more and more obvious. Kyle's flabby stomach peeked out from beneath his shirt, and the unbuttoned jeans were clearly unbuttoned for a reason; they could no longer contain his pot belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever hear of a shirt?\" Kyle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad turned around and smirked. \"Hey, my muscles are too big for most of my stuff. At least I don't go around with my belly hanging out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked down and saw his fleshy stomach was on display. He struggled to pull down his shirt, but it was no use. \"Ahhhh crap,\" he sighed. \"Well, I'm not the only one who's been packing it on you know. Your getting a gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed and patted his stomach. \"Don't be ridiculous, this is all muscle,\" he shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muscle?!\" Kyle smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Brad said, a little uncertainly. \"Muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gaining dude,\" Kyle said. \"All you've done since getting dropped from the team is eat. You're appetite is even bigger than mine now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta keep my strength up,\" Brad shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for? More eating? You haven't worked out in weeks,\" Kyle said. \"Face it Brad, you're getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked down at his stomach, then flexed his thick biceps. Was Kyle right? Was he getting fat? Had he fooled himself into thinking this was all muscle? He hurried to the bathroom scale and hopped on; the reading came up at 212. Two hundred and twelve pounds...he had grown...but was it really fat? Brad stared at his reflection in the mirror, running his hands over his bulging belly...</span></div></div>",

As the new school year begins, both boys begin to get lazy and forget about being so strict with their football and whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd chapters to make this story full of fun and fantasy.
