Austin has always felt that his older brother Jeremy is a bit of a bully. He uses his age and size advantage to force him into doing things he doesn't want to do, and to always get his way. Since Jeremy became a teenager, it's gotten even more stand-offish. However, Austin's life is about to change when, while walking home from school one day, he finds a glowing rock on the ground, a rock that seems to have some interesting effects on him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Collin (16) and Cody (14). Collin and Cody are as close as two brothers could be. Not only are they each other's best friends, but they also each have a slight crush on the other, though neither have the courage to admit it. When they take a mini-vacation together though and share a bed because of it, they end up exploring their feelings with each other, and discover that they have a certain chemistry together... a growing chemistry, if you will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Patrick (17), Nick (12), and Nate (12). Patrick knew this his twin younger brothers Nick and Nate were actually adopted, but he nor anyone else in his family ever really knew the truth of where they actually came from. On the twins' twelfth birthday, when they suddenly start to sprout up at a rapid pace, Patrick discovers he's in for quite an interesting and hair-raising experience...</span></div></div>",

He had just been playing video games in his house when Jeremy, his thirteen year old brother came in and booted him off the TV, claiming 'bigger brother privileges'. To Austin, that sounded like bullcrap, but since Jeremy was nearly a foot and a half taller than him and could pick him up by the armpits and drag him outside, it didn't really matter what he thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brisk fall air blew through his hair, causing him to shiver. He didn't have a chance to grab his jacket before leaving, so he was out here slightly cold. Sure, he could go back inside, but Jeremy would certainly give him grief about it. If only there was a way to turn the tables a little, and make him see what it would be like to be the little brother for a change. But, without a miracle, Austin knew that could never--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted as his eyes caught a light streaking through the early evening sky. \"Is that a shooting star?\" Austin wondered aloud. He'd only heard about them before, never seeing one in person, and he thought it was especially weird to see one when it was so light out. Furthermore, there seemed to be something peculiar about just how this shooting star, if that's what it was, was traveling. However, he remembered what his mom had once told him about making a wish on a shooting star, and with all his frustration with his older brother boiling up inside of him, he figured it was worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could be the bigger brother for once, and let Jeremy get a taste of his own medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing seemed to change at first, and Austin felt his heart start to sink. \"Shouldn't have gotten my hopes up,\" he muttered, looking back down at his feet and sighing. As he turned his head upward again, though, he dropped his jaw as he saw that the path of the object flying through the sky had seemed to shift slightly, now headed directly towards him! He began to feel a little frightened, but as it got closer, he realized that the object had been much closer than he had thought it was all along, and it really was very small, finally crashing into the ground about a hundred feet from him, leaving a small trail of smoke behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran over to the crash site, seeing the small crater that had formed around ... whatever it was. As he peered into the crater, he saw a small hard object, almost like a stone, at the center of it. It looked to be about as big as a quarter and twice as thick, but the most amazing thing about it was that it glowed a bright blue! It was almost entrancing, as if the light from the stone beckoned him to pick it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, he felt a small shock run up and down his arm, nearly dropping the object back down. However, the spark was more startling than painful, and after a few seconds, he began to feel a surging sense of energy build through him. Whatever the stone was, he thought, so far it was having some pretty neat effects!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that those effects were just getting started...</span></div></div>",

After a few more pokes, Austin determined that it was ok to try and pick it up again. The stone seemed to glow a bit brighter and Austin briefly felt a rather nice tingling sensation go through his body once more, but other than that nothing else seemed to happen. After admiring it for another moment, Austin pocketed it. The glow didn't show through his pants, which was good since he didn't want Jeremy to see it and take it for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin headed back inside, entering through the front door and into the living room. Jeremy was on the couch, just casually flipping through the channels and not actually watching anything, which made Austin a bit upset again. Why did Jeremy get to use the TV when he wasn't actually <i>watching</i> anything? It was completely unfair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy suddenly noticed his little brother watching him flip through the channels. \"What, came back to cry again?\" Jeremy asked in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Austin protested right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. While you're up you can go into the kitchen and get me some ice cream.\" Jeremy ordered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you get it yourself?\" Austin whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if I get up, I'll pick you up and throw you into the kitchen to get it for me anyway. Now hurry up before I do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin gritted his teeth and went into the kitchen as he was told. If only Austin was bigger and stronger than his brother, he would show that big bully who was boss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought this, the little stone in his pocket pulsed and glowed briefly brighter. Because it was in his pocket, he didn't notice it at all, but absently he tugged at his collar, which suddenly felt a bit tight to him.</span></div></div>",

Austin didn't know why he expected anything, but he still felt a little peeved. Clenching his fists in anger, he turned around and stormed up to his room, knowing he would probably feel bummed about this for the rest night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, though, Austin seemed to get sleepier much earlier than normal, already yawning at just 8:00pm. Luckily, he had finished his school work earlier in the afternoon, so he decided to go to bed early. \"I hope I'm not coming down with anything,\" he thought, stripping off his clothes and changing into his pajamas. He was momentarily surprised that they felt tighter than they normally did, and looking down at his stomach, he noticed that the bottom of his shirt just barely met the top of his pants, and his ankles were now exposed, even though the legs of the pants used to reach all the way to his heels . Shrugging, he wrote it off as a sign of either havig a nice little growth spurt, or someone messing up on the last laundry day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he picked up his pants from the floor, he remembered the stone from his pocket, and pulled it out. The glow was still there, although in the darker room it seemed to have dimmed somewhat. \"Well, at least something cool happened today,\" he muttered to himself. Looking around his room, he tried to decide where he could put the stone, but nowhere appeared to be safe enough to keep from being seen if his brother butted in some point during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he decided to just put the stone under his pillow, covering it so that the blue glow wouldn't keep him awake. Crawling under the sheets and laying down, Austin closed his eyes, thinking about what life would be like if the tables were turned and he was the bigger one for once. \"I'd love to see Jeremy's face if that happened,\" he murmured to himself, a slight smile forming on his face as he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the night, the blue stone continued to pulse and glow, as Austin's body continued to slowly grow...</span></div></div>",

This made Austin wake himself a while later, and pressed it to make it stop.  Not knowing what was going on during the night, the youngster yawned heavily and uncovered the duvet, when there was a huge surprise that brought right in front of Austin\u2019s eyes.  All he can see is his pyjamas looking so small and tight, it looked like it had shrunk from the wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Austin knew his pyjamas fits him perfectly last night, but that\u2019s when he then see\u2019s his legs and feet had stretched much further than usual.  Something\u2019s amiss, and Austin thought he was dreaming still.  But he there was one thing he had to check and so he sat up and takes a look under the pillow to see the stone was glowing at him.  That\u2019s when his heart beat so hard, and questions him with a much excited and nervous look to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, if that thing glows, then that means...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Austin stood up, he couldn\u2019t believe his luck!

His expression says it all, and that smiles in shocks made him feeling amazed and looked around his newly grown body of a nine year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!  I\u2019m so tall!

Austin went to the kitchen and saw his older brother sitting down, eating his breakfast. Thankfully, it was now the weekend, so Austin would have plenty of opportunities for pay back at Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin walked over to Jeremy and tapped him on the shoulder. When Jeremy turned around and looked at Austin, he nearly choked on his food. He looked up and up at his now taller, younger brother. He couldn't believe how tall Austin was!

Happy Birthday to you!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick sat at the patio table as his mother stepped out of the kitchen holding the cake, loaded with twenty-four candles, twelve bunched together per side. She sat the cake in front of Nick and Nate, Patrick's twin brothers, who both looked at it eagerly, ready to blow out their set of candles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Birthday Nick and Naaaate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Patrick knew that Nate and Nick weren't his biological brothers, but instead had been adopted when he was five. It was fairly obvious; both boys had red hair and pale skin, while Patrick and his parents had a more tan complexion with darker hair. He vaguely remembered the two of them coming home as babies, but since he knew them from such a young age, he figured it was more or less how any other set of brothers would behave, especially twins. He would give them a hard time and they would gang up on him, but overall they got along fairly well, and the fact that they weren't actually related by blood didn't seem to matter much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Biiirthday to yoooooou!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, the were celebrating their twelfth birthdays, a day that both of them had looked forward to for weeks. Though their parents had offered to throw them a party, they declined, instead wanting to just have a simple family gathering with none of their friends. Patrick figured it was just as well; though he got along okay with the twins, the kids their age that they hung out with were another story altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe song had been finished for several seconds, and Patrick and his parents watched in anticipation, though Nick and Nate seemed to be taking their sweet time blowing out the candles. Finally, impatience got the best of Patrick. \"Well? What are you waiting for?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Nick and Nate replied by finally blowing out their candles, each getting them all out with little effort. Patrick's parents applauded, and, though he rolled his eyes, he smiled, clapping along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'd you each wish for?\" he asked as his mom started to cut the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish?\" Nate asked, a grin still on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, didn't you guys make a wish?\" Patrick said, giving him a questioning look. \"That's what you're supposed to do on your birthday, ya know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick adjusted his glasses, the one obvious identifying trait that separated him from Nate. \"Well, I don't think it matters what we wished. The two of us already know what's going to come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confused Patrick even more. \"What? What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins exchanged glances, looking as if they knew something Patrick didn't. \"Well, let's just say that this birthday is something special,\" Nate finally replied. \"It's about time we grow up, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick squinted his eyes and tilted his head. \"I guess. I mean, twelve isn't exactly teenager, yet, but you're getting close. Don't worry about becoming an adult too quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick giggled. \"No, that's not quite what we meant. Just... just wait. You'll see what we're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Nate nodded in confirmation. \"Real soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them dived into the pieces of cake in front of them, Patrick felt a shiver run down his spine. What in the world could they possibly mean?</span></div></div>",

Patrick had tried to get them to talk about what they had meant but the twins were frustratingly coy about it. When he asked them when they were together they just grinned at each other before looking at him and saying, \"You'll see!\" and when he cornered them when they were apart (Nick while he was on the way to the bathroom and Nate while he was getting more soda out of the big fridge in the garage) they both responded in different, yet similar ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had pushed his glasses up, the frames making a slight clicking sound that tended to get on Patrick's nerves (considering that Nick usually never adjusted them pointedly before saying something unless he was planning on being vague or smart alecky about it), and said, \"Well, what do you think happens to boys our age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick had thought for a moment before responding, \"You...get older?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had chuckled and shook his head slightly, \"Well duh, but what else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick didn't appreciate the condescension and barked, \"Well how should I know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick pointed up at him, poking his nose playfully, \"See, you wouldn't be so upset if you were smarter. Just wait! Like we said, you'll see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had run off with a giggle after that, locking the bathroom door behind him so Patrick didn't get any ideas about pranking him while he was on the toilet. As for Nate, when Patrick had closed the door leading into the house behind him, blocking it, the little red head had sighed and merely said, \"Wait, okay? Don't be so impatient!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What's the big deal? Can't you just tell me?\" Patrick had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh, of course I could! But that's no fun.\" He grinned as he said this, winking at Patrick. \"I'll give you a hint though: What do you think happens to boys our age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this again...\" Patrick had thought, keeping his annoyance down and actually thinking this time. \"Let's see...I guess...maybe puberty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate chuckled and said, \"Think about that for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had then grabbed a bottle of Pepsi and darted around Patrick, getting back inside the house. Patrick sighed and rubbed his forehead. Sometimes, those two were more trouble than they were worth. \"It IS their birthday though, I guess they can have their fun.\" Patrick murmured to himself, heading back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick wasn't about to be satisfied until around nine o clock, when their mother had clapped her hands and said, \"Alright you two, bed time! Upstairs and brush your teeth, now please, and no complaining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins sighed in unison and jumped up, running upstairs to the bathroom. Their parents' bedroom was on the first floor, along with the kitchen, dining room, living room, and another bathroom. The second floor was officially the domain of the kids, the only rooms up there being Patrick's room, the twin's room, and the bathroom. Patrick helped his mother clear the dishes and put them in the dishwasher, the sounds of laughter and running water coming from upstairs. \"Make sure those two actually go to bed, alright?\" Their mother said, sighing slightly. \"Those two can be such a handful sometimes I swear! Are you sure you're going to be able to handle them while your dad and I are gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, please. They're just two little kids. What could possibly go wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir parents had been planning on going on a trip for awhile now, though they were being cagey about the reason. It wasn't strictly business and it wasn't pleasure either but they didn't get any clearer than that. Patrick assumed it had something to do with the twins, the trip being planned so close to their birthday and all. She sighed and kissed Patrick on the forehead. \"Oh, I know sweetie but I'm a mother. We worry. It's part of the job description.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the dishes packed away Patrick bade his mother good night and headed upstairs, the lights in the house going off one by one as everyone made their way to their rooms. Patrick planned to stay up for a few more hours yet, surfing the net on his laptop for awhile, when his name was called out in unison by his brother's. It was something Patrick got used to hearing, considering the twins often spoke together and finished each others sentences in a stereotypical twin fashion. \"Patrick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped and looked into his brother's bedroom. \"What's up you guys? Mom said to go to bed, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate chuckled, laying out on his bed, arms behind his head, looking a bit smug. \"Yeah, we know. Guess you don't want to know what were talking about earlier then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick's interest was immediately piqued. He felt like he was walking into a trap but his curiosity was getting the better of him. He stepped into the room and closed the door, locking it. \"Okay you two. No getting out of it this time! What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate glanced casually over at Nick and said, \"I dunno, you think we should tell him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, who was hugging his knees slightly as he sat on top of his covers, sighed theatrically and shook his head. \"Nuh uh. No way. Not in a million years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick rolled his eyes and said, \"Come on you guys! No escape this time. Talk.\" His tone made it clear the time for games was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Patty boy but Nick said no way.\" Nate said, holding his hands up, like there was nothing he could do about it. \"Guess you're just gonna have to go back to bed and...wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly leaped to his feet, holding his hand up, finger extended like he was pointing at the moon. \"I've got a great idea! I can't tell you...so how about I show you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick clapped his hands to his cheeks and said, \"Aw man! You found a way around it! Guess I've got no choice now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys moved to the center of the room, holding hands. \"Ready?\" They said in unison, nodding once at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick, starting to lose his temper at all these games, said, \"Look you guys, this is getting annoying how about you just....tell me...what's going...on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice trailed off slightly as he watched his twin brother's bodies suddenly glow with an internal silvery light, their hair rising slightly like they were caught up in a light wind, their eyes closed. The effect only lasted for a second, the twin's eyes opening as the light disappeared. \"What...the heck was that?\" Patrick asked, unsure of what he had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on..just wait...the best part is coming.\" Nate said, holding up a hand, sounding slightly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick watched curiously as his brother's both seemed to pant, their pajama shirts riding up slightly with every deep gulp of hair, their hands still clasped tightly together. After a few minutes, Patrick started to notice something strange...their shirts seemed to be riding up higher as they breathed, slowly showing off more and more of their pale skin, the buttons on their shirts stretching slightly, showing off little ovals of flesh between each button. Patrick's eyes widened as he looked down, seeing the waistband digging in slightly to their bodies, the legs of their pajama bottoms rising up past their ankles, making a slow, smooth trek up their hairless legs. Their feet kept pace, slowly stretching along the carpet, their toes digging in, the feeling from this strange growth obviously pleasing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow...this feels even better than I thought it would...\" Nick murmured, licking his lips a little, the creaking sound of cloth filling the air. Both boys had started out at a rather runty four and a half feet tall but they were both easily cresting five foot even and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm yeaaaaah! I don't want this feeling to EVER stop!\" Nate said with a grin, taking a particularly deep breath, the ping of a button audible as it popped clear of Nate's top, revealing more of his chest. Nate chuckled appreciatively, his body still steadily expanding. The hems of their tops were now clearing their belly buttons, the sleeves growing ever tighter around their pale arms, seams popping as their thighs grew to be too much for their pant legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick could feel his heart racing as the twins swiftly approached his height of six feet, the sound of ripping cloth and lost buttons rising into a cacophony around him. He took a step back, Nate's hand quickly grabbing his and holding tight, yanking him closer. \"No, no, you wanted to know what we were talking about, now stick around until it's over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick was shocked by the force in Nate's grip, holding him still, inches away from the young growing bodies. The twin's eye line were now equal with his...and then above it! And the growth didn't appear to be stopping!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inch by inch the twins grew taller, forcing Patrick to watch as they rose higher and higher above him. Their clothes, made for rather short twelve-year-old boys, now seemed ridiculous trying to cling on to their bodies, which were now bigger than most adults! The front of their shirts had both completely ripped open, revealing their smooth, flat chests and stomachs, still looking similar to how they had looked before, just a lot... larger! Their pants didn't seem to be doing much better, ripped to shreds below the knees and squeeze tightly around their crotches. It was obvious that the sensation of growing was very pleasurable to the two boys; their straining bulges proved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand still firmly on Patrick's arm, Nate unclasped his hand from Nick's and brought it up to his chest. He began to slowly run down it with his fingers, closing his eyes and feeling his skin and brushing against his nipple. \"Mmmm,\" he moaned, \"this feels better than you could possibly imagine, Patrick! Too bad you'll never--\" He stopped mid-sentence, whimpering slightly, then opened his eyes, frowning slightly. \"Ah, dang it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Nick took his arms and folded them over his chest. \"You forgot that we have to stay touching to keep growing, didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Nate sighed, \"but that's okay. It's not like we won't get a chance to do it again, right?\" He let go of Patrick, the older teen quickly backing away to the wall, staring up at his brothers dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick only smiled in return, then turned his eyes down to see the results of what he and his brother had just done. Whistling, he nodded in approval. \"Impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one word for it,\" Patrick muttered under his breath, the twins either not hearing him or ignoring him. They certainly were a sight to behold; both were just over seven and a half feet tall, their massive figures still pale and boyish in proportion. He wasn't even as tall as their shoulders, and he didn't like the sound of what Nate had said about \"doing it again\". What on earth could've caused this, he wondered-- and what could he possibly do about it now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a car door slamming in the driveway outside. Turning around and looking out the window, his heart sank as he saw both of his parents in their car, now backing out of the driveway. They weren't supposed to leave until tomorrow, he thought. Where the hell are they going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spun back around to face the twins, Patrick noticed that they seemed to be eyeing each other a little suggestively. Nate was still feeling himself up, while Nick had brought his hand up behind his head, blushing while leaning back. He didn't like where this was going; they were his brothers, after all! But what could he do to stop these two adolescents who each had a good foot and a half on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, he waited until the twins each seemed to be completely distracted by each other, then quickly stepped around them and out of their bedroom. Neither of them did anything to stop him, too enamored with their bodies -- and with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick headed downstairs to the kitchen, hoping that his parents had left some clue or indication on why that had left tonight, instead of tomorrow like they had planned. Sure enough, there was a note on the kitchen table, but as Patrick sat down and started to read it, he could feel his stomach grow sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patrick,\" it read, \"We've known this day would come for years, but it still is as hard to deal with now as it was when we first heard about it. As you've probably discovered by now, Nick and Nate are no ordinary 12-year-old boys. They're descended from a race of godlike beings who can manipulate their size and physical characteristics at will, once they've reached this age. These traits have laid dormant in the DNA of their predecessors for thousands of years, but the right combination of recessive genes are present in them to allow them to use this power once again. Our family took them in because we descended from the caretakers of this race, and they're genetically conditioned to listen to us and do what we say, at least most of the time. We're the only ones who can guide them and help them learn how to contain themselves, and keep them from becoming a destructive force to society. Your mother and I have done our best over these last twelve years, but once they come into full control of their power, they must imprint onto a new caretaker, which is you, Patrick. We wish we could've given you more guidance than this, but any hint of influence from us beyond these basic instructions would seriously jeopardize your ability to control the twins. We know that you're strong enough to do it, though, and though we can never see you or your brothers again, we'll always be watching over all of you. Love, Mom and Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the letter drop to the floor, Patrick slumped back in the chair, his head swimming with questions. Why would his parents never even hint at something like this before? How is any of this possible? And what the hell can he do to get the twins to listen to him if they're able to grow whenever they want? It all seemed like a strange and horrible nightmare, and he sat there staring, hoping that by realizing it was a dream he would wake up from it. But minutes passed, and nothing changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he said aloud finally, \"if what this letter says is true, then I suppose I need to be back up their with the twins and make sure they're not doing anything too...\" He didn't know quite how to finish that sentence. Still shaking a little from the shock, he rose to his feet and slowly made his way back to the staircase. Climbing up the stairs, he listened for the sounds of Nate and Nick doing-- well, the things that they looked like they were about to do when he left the room. But he heard nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached their bedroom door, which was closed, he placed his hand on the handle and took a deep breath. Opening the door, he was shocked to see--</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Patrick was surprised to see both Nick and Nate, not only back to their normal sizes, but now tucked away quietly in bed, sleeping. The only evidence that anything extraordinary had happened were the bits of shredded cloth on the floor from their pajamas. He hesitated slightly before walking over to Nick's bed. He wasn't nearly as rambunctious and wild as Nate could get (though he could give him a run for his money when he got wound up) so Patrick felt a little more comfortable approaching him knowing that he could change himself so drastically...but then again that was only possible while they were touching...Patrick shook his head, feeling exhausted. This was all just...way too much for him to process right out of the blue! Maybe being confused was part of his \"training\" as a caretaker to these god like boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently shook Nick's bare shoulder, the younger boy groaning slightly before turning over onto his back, opening his eyes blearily. He grabbed his glasses and put them on, squinting at Patrick. \"Patrick? What are you doing? It's past our bedtime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's just that...I got a note from Mom and Dad and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Nick said, nodding, a bit of a sad, sympathetic look on his face. \"Yeah...I thought I heard them leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew this was going to happen?\" Patrick asked, blinking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah! I mean, ever since we were little we knew what was going to happen. We really, REALLY wanted to tell you Patrick, HONEST, but Mom and Dad made us promise not to. They said if we told you, you wouldn't be able to take care of us as good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know more about this than I do though I'd really like to learn.\" Patrick said, sitting down on the bed next to Nick. \"Should we wake Nate up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked over at his sleeping twin, a loud snore emanating from the other bed. \"Nah...let him sleep. He's not as good at explaining things as I am anyway. Not too long though, okay? I don't want to be tired for school tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick felt a shiver pass through his body at that thought. Two mischievous twins, who shared every class together and sat next to each other, with the ability to grow at will and no supervision? Things could SERIOUSLY get out of hand! \"We'll talk about that more in the morning. It might be better to keep you guys out of school for now until we can set some ground rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick giggled and said, \"Hey, you're already starting to sound like a caretaker! I knew you'd catch on fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly...IS a caretaker though?\" Patrick asked, scratching his head. \"What am I expected to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...take care of us?\" Nick said, like it was obvious. \"To be honest, we don't really know all that much about it either. Mom and Dad told us when we were little about what was going to happen but they said they couldn't tell us much of anything at all. Apparently we're supposed to all learn together, all three of us. All I know for sure is that you were always going to be our caretaker so we had to be adopted while you were young, so we'd grow up together and get close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long am I supposed to be your caretaker though?\" Patrick asked, almost dreading the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...forever...I mean, one of our kind hasn't existed for thousands of years! You need to be there to help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Forever?!\" Patrick shouted, Nate snuffling in his sleep at the sudden noise, turning over. \"That's...insane! I can't...what about MY life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Pat...it's not going to be THAT bad is it?\" Nick said, looking a little hurt at this negative reaction. \"We all get along don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but....but...I never agreed to this! It's not fair! What if I didn't WANT to be your servant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caretaker...you're not going to be a SERVANT that's stupid!\" Nick said, getting a little heated himself now. \"You're gonna be the only one who can control us! If we didn't have you then...then...we could just do whatever we wanted and things would get nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick took a few deep breaths, trying to calm down. He knew Nick was right but this whole situation had just become even more impossible. His academic and professional life wouldn't waver but his personal life was pretty much gone. Who would want to be with him if it meant babysitting an increasingly powerful set of god like twins? Into their adulthood? Wait...if they could change their physical characteristics would they ever necessarily age? The way their powers had been described (the phrase \"god like\" being employed) seemed to point to them being able to be as young or as old as they liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going to happen if I'm gone?\" Patrick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to LEAVE us are you?!\" Nick shouted, starting to look incredibly upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I mean...you know...I...\" He didn't want to actually say the word, but Nick slowly understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I...I don't know...we're going to have to learn all this stuff together.\" Nick said, tears shining slightly in his eyes. The enormity of this situation finally seemed to be weighing down on the young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick sighed and hugged his little brother, those thing arms wrapping tight around him. \"Don't worry...we will. We're in this together now, better or worse, so...we'll make the most of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...can I go to bed now? I'm really tired...\" Nick asked, yawning loudly, taking off his glasses again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. I'm going to be downstairs for awhile. I need to think about some stuff.\" Patrick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Night bro.\" Nick mumbled, already sleeping again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick slowly crept over to the door, closing it quietly behind him before making his way downstairs. He made a beeline for the kitchen and started making a pot of coffee. There was no way he was going to be getting sleep any time soon. \"Might as well have something to do while I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the coffee percolated in the kitchen, a mug with sugar and cream already added to it sitting on the counter, Patrick sat down in the armchair in the living room and started to collect his thoughts about his new life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Patrick's eyes snapped open suddenly, and he was dismayed to see early morning sunlight pouring in through the blinds, while the smell of burnt coffee wafted in from the kitchen. \"I guess I was wrong about not being able to fall asleep,\" he said as he smacked his lips. \"I guess the twins really took-- The Twins!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing why he had planned on staying up in the first place, he quickly jumped to his feet and dashed to the stairs, taking them up two by two. \"I hope they're ok--\" he stopped as he saw Nick through the half-opened door open the door, sitting on the bed in his underwear and thankfully no different than when they had their discussion last night. \"Thank god.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, mornin', bro,\" Nick said, a slight embarrassed look on his face. It was then that Patrick noticed Nick was holding out his arm, and as he opened the door the rest of the way, he let out a yelp of surprise as he saw just what-- or, who-- he was touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate? I-is that you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him stood a monolithic, huge beast of a person. As he was facing the opposite direction, the only hint that Patrick had that he was looking at his younger brother was the messy crop of red hair that was now pushing against the ceiling. The skin, too, was pale and smooth like Nate's, and fully nude, Patrick was embarrassed to realize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more amazing, Nate's body was bulging with muscle all over. His legs were each as thick as telephone poles, and his shoulders were almost as wide as the bed he had previously been sleeping on. The arms bulged with biceps on top of biceps, and as Nate turned around, Patrick could count 8-- no 10-- 12 rows of abs beneath two cannonball-sized pecs. Holding hands with the still-small Nick made Nate look even more incredibly oversized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Patty,\" Nate finally said, his voice still innocent and child-like but much louder than Patrick was used to. Nate's grin spread from cheek to cheek as he looked down on his older brother, and he dropped away his hand from Nick's. \"Ah, geez, I did it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick rolled his eyes. \"I'm pretty sure you've done plenty for this morning anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick ran his hands through his thick, dark hair, letting out an exasperated sigh. \"Yeah, geez, Nate, what have you--HOLY HELL WHAT'S THAT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis finger instinctively pointed out towards the area in between Nate's legs, where a massive pillar of flesh jutted out at least three feet in front of him. Patrick's tan skin turned bright red as he realized he was looking at his little brother's cock, which was now just below eye level to him, and seemed to be rising slightly the more Patrick gawked at it. The shaft was as big around as Patrick's waist, and below it two bulging, gently swaying orbs hung down below Nate's knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick was speechless. \"Like what you see?\" Nate beamed, his eyes narrowing suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few silent seconds, Patrick shook out of his stupor. \"N-no, Nate, what the hell are you trying to do? You can't go around like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I told him,\" Nick said, standing up and heading to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, guys,\" Nate said as he leaned against the dresser, shoving it several inches without even noticing, \"I was just having some fun. Look, I'll go back now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before Patrick's eyes, Nate's body started to shrink. His muscle, height, and endowment all receded, almost as if someone had overfilled a giant parade balloon and was letting air out of it until it came back to normal size. Within thirty seconds, Nate was back to his normal four-and-a-half feet tall, though he was still naked and sporting a healthy hard-on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little bit shaken, Patrick averted his gaze and pointed to the bathroom, mustering up his best \"caretaker\" voice. \"That's better. Now, go ahead and start taking your showers. SEPARATELY.\" As if on cue, he heard the shower head begin to run, as Nick had already started. \"Actually, Nate, you can go ahead and use the downstairs shower.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean mom and dad's??\" Nate's eyes lit up. Their parents' bathroom was strictly off-limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're... yeah, it's fine.\" Patrick was unsure how much Nate was aware of their current situation, so he decided to wait until breakfast to talk things over with both boys. Nate grabbed his towel from the bathroom and ran down stairs, not caring that he was still naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick sniffed himself, realizing he probably needed his own shower too, but he'd have to wait until he could find a time when both boys were occupied and able to be left unsupervised for a few minutes. For now, it was breakfast time. \"At least they left us with plenty of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, Nick and Nate sat on opposite sides of the breakfast table, both in matching pairs of black boxer-briefs and a white sleeveless undershirts, their hair both still damp from the showers. Patrick had made sure to remove all but the chairs at either end of the table, so as his brothers wouldn't be tempted to do anything until they could have a talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, guys,\" he said as he slid two plates of scrambled eggs and bacon in front of them, and they began to chow down. Bringing over his own plate to the table, he slid a chair from behind the kitchen island (where he had hidden it) and joined them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" he finally said after both boys had stopped to chew, \"I talked with Nick a little last night. I suppose you both know what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate turned to him, his mouth still half-full of scrambled eggs as he talked. \"Yeah, we're-- it's just the three of us now, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Patrick took his fork and stuck it in his eggs, but didn't bring it to his mouth. \"That means... I'm supposed to take care of you guys from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Nick said as he crunched on some bacon. \"I'm sure you'll do great, bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wish I could be so sure,</i> Patrick thought. \"Thanks. But that means you guys are going to have to listen to me and do what I say from now on, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" A goofy smile spread across Nate's face. \"When have we ever not listened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like every day,\" Nick answered his twin, and they both giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys,\" Patrick interrupted, \"I'm serious. I'll be honest with you: your... power, or whatever you want to call it? It scares me a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smiles disappeared from both twins' faces. \"Really?\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, the older brother nodded. \"It does. I mean if it was up to me, I'd say don't use the power at all, just be safe. But something tells me that's not practical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or fair,\" Nate said as he finished the last bite on his plate. \"Why would we want to keep something so awesome locked up like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Patrick agreed. \"If I was your age and could do that, I'd want to use it all the time too. So, let's make a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deal?\" Nick repeated, his ears perking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you guys want to grow, or change, or do whatever, you'll ask me first, and listen if I say no. And, in return, I'll be open-minded about it and let you have fun when it's not going to hurt anybody or cause trouble. We can even find ways for you to really let loose, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate and Nick turned from Patrick to look at each other, tilting their heads as they considered the offer. Nate was the first to speak. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we kinda have to,\" Nick replied, pushing his glasses up his nose as he did. \"He's our caretaker, after all. Besides, it sounds fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Nate sighed, then turned back to Patrick. \"Okay, deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank god</i>, Patrick breathed a sigh of relief. \"Awesome. Now, go upstairs and get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean for school?\" Nate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick thought for a moment. Was it really wise to send them to school on the first day like this? What other choice did he have? What about his <i>own</i> school? Finally, he replied...</span></div></div>",

I just want to get a better idea of what your daily routine is so I can... you know... advise you how to handle yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to make sure we don't cause any trouble.\" Nate said with a grin. \"Look Patty, my boy, we already promised we'd be good little kids so why do you need to come along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's precisely because I know you two that I can't let you both loose without any supervision.\" Patrick said patiently. \"Nick would be good but with you sitting next to him all day, whispering about things you could do, I can imagine it could get pretty out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate couldn't help but snicker, even as he felt a flash of annoyance. \"Geez Patty... you know me better than I know myself! Okay, okay, okay, fine, fine, fine, you can come and we'll show you just what little angels we can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Nate both grinned and held their hands together in a prayer formation, tilting their heads slightly and turning to face Patrick. The older brother grimaced and said, \"Okay, that's enough of the creepy twin thing, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all held their positions for a few seconds before bursting out into laughter, the tension and the weirdness of their situation broken for the moment as they just interacted like brothers. After finishing breakfast, both boys ran upstairs to get ready, Patrick moving at a slower pace. Rather than change into his school uniform, he put on casual, but presentable clothes: a polo shirt, dark jeans, and the pair of shoes between his ratty athletic sneakers and his dress shoes. Once he was ready, he knocked on the bedroom door of his brothers, calling out, \"You two dressed yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard them call out in the affirmative, opening the door, half expecting to see some odd spectacle again... only to see his brothers standing their, perfectly normal, and fully dressed. The middle school they attended also required uniforms so the boys were dressed in clean white shirts with a dark navy sweater vest over top, dress pants, and dress shoes. Nate tugged at his collar, grimacing slightly, looking like he'd rather be in far less while Nick smiled brightly, enjoying the outfit more than his brother. It was the common reaction both had to getting dressed for school, but Patrick was seeing every familiar interaction in an entirely new light. The older brother herded the younger out the door and into the car, adjusting the rear view mirror as the twins buckled themselves in, Nate's fingers already inching towards Nick's. \"Don't think I don't see that Nate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate flinched, Nick looking over curiously, only to crack a smile as he realized what had been going on. He grabbed Nate's hand and held it up. \"You know we can still touch each other WITHOUT changing ourselves, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate let out a little moan as his trousers suddenly tented visibly, his body twisting slightly at the pleasure of the change, Nick hastily dropping his brother's hand. \"Yeah, we sure can... but how can I resist?\" Nate said with a cocky little smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strike one for you Nate.\" Patrick said sternly, turning around slightly. \"Try that again and we'll march right back inside and you can spend the day in your room while Nick goes to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate rolled his eyes, but sat up straighter, nodding slightly. \"Sorry... just got a little carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick nodded back and started the car, dialing his high school with his other hand. On the drive to the middle school, Patrick talked to the high school secretary, saying he needed to escort his brother's to their classes given a sudden medical emergency. He used the same line on the middle school secretary when they arrived, Nick and Nate dutifully backing him up. When they had managed to assure the secretary that, no, it wasn't anything contagious or dangerous, they were allowed to go to the first class of the day, history. The twins had two seats in the back, one right next to the other, and were close enough that they could reach out and touch each other if they wanted. Patrick was tempted to just park himself between them but that would have been ultimately counterproductive; they had to learn to get along without him constantly being there. Patrick tried not to notice the stares he was getting, the younger kids all curious why a high schooler was hanging out in their classroom. The teacher chose not to address it, starting class the minute the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class! Today I thought we'd start out talking about something a bit more fun than your typical history... Greek mythology!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class perked up a bit more upon hearing this. Since they had started European history, they had all been looking forward to this section. It was so much more fun to hear about monsters and heroes than it was learning about economic decline or depressing things like war or famine. Nick and Nate both eagerly listened as well, Patrick feeling a bit nervous in his seat in the back. He didn't want them getting any ideas...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Of course, while the gods of Olympus are perhaps the best known of all the Greek mythological figures, they were actually preceded by a race of deities known as the Titans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick felt his heart sink a little more as the teacher started to lecture. This was certainly <i>not</i> the subject that he wanted the twins to be hearing today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These were the children of Gaia, Mother Earth, and Uranus, Father Sky. One of them, Cronus, gave birth to Zeus and led to the rise of the Olympian gods. They eventually fought the Olympians, ultimately losing and being imprisoned in the deep abyss known as Tartarus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by how they kept exchanging glances at each other, snickering, and then looking back at Patrick, Nick and Nate already had begun formulating some ideas based off of the lecture. Patrick dreaded hearing them after class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These beings were colassal in size, even bigger than the gods themselves, and could change their size at will. Perhaps you all have heard of the titan Atlas, who is often depicted holding the earth on his shoulders?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teacher went on, Patrick tried to guess just what Nate and Nick were planning, starting to daydream a little. The image of them stretching to the bedroom ceiling the night before came to mind, but it was only a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe imagined the two of them grasping each others hands and suddenly bursting through the ceilings of the school, stretching higher and higher above, their feet plowing through the walls and covering the rest of the campus, leaving him stuck below their toes. They became hundreds, if not thousands of feet tall, laughing maniacally as they stomped cars, people, and buildings beneath their heels. They would rampage separately for a few minutes, then hold hands again so that they could continue to loom higher and higher, able to destroy more and more with less and less effort, getting bigger and more powerful all the while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the most pleasant of thoughts. Coming back to reality, Patrick hoped his brothers' typical good natures would prevent something like that from happening. But, as he thought back to the note his parents had left him, the phrase \"keep them from becoming a destructive force to society\" kept running through his mind. He began to realize that his own influence might be all that would keep the world from experiencing the kind of horror he had just imagined. It was an enormous weight on his shoulders, one worthy of Atlas himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the class bell finally rang, Nick and Nate quickly gathered up their books and ran back to their older brother. \"Hey Patrick,\" Nate said. \"We have a question!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick continued the thought. \"Yeah, we want\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To grow yourself to be the size of titans?\" Patrick looked at them disapprovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe not <i>that</i> big,\" Nick rolled his eyes slightly. \"But big enough that we can\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have some fun!\" Nate interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and not just in our bedrooms either. Somewhere outdoors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick took in a deep breath. \"Okay,\" he finally said, \"I can let you grow <i>a little</i>. But it'll have to wait until after school.\" The twins smiles faded slightly, but still shone with eagerness. \"And,\" he added, thinking back to how his own parents would keep rewards for him until he fulfilled his responsibilities, \"I want you to finish your homework first too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate frowned, but Nick nodded. \"We can do that,\" Nick said, elbowing his brother. \"Right, Nate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Nate mumbled. \"It better be worth it, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next class was Math, which was both Patrick and Nate's least favorite subject, though Nick had always done okay with it. Throughout the class, the twins seemed even more fidgety than usual. They listened and took notes in class, but Patrick also saw them passing back and forth scraps of paper every so often, giggling as they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne fell to the ground, and after class Patrick picked it up and saw it was a doodle of two stick figures standing over a city skyline that didn't even come up to their knees. Below the drawing, in Nate's slightly sloppy handwriting, were the words \"A good start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Patrick crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it in the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the morning was uneventful, Art and Science passing with no trouble at all. Patrick began to feel better about the situation. <i>Hopefully, tomorrow, I won't have to come back here with them, and I can get back to my own life,</i> he thought. <i>Or as close to that as possible.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luckily for Patrick, the next event of the day was an easy one: lunch. He had neglected to pack anything for himself but luckily the cafeteria workers were happy to allow him to take some food... so long as he paid for it like the other kids. The meal was a pretty standard one: rotini style noodles with meat sauce, a carton of milk, some bread, and a little cup of fruit. It was certainly enough for a middle school stomach but Patrick felt a little... unsatisfied by the offering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a seat with his brothers, the twins whispering to each other and giggling, snatches of conversation drifting over to the other side of the table where Patrick was sitting. He picked up \"titan\" and \"bigger than EVERYONE\" and what sounded like \"lift Patty up between my toes\" before coughing loudly, interrupting them. \"Remember you two... homework first, and no extremes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate sighed loudly and slammed his forehead against the table dramatically. \"Patty, you are being SUCH a killjoy right now! We're just TALKING about stuff, it's not like we're ACTUALLY going to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate's right, you can't always treat us like we're planning something.\" Nick said, frowning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two ARE always planning something.\" Patrick dryly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not ALWAYS!\" they exclaimed in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Patrick could respond, someone came up behind Nick, slamming him hard on the back, the boy's face registering shock before it was planted, messily, into his lunch, sauce splattering all over the table. \"OOPS! Sorry about that freakshow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick looked up in shock at the kid standing behind his brother. He looked like he was a year older, with dark brown hair slicked up into a faux hawk and the overall demeanor of a punk. His shirt was untucked, hanging out the bottom of his vest, his pants sagging down while his shoes were scuffed. He laughed obnoxiously before moving along, high-fiving a different boy, equally unkempt looking. Patrick turned his attention to his brother as he coughed, lifting his head back up, taking his glasses off and wiping them off with a napkin. \"You okay Nicky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not.\" Nick said in a huff, looking deeply embarrassed, eyes focused fully on his food as he put his glasses back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that guy?\" Patrick asked, turning to Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan.\" Nate said with a grimace, rubbing his brother's back. \"He's had it out for us since grade school. Singled us out because we're twins, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does he call you freakshow?\" Patrick asked, turning back to Nick. There wasn't anything outwardly freakish about the twins, outside of their... twinness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're twins. It's THAT stupid!\" Nick said, his voice rising slightly before he caught himself. \"And because we do stuff like--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish each other's sentences.\" Nate picked up, shrugging. \"I mean, some people also think it's weird when we talk at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had joined in at the end, the sentence finished in unison, both boys shrugging this time. They looked so dejected and annoyed that Patrick couldn't help but feel a surge of anger at this Dylan. Glancing around, he leaned in close and said, \"You know I said you guys couldn't grow until after school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" They both answered in hushed tones, leaning in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm willing to change my mind... provided you two are willing to teach a little lesson of your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins looked confused for a moment before Nick smiled, turning to look fully at Nate with his eyes glittering in delight. Nate continued to look confused, bordering on annoyed... until he, too, understood, a mischievous grin lighting up his features. They both turned to Patrick and winked. \"You got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of lunch, Dylan rose from his table to use the bathroom. Glancing around, he saw that his two favorite targets were nowhere to be seen, a cruel smirk spreading across his face. Maybe they were so upset they had run off. It wouldn't be the first time. Kicking open the bathroom door, Dylan made his way to the urinal, unzipping and slouching in front of it, practically posing for nobody who was watching... or so he thought. He heard the door open and close, glancing up into the mirror over the urinals, spotting his two favorite targets once again. He laughed rudely. \"What the fuck do you two want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us?\" They said together, looking at each other, before looking back at Dylan. \"Not much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two really piss me off with your stupid freakshow bit.\" Dylan said, frowning, finishing his business and zipping up. \"Maybe a few broken teeth will make you skip a beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Dylan!\" Nick said, shaking his finger, his other hand gripping his brother's tightly. \"Our big brother gave us permission to take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAH! You two? Take care of me? That's a laugh.\" Dylan said, cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... I think I'll give Nicky here the honor.\" Nate said, concentrating fully on his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan stopped his advancement as he saw something... strange happening. Nick's body appeared to swelling, his clothes becoming tighter on him. Upon closer inspection, Dylan saw the impossible happening: the little shit's muscles were GROWING! Inch by inch, more meat accumulated on those bones, his stick thin arms suddenly bursting with softball sized biceps, his flat chest pulsing forward, two slabs of beef pushing against his shirt, drawing it tight. His back broadened as his shoulders widened, the seams on his shirt beginning to pop. Down below, his thighs thickened visibly, his calves swelling in time with the rest of him, his shoes creaking as his feet became too much to be fully contained, the tops threatening to split open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan took a step back, stunned, as Nick not only grew more muscular... but taller too! His body slowly stretched upward, shirt coming untucked, peeks of the abs that had formed over his flat stomach becoming visible. He stopped before he truly threatened to burst out of his clothes, his previously shrimpy body now easily a few inches taller than Dylan... and far wider and stronger. Smiling, Nick released Nate's head, the now smaller twin folding his arms with a smirk as he watched his brother work. Dylan, freaked out, but not immobile, threw a punch at Nick's abs... only to feel his fingers crumple, bones shattering at the impact. Not only had the twins made Nick's muscles larger... but they had changed his very genetic makeup, making his muscles far harder than any human could hope to be. For Dylan, it was like punching, full force, a brick wall. Whimpering, the older bully fell back against the wall, clutching his hand to his chest. Nick reached out, grabbed a handful of the boy's shirt, and dragged him close. \"You leave me and my brother alone from now on... or your hand isn't the only thing I'll be breaking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate covered his mouth to hide a snort of laughter at his brother's words; he sounded like the hero in a cartoon they had watched last week. Dylan began to blubber, shaking his head, promising he'd never so much as LOOK at either of them again if they just let him go. Nick nodded, satisfied, throwing him out the door, Patrick watching in amusement as the punished bully scampered down the hall to the nurse's office. Walking in, Patrick couldn't help but marvel as his hulking little brother, both boys celebrating and letting out whooping cheers. Nick, upon seeing his older brother, rushed forward and picked him up in a crushing bear hug, making sure to restrain himself enough to not hurt him. \"Patrick that was SO COOL! I felt so... so good! I've never been able to stand up for myself like that! Thank you SO MUCH for letting us do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick chuckled, wincing slightly. \"N-No problem! Can you maybe... put me down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" Nick said, releasing his brother, looking a little awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Patrick said, taking a deep breath, making sure there were no bruises. \"Now that THAT'S over... time to go back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed, crossing his arms. \"I guess... I like being strong though... I bet I could hold the whole world up, just like Atlas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nicky... we gotta listen to Pat, remember?\" Nate said, clapping his hand on his brother's shoulder, the bigger twin already dwindling back down to normal size. Patrick was a bit surprised at Nate's acquiescence... until he noticed the boy's muscles subtly swelling. So while changing back one, the other could still change his own body at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nate! Don't think I don't see that! Normal, right now, until after school and after your homework!\" Patrick admonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Fine! Dumb eagle eyed...\" Nate muttered, his words becoming indistinguishable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three left the bathroom just as the bell ending lunch rang, heading towards the next class.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The final two class periods of the day passed without incident. In English, the teacher droned on and on about some book Patrick had remembered hating when he was the twins' age, something about a house in New England that he found incredibly boring. He was surprised to see both boys stay awake throughout the period, scribbling down notes at an impressive pace, as he almost found himself nodding off himself at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym class was at least more active, if not more exciting. The class played Dodgeball, and (through either a stroke of brilliance or sadism, Patrick wasn't sure which), the teacher had placed Nick and Nate on opposite teams, not even acknowledging their protests otherwise. Though he didn't say anything, Patrick silently thanked the teacher, as this was the class he was the most fearful of the twins using their powers during.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Nate were actually both fairly good at the game, and ended up being two of the last four players left. Their downfall ended up being that neither boy would aim for the other, so when the numbers started to dwindle, they both became easy targets. Nick was eliminated first, taking a glancing hit off his backside. Nate lasted a few minutes longer, almost able to catch a ball thrown at his chest, which just barely slipped through his fingers to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the twins had showered and changed, Patrick met them at the locker room door. \"Ready to go work on your homework?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the best part, Patty!\" Nate beamed. \"We're already done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys pulled out their notebooks and showed him pages full of equations. \"We only had homework in math today,\" Nick explained, \"and we actually finished it in English class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick frowned, peering at the two notebooks. \"Well, you guys really <i>should</i> pay attention in class... but you did finish.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Nate agreed, \"so ready to honor our deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick nodded, though inwardly he began to fret. He had hoped he would be able to use the excuse of them taking too long with homework to weasel out of having to let them grow, but that option was gone now. It was too late to back out now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked out to the car, he mentally blocked out the twins' chattering, trying to think of what would be the best location to do this at. Sure, he had let them grow in the bathroom in front of Dylan, but that was only a small amount, and if the bully had told anyone he probably would be laughed off. From the sounds of things, Nate and Nick wouldn't be satisfied unless they could grow substantially bigger than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had driven about a mile before he finally had an idea, and turned the car towards the southern edge of town. He had only been to that area once or twice in the last decade, but there was one place there that seemed to be ideal. <i>As long as we don't get caught.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fifteen minute drive, they pulled into a large, empty parking lot in front of an old, abandoned brick building, three stories tall with large glass windows. Nate pressed his face up against the window, scrunching up his nose. \"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The old Zippy's factory,\" Patrick answered as he got out of the car. \"They used to make dog and cat food here, before closing up about ten years ago and moving out of town. I remember this whole side of town used to smell like old rotting beef stew. It was gross.\" Even thinking of the memory now still triggered his gag reflex a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Nick said, \"then <i>why</i> are we here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm honoring our deal. C'mon, let's go inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys looked at each other excitedly, and both leapt out of the car and caught up with their older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door had been slightly rusted with age, but thankfully was unlocked, and opened with just a bit of effort. Inside, a short entrance hallway led to the factory floor. Most of the machinery that wasn't able to be sold had been left behind when the company had gone out of business, including two conveyor belts running on either side of the factory trailing from a pair of large metal vats that Patrick could swear still had the lingering smell of rotting pet food. All the lights inside were off, but the large windows let in plenty of light from the afternoon sun. Best of all, the ceilings of the factory were at least thirty feet overhead, and the room was at least as long as a football field and half as wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Patrick said. \"Do whatever you guys want to in here\u2014 just as long as you don't cause any major damage,\" he quickly added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy!\" Nate exclaimed excitedly, grabbing his twin's hand and dragging him towards the center of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waitwaitwait,\" Nick protested, pulling free before Nate could start anything. \"Aren't you forgetting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate gestured towards his body. \"We don't want to ride home naked when we're done, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second for Nate to pick up his brother's meaning. \"Oh, right, our clothes. We don't want to ruin them, I guess. At least not this time,\" he added in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick chuckled, and the two boys started to disrobe. Patrick started to protest, but realized Nick was right. He had almost ripped apart the school uniform in the bathroom earlier; with what they probably had in mind, the clothing would quickly be in tatters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Nick and Nate stood naked, while Patrick held onto their clothes to keep them from getting decades-old grime all over them. Smiling at each other, they each grasped each other's hand, and closed their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, their heads started to rise up. Patrick was nearly caught off guard by how quickly the boys were growing now, as if their previous efforts had just been for practice. Within seconds, they had surpassed him in height, and rapidly stretched towards the ceiling. Their feet slid across the concrete floor, each twin having to take a step apart every so often as their bodies got bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Nick said, closing his eyes. \"This is the best so far.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not done yet!\" Nate replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick watched in awe as their waistlines passed his head, then their knees. He stepped back and back until he was flat against the wall, not wanting to be accidentally found underfoot by his two behemoth brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the twins' heads brushed against the ceiling, and they dropped their hands away from each other. Nick looked down at his surroundings, laughing a booming yet childish laugh. \"This is so cool! Everything is so much smaller now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Nate agreed, scanning the floor for their older brother. \"Hey, Patty, what's the matter? You're not scared of us, are you?\" He flashed a devilish, toothy grin, that broke into a snickering laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" Patrick stammered, trying to bring his instinctive trembling under control. \"just... that was... impressive, I guess?\" Despite not really believing that his brothers would hurt him, just seeing such powerful beings in front of him was a little intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet.\" Nate turned to his twin, patting him on the shoulder. \"Alright, Nick, what do you think we should do now?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Why not follow Ray (16) and his little brother Mike (10)? Ray is a meek and mild teenager, just barely a year into high school. He doesn't really fit in with anyone, not to mention he's completely useless at sports, and prefers to sit by himself and be left alone. He stands an unassuming five foot five, a bit small for his age, and is skinny as a rail. He tried to work out at one point to put a little muscle on but no matter how much he eats or how much he works out, he stays as small and skinny as ever, leading him to pursue more academic related activities. He has longish shaggy brown hair that tends to hide his face when he's leaning his head down and bright green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis little brother, on the other hand, is the complete opposite! Outgoing and extremely popular, he has a ton of friends and excels in any sport he tries. The only reason he isn't an integral part of any team he chooses is because he gets bored with spending too much time doing one thing. All of the time spent playing sports has given him a powerful build for such a young kid, lightly defined muscles visible all over his body. Standing at an impressive (for his age) five feet two inches tall, he cuts an impressive figure amongst his smaller, weaker friends, making him a natural leader. He loves to keep his short, black hair gelled up into spikes, various cuts, bruises, and bandages alternately appearing on his body thanks to his rough and tumble lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relationship between the two is amicable, with Mike actually adoring his older brother while Ray slightly resents his younger brother. Being older and yet so much weaker and less effectual takes its toll on Ray's esteem while Mike only sees his wonderful big bro that he wants to spend all his time with. Unfortunately for Ray, Mike is often very insistent and loves to play wrestle with him, pinning him, easily picking him up, comparing himself to him, and calling him nicknames like \"squirt\" or \"little bro\" or \"tiny\" and the like. He does this all with love, eager to protect his older brother, without knowing how much it gets to Ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Ray finishes a project he had been working on for years, something to help boost himself, to give him more size and more confidence. Unfortunately for him, this little project ends up in Mike's hands, leading to problems MUCH bigger than Ray could have ever foreseen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(It's a really long intro, I know, I kind of got carried away.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a phrase that Ray seemed to use a lot in his life. Ever since he was little (and even as he got older he pretty much REMAINED little) bad things just always seemed to happen to him. He didn't grow much, he was terrible at sports, he was shy and awkward around people his own age, and nothing he ever tried seemed to improve his life. He had taken to keeping to himself, head almost always hanging, staring at the ground, only able to see the feet of people as they walked around him. On particularly dark days he sometimes imagined that it would be better if ended up UNDER someone's foot. Maybe that's where he actually belonged. But those days were few and far between. Usually Ray would just be frustrated and annoyed. It seemed that life had picked out a particularly depressing destiny for him...especially when considered next to his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was Ray's opposite in almost every way. Cheerful and loud where Ray was quiet and withdrawn, tall and strong (for his age) while Ray was short and weak (also for his age), talented at every sport he tried while Ray habitually failed, able to eat like an elephant and only put on the right kind of weight, his metabolism burning away any excess fat, while Ray couldn't gain a pound of anything, muscle, fat, or otherwise. It was like Mike was a sponge, sucking away anything and everything that Ray might have otherwise had, leaving him with only the negative aspects. This was completely ridiculous of course but Ray couldn't help but feel that way sometimes. It didn't help that Mike liked to wake Ray up by pouncing on him, pinning him down to the bed with an infectious grin on his face, eager to start the day. Living in a small family, with parents that were almost always working, made for small living arrangements. Ray and Mike had shared a room as long as Mike had been alive. Ray knew the only way he was going to get his own room was when he moved out for college in a few years. This idea was one of the few things that could bring Mike down, but Ray couldn't wait. He loved his little brother more than anyone but he couldn't help but feel a bit resentful towards him, a feeling that he hoped would disappear once they spent some time apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now though, they were stuck together. The morning sun rose bright and rosy as Ray snored lightly in his bed, his thin body covered by a large comforter. He always seemed to get cold at night, even when the weather was extremely warm. His peaceful dreams were interrupted as a large, heavy weight slammed down on top of him. His eyes flew open, immediately seeing the grinning face of his younger brother staring down at him. \"Wake up Ray! It's Saturday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay groaned and tried to push Mike off, his arms unable to move under the comforter. Mike had him easily pinned down, his strong arms making sure to keep Ray's at his side. \"I know Mikey...that's why I'm trying to sleep in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep in?! Are you crazy?! Today's the start of spring break, remember? We have the whole week to ourselves, just us! No friends, no mom and dad, no one else!\" Mike practically shouted, jumping up, his knees still clamped around Ray's waist. Now that he was sitting up, Ray was able to sit up himself, stretching slightly, letting out a loud yawn. He had completely forgotten. Their parents had decided to take a vacation, a kind of second honey moon, during this year's spring break. They had left early yesterday morning, right after seeing the kids off to school for their last day. It wouldn't be so bad, being alone with Mike for the whole week but taking care of him was going to be a handful. Just another thing to add on top of the already heavy burden of Ray's daily routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike jumped up off the bed and landed on the ground, sticking his bare feet out, his toes clenching and relaxing slightly, an expectant look on his face. Ray groaned and said, \"Not today Mikey, it's the weekend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come ooooooon, you promised you'd do this with me at least once a week!\" Mike said, pouting a little. \"I wanna see if I'm growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only ten years old.\" Ray said, flipping his covers aside, his own bare feet hitting the floor, just barely. \"Of course you're growing. You're probably going to keep growing until you're in your twenties. That's how things work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike giggled and said, \"Yeah, but you said it yourself before, I'm growing really fast for my age! It's so cool! I'm almost as tall as you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay winced as he heard this proclamation. While true, it still stung....the fact that he wasn't getting any taller while his younger brother sprouted up like a weed. No doubt he would be left behind by the time Mike hit puberty and then the problem would only get worse! Ray got up and started walking to the door. He made it about halfway before he felt a strong hand grab the back of his shirt. \"Nuh-uh! You're not getting out of it THIS time!\" Mike said, his other hand grabbing Ray's butt, lifting the older male clear off the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mikey! Put me down! I mean it!\" Ray sputtered, struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike set Ray firmly down on the ground and spread his legs for him, making sure they were just the right mount apart before taking up his own position in the same manner. He grinned and said, \"Okay, let's measure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay thought about protesting, about getting up and leaving again, but it was useless. When Mike wanted something done, he did whatever it took to get it done. It would be over faster if he just went along with it. He watched in slight trepidation as Mike slowly, almost theatrically, extended his legs, bringing their feet closer together. He licked his lips, eyes wide, his soft soles pressing up against Ray's more narrow ones. \"Woooooah~! Look, look! They're almost as big as yours little guy! I really am growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately leaped to his feet, jumping up and down and cheering, the white shirt he wore to bed rising up slightly with every jump, giving Ray a jealous glimpse at the developing abs hidden there. Just looking at Mike you could tell he was freakishly strong for his age, his arms containing more than just a hint of biceps while his shirts were always stretched slightly over his chest. Mike had at least some idea of the stir his body caused, the admiring glances it brought around, as he always wore shirts that were JUST a bit too small and tried to dress in shorts as much as possible, his strong legs jutting powerfully out from them. Ray got slowly to his own feet, clapping Mike on the shoulder before saying, \"Just get dressed and come down to breakfast, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" He said sweetly, settling down a little, his little chest heaving proudly. \"You said guys with big feet tend to get really tall right little bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that. But yes, that's usually the case.\" Ray said, rubbing the back of his head as he made his way to the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm gonna be a GIANT!\" Mike said proudly, stomping his feet a little, making the room quiver. Ray sighed as he heard this proclamation. It was true, Mike had rather large feet for his age. Finding shoes was always a problem, prompting him to mostly wear sandals fore ease, though his toes always seemed to hang over the edge of them. If he kept up at the pace he was growing, he could very well crest a full seven feet tall, if not more! Ray quickly left the room, heading for the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to be left behind.\" He thought to himself firmly, opening the door and practically running down the stairs. Whereas Mike had an affinity for sports, Ray had an affinity for academics. He had been working feverishly on a secret project for years now, combining gene study with human development study and even dabbling in more obscure sciences that weren't exactly widely practiced in the general community. He did this all for the sake of stimulating his own development, to give himself at least SOMETHING in the way of a normal body and normal strength, so that he wouldn't have to constantly be at the mercy of the world, especially his younger brother. Finally, the project as in its final stages. With a few more tweaks, he'd be able to test it out. He wiped the sweat from his forehead as he finished, looking with pride at his creation.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bright green liquid in the small glass almost glowed in the light of Ray's desk lamp as he looked at it, a smile forming on his face. \"This is it,\" he whispered to himself. \"This is what I've been working for, what will end up changing my life!\" He licked his lips, thinking about the changes his body would go through once he finally drank this stimulant and his pituitary gland would finally kick in. At minimum, he should end up at over six and a half feet within a few months, though some of the projections he had worked out indicated he could end up as tall as eight and a half! He would no longer have to be left behind by his younger brother, and could finally stand up for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just had to do one final step, though this is the one that made him the most nervous. The stimulant consisted of several active ingredients, enzymes that would cause his pituitary gland to go through what basically amounted to a second puberty. But at their current state, these enzymes would be too active. They could end up overworking his hormonal system and either cause him to grow much bigger than he was aiming for, or, even worse, give him a heart attack or cause some of his organs to shut down. This meant that before he could safely drink it, the mixture needed to be chilled at below-freezing temperatures for twenty-four hours, causing the enzymes to be reduced to a near-dormant, though still effective, state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the only place that he could think of to do this was the kitchen freezer, which presented the obvious problem of his drink being found by someone else. As long as he did it this week, his parents wouldn't be a factor, but if Mike were to find it... He shuddered, wondering if it was even worth the risk of that happening. The thought of finally being big for a change was too good to pass up, though, and so as Ray watched cartoons in the basement and ate his cereal, Mike quietly walked to the kitchen, opening the freezer door. Standing on his tiptoes, he reached up and placed the glass with the stimulant at the very back corner, as out of sight as possible. He also rearranged a stack of frozen pizzas to hide the glass from view. Taking a quick breath, he stepped back and closed the freezer door -- just in time to hear Mike bounding up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Mike called out, running to the sink and tossing his now-empty bowl in it, then turning on the faucet to start rinsing it out. \"So what are we going to do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Mike,\" Ray said, hoping his nervousness at almost getting caught with the stimulant wasn't obvious. \"I think we should just lay low and stay h--\" He stopped, realizing that the best way for Mike to not find the stimulant would be to not be anywhere near the stimulant for as long as possible. If he could keep him out of the house all day, that would minimize the chances of him looking in the freezer and discovering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" he said slowly, \"since it's Saturday, and supposed to be nice out I think, let's go to... uh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The park?\" Mike suggested, nearly jumping up and down with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating only a moment, Ray finally nodded in agreement. \"Sure. The park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaay!\" Mike cheered. \"I'll go grab the football!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his younger brother ran up the stairs, taking them two at a time, Ray rolled his eyes and shook his head. Today was starting to sound like a lot of work all of the sudden, but \"no pain, no gain,\" he supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shower time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt eight o' clock that evening, Ray and Mike had finally returned home. While Mike ran back up to the bathroom they shared, still full of energy, Ray collapsed on the couch, groaning. From upstairs, he heard the shower start running, and Mike singing an indiscernible song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday had been exhausting. Not only had they played football and whatever else Mike could think of at the park for nearly three hours, but then they grabbed lunch, gone to see a movie (the latest comic book superhero movie that Mike was itching to see), driven an hour across town to go to the \"good\" mall and spent nearly four hours there. Ray had felt a little uneasy about being seen all day with his kid brother, but at least he hadn't run into anyone he knew from school. Not like that would make his reputation any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it would all be worth it once the twenty-four hours had passed and he could finally drink the stimulant. Forcing himself to stand back up, he went over to the kitchen, opening the freezer and checking on the glass at the back. It looked very much like it had that morning, the green glow only fading slightly, though the glass had frosted a little on the outside. Gently shaking the glass, he was pleased to see that the stimulant still was in liquid form, sloshing from side to side. The freezing point of the stimulant was well below 0 F, so he doubted a simple kitchen freezer would affect that, but he wanted to make sure. After all, he would need to be able to drink this within a few minutes of taking it out of the fridge tomorrow morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's anticipation began to build as he thought about what would happen once he started growing again, but he tried to keep himself in check, and slid the glass back towards the rear of the freezer, closing the door. The water seemed to suddenly stop upstairs, and he heard Mike slide the shower curtain open and step out. Feeling a little sticky himself, Ray decided to head upstairs and hop in the shower right after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped into the bedroom and grabbed a pair of underwear and socks from the dresser, Mike came in through the door just a minute later, wearing only a towel wrapped around his waist. As Ray turned around and saw his brother's smooth, slick body, just a little too muscular for a ten-year-old boy, he felt his blood begin to boil with jealousy. Jealousy and-- something else? He didn't know quite what it was, but seeing Mike this undressed had always given him an odd feeling, one that wasn't entirely unpleasant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what ya see, little bro?\" Mike giggled, stretching his arms above his head, causing his stomach and chest muscles to go taught and flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that he was staring, Ray snapped out of it, saying nothing as he stepped past his brother to the bathroom. He tried to hide his scowl, but he knew that his brother had to be able to tell that he was upset, if not from his expression than from the clenching of his fists. Regardless, it wasn't going to matter after much longer, and for now, the shower would do him some good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Ray felt fresher than he had at any point throughout the day. His hair was still damp as he slipped on a small black undershirt and his boxers and looked at himself in the mirror. Just stepping out of the shower was one of the few times where Ray felt good about the way that he looked, with his mussed-up hair and soft, smooth skin. He wondered if, once he was bigger, this was the kind of way he'd feel about himself all of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly realized that he was feeling a little dry at the back of his throat, and started heading downstairs to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, or perhaps a Gatorade. As he rounded the corner, though, he suddenly froze in his tracks, and his jaw dropped open at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was holding the small frosted glass, now empty, in his hand, and a faint trail of green liquid was visible on his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-- Ho--\" Ray sputtered, devastated by what he was seeing in front of him. His dreams, his desires, everything he had worked so hard for was now gone. Worse, actually; it had backfired! Not only was he going to stay the same size, but his younger brother, the one he had been so jealous of his size for so long now, was about to grow even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Ray, Mike grinned sheepishly. \"Oh... was this yours? I'm sorry!\" He placed the glass on the kitchen counter behind him. \"I just was crazy thirsty all of the sudden, and wanted something cold. I saw that in the freezer and it looked tasty, so I ... well, I drank it.\" Blushing, Mike ran his hand through his hair. \"If ya want, I can try to get you another one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welling up in his eyes, Ray spun around and ran upstairs back to his bedroom, throwing himself on his bed. He started to cry into his pillow, pounding his fist on the mattress in frustration. Why did his stupid younger brother have to go and do that? Why was Mike going to get the benefit when he already had so much? And why did he have to be so stupid and store the stimulant here at home where Mike could find it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sobbed for several minutes, until his fatigue set in and he suddenly started feeling extremely tired. Within minutes, he was starting to fall asleep, his face still moist with tears of anguish. As he did so, one final question came to mind: Just how big is Mike going to get now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ray was so exhausted from the day's events he didn't so much as flinch when there came a knock on his door. Mike was no fool and had seen the hurt in his brother's eyes as he turned and ran upstairs, getting away from him. He had stood there, a dismayed expression on his face for a moment, his heart beating fast, before he ran up the stairs after him, knocking softly on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ray?\" He said quietly, not even using any of the usual pet names he had for his older brother. \"Are you okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got no answer, he knocked again, a little louder, scared of hearing Ray's angry voice shouting at him. When there was still no sound from within, he gently opened the door, peeking inside. The room was dark, the shades already drawn, blocking out the last light of the evening. Mike hesitated and then walked into the room, over to his brother's bedside. \"Ray?\" He said again, his voice sounding unnaturally loud in the pure silence of the room. This time, Mike received an answer in the form of a soft snore, his brother's tear streaked face finally peaceful in his dreamless sleep. Mike smiled a little sadly and gently rubbed his brother's arm. \"Sleep tight little bro.\" He said, kissing his brother on the cheek before leaving the room. He only stayed up for an hour or so longer, eating some leftovers that were in the fridge that were easy to heat up. By the time it was fully dark outside, he was in his pajamas and in bed, snoring within minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Ray woke up first, his head feeling a little groggy, his stomach growling fiercely from having missed eating dinner last night. He groaned slightly, touching a hand to his gut before looking over at his brother's bed. Mike was still fast asleep, body sprawled out on top of his bed, covers kicked everywhere. His mouth was wide open as he snored, his short black hair mussed up. Ray noticed that his pajamas had gotten tangled up as well as he slept, the shirt riding halfway up his torso, revealing his abs once again, that feeling from last night briefly flaring up inside Ray. It was hard to be jealous and angry at his brother while he looked so peaceful. With the clarity of a new morning, Ray realized that he had something else he needed to worry about for now. Mike had drunk the stimulant before it had time to fully stabilize, meaning that the stimulant's effects were going to be greatly amplified. He had to make absolutely sure his brother wasn't going to have any medical problems. He would worry about the other effects later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly got dressed and headed downstairs, pulling some eggs out of the fridge along with a package of sausages and some orange juice. After turning the stove top on and dropping some butter into a frying pan, he pulled the toaster out of the appliance garage (the little area underneath the hanging cupboards that held all their smaller appliances) and deposited two pieces of bread in the first two slots. He had just finished pouring himself a glass of orange juice when he heard the butter beginning to sizzle in the pan. With a few quick motions, the butter was spread all over the frying pan, coating it completely. Ray cracked two eggs immediately into the butter, letting them fry while he pulled out another pan to cook the sausages in. It was the picture of a perfect, serene morning, the morning light shining in through the kitchen window, marred only by Ray's expression of guilt, worry, residual anger and jealousy...and just a touch of the fear of the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought out of these thoughts by the sound of energetic footsteps on the stairs, Mike appearing with a grin on his face, not yet dressed. \"Morning little guy!\" He said brightly, back to his old rambunctious self this morning. \"How'd you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sighed, not even looking at his brother, and said, \"Fine Mike. How did you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" was the cheerful reply, the sound of footsteps approaching Ray. \"I'm REALLY hungry though! Can you make me some breakfast too? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a strange tinge of...excitement to Mike's voice as he asked this question, as though he was planning some kind of surprise. With a feeling of trepidation, Ray turned around, finding himself face to grinning face with his \"little\" brother! Ray's mouth dropped open again in pure shock, Mike's already wide grin getting even wider, an excited twinkle in his eye. \"I knew it! Look little bro! We're the same height! That's so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ray could say anything, he felt Mike's strong arms wrap around his waist, lifting him up into the air even more easily than he normally did, his younger brother laughing all the while. \"Wow, you feel so LIGHT! I can't believe it! Am I finally getting a growth spurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mike!\" Ray shouted, finally finding his voice. \"Put me down! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh! Not until you say \"please\".\" He said with a cheeky grin, looking up at his brother, his arms tightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE! PLEASE put me down!\" Ray barked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike giggled and let his brother drop to the floor. \"See that wasn't so hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay steadied himself against the stove, nearly upsetting the eggs and sausages before pressing a hand against Mike's chest, pushing him away. \"Look just....sit down. I'll explain everything after breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, so you DO know something about this!\" Mike said, looking at his brother in slight awe. \"Okay! I'm going to get dressed and stuff then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he scampered away, Ray taking in how small his pajamas were. It wasn't just that the shirt had been hiked up, it actually only covered his brother's chest, his already athletic arms looking even bigger stuffed into sleeves that were too tight. The hems of the pants were wrapped tight around his calves as well. Ray shook his head, his heart beating wildly again. After only one night...Mike had already grown five inches taller! This was blowing the projections he had originally made out of the water! The fact that Mike was younger, already naturally gifted, AND hadn't even experienced puberty for himself yet was all obviously playing a part in this immense growth. Ray tried to run some calculations in his head but the numbers just kept coming out too....BIG! There was no way that Mike would possibly end up THAT huge...was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by Mike's reappearance, dressed in oddly familiar clothes...\"Hey! Are you wearing my clothes?\" Ray asked, giving his brother a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry small fry but I can't FIT into any of my other clothes!\" Mike said, shrugging, heading into the bathroom. \"Maybe by tomorrow even this stuff will be too small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nervous as Ray was, Mike was equally excited. It was only a few minutes longer before breakfast was ready and Mike ran out of the bathroom, his hair gelled up into spikes once more. He sat down eagerly at the table and picked up his silverware, practically bouncing as Ray gave him his portion. Soon, both brothers were eating, Mike moving a mile a minute while Ray moved more slowly, savoring it. By the time Ray was only a quarter through with his plate, Mike was letting out a loud belch, holding his plate up. \"More please!\" He immediately said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay stopped with a bit of sausage halfway up to his mouth and said, \"Let me finish mine first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sighed theatrically, letting his plate down, his belly audibly rumbling. He impatiently watched as Ray finished about half the plate before saying, \"But you're taking FOREVER! Pleeeeease just get me a little more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was forbidden by their parents to use the stove on his own. He wasn't a dumb or clumsy kid but his boundless energy always seemed to end with him getting burned or food getting dropped to the floor. Thus it was Ray's perpetual mission to tend to the cooking. The only upside of this was that it had allowed him to gain some culinary skills he otherwise wouldn't have had. He let his fork and knife fall to the plate with a clatter, snatching Mike's plate and filling it up with the rest of the food on the stove, thrusting it back at Mike in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks little bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you not to call me that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...by tomorrow it might be actually TRUE!\" Mike replied with a grin, shoveling more food into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought chilled Ray, imagining having to look UP at his younger brother. He was already manhandled like a toy sometimes by his brother, what would their dynamic be like when Mike inevitably grew? Ray pushed his plate aside, no longer feeling hungry, Mike eagerly taking the leftovers and adding them to his own. Once he was finished, Ray took both plates, rinsing them off before sticking them into the dishwasher. \"Alright Mike! I'm ready to tell you all about what's going on. But first, you have to have a little physical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike groaned and said, \"I HATE physicals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's the only way to make sure you're still healthy.\" Ray said, slapping him lightly on the back. \"Come on, get up. Into the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay was by no means a doctor, but he knew enough about the human body to at least be able to tell that Mike's body wasn't going to suffer organ failure or have a heart attack. If that was truly in the future, the symptoms would start showing almost immediately. The two brother's made their way into the basement, Mike pulling off his shirt, tossing it over the back of Ray's desk chair and sitting on a stool. \"Okay...go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay picked up his instruments and began the physical.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ray started by taking Mike's blood pressure. As he wrapped the velcro around Mike's arm, his brother flexed it, causing it to push apart slightly. \"Stop that.\" Ray said as he shot Mike a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just having a little fun with this.\" Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay kept his stern gaze on Mike for a second longer before breaking off and continuing the task at hand. It was bad enough that Mike got the formula, but now his brother was rubbing it in. He was sorely tempted to call off the whole thing and let whatever bad things happen to him...but Ray wasn't that heartless, and Mike was still his little brother, despite what Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay took Mike's blood pressure and heart rate and found them both normal, which was a good sign. Taking out a stethoscope, he pressed it against Mike's chest to hear his heart. Mike gasped and his sizeable chest pushed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Ray snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, that thing is cold!\" Mike said, fidgeting in his seat and rubbing the spot the stethoscope touched. \"This is why I hate physicals, everything is so cold and...and technical! I don't get anything you're doing as you poke me with all sorts of stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm checking your heart to see if it's healthy or not.\" He said, rubbing the end of the stethoscope with his shirt to warm it up a bit. \"Now hold still while I listen to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, just hurry up will you?\" Mike rubbed his arms trying to warm himself up. \"I'd probably die from pneumonia before you figure out I'm perfectly healthy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tempt me.\" Ray said and pressed the stethoscope on Mike's chest again. He heard Mike's heart beat loud and clear, with no sign of strain to it whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there Ray performed other tests on Mike. His brother's heart and lungs were working fine, and there was no sign of any abnormalities. When Ray asked for a blood sample, though, Mike backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa, you didn't say anything about needles!\" Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be such a baby, I'm just going to take a few drops.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I did NOT agree to getting stabbed!\" Mike took another step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay considered his options on how to deal with this. He could try and force Mike back, but that never really worked in the past considering that Mike always overpowered him. He could try threatening him, but he had nothing to threaten him with. Bribing was also out the window for the same reason. But, perhaps if he manipulated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, fine, I guess I found something wrong with you after all.\" Ray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" Mike asked, a tone of panic hinted in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently the bigger you are, the more chicken you become.\" Ray told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Mike's face turned red. \"You...you're just making fun of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, it's called a reversal of emotional size syndrome. The bigger you become, the more afraid you are of stuff, like say a tiny needle like this.\" He held it up. \"After all, would a big, strong guy really be afraid of something as small as getting his blood drawn? No, because normally they're a lot tougher than that, and you're just a bag of marshmallows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll show you!\" Mike walked up to Ray and thrust his arm out. \"Go ahead and take your damn blood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay smiled and took the blood sample. Mike flinched very slightly when the needle pierced his skin and had his eyes shut the entire time, despite his show of trying to be brave. It wasn't until Ray put a bandaid on him that Mike finally relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we're done, you can put your shirt back on.\" Ray told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Mike said, grabbing Ray's old shirt and pulling it onto himself. Ray noticed how much tighter it was on Mike than it ever did on himself, but pushed his irritation to the back of his mind. From what he had gathered so far, Mike was indeed perfectly healthy. He'd have to analyze the blood sample later to be sure, but for now it looked like Mike wasn't in any immediate danger. For now he'll just calculate Mike's rate of growth to see how big Mike would get. If Mike grew several inches in just one night, just how big would Mike become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay began to crunch numbers, calculating Mike's rate of growth. If Mike's growth continued at the same rate of five inches a day, then in one week he'd be almost three feet taller! But that wasn't including the fact that Mike was going to enter puberty, nor the fact that his stimulant had not completely stabilized. Those factors Ray would have to wait and see before he could get a more accurate measure. But, if Mike was to grow continuously at 5 inches a day, 3 feet a week, then within a year he would be 160 feet tall! Ray gulped at the thought of a 160 foot tall brother. He already felt small among the seniors at high school, but he'd be downright microscopic compared to Mike!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Mike asked from his seat next to Ray. \"Have you figured out something yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay looked over at Mike, who was peering at the numbers he had scribbled down. The look in his eyes told Ray that Mike didn't understand at all what the numbers meant, which was probably a good thing. Ray didn't want to let him know just how big he was going to get at the moment, Mike's ego was big enough as it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are too many unpredictable variables for me to make an accurate estimate right now.\" Ray said. Well, technically he didn't lie, but he didn't tell him the whole truth either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to tell me why I'm suddenly as tall as you are, or am I going to have to wrestle it out of you?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay looked at Mike silently, then sighed. \"I might as well tell you...That drink you took from the freezer was actually a stimulant for the pituitary gland, which would-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In English please?\" Mike cut him off and rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. It's formula I spent a lot of time on meant to make you grow bigger.\" Ray summed it all up in one sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually made something like that? That's awesome!\" Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, until you drank it.\" Ray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but...oh.\" Realization dawned on Mike's face. \"Oh, so you wanted...and that's why...oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's why I was so upset with you when you drank it.\" Ray said. \"And it wasn't completely stabilized when you took it, so who knows how big you'll grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as sorry as I am that I took it from you, I gotta say it sounds pretty awesome!\" Mike said, excitement growing on his face. \"I mean, now I get to be the biggest guy in school! Just wait until they get a load of me when I tower above them all! I'd probably be able to take on the entire football team by myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay felt annoyed that his brother wasn't showing any remorse for stealing his precious formula from him, but there wasn't anything either of them could do. For now, he'd just have to observe Mike and see what comes out of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days didn't make Ray feel any better about Mike; if anything, they made him even more worried -- and certainly more jealous. Ray even started to wish they didn't have the week off school, so he could put this ordeal out of mind, for a little while at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had to face the facts: Mike was growing, and growing fast. By the next morning, he passed six feet tall, and could no longer fit in any of Ray's clothes, having to find some of their father's old clothes that still left little to the imagination. The day after that, he had grown another seven inches, rapidly approaching seven feet tall. Clothes were quickly becoming a pipe dream for Mike, not that the ten-year-old seemed to mind; he gladly stomped around the house in nothing but a pair of formerly-baggy sweatpants that hugged his thighs so tight they looked like they would burst at any moment. Mike wanted to go out and show all his friends and everyone from school, but Ray thankfully was able to convince him to stay home, though he did venture out into the backyard a few times. Ray could only hope that the neighbors didn't catch sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat troubled Ray more than Mike being seen, though, was the fact that his younger-- he definitely couldn't use the word \"little\" any more-- brother's growth seemed to be accelerating. Five inches the first night, six the second, and seven the third... At that rate, his original 160 foot estimate for a year out would definitely be way under. Mike couldn't possibly get that big... could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while his body (thankfully) didn't seem to be packing on any added muscle or bulk, Ray couldn't help but notice that the bulge in Mike's pants continued to get more and more pronounced, and not just because the pants were becoming smaller on his frame. Ray had caught a glimpse of Mike's package when his younger brother had been readjusting his pants, and it was clear that Mike's endowment was now bigger than his own, both overall as well as in proportion to his body-- much larger than any ten-year-old had the right to have. It must've been a side effect of the formula that he hadn't been aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this lead to Ray deciding that he had to try and start developing some sort of antidote, and fast-- their parents would be back home at the end of the week, and if he didn't do anything, Mike might not fit inside the house anymore! Locking himself in his room towards the end of this third day, Ray spent several hours trying to reverse-engineer the formula and create something that could counteract its effects. But he soon started to dread that his task was impossible; even if such an antidote could be synthesized, he was trying to do several weeks worth of work in a few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he kept at it, long into the night. Eventually, though, he succumbed to his exhaustion, falling asleep at his desk right where he was working. He slept for several hours, only waking up when a loud noise jerked him out of his rest. His heart pounded as he got up and carefully, quietly, left the room, afraid of what the source of that noise would end up being, and knowing that Mike was almost certainly the cause...</span></div></div>",

When he entered the room, he found his now much larger brother hunched over on the ground, sweating profusely and his arms wrapped around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike!?\" Ray immediately when to his brother's side. \"Mike, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts!\" Mike said, biting back a cry of pain. He was visibly shaking, his too tight tank top and sweatpants soaked with sweat. \"I...I just wanted to see how strong I was and- argh!\" He jerked as another wave of pain racked through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay glanced over to where his brother's weight set was. The barbel was loaded with a ton of weight, probably around 400 lbs! \"Mike, why would you do something so reckless!? I told you you shouldn't do any strenuous activity at all, we don't know what kind of effects it would have on the formula inside of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do now,\" Mike said wryly, then let out another cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned and worried, Ray grabbed his brother, trying to comfort him. His mind was racing, trying to figure out what to do. As he held on to his brother, he felt his body...pulsate? Frowning, Ray looked down at Mike. Although mike was shaking and jerking from pain, and it could have been a trick of the light, but it almost looked like he was...growing?</span></div></div>",

I can't believe how much I grew overnight! I guess that puberty thing finally started!!\" The boy was beaming, unaware of the potential dangers he might be facing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... that isn't why this is happening....\" Ray sighed heavily as he remembered the terrible sight of the freshly showered boy just after having guzzled down his serum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh yeah, you said you had something to do with this right??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. sort of, do you remember that 'drink' that you took from the freezer last night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike seemed to look confused for a moment before remembering the refreshing green beverage from the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH YEAH!! That stuff was soooo tasty!\" The ten year old involuntarily licked his lips as he remembered it's odd yet sweet taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay clenched his fist as the boy practically rubbed salt in the wound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any more of that stuff? I could go for another~\" Mike grinned innocently<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay was trying his best to stay calm, but it seemed like every word that came from the boy's mouth was purposely meant to mock him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.....\" Ray stated with an aggravated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That 'tasty' drink took me a very VERY long time to produce. I probably won't be able to make another one for an entire year, maybe even longer..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's eyes went wide with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wooow..... darn.... I guess I should have just taken a cola instead huh?~\" The ten year old giggled as he rubbed his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....J-just open your mouth okay?....\" Ray was clearly seething as he approached the boy with the cotton swab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAA~\" Mike exclaimed unnecessarily as he opened his mouth widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rubbed the inside of the boy's cheek, Ray couldn't help but wish that it were somehow possible to just reach down the boy's throat and get his serum back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... now I just got to test this...\" The teen grumbled as he walked over to his microscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, what was so special about that drink anyways?\" Mike muttered as he began to spin in his chair again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay placed the sample between two petri dishes and turned on the microscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That 'drink' was filled with a collection of VERY powerful, custom made enzymes whose purpose was to stimulate secondary pubetorial growth...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmmmm..... so I guess that means it helps you grow more??\u201d  It was pretty clear that the teen's explanation went straight over the boy's head, aside from  the word 'growth' of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo THAT'S why I grew so much? Awesome!! Now I'll probably be bigger than you before I even turn eleven!\" Mike giggled playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay beginning to feel his inner rage surface again before taking a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't make it for you....\" Ray bit his lip as he continued to scan his brother's cells through the microscope's lens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike didn't seem to notice the soft-spoken comment as he continued to spin around excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god......\" Ray's heart began to race as he stared down at the cells, all of which were duplicating at a rate he never knew was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn damn damn..!, that serum was never supposed to be absorbed that early, it was way too powerful, especially for a kid that hadn't even hit puberty yet...\" Ray began to subconsciously speak out loud as he scrambled over to a notepad and began crunching the numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike suddenly stopped spinning as he heard the distress in his brother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up from the seat, the ten year old began to walk over to see what the teen was writing when he realized something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woaaaaah!!!\" Ray felt a shiver run down his spine as he heard Mike's voice immediately behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head, the sixteen year old's heart nearly stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very slight, but noticeable; Mike was now about an inch taller than the teen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-there's no way...there's no way it could be happening this fast!....\u201d Ray's voice trembled as he quickly looked down at the floor. Both brothers were wearing socks, there was no way that this was some sort of trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge grin began to spread across the boy's face. He had been waiting for this for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I guess the little bro thing isn't a joke anymore..\" Mike laughed as he pulled the paralyzed teen into a headlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no....no....nonono...\" Ray quietly muttered with mortification as tears began to well in his eyes. The whole reason he made that serum was to avoid this moment. The only thing it did was just accelerate the inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike then noticed that the teen's eyes were getting watery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don't cry little guy. If it makes you feel any better, It always kind of felt like I was meant to be the bigger bro, ya know?.\u201d  The boy was totally oblivious that every word was just making teen more upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Ray just reminded himself of the results he had just discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mike, let me go! This is important, you need to know something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing LIL bro~\" Mike was clearly adding more emphasis now that he could literally lord himself over the teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being released, Ray began to recount the results over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you getting so upset about lil guy?\" Mike muttered as he walked over and placed his hand on the teen's head, ruffling it bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the condescending gesture was very upsetting, Ray knew there were MUCH bigger issues at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the serum.... like I was saying, not only did you drink it before it was ready, but your body type and age will only magnify the effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so this growth splurt thing isn't even over yet? COOOOL!! Can you tell how much bigger I'm gonna get?\" Mike's eyes grew wide with anticipation as he looked down at the indecipherable notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's no way....\u201d Ray kept calculating the numbers, but they were simply too big \u2026.WAY too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, just tell me!!!! I hope I grow taller than a skyscraper!!\u201d the boy laughed to himself jokingly as he raised his arms out and stomped his feet in a godzilla like fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay made a nervous gulp as he heard the boy's comment. Mike's innocent boasting wouldn't have bothered him had the results not seemed to project a similar result....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-look.. I need to monitor you to make sure this-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm staaaarving....can you make me something to eat?\u201d The Mike's toned belly gurgled from behind ray's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay took a deep calming breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, sure. Just promise me that you'll cooperate for the next few days.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course lil bro! Whatever you say!\u201d Ray couldn't help but notice that the tone of the boy's voice seemed a bit more condescending now that he was technically looking down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-In the kitchen-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could really go or some lasagna!\u201d Mike shouted loudly as his stomach growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine...\u201d Ray rolled his eyes as he opened the freezer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't wait to go back to school and show my friends! I bet I'm as tall as the twelfth graders by then!\u201d Mike giggled as he imagined how it would all play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf ray's calculations were correct, it was very unlikely that Mike would even be able to FIT in school after break was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping his thoughts to himself, Ray attempted to pull down a plate from the top shelf, a task he often struggled with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, let me help you out there little guy~\u201d Mike suddenly appeared behind him, reaching his arm up and grabbing the plate with no effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ever need any help reaching anything, just let me know~\u201d Mike was clearly loving every moment he was able to show off his new height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the...\u201d Ray suddenly noticed that Mike had grown a good two inches taller since they had been in the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is crazy... you're growing faster as time goes on..\u201d Ray backed away and noticed that all his clothes had become too small for Mike's growing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCooool! You're right! I didn't even notice until now...\u201d Mike didn't seem to be concerned. If anything the boy just wanted to see just how tall he could really get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-mike, I don't think we should be joking about this anymore...\u201d Ray couldn't help but notice that the clothes seemed to be getting visibly tighter as they talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWooooow~ If I stand really still it almost feels like the room is getting smaller!!!\u201d Mike fidgeted excitedly as he began to add on centimeters with each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We need to get outside now!\u201d Ray yelled as the clothes on the boy began to rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay sure.....\u201d Mike seemed mesmerized by the exciting growing sensation as he slowly followed his brother to the back door of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reaching the lawn, Ray turned around to see Mike ducking his head just to make it through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point he Mike was butt naked, which was very unsettling considering he still had the body of a lean, toned,  athletic ten year old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was standing a good seven feet away from his brother, he could actually begin to see Mike growing inch by inch within seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMIKE! GET AWAY FROM THE HOUSE! HURRY!!\u201d Ray screamed as he waved the boy over towards the back of the yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike began to slowly walk across the yard the acceleration seemed to double. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCooooooooooool~\u201d Mike was smiling in awe as he watched the world around him begin to shrink. Though he never admitted it to anyone, not even to his brother, the boy had always fantasized about being a giant. The innocent fascination was likely one of the reasons why the boy had always been obsessed with becoming taller, but now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay slowly backed away until his back made contact with the wooden fence parameter. Mike's size continued to accelerate, forcing the mortified teen's neck to slowly crane higher and higher just to keep eye contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's feet alone were growing at such a rate that they were quickly taking up 20 30.. 40..50. 60 70% of the yard!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's legs began to wobble with fear as he realized he was now roughly about the height of the boy's ankles. Mike's toes alone were now the size of small cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen craned his head back up. The younger male was now the size of a 17 story building. The boy's naturally impressive lean, toned, body was now made even more apparent as he loomed overhead like a young god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Ray, the splurt seemed to finally slow just as Mike's feet were about to bust through the parameter of the yard. The teen was cowering against the fence as the boy's garage sized toes towered over him only a couple feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a giant......\u201d Mike's heart raced as he looked ahead towards the horizon. The neighborhood  around him looked as if it were an incredibly detailed model town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo lost in his own world, Mike seemed to have totally forgot about his 'little' sibling, who was now cowering at his toes. Still not fully comprehending just how dangerous he had become to the civilization below, Mike began taking a step forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait.. WAIT WAIT! MIKE STOP!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!! STOOOP!!!\u201d Unfortunately for  the frantic teen, Mike had become far too large to notice his brother's tiny voice as his enormous foot rose forward into the air. Ray could only watch as Mike's incredibly vast fleshy sole zoomed past him over head to the property next door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Sooooo coooooooo-.. *crunch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chuh..?\u201d Mike made an innocently confused face as he felt something the size of a small pack of cards crunch under his left foot. Looking downward, the boy seemed confused for a moment, not sure of what he was looking at until..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike suddenly gasped with realization. All around his huge feet were the tiny houses of his neighborhood, he had not realized he had become THAT big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coh.....\u201d Mike bit his lip with apprehension as he lifted his foot from the spot he had just firmly planted it. All that remained was a flattened mess that used to be his neighbor's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops.....\u201d Though the boy felt a bit guilty, he couldn't deny that staring at the aftermath kind of excited him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet everyone is like a bug to me now....\u201d Mike whispered to himself with a tone of delight. The boy couldn't help but suddenly feel a bit titillated as he fondly began to recall his stompy giant dreams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Wait a minute!\u201d Breaking free of the naughty day dream, Mike finally remembered his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure not to move his feet anymore, the boy squatted down between the two properties and scanned the lawns, granting quite a sight to anyone beneath the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten year old grinned widely as he pin pointed the teeny cowering teen leaning against the back fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFOUND YOU LITTLE BRO~!\u201d The boy's voice boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike couldn't help but feel complete and total fear as the giant's eyes focused in on him. Mike had always had a huge ego, but now he had the body to match. Jay wasn't entirely certain how the boy would handle his newfound power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant himself was now squatting directly over their house. The boy was one slip away from crushing their home under his toned glutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoooow, you're so tiiiiny!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay slowly lifted himself up and stared back, not sure what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI.. I uh...\u201d The teen muttered before quickly being interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahah! I guess comparing our feet would be silly now huh??? Just look how BIG mine are!\u201d Mike grinned as he stood up straight and carefully lifted one of his feet into the air directly over the teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay could do nothing but watch as the vast fleshy surface of the boy's sole came to a stop overhead, engulfing him in shadow. Various debris from the house he had crushed earlier had remained stuck to small spots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike couldn't help but imagine how big he must look to the teen, to everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The house sized foot dangled above you like some kind of alien invader, ready to turn you into a red splotch on Mike's massive sole. But, just as you thought all was lost, with deliberate slowness Mike began to lift his massive foot back into the air letting the sunlight touch your relieved face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the sweat off your brow a gasp of, \"That was close\" escaped your lips. Unfortunately for you however, your relief would be short lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up to your building sized younger brother, you were about to say something when you saw a face that made your blood freeze. Mike wasn't even looking at you as he set his foot back down (smothering another house), instead his gaze had turned to the neighborhood around him and he didn't look like he was about to start distributing cookies either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cocky grin was plastered to Mike's face and there was more than just innocent joy in his facial features, there was...mischief in there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing you needed to say something fast, you waved to Mike and called out a simple, \"Hey Mike!\" Startled by your voice, the mischevious look vanished from his face for a split second as he scanned the ground with a look of genuine concern, seeming to have forgotten where you were in the excitement. \"Maybe he's still nice\", you thought for a moment. Spotting you however, the look of concern vanished and was instead replaced by another cocky grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little BUG!\", he bellowed seeming to add emphasis to the \"bug\" part of the sentence, \"What are you doing around here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean bug?\", you replied with concern, \"I'm your big-brother, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, booming laughter filled the air and you covered your ears, the sound waves seeming like they would crush you into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIG BROTHER? I think you're forgetting who's the bigger brother now!\", Mike boomed casually lifting his foot into the air above you, \" I think you're just a bug now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes, you prepare for the worst, expecting to be crushed under one of Mike's massive soles, but to your surprise nothing comes. Instead a great \"CRASH!\" resounds behind you and a blast of air knocks you on your face. Groaning you pick yourself back up and carefully balance yourself on your feet. Opening your eyes just in time,  you see Mike spring into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving swung his foot over your head and into the house to the left of your own, Mike then brings his other foot over your head and onto the next house. Like a kid playing in a rain puddle, Mike stomps down onto house after house with high swinging steps yelling out, \"SMASH! SMASH! SMASH!\" with every foot fall. Reaching the end of your row of houses, Mike turned to his right in order to stomp a house across the street. Then using his foot like a bulldozer, Mike dragged the side of his foot down the row, grinding a half dozen houses into matchsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the remaining houses, a single kick was all it took for Mike to obliterate the last 4 houses in the row, leaving your house the only one standing in a sea of carnage. Swallowing, you can barely look Mike in the eyes as he plants each of his gargantuan feet on the fence surrounding the back yard, walling you in. Every muscle in your body tells you to run as Mike's towering frame straddles the yard like a modern colossus, but you're frozen in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike squatted down onto his thighs, you literally felt the force of his muscles from the relatively benign movement, making you shudder in fear. Raising a hand to shield your eyes from his nude body, you realized that he was no longer completely nude, instead now sporting a pair of tan colored briefs that somehow match his massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where'd you get the underwear from?\", you asked trying to suppress the fear in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the briefs, Mike looked equally surprised that they were there and he simply replied, \"HUH, I dunno, I was kinda embarrassed about being naked and I guess they just appeared there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\", you spluttered, \"That's not possible?! The serum doesn't do th-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were trying to finish your thought, Mike lost patience with your babbling and plucked you off the ground with his fingers hoisting you up to his waist. Then with remarkably good motor skills, he pulled the waistband of his briefs forward just enough for you to slip underneath it and lowered you into the gap before letting it snap down on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scaled up elastic pinning you to Mike's abdomen seemed to be crushing you, but somehow you were still alive despite barely being able to breath. Managing to force a little air out of your chest and into your throat you managed to gasp out, \"Mike...I c-an't breath... P-Please let me...out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleshy wall behind you rippled with force as a deafening giggle traveled up Mike's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bug-bro I can't hear you! You'll have to speak up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to try and speak again, the rhythmic beat of helicopter blades touched your ear drums alerting both you and Mike. Squinting, you could just make out the little aircraft as it flew towards you. You wanted to yell to it to stay away, but you knew it wouldn't do them any good as you saw Mike turn towards it with malicious curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, looks like I have some fans to greet!\", Mike boomed and he began to walk towards it, crushing house after house to splinters as he walked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what kind of helicopter was it? </span></div></div>",

Each stride must have been covering close to 200 feet and your energetic younger brother seemed to be bounding across the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you thought the wild ride would make you vomit, Mike came screeching to a halt, sliding over close to an 1/8th of a mile before completely stopping. Leaning down with what little of your body was free, you peaked down at the ground and immediately felt a new chill of fear slide up your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Mike's towering frame was a growing assembly of military vehicles. Humvees and troop transports were filtering their way through the narrow roads criss-crossing the suburban area. At a number of the roads leading south towards the city, trucks and humvees had been parked nose to nose in order to \"block\" Mikey from proceeding. However, it seemed that the military had missed the memo on your brother being close to 200 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not come any further!\", rang an amplified voice (clearly directed through a microphone), \"Stay where you are and do not move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were concerned about your own safety (catching a stray bullet wasn't on your priorities list), you couldn't help but be concerned for your younger brother, even if he was 170 feet tall. You had no idea if he would be able to survive being shot at by the military, and you didn't even wanna think about the missiles being trained on him by the helicopter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning your neck back up to look at Mikey's face, you were relieved to see a look of equal concern as he clearly understood the warning from the soldier below. \"Listen to him Mikey!\", you implored him, \"I really don't wanna see you hurt, pleeeeaaasssee? Just stop and I'll try to help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing you speak however, seemed to have the opposite of the calming effect you'd been going for and Mikey's look of concern quickly vanished. With his 20/20 vision, Mike began to scan the roadblock in front of him, a look of bold defiance quickly appearing on his face. Crossing his arms Mike bellowed out, \"Oh yeah! Why should I stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we'll...shoot you.\" replied the voice; the last words clearly dropping off in volume<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReplying a booming laugh, Mike took a defiant step forward adding plenty of extra force to it. The step shattered the asphalt beneath his foot and managed to knock a couple soldiers off their feet as their vehicles bounced up and down on their suspensions. Mike's basketball sized toes were now barely touching the shoes of one of the soldiers and after he'd swallowed a good sized lump in his throat, you saw him take a cautious step back. Laughing at their obvious fear, Mike's ego clearly took over as he made his own ultimatum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LISTEN UP!\", he yelled forcing you to cover your ears, \"EVERY ONE OF YOU BUGS HAS TO THE COUNT OF THREE TO GET OUT OF MY WAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers exchanged nervous glances before shakily raising their rifles. Giggling at their show of defiance, Mike started his count. \"One!...Two!...THREE! Ready or not here I come!\", he called out giggling a little at the end of his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of gunfire answered mike's challenge and lines of bullets streamed up from the ground towards Mike's enormous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to Mike?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yelping in fear, you closed your eyes and attempted to make yourself a smaller target as bullets began whizzing overhead. Unfortunately for you, the crushing force of the waistband prevented almost all movement and you stayed just as exposed as you had been before the shooting started. However, you noticed something was missing, where were the painful yelps from your brother, where was the crying of \"OW! That hurts!\" and other things of that nature. Opening your eyes you looked up to see a face of..astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's arms were outstretched as he slowly rotated his arms and hands scanning every square inch of his body. Instead of being covered in hundreds of tiny bullet wounds, Mike's skin was perfectly clean despite the bullets clearly hitting him. The only thing the bullets seemed to be doing was creating the occasional harmless spark, otherwise simply hitting his body with a \"Ping!\" before seemingly disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the bullets were having no effect, the military changed gears and began to switch to heavier weapons. The popping of rifles began to be drowned out as the booming of heavy machine guns rang out through the neighborhood. For the military, this would be a mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming of the machine guns was just loud enough to snap Mike out of his trance, and a look of amusement spread across his face. Spying a humvee at his feet firing its machine gun at him, he slid one his feet forward and used his massive weight to grind it into scrap metal. Spotting another humvee just down the road, Mike took a long yet lazy step towards it, carelessly crushing it beneath one of his 30 foot long treads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike made his way around the neighborhood crushing vehicle after vehicle, you couldn't help but notice how relaxed he was. Perhaps wanting to seem even scarier, Mike took each step with extreme slowness, letting each foot sit there for a fraction of a second before taking the next step. With it being quite obvious to him that the bullets were having no effect, you realized Mike had all the time in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gunfire began die out around Mike, you saw the soldiers beginning to abandon their posts and begin to run towards a grocery store just up the road. There a number of troop carriers and armored cars were waiting in the parking lot, ready to move in with reinforcements. Spotting them Mike put on a mock face of concern cooing, \"Awww, are the wittle bugs trying to run? I think they'd better be careful of the big bad giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding his arms behind his head, Mike turned to give chase, a cocky grin spread across his face as he took long and exaggerated steps towards the store. You could only close your eyes as you heard his feet rip through the fragile houses beneath him accompanied by crunch of people beneath his massive treads. Separating the neighborhood from the store was a wide stretch of main road, and Mike stopped just at the edge of it, less than one stride now separating him from the main force of the military. Crossing his arms in front of his chest, Mike gave the military a piercing stare as he drummed his toes on the ground, the vibrations no doubt being felt by every soldier present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess its time to finish off these annoying bugs!\", Mike boomed, raising a foot into the air. But just as he was about to stomp down on the military's side of the street, the \"WHOOSH!\" of a missile sounded out. The helicopter fired missile slammed into the Mike's shoulder blade and he wheeled around to face his attacker. Before he could take any action however, another missile slammed into the back of his head obscuring his face in a cloud of smoke. As Mike tried to wave away the smoke, the Helicopter let loose its swarm missiles directly into Mike's face, causing him to stumble backwards onto the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike realized what was happening, missile after missile soared up from the ground below peppering his body in explosions. Rocket after rocket slammed into Mike's body and you could barely see or breath in the cloud of smoke covering Mike's entire upper body. After several minutes of non-stop missile fire, the number of rockets began to subside and the cloud of smoke began to clear around the young titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the smoke cleared and after expelling the last of it from you lungs with a cough, you looked up to examine Mike. Mike's cocky grin was gone and instead your younger brother looked exhausted from the pounding he'd just taken. You felt Mike's thigh shift beneath you one final time as he tried to step forward before you saw his eyes roll back in his head. Suddenly, a rush of vertigo reached your head and you saw the entire world roll backwards as Mike's enormous frame crashed to the ground. The force of the impact was mostly absorbed by Mike's body, but for a moment you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were you when you woke up?</span></div></div>",

Still dazed by Mike's fall, you could barely make out the acres of skin around you as you attempted to see what was going on around you. Suddenly a pair of hands grabbed your shoulders and someone yelled behind you, \"One, Two, Three!\" before you felt the hands trying to unsuccessfully drag you out from underneath the crushing elastic. A pair of bodies fell down behind you with a groan as the flesh beneath them suddenly...shifted. Turning around, you saw two soldiers scan the \"ground\" beneath them with expressions of terror, exchanging a quick glance before fleeing in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey?!\", you called out nervously, \"Are-are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall behind you twitched for a moment before it began to ripple with the giggling of your very much alright, \"little\" brother. Suddenly, you felt several G's of force pushing you back into Mike's stomach as he leapt to his feet, your vision going momentarily red from the sudden acceleration. Dazed, you shook your head to try and fend off your dizziness wincing a bit as blood rushed back to your head. Looking up, you saw Mikey's beaming face along with his pointer finger barrelling straight towards you! Yelping in terror, you thrust your arms into the air as if your scrawny limbs would somehow be able to stop a finger as big as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, bro!\", Mike said as he suppressed a laugh. \"I'm not gonna hurt you!\", and he pressed the enormous digit press into your head, using his finger to rub your head a bit, tousling your hair. Removing his finger, you rubbed your head a bit trying to dull the pain as you groaned out, \"I...thought you were..done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn audible snort escaped Mike's mouth as he scoffed at the idea of being taken out by \"bugs\". \"Nahhhh, I just wanted to see if playing dead would lure the military in!\" \"Lure in the mil-\", you stammered before looking down at the ground. Packed in around Mike's form were the remnants of the military, previously ready to \"capture\" Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou no longer had words for the situation and all that you could do was gulp as you tried to decipher what Mike was trying to do here. \"Is he really that sadistic, did he lure them in here just to crush all of them?...No, he would've done that before, he has no reason to play dead!\" Your thoughts were interrupted as Mike stomped his foot on the ground, causing the whole army to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you bugs going to try and attack me or what?\", Mike boomed impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Mike however, the military was done. Their ammunition was exhausted and their spirits crushed as they'd realized they hadn't even touched Mike this entire time. Instead of popping rifle fire and streams of bullets, the army answered with almost complete silence, with only a few murmurs scattered across the ocean of helmets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike seemed disappointed at this turn of events and a frown spread across his face as he realized the military wouldn't be fighting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you guys aren't gonna fight anymore, I'll be leaving. Later everyone!\", and Mike stepped forward to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally of course, he couldn't help but mess with his size and he made sure to plant as many steps as possible on the military below, the crunching of vehicles and the wet squishes of people accompanying him as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike jogged for a good 10 minutes as he seemed to look for something in particular. You wanted to ask him what he was looking for, but every time you opened your mouth, the wind tore the words right out of your mouth and you were forced to close it. Finally, Mike yelled out an \"Ah-ha!\" and barrelled towards a relatively inconspicuous 10-story apartment building. Slowing down, Mike stomped into the parking lot in front of the relatively boring building and stomped both his feet into the ground, a \"1-2!\" thud pounding into your chest and almost certainly being felt in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping his hands, Mike yelled at the top of his voice, \"Attention everyone! I'm going to tear down this building soon so you'd better leave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for just a moment, Mike crossed his arms as he waited for the residents to flee the building, tapping his foot impatiently as people ran along the sides of the building, desperate to get away from him. When the stream of people had slowed to a trickle, Mike stepped forward and grabbed the roof of the building. Pressing down tentatively, Mike's hand bent in the roof of the top floor a bit, but did nothing more. Confident that the building was strong, Mike turned around and hoisted himself up onto the top of the building. The top two floors caved in from Mike's sheer tonnage, but the building still stood by some miracle, and Mike found himself quite comfortably seated on the top of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his feet now swinging in front of the third floor windows, Mike finally plucked you out from underneath the waistband of his briefs and somewhat roughly dropped you into his palm. Grinning at you, Mike finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well bro, I'd say your growth serum worked!\", he boomed making you wince,\"And guess what, I figured out how to grow even bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, you opened your mouth to reply only to close it again as you tried to think up the \"proper\" thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-well\", you stammered out, \"how do you grow then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple!\", Mikey replied, \"I absorb energy to help me grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by his answer, you had no idea what to think of his claim. The serum had been to stimulate a new kind of puberty, what Mike was saying would defy the laws of physics. You didn't want to ask, but you knew you had to if you wanted to start to figure things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do you know then? You haven't gotten any bigger since we left our house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeellll, growing bigger was just an option earlier I only realized earlier that I was the one who made this pair of underwear. When I was stomping on all the houses in the neighborhood, I accidentally touched one of those power line thingys. After I stomped on all the houses I felt amazing! Like I could do anything or grow to be any size! But I was kinda embarrassed being naked so I couldn't stop thinking about at least having some underwear to put on! At first I thought I just felt so good because I was having so much fun, but I remember seeing a cable in one of my footprints as we left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can either use the energy to grow, or to create stuff with your mind?\", you said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! And I got that same feeling while the military was shooting at me! I feel like I'm gonna explode with energy!\", Mike boomed with a smile. \"Well bro\", he grunted as he stretched his arms, \"I think you'd better grab onto something, because I'm about to have a new growth spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising your arms you pleaded with Mike, managing to yell out, \"Wait! Don't do it!\", but your words fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's eyes were already closed with concentration and you heard a low rumble as Mike's skin ground against the concrete of the building he was seated on. His palm stretched out in front of you becoming a field of smooth skin. His torso broadened and expanded rising slowly into the sky. Running to the edge of Mike's lengthening fingers, you looked down to see his thighs stretching outward like flesh colored runways. A \"THUD!\" tickled you ears as Mike's feet made contact with the ground, the appendages creating a landslide-like sound as their expansion ground anything they made contact with into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a solid minute of growing the sound of grinding concrete began to lessen until it disappeared altogether, Mike having finally exhausted the energy gained from his fight with the military. Opening his eyes, Mike wiped a bit of sweat off his brow letting out a \"whew!\" \"Well bro, off to the next adventure!\" he boomed, and before you could protest he was already on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was Mike's next adventure?</span></div></div>",

Before he had realized it, he had fallen asleep and it was already morning the next day. Instinctively his hand shot out to slam down on the snooze button, but he accidentally knocked it off his bed stand. Swearing he reached down to turn it off, but found that it had rolled under his bed, making him swear louder as he got out, got on his stomach, grab the clock and slam it off. His anger at his clock rekindled his anger towards Mike, making Ray feel crappy already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the floor by his bed, he contemplated what he wanted to do. a part of him wanted to try and go back to bed and hide there forever, but after the episode with the alarm clock he was no wide awake. Not only that, he was starting to become hungry, and there wasn't much stuff that was edible in his room. Despite his desire to sit and brood all day in his room until the end of time, he knew he had to get out and face reality: he was going to stay small, and his brother was only going to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay groaned as he leaned back, his head bumping against his stand. Why did this have to happen? Ray was so close to achieving his goal. Perhaps it was a good thing that Mike drank the formula first, he tried to tell himself. Mike could be the first guinea pig, and Ray could observe the results...No, that was wrong. Ray couldn't fool himself, he had wanted to take that formula so badly, and the fact that his already gifted little brother received it made it even worse. And to top it off, it would take months to recreate the stimulant! And that wasn't including the time he needed to raise enough money to purchase the compounds and components, nor the fact that some of those components were very difficult to find. By Ray's calculation, he would be able to replicate that stimulant after at LEAST a year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Ray thought about it, the angrier he became. It was unfair. Mike already had everything Ray ever wanted, and now he was going to get more of it! That anger just grew more and more as Ray got dressed and went downstairs to go into the kitchen. The idea of punching his brother grew in his mind with each step he took, and when he was outside of the kitchen door he was ready to jump on top of Mike in a full blown assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stepped into the kitchen, though, he found the table already set up for breakfast, with eggs, toast, bacon, everything. Seated at his usual spot was Mike, who jumped out of his chair as soon as Ray entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ray! You're, uh, you're out of your room.\" Mike said. Ray quickly checked out Mike, trying to see if there was anything different. However, Mike looked pretty much exactly the same as he did the previous day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am, did you think I was going to stay in there forever?\" Ray said, a bit more harshly than he intended. But he liked it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike flinched back. \"Well...you locked me out and everything. I had to sleep in mom and dad's room last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not nearly enough payback for what you've done.\" Ray said, his hands tightening into fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked down. \"I...I'm sorry, I didn't realize you'd get so upset over a little drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little drink? LITTLE DRINK!?\" Ray barely stopped himself from jumping over the table and lunging at his brother. \"You don't have ANY idea how long I waited for that 'little' drink, and you just gulped it down when you didn't even need it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike took a step back. \"I'm sorry ok! I didn't know it was so important to you. Look, I'll buy you a whole case of it ok? I got some money saved up from Christmas and my Birthday and stuff, so...so please don't stay mad at me ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay took a deep breath and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ray glared, twenty different horrible things on the tip of his tongue, but before he could start yelling, he paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey's eyes were shiny, like he was one shout away from crying. Ray saw a new bandage on his hand, not fully covering a small burn mark. Mikey was <i>super</i> clumsy in the kitchen, with the coordination and attention span of a big puppy. And between the tears, the breakfast, and the kid practically offering him everything he had to make up for drinking the formula, it'd be easier to kick a puppy than to yell at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay let his breath out in a sad sigh, hugged Mikey to his side, and ruffled his hair. He heard a sniffle, and was sure he just got snot on his shirt. Gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still mad?\" Mikey asked, not really looking at anything for a second and trying to pretend he wasn't rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mikey, I'm not.\" Ray rolled his eyes.  \"Well, yes, I <i>am</i>, but not at you. People forget with you, I guess, but you're ten. Taking stuff without permission is just a thing you're going to do sometimes. It's not your fault you can see the top shelf in the freezer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey giggled a bit and tugged Ray over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I meant it; I'll help you get some more of that drink, even if it takes my <i>whole</i> stash of money. And, I made this breakfast for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay grimaced a bit as he bit into his scrambled egg and felt shells crunch in his mouth. Bleh. Still, the brat meant well, and...if he was honest, he should have locked the formula up or something. Now, he was going to have to come clean about everything, and hope Mikey wasn't mad at <i>him</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate being small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay paused, not sure why those words came out of his mouth. He'd meant to start talking science, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not small!\" Mikey exclaimed hurriedly, jabbing a (mostly) empty fork toward Ray for emphasis. \"You're taller than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By like three inches.\" Ray muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's 'cause I'm <i>big</i>.\" Mikey said firmly, now shaking the fork. \"I'm not stupid, Ray; I can sit my chin on most of my classmate's <i>heads</i>. You're not small, you're <i>normal</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of breakfast passed a bit quietly; Ray'd practically admitted to his kid brother that he was jealous of him, and it looked a bit like Mikey was struggling with the concept. Ray decided explaining the formula could wait a until things calmed back down again. Though he didn't ignore that Mikey ate more than double what he did, and finished off the gallon jug of milk. (He thought that thing had been full yesterday, but it'd been at a quarter this morning. Still, a quart of milk was a lot to drink!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was to pay him back for all the out-door stuff they did yesterday, but Mikey seemed fine with just vegging on the couch together and playing video games. An hour in, Ray started to get a bit worried when he felt Mikey leaning into his side.  Looking over, he saw Mikey blinking slowly, eyes muzzy, and a pained expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike?\" He asked, worried, bringing a hand to his brother's head; a bit warm, but not hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dun' feel gud,\" Mikey mumbled, curling into Ray's side and shivering a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, buddy?\" Ray asked, getting up and laying him out on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurt,\" Mikey moaned, trying to curl back up a bit. The shivering got worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Ray asked, freaking out a bit. God, if Mikey said side, or <i>chest</i>-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feet.\" Mikey mumbled, curling up and grabbing his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay blinked, considering that. Well, not a vital organ then. Panic time over, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold...\" Mikey definitely had a 'sick little kid' whine going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One sec,\" Ray said and quickly rushed upstairs and back and dropped a bunch of blankets and pillows on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay grabbed a glass and some water from the kitchen and handed his brother a painkiller. Mikey swallowed it and sipped the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk?\" Mikey asked, settling back into the blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shook his head, worried. Mikey didn't get sick very often, he was a really healthy kid. And whatever this was had hit the poor kid like a truck. Well, this was definitely an older brother moment; weekend watching sick little brother. Awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay signed, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll got get some at the store in a few minutes. Just try and sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay watched as his normally hyper kid brother fell deeply asleep at eleven in the morning, shivering under the blankets. Still, he didn't seem to be getting worse, so if he was going to get supplies he needed to go now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the market was done at legal-if-you-squint speed. Ray stocked up on pain meds, milk, a few other groceries, tissues, the works. Mikey seemed to perk up a bit when Ray got home, blinking away with a yawn and a mumble of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirsty?\" Ray asked from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay poured out a tall glass of milk and added an ice cube so it'd stay cold for long sipping. When he got to the living room, Mikey was sitting up with one leg crossed in his lap, rubbing his foot with a pinched face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, bud?\" Ray asked, passing Mikey the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey tilted the glass back and started gulping. Ray watched, bemused, as the kid drained the whole glass in eight long gulps before deciding he needed air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet hurt.\" Mikey whined slightly, leaning back on the couch. \"And my hands, and....\" he yawned, \"and I'm real tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ray patted Mikey's shoulder, feeling a bit out of his depth. \"Just...try and get some sleep, kay? You'll be better before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More milk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay quirked an eyebrow at the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure, Mikey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Dunno, but I'm still real thirsty, and milk just sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Ray got the kid a refill, which was downed just as fast. Mikey passed back out after that, face still scrunched with discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sat down at his little brother's side and turned on a movie. Feeling the kid wriggle a bit in his sleep, Ray scopped up his legs into his lap and started massaging Mikey's feet.  He heard Mikey giggle a bit at the touch before he worked out how not to tickle, then the kid let out a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay watched two movies before Mikey stirred again. The kid was <i>not</i> a quiet sleeper, snoring the whole time, and sometimes letting out a gurgle that Ray figured was him regretting downing a quart of milk in ten minutes (or half a gallon in two hours, or over a gallon in ten).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirmy too; the whole time Mikey tossed and turned, sometimes Ray felt the kid's joints pop as he rubbed Mikey's soles, but the always calmed back down after a minute or two of massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey stayed awake long enough to eat a large lunch and dinner on the couch, whatever had him sick not hurting his appetite, but the rest of the time just slept.  Ray left him to it in the evening, tossed the empty milk jug, and went upstairs to bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drifted off to sleep, one thought kept Ray awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if the formula made Mikey sick?<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bit of a rough night for Ray. Now that the formula was gone and the rage and feelings of despair had passed the intelligent teen was beset with horrible thoughts of the damage he might have done to his little brother. It was one thing to test chemicals on himself but Mikey had never agreed to such things; what if what he drank was hurting his insides, doing damage to his organs, harming his bones? Ray tossed and turned while in the other room Mikey slept like a log, arms and legs sprawled out, mouth wide open and snoring like a chainsaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Ray, having gotten almost no sleep, cracked his brother's bedroom door open slightly and peered inside. Mikey was still fast asleep, now on his front, hugging his pillow, a thin line of drool leaking onto it. Ray couldn't help but let out a little chuckle at the sight. Mikey could be a pain in the butt but that was natural for a kid, especially a little brother; it was just in their nature. He closed the door again and walked to the kitchen, pulling out a pan and grabbing some eggs from the fridge along with bacon and bread. He was in the middle of cooking breakfast when a loud crash came from upstairs. Ray's head jerked up at the ceiling and called out, \"Mikey! You okay up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeeeeah I just tripped.\" The younger male's voice drifted down from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay hesitated, not wanting to burn the food but also wanting to check on his brother. Luckily Mikey was quick and was soon bounding down the stairs, running over to his brother and hugging him around the middle. \"Morning Ray! Thanks for helping me out yesterday...you got any more milk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay ruffled Mikey's hair and said, \"Kid, you drank a full gallon yesterday, do you really think you need more milk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey stepped back and playfully flexed his arms. \"Milk does a body good! Just like the commercial! Plus it tastes really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shook his head and flipped the omelet he was making over. \"I haven't had the chance to get back to the store so you'll have to make due with water. Or juice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey groaned and said, \"Fiiiiiine, I guess orange juice is pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the fridge and grabbed the jug, setting in on the table before taking a seat, unscrewing the cap, and drinking straight from the jug! His throat bobbed as he took one, two, three strong gulps, his flat stomach pushing out slightly at the sudden rapid influx of liquid. He let out a satisfied sigh as he set the jug down, pushing it aside slightly as he watched Ray cook. \"Hey bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Ray asked, taking plates from the cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hands and feet have been feeling really weird since I woke up. Is that normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey knew Ray was extremely smart and often deferred to him in cases like this. Ray froze for a second before carefully answering, \"Kids your age often feel pain in their hands and feet and limbs and such when they're...growing. So if you're feeling a little sore it's perfectly normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was it? Sure it was normal for kids to experience growing pains and Mikey was just about at that age but Ray had to factor in the chemicals. Was this natural or something more? Ray scooped the omelet onto Mikey's plate, accompanied it with some crispy bacon and a slice of toast, setting it before his brother before making up his own plate. When he sat down, Mikey had already finished scarfing down his food, holding his plate up for more, a pleading look in his eyes. Ray sighed and made more food for his ravenous brother, the kid eating double his normal portions once again. \"I'm going to start running up a big grocery bill at this rate...\" Ray muttered before saying in a louder voice \"After breakfast I want to take a look at your hands and feet Mikey, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" He replied before chugging more juice. Over half a jug, gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce breakfast was over Mikey jumped to his feet, giggling as he saw his shirt was stretched slightly over a rounded belly. He patted it and poked it a bit, watching it vibrate slightly as the digestive process started kicking into high gear. \"Woah, guess I ate a lot.\" Mikey said in a carefree voice. \"I've been feeling really, REALLY hungry lately, guess I'm just--boooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaarp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words were cut off as a loud, long belch erupted from his wide open mouth, his hands pressing against his stomach as it shrank back down somewhat, the trapped air escaping from within him. He let out a few shorter blasts of air and sighed, rubbing his belly. \"Oh, uh...excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay patted his brother on the back and pushed him towards the living room. \"Just go sit on the couch, I'm going to get some tools from downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it bro!\" Mikey said, jumping onto the couch and kicking his feet up, grabbing the remote. Ray didn't take long gathering up a tape measure, a stethoscope, a blood pressure cuff, and a reflex hammer. Mikey was only complaining about his hands and feet but it couldn't hurt to give him a bit of an overall exam, just to make sure there wasn't any health irregularities. Ray walked into the living room as Mikey let out a little huff of frustration, holding the remote up. \"The buttons on this thing are really weird today! It's like they're in different places...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay raised an eyebrow and grabbed the remote, looking it over. \"No...it's the same as its always been. Are you feeling sick again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out and pressed his palm against his brother's forehead, Mikey pulling back and shaking his head. \"No, I'm not! Look!\" He grabbed the remote again and started pushing buttons. \"I'm trying to turn to channel 47 but I keep hitting five and one! Stupid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay watched his brother fiddle around, his thumb pressing multiple buttons at once, something that had never been an issue with Mikey before. Leave it to the kid to think the problem was with the remote and not his own hand. Ray firmly took it away from him again and crouched down at his side. \"Okay Mikey I'm going to run a few tests. Just relax and do exactly as I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit by bit, Ray ran the usual tests on his brother. Heart rate...normal. Blood pressure...normal. Reflexes...normal. Mikey was starting to get restless, kicking his legs slightly. He had said his hands and feet felt weird so why was Ray going through all this extra stuff? Finally, Ray picked up Mikey's left foot, running his fingers along the sole, squeezing slightly in places. \"Does that hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...kinda tickles though.\" Mikey said, wiggling his toes, joints audibly cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay pulled out a length of the tape measure and held it up against the side of Mikey's foot, writing down the measurements before moving up to Mikey's hands. He repeated the process (\"Does this hurt?\" \"Nope!\") before measuring them as well. Taking a deep breath, Ray compared the measurements he just took to the ones he had taken last time he had done this for Mikey. His eyes widened slightly, Mikey noticing his brother's silence. \"Is something wrong bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...not wrong. Just...surprising. Stand up please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey did as he was told, stumbling slightly, his feet tripping over themselves a bit. Ray measured Mikey's height, noting that it was, thus far, unchanged. \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaaaat?\" Mikey whined, stomping a little a bit as he swung his arms around. \"What's up? Why do my hands and feet feel so weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I'll show you.\" Ray said, walking to the front door and picking up one of Mikey's shoes. He instructed his brother to sit back down and held the shoe up to his bare foot. Mikey's eyes widened as he saw his toes peeking out fully from the tip of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooooah! My feet are bigger! Cool!\" He giggled as he wiggled his toes, curling them over his shoe, the appendage itself also slightly wider than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This explains why you've been so clumsy this morning.\" Ray said. \"Your hands  and feet are a bit bigger than normal...which is, in itself, normal. Usually the hands and feet grow bigger before a...uh...growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm gonna get a growth spurt? Sweet!\" Mikey said, pumping his fist, jumping up to his feet. \"Hold out your hand!\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay held up his hand and Mikey pressed his palm against his older brother's, comparing them. Much to Ray's chagrin, the tips of his little brother's fingers reached beyond his own. Mikey squeezed the hand with a grin, threading their fingers, pulling his brother down into a sitting position. \"Feet now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck out his feet and urged Ray to do the same, pressing sole to sole. Mikey's toes were fully over Ray's, the digits able to comfortably curl over and grip the older male's. \"My feet are bigger.\" Mikey said unnecessarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup...sure are...\" Ray said, resigning himself to whatever was to come. It wouldn't do any good to mope and whine so he was going to focus on dealing with whatever happened now. Even if Mikey was a brat he was his little brother and he had to look out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what to take care of first?</span></div></div>",

The kid was still adjusting to the new change; although watching him swing his arms and go up and down on tiptoes, Ray didn't think his brother minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his longer feet came a bigger difference in height; Mikey grinned cheekily as he got toe-to-toe with Ray and slowly crept up past eye level, looking down at his older brother, before relaxing until his heels hit the carpet. On his second lift he looked up curiously and stretched his arm as high as he could, giggling even though his longer splayed-out fingers were still over half a foot away from touching the eight foot ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shook his head at his brother's antics, prompting the brat to stick out his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, bigfoot, I think we should hit the mall for lunch, and do a bit of shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Mikey exclaimed, dropping awkwardly to his heels with a bit of arm-waving. \"Can we get some new games? Or...oh! We can go to the arcade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking groceries, since you decided to eat the whole week's worth of breakfasts in two days. Also, maybe some shoes.\" Ray answered dryly, cocking an eyebrow down at his once-again shorter brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey blushed a bit, and laughed, rubbing his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, that makes sense, right? I mean, I can't even borrow yours, so mine have gotta be....\" his eyes widened. \"Oh no! My favorite sandals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey was off like lightning, running at the stairs and scrambling up to his room with only one really loud crash. (\"I'm okay!\") When he came back down, he was walking even more awkwardly than usual and sporting some stupidly tiny footwear. Ray could see his toes touching the carpet over the fronts of those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's not going to work.\" Ray commented, easily slipping on his own footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was the biggest size they had!\" Mikey whined, glaring down at his feet with an almost betrayed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing a bit (maybe he were still a <i>little</i> peeved about the stolen formula), Ray ruffled his hair and corralled the kid into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them's the breaks, Shaq junior,\" Ray snarked as he took off for the nearest mall. \"Big feet, big shoes. And big shoes don't come with cartoon characters on 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey had a major pout going at that. But after a good minute, it seemed like a lightbulb clicked over his head. Glancing slyly to the side, he offered an evil grin and heaved a long fake sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can't wear these anymore.\" His teeth flashed. \"So, do <i>you</i> want 'em? I mean, your teeny, little feet should fit in these just fine. So, do you want some hand-me-downs, <i>little bro</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long, tense silence for a few miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truce?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out the brothers' first stop wasn't going to be a clothing store after all. After listening to gurgles and grumbles for the last few minutes, Ray made the executive decision to get his hobbit of a brother a second breakfast. So far, it looked like the kid was grabbing a large meal about every other hour, so he was definitely showing a \"hollow leg.\" Ray couldn't tell for sure, but he thought Mikey's cheeks looked a tiny bit rounder, weirdly making the tall kid look a bit younger. Thinking back though, he thought he'd gone through a phase like that too when he was eleven or twelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the closest shoe store, Mikey was pushed onto a bench near the kid's section and told sternly not to fidget. So while he drummed out increasingly random beats with his fingers, Ray held his foot still and pressed it onto one of the free nearby measuring tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Size...ten.\" Ray finally mumbled dully as he rose to his feet. Mikey bent over to peer at the lines and numbers as Ray walked past his own size eight section, skipped right past the nines, and grabbed a pair of slightly colorful sandals in a ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came back to Mikey swinging his feet and humming something from <i>The Grinch</i> with a big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey...why are you humming a Dr Seuss Christmas song?\" Ray asked has he plopped the much larger sandals down at his brother's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, his little brother grabbed one of his old sandals and slipped it <i>inside</i> the new one, showing that his shoes from yesterday could 'wear' his new shoes. Then, he pulled the old sandal out and flipped it over, showing the barely-readable '6 1/2' etched into the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I checked that, and it made me think of it.\" Mikey offered mysteriously, slipping on his new sandals as he tried wearing an old one on his <i>hand</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pair checked out, Ray turned them towards the local fresh market to pick up some food. Mikey strode alongside his older brother with less and less stumbling and more confidence. As the younger brother casually chucked his outgrown sandals into a nearby trash can, Ray heard him talk quietly to himself in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened last night? Well around here they say, that Mikey's big feet grew three sizes that day.\"<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The brothers entered the market, the glass doors sliding open silently as a blast of cold air rushed out to meet them. The air conditioning always seemed to be running full blast in here which was a welcome relief in the summer time. Mikey sighed happily for a moment before taking off full force down one of the aisles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey! Hey! Wait!\" Ray shouted, rather uselessly as Mikey paid him as much mind as a mouse squeaking. Ray grabbed a cart and quickly wheeled it down the aisle Mikey disappeared down, catching a glimpse of him as he was already at the other end, turning the corner and disappearing once again. Ray quickly gave chase, turning the corner so fast he almost ran straight into his younger brother who was examining a stack of chips; luckily, Mikey was ready, hand outstretched to easily stop his older brother and the cart in their tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want some of these!\" Mikey said with that infectious grin of his, grabbing a bag of chips and tossing it into the cart. \"Can I have more than one? Please? Pleeeeeeease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay bit his lower lip, thinking for a moment, before replying, \"Sure, you can...two. Just two though! We'll just...consider this a special treat since Mom and Dad are away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo! Special treat!\" Mikey shouted, tossing another bag into the cart before taking off again. \"Special treat! Special treat! Special treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay could hear the chanting no matter how far away Mikey got. He could feel his cheeks burning red as other patrons in the store gave him a curious look, eyebrows raised. Ray didn't say a word, turning the cart and following after his brother. \"Mikey, can you please, PLEASE just stay by me and the cart while we're in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey answered by tossing a box of cookies into the cart. \"Special treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shook his head and picked the cookies back up. \"No, no, the CHIPS were a special treat, you're not getting cookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey's stomach immediately rumbled loudly, as though the organ was aware of what it was missing out on and wasn't pleased in the slightest. Mikey rubbed his belly and turned those big puppy dog eyes on Ray. Despite how much his younger brother annoyed him, or even pissed him off, those eyes...they were like magic. Ray felt his will weakening as he threw up his hands. \"Fine! Fine, you can have them. Let's just go crazy I guess! You can pick out...I'll give you...how about you can choose ten things you want as a treat? That sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey crossed his arms and thought about it, making Ray feel slightly nervous. Mikey was a good kid but suppose he refused? He was already pretty strong for his age and judging by his hands and feet, his body would catch up to their size at some point...though Ray wasn't one hundred percent sure how soon that would be. When he was bigger...would he even listen to his little big brother? Ray was shaken from these thoughts as his younger brother piped up, \"Alright! Ten things! Does the stuff in the cart already count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Ray said firmly. \"So you can pick out seven more things you want. Just stick to the cart, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\" Mikey said nonchalantly, waving a hand as he grabbed onto the side of the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopping trip was, at least for the moment, calm again. The two brothers went up and down each aisle, picking up essentials: bread, veggies, meat, fruit, everything locally grown and extremely fresh, perfect for a growing boy. Mikey was quiet for about ten seconds before he started whimpering when Ray only picked up a few things. \"Bro, come on, get more than that. That's not going to be enough for me, even. Do you WANT to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay rolled his eyes and said, \"Believe it or not, I'm not just a machine that feeds you. I do intend to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get more!\" Mikey insisted, shaking the cart slightly. Ray was rattled; that shake was stronger than it should have been...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I'll get more then.\" Ray acquiesced. Two loaves of bread became four, one pound of sandwich meat became three, a liter of soda became two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These don't count as my special treats.\" Mikey was quick to point out, rubbing his mouth slightly as he began to drool at the prospect of all this food. Ray checked his watch. After the shoe store and by the time they were done shopping it would be time for another big meal. Unfortunately for Ray, while he was doing this, Mikey had taken off again, rushing back into view holding a gallon of ice cream in his hands. \"You didn't say I couldn't get a big thing as a special treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sighed as Mikey tossed the tub into the cart. This kid was smarter than he looked. Strength, looks, smarts...did this kid miss out on ANYTHING in life? Ray gave in to fate for the moment and just let Mikey run wild, gathering up his \"special treats\", a phrase that was starting to grate on Ray's nerves for how often Mikey was using it. Ice cream, cookies, chips, candy, Pop Tarts, doughnuts, the kid gravitated towards junk food like a moth to flame. \"Aren't you worried eating all this is going to make you fat?\" Ray asked as they headed to the checkout aisle, the cart nearly overflowing with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't get fat!\" Mikey said casually, his arms behind his head. \"I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay clucked his tongue and said, \"Well you're going to be eating good food before you can have any of this other crap, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuuuuuuure, sure, sure, litt--I mean...bro.\" Mikey grinned sheepishly as he remembered the truce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay didn't notice the slip of the tongue. He was too busy focusing on Mikey's midsection, a small band of tummy visible between the waistband of Mikey's shorts and the hem of the shirt. Even when Mikey raised his arms up to the ceiling and stretched his shirt didn't ride up enough to show off skin....did it? Was this normal? Did Mikey grow again? Ray was so absorbed in thinking about this, Mikey had to shove the cart forward. \"Bro, hey, wake up! It's our turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shook his head slightly, tossing things onto the conveyor belt mindlessly. He really had to stop treating every single instance of Mikey saying or doing anything as some kind of omen. He was making himself paranoid with all this. Ray ignored the looks the cashier gave him as he piled the food up, Mikey eyeing it all with hungry looks, his hand moving up to swipe away the drool from his lips every few minutes. \"Hey, hey Ray, can I have some chips in the car on the way home? Pleeeeeeeease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't spoil your appetite.\" Ray admonished, handing his credit card over to the cashier. Well...his parents card that they were letting him use, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think ANYTHING can spoil my appetite, I'm so hungry.\" Mikey whined, his belly letting out another rumbling grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, you are going to eat me out of house and home.\" Ray said, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sly grin came back to Mikey's face. \"Woah...that sounds kind of cool actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay loaded the bags of groceries back into the cart and wheeled it all back to the car. Mikey immediately jumped into the back seat and grabbed a bag of chips, popping it open and greedily stuffing them into his face, crumbs falling down around him. Ray watched him for a moment before loading the bags into the back of the car. \"This food is supposed to last us for at least a week, don't eat it all before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Challenge accepted...\" Mikey muttered to himself between munches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ray said, narrowing his eyes, not sure if he heard his brother correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Ray got the car parked, the crunching sounds had stopped. Ray was a bit relieved at that; sure he told Mikey he was allowed to snack, but the kid had just kept snacking and Ray had started to worry. Looking in the rear-view mirror, Ray saw Mikey had set the chip bag aside and was licking salt and crumbs off of his hands. He snorted a bit as he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, you had your snack. Now close the bag and put the rest away while I get the trunk open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest?\" Mikey tilted his head to the side and gave the bag next to him a quiet shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay blinked, then snatched the bag to peer inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was an extra-large family sized bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey grinned and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was supposed to be a snack <i>for the week</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey laughed sheepishly and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>told</i> you I was hungry,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sighed as he balled up the bag and trashed it, motioning Mikey to come around behind the car. Popping the trunk, Ray counted out all the bags and checked for spills; if the human vaccuum was going to eat all of it, he might as well carry it inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, kiddo,\" Ray said, pulling out a few bags. \"I'm not hungry yet anyway, so we'll have lunch-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grumble</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...now.\" Ray finished, passing bags to his brother with an incredulous expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Mikey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey just took the bags from both of Ray's hands and grabbed them all up in one of his. His knuckles popped quietly as he made a fist, but his arm didn't drop from the weight at all. He gave the bags a few slow lifts, and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say?\" He held his other hand out wide for more bags. \"I'm a growing boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay quietly grumbled a bit about stupid over-grown kids as he passed more and more bags into his brother's waiting hands. Mikey just kept grinning and refused to go inside until he was carrying so many bags that Ray not only wouldn't, but <i>couldn't</i> have tried it. At that point the brat slowly staggered (he <i>really</i> pushed it) inside. Ray grabbed the two small bags Mikey left for him to carry, closed the trunk, and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey was moving from one side of the kitchen to the other, putting things away as fast as he could. He stood on tiptoes in the pantry, pushing an extra-large box of potato flakes onto the highest shelf, shooting Ray a grin as he cheerfully ignored the folded stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" He grinned. \"How about we have some pizzas? You do the oven stuff, and I'll put everything away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that sounded a bit more like a demand than a suggestion, but Ray didn't really care what they ate, and Mikey was <i>under no circumstances</i> to use the oven, so whatever.  Ray walked over to the oven and found a stack of frozen pizzas left on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just cook 'em all!\" Mikey called out from inside a cupboard. \"We can play video games and snack for a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay wasn't sure all of the pizza would fit in the oven at once, but that did sound like the easiest solution. Besides, he didn't want to be stuck in the kitchen cooking all afternoon for the kid.  The <i>quick</i> kid, Ray amended, since by the time he'd unwrapped and started the pizzas, the food was almost all put away. Mikey was learning really fast how to best use those new flippers of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay set the timer, nodded, and turned to find Mikey holding the last of the groceries, a gallon milk jug, with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't fit,\" Mikey offered as an explanation. \"The fridge is <i>stuffed</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\" Ray answered, pulling the door and double-checking. (Smart yes, but organized Mikey was not.) Nope, fridge really was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey looked at the fridge, at his brother, decided the milk really wasn't going in that fridge, shrugged, pulled off the cap, and drank down five long gulps straight from the jug. Seeing Ray's slightly freaked-out look, Mikey shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's not going in there, I'm still hungry, milk is <i>awesome</i>, and I can just drink it while we play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay didn't have an answer for that, so the two brothers headed into the living room, the (slightly) shorter one holding a gallon jug a bit like it was an over-sized coffee cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooting up their game system, Ray tossed a controller at his little brother, smirking as he fumbled it a bit. What followed was a massacre of epic proportions; Mikey could <i>not</i> hit the buttons right. For the next few hours, the two brothers just hung out, snagging pizzas and playing video games. Ray couldn't help grinning as he watched Mikey glare a bit at the screen, his tongue poking out in concentration, and his fingers flailing around the buttons. Sometimes Mikey would take a break, getting up to rub his legs and arms and walk around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Ray had maybe half a pizza. Mikey destroyed the rest, along with the milk jug. At one point Ray could actually hear a sloshing, gurgling sound as the kid paced in front of the couch. Mikey huffed a bit in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay felt kind of bad; it was almost like taking advantage of the poor kid to play video games when he wasn't used to his own fingers. Setting the controller aside, he gave his brother a poke, startling a laugh out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna do something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey nodded, eyes lighting up as he slid down next to the coffee table and propped up an arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay groaned. \"Something other than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Ray!\" his younger brother whined. \"You asked me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay grumbled a bit, but hunkered down and let Mikey wrap his fingers around the outside of his own hand.  After an intense stare-off, both brothers began pushing hard against the other, their joined fist swinging back and forth. Slowly, their hands started moving toward's Mikey's side of the table. Mikey's eyes widened, and a surprisingly large bicep popped out as he made a big sudden push, forcing Ray on the defensive. Ray kept their arms even for a long time; even if he'd had a super disappointing puberty so far, Ray had still had one, and his arm was about as thick as Mikey's. In the end though, the difference was that Ray's arm was thick, but Mikey's was <i>muscular</i>. After a long struggle, Ray felt his smaller hand get crushed against the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey grinned at his brother with a hint of pride as he got back up. Ray frowned as he saw his little brother wince and massage his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Mikey?\" Ray asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Mikey answered vaguely,  rubbing along his legs. \"Maybe I sat too much, I think I'm getting a cramp. And, well, it's weird, ya'know? I mean, it's <i>cool</i>, but my hands and feet got really, <i>really</i> big.  Maybe it's all the milk? Like, how it 'does a body good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey giggled a bit. \"What if all those dumb sayings were true, right? Like, eating veggies really made you big and strong, or...or....a pinch to grow an inch, and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey reached over and pinched Ray's arm, laughing. Ray winced, that had hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out.\" Ray gave his brother a light shove. Mikey pinwheeled his arms and fell back onto the couch, but he just grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's true!\" Mikey insisted. \"It's like...It's like something was <i>pinching</i> my hands and my feet yesterday, and then they really <i>did</i> grow an inch! And now, it feels like I've got pinching all over in my legs and in my arms, which kinda hurts, but what if it's the <i>same</i>? And all the milk I'm drinking, and - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey's eyes shot open and he jumped off the couch, bare feet slapping onto the floor as he tore off to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta eat more vegetables!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay stared after his brother, only one thought on his mind as he put away the game system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you <i>still eat</i>?\"<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ray, somewhat bemused, watched Mikey rush into the kitchen, following along behind him as his younger brother opened the fridge and grabbed a bunch of vegetables; carrots and celery specifically. He carried the armload over to the table and dropped it there, sitting down and picking a carrot up. He sniffed it before gingerly nibbling the very tip of it. He pulled a face and muttered, \"Gross...but if it helps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit into it with gusto, chewing the carrot up and swallowing it before taking another big bite, his other hand reaching to grab a stalk of celery which he also began to munch on, one after the other. Ray watched for a bit before sitting down opposite Mikey, the kid swallowing a particularly big mouthful of vegetable before asking, \"Hey you think if I eat more meat I'll get stronger, too? That's what makes muscles bigger, right? Exercise and...uh...protein! Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye...n....I don't know.\" Ray admitted. It was entirely possible that Mikey eating and drinking all of these things was having some kind of effect on his growth. After all, the drink Ray developed had been meant to specifically stimulate the pituitary gland which promoted natural and healthy growth. Was the formula having an effect on other aspects of Mikey's body? He would never know for sure without an in depth study and that wasn't exactly forthcoming...until he told Mikey about what the drink actually was and what it was doing to him. Ray wasn't quite ready to take that step though; at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can't hurt to try!\" Mikey laughed, chowing down on the vegetables again. The pile began to dwindle, bit by bit, until almost all the celery and carrots had been eaten, Mikey letting out a resounding burp before patting his stomach in satisfaction. \"You know...those actually started to taste good after awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shook his head slightly and said, \"Weeeeell probably because your tastes are changing a bit from when you were younger. You still almost wiped out half a weeks worth of veggies though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay got to his feet and started picking up the leftover vegetables, putting them back in the fridge before scooping up the discarded ends that Mikey hadn't eaten and tossing them in the garbage. Mikey watched all this through half closed eyes, his arms and legs feeling oddly heavy while his stomach churned away at all the pizza, milk, and vegetables he had just consumed. He winced slightly and stretched his legs out, joints cracking slightly as he did so. He wiggled his toes, clenching them as well, each joint popping like a series of firecrackers, getting Ray's attention. He watched closely as Mikey stretched his legs out...and out...and out some more! His eyes widened as he saw his little brother's legs seem to catch up to his feet, moving one kitchen tile over...then two...and then a third! Mikey chuckled slightly, eyes closed, loving how GOOD it felt to just streeeeetch out. He lifted his arms up over his head and stretched up, fingers cracking, elbows popping, the limbs lengthening before Ray's astonished eyes. There was no denying it now; Mikey was definitely GROWING, though the pace seemed...erratic. His hands and feet had grown larger first, overnight, and his arms and legs were now only just catching up...though it hadn't taken a full day like with Mikey's hands and feet. Was the process slowly escalating or was this what was going to always happen? Feet, then limbs...and then presumably torso and head? There were far, far too many unanswered questions and Ray was working against all his experiments, which had been performed on animals post puberty and never on one before or during.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ray pondered, Mikey finished his stretch with a loud yawn, letting his arms flop back down on the table with an attention drawing BANG! Ray jumped slightly and Mikey snickered, rubbing his eyes. \"Spooked ya bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little...\" Ray admitted, wondering how aware his tired brother was of his transformation. \"You...feeling tired Mikey? Want to go to bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, not sure...\" Mikey admitted, scratching his cheek and standing up...and up...and up! Ray's eyes followed Mikey's face as it started out below him....met his gaze...then surpassed it! Ray's jaw dropped open as he realized his worst nightmare had come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis little brother was TALLER than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't by a huge margin; Mikey was just a head taller and Ray was already short for his age to begin with but still...the balance had shifted once and for all. Ray's eyes traveled up and down his brother's body, taking it all in. His shirt, oddly enough still fit rather well beyond the slight broadening of his shoulders, the sleeves now far too short for Mikey's lengthened limbs. His shorts were similarly problematic, the hems, which had once covered his knees, now wrapped more tightly around his thighs. Overall he had a more lanky build now, his tight, fit body lost for now in a more stretched out look. It wasn't unnatural looking, he just had more the look of a basketball player now rather than a football player...for now. Everything was bound to catch up soon after this most recent spurt...or was this all one very long, ongoing spurt? Ray was getting frustrated by how many questions he had to keep asking himself, his eyes rising to meet Mikey's...who was looking down at him with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mikey...now hold on a second...don't get TOO excited!\" Ray warned, backing away slightly as Mikey leaped into the air, hollering with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy moley! Look at me! I'm big! I'm really big! It worked, it really did!\" Mikey cheered, flexing his arms, bending his legs, gazing proudly around the kitchen, marveling at how everything seemed smaller and lower to him now. He grinned at Ray and said, \"Now I guess you really ARE my little bro, little bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I thought we had a truce...\" Ray said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that was before!\" Mikey said firmly, nodding. \"Back when you really were bigger and it was just a joke, me calling you that. But it's not a joke anymore! Now you are the littler brother! So I'm going to call you little bro! And you...you can call me...big bro! Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay did not like how excited Mikey was by this prospect, his chest heaving as he breathed more rapidly. \"I...don't think so. I'm still your older brother and...I'm not going to call you big bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Wanna bet?\" Mikey asked smugly, puffing his chest out and standing up a little taller, looking down at his brother. \"How about we play a game for it? If I win, I'll call you little bro and you'll call me big bro. And if you win, I'll still call you big bro and you can still call me little bro, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay knew this tone, this posture. Mikey was testing his boundaries. If Ray gave in and played and lost he would no doubt lose a lot of authority in Mikey's eyes. If he backed down, however, Mikey would still consider it his loss, calling him afraid. The only winning move was for Ray to except and actually beat his brother. \"Alright...fine. What game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey grabbed Ray's hand and dragged him into the living room, pushing aside the couch and love seat with a grunt, kicking the coffee table down the length of the room to clear a space in the center of the carpet. He grabbed a few couch pillows and tossed them haphazardly around in a circle before squatting down at one end of it. \"Wrestling! First to get pinned for three seconds or get knocked out of bounds loses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sighed, already regretting this decision, and took his place opposite Mikey. \"On the count of three then...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...\" Mikey started, a grin already curling the edges of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two...\" Ray said, gulping nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THREE!\" Both brothers shouted, charging forward and locking their arms around each other.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ray figured out really fast that he was <i>not</i> winning a contest of strength with his lit...younger brother. Mikey had always been strong for his age, and even if he looked a bit gangly right now that muscle was still there. As Ray wrapped his arms around Mikey's middle and pressed his shoulder into the big kid's chest, Mikey just laughed as his feet skidded back a few inches. Before Ray really knew what was happening Mikey had wrapped his hands around the older boy's waist and picked him up off of the floor! The room spun around as Mikey flipped Ray over and slammed his back into the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that saved Ray from a fast and humiliating defeat was that instead of pressing his advantage Mikey released his grip and raised up a leg to try and step on his older brother's chest. Ray gulped and rolled quickly to the side as Mikey let out a playful roar and brought his big foot down with a loud <i>thump</i>. He couldn't help feeling relieved as he saw his brother clearly fooling around and not seriously trying to hurt him; Mikey might be pushing his boundaries but at least he was still just a kid who wanted to play. As Mikey wobbled a bit on his longer legs, Ray got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his arms in tight, Ray continued his roll along the ground, careful to keep an eye on his brother looming above him and at the pillows he was just about to reach. Mikey, laughing at how easy it was to shove his older brother around now, continued taking big exaggerated stomps as he chased after his smaller older sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last moment, on the very edge of the ring, Ray struck. He knew he'd only get one shot. As his brother took another awkward, exaggerated Godzilla stomp, Ray spun, kicking at Mikey's only grounded leg and threw his arm up as high as he could. Mikey's eyes widened in surprise as he was put badly out of balance. His mind would need time to adjust to his longer limbs, and per Ray's plan, his much higher center of mass. Add to that the brat had been hamming it up and had thrown his big foot forward to stomp his older brother, and Mikey began to tip toward the pillows. Ray's outstretched hand could barely hit his taller brother in the back as he tipped, but that little bit of extra push sent his younger sibling tumbling out of the ring in an awkward tangle of long limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Mikey gasped as he rolled to a stop and started working out where his hands and feet where. Pouting, the younger brother scrambled to his feet and crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a rematch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm....no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Mikey,\" Ray answered, getting up quickly so Mikey wasn't looking down on him as much. He puffed up as much as he could and dropped his voice; a trick his younger brother couldn't pull yet, and tried to put authority into his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I played the game with you like you wanted; you made the rules. Or are you going to punk out like a little kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey frowned for a second, but after a moment he gave a toothy grin and laughed. He quickstepped over to his older brother and picked him up again, though this time in a tight hug. Ray had mixed feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. Sorry I was being a jerk. And wow! I didn't think you'd win, being so little and all!\" Mikey looked at his brother with admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me being normal and you being big?\" Ray asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey set his brother down quickly and waved his hands, eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I didn't mean you were little, um, it's just that <i>everything</i> looks littler now, and, I mean -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, brat,\" Ray sighed. \"And I wouldn't have beaten you if I didn't know some stuff about dealing with bigger guys, so it's...sort of fair to say it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whadda you mean? Do other kids try to stomp on you?\" Mikey actually growled a little at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay quickly shook his head and started picking up the pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Mikey, really. Just some arguments, school crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey still looked upset as he easily slid the furniture back into place.  Ray searched for a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mikey, how about we go the the park before it gets dark. We can shoot hoops or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey paused, before grinning again and eyeing the ceiling. A few seconds later, the goof was giggling as he flexed on his tiptoes, his hands splayed wide, and flat, along the ceiling. Dropping to his heels, Mikey gave Ray a cheeky grin before rushing off to get his sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun, 'big bro.\" Okay, sure the jerk said it, but Ray could <i>hear</i> those air quotes. \"Let me know if you want a piggy-back ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay scowled a bit as he slipped on his shoes and his brother tried to ruffle his hair.  Locking up, he very much did <i>not</i> respond to the offer of a piggy back ride; he merely trailed along, letting his younger brother get used to his longer stride, making the brat double back if he got too far ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the punk was listening for now. Though Ray didn't know how long that would last. After all, he'd seen how fast the kid just grew, and he had a bad feeling Mikey wasn't finished yet.  After all, while his limbs had stretched out, Ray knew how growth spurts worked and the kid's torso hadn't caught up yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Ray had bent down to tie his shoes, he'd seen Mikeys' toes poking out the front of his new sandals.<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The park was relatively close to the boy's house; it was a location they had often frequented growing up, playing on the playground when they were really young and moving up to the basketball court as they got older. Mikey had fond memories of playing with his bro there but they were tempered with memories of sadness when Ray suddenly...stopped coming to the park to play with him. He didn't understand why it happened, how Ray had felt increasingly inferior, how Mikey's jabs dug a little too deep for him sometimes, how the cruel taunts at school played with his mind. It was all a bit too complicated for a kid but now, now Ray was actually coming to PLAY with him again! He wasn't going to let anyone or anything get in the way of them having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey was practically vibrating with energy as excitement as he moved forward, then doubled back, then moved forward again, then looped back around Ray. It was like walking with an energetic puppy in human form. Once the park was in sight Mikey broke out in a full sprint, heading straight for the basketball court which was, thankfully, empty. Ray walked at a more leisurely pace, scanning the park. The whole thing was pretty much empty, save for a scattering of little kids playing around on the slide. Ray watched as they moved from slide to teeter totter to swings, smiling slightly as he remembered Mikey and him playing in the same way. \"If only things had stayed that way.\" Ray mumbled to himself, heading over to the court. But why hadn't it stayed that way? What had happened? The more Ray thought about it the more uncomfortably he realized that, well, he had just...stopped playing with Mikey. And why? Because he grew? How was THAT fair? Ray shook his head slightly and pushed the thoughts from his mind. \"Worry about that later just...lets focus on getting through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park, in order to encourage more visitors to come by, had various sports equipment that could be checked out for free from a little shed on the premises. By the time Ray got to the court Mikey had already gotten a basketball and was dribbling it. He jumped up slightly and shot the ball, the orange sphere moving in a perfect arc before cleanly entering the hoop. \"So, what do you wanna play?\" Mikey asked with a grin, chasing after the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horse?\" Ray asked meekly, feeling a bit intimidated by how fast and fierce Mikey was moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, that's not much fun though. Let's play one on one! Come on, please? Just a few rounds? Until ten baskets?\" Mikey pleaded, pouting out that lower lip. Mikey may have been big but he wasn't afraid to turn those big old eyes onto his brother if it got him what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\" Ray acquiesced, feeling increasingly uncomfortable. It was one thing to possibly lose against Mikey in private but in public? He looked around once more, making absolutely sure nobody was around before holding his hands out. \"Check it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey beamed as he bounced the ball towards Ray, the older brother bouncing it right back. The second the ball touched Mikey's hands he was off like lightning, dribbling and moving around the court with reckless zeal. Ray shadowed his brother as best he could, holding his arms out, managing to keep up with Mikey's movements due to their clumsiness; the kid still hadn't quite gotten used to his longer limbs but he was a fast learner. Ray was able to keep up for a few minutes before Mikey pivoted and jumped, tipping the ball into the basket. \"Yes! One for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay grabbed the ball and said, \"Don't get too cocky, that's just one point! You got nine more to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked the ball and dashed to the left, stopping short on his foot before pushing in the opposite direction, moving his arms to try and goad Mikey with a feint. Mikey, trying to move in two directions at once, ended up twisting his legs around each other, his feet stumbling, sending him to the ground. \"Ouch! Hey! No pushing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay, with a bit of effort, managed to make a basket. \"Not my fault you can't control that big body of yours yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey scrambled to his feet and said, \"Enjoy that point cause it's gonna be your last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words were hammy and exaggerated and he followed up this declaration with a hearty \"Ha, ha, ha!\" Ray couldn't help but smile at his goofy brother as they squared off again. Back and forth, the brothers were evenly matched for the first five points but the more they played, the more Mikey's athletic prowess, physique, and growing control over his own body started to edge out Ray. By the end of the hour they were 6-9, Mikey's favor. Ray panted as he bent over, his hands on his knees, his shirt soaked with sweat. Mikey, who was also sweating, was upright, the ball tucked under his arm, pratically glowing with vitality as he grinned. \"You doing okay big bro? We're at the end here! Game point! Think you can stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tone was still playful but Ray couldn't help but feel those old resentments bubbling up again. \"Whatever...lets just get this over with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey's grin faltered slightly, transferring the ball to his hands. \"Sure...don't give up now! You can still win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's hand were shaking slightly as checked the ball, Mikey pressing hard to the basket. Ray planted his feet, trying to block his brother but his tiredness mixed with Mikey's energy finally collided in a bad way. Mikey barreled right through Ray, knocking him to the ground, winding him as Mikey jumped for the basket and actually managed to dunk it. \"Woohoo! Did you see that, bro?! I dunked it! I can't believe it! That was SO COOL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay gasped a little and sat up, holding his stomach. \"Yeah...great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I hurt you?\" Mikey asked, bending down and holding his hand out to help his brother up. \"I'm sorry I just got so excited and....did you see it? Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ALL saw it, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay groaned as he slowly got to his feet, pushing Mikey's hand away. How could this situation possibly get any worse? Ray saw a trio of teens his age step onto the court. \"How long have you been standing there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of the game, shorty.\" The boy in the middle said, grinning. How different of a grin it was from Mikey's, filled with amused cruelty. \"So it's true, you're not just a pathetic loser in school, you're also a pathetic loser on your free time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey frowned, stepping forward slightly, holding his arm out in front of Ray. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey, don't.\" Ray warned, pushing his brother's arm out of the way. He didn't want Mikey getting involved with this jerk...but he also didn't want to be protected by his little brother either. Sean was bad news, your typical jerk jock who had more muscle than brains and a mean streak a mile wide. The self proclaimed king of the school had little time or patience for the smaller, weaker inhabitants of his kingdom and he wasn't afraid to show it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to your little brother, kid.\" Sean smirked, flexing his arm, an impressive bicep popping up. \"Unless you want to get creamed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just a kid, leave him alone.\" Ray muttered, clenching his hands into fists. The two on either side of Sean were his friends, Steve and Jake. Both as dumb and mean as Sean, just not as talented on the football field. Teens of few words, they preferred to let their fists do the talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If all you guys are going to do is be mean you can just go away.\" Mikey said, puffing his chest out, standing his ground. The older teens laughed at his posturing, Sean walking up to the kid and giving him a shove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off, you little shit. We're not done playing with your brother.\" He said, his voice low and dangerous. Mikey stumbled back slightly and glared at Sean, stepping right back up and shoving him, hard. Out of shock more than anything, Sean stumbled back slightly, eyes wide. The kid was...stronger than he looked but that didn't matter. The bully clenched his hand into a fist and raised it, grabbing Mikey by the collar and lifting him up off his feet. Mikey was big compared to Ray but that didn't mean much when put against a group of boys who were also big for their age. Mikey struggled, kicking his legs, his toes connecting with Sean's shin with surprising force. Sean winced and shoved Mikey back, sending the kid to the ground. \"Stay down if you know what's good for you, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean turned his back on Mikey and cracked his knuckles. \"Since your brother was just SO rude to us, I think I'm going to take it out on you, shrimp. Hold him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Jake moved fast, grabbing Ray by his arms, holding him in place. Sean wasted no time, pulling his arm back and punching Ray in the gut. The first blow would have been enough to send him to the ground if he wasn't being held up. Before the second punch could come, however, Mikey was back on his feet, leaping onto Sean's back and wrapping his arms around the bully's neck, squeezing and trying to pull him back. \"You...nngh...little brat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey was tossed to the side like a rag doll but almost immediately sprang back up, aiming a kick directly at Sean's crotch, his foot connecting fiercely. Sean wheezed and fell to his knees, face turning red, mouth working wordlessly. Steve and Jake immediately dropped Ray and went to try and help their friend, Mikey grabbing Ray and tossing him over his shoulder, running back to their house. Ray, in shock, watched as the bullies seemed to shrink into the distance, the only sounds he could hear was the blood rushing in his ears and his younger brother's panting breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth brothers were silent as they arrived back home, breathing hard, neither one looking at each other. Mikey's heart was pounding; he wasn't sure how Ray was going to react.</span></div></div>",

He turned to Mikey and looked into his eyes. The boy's eyes reflected fear and despair. Ray understood that his younger brother was worried about how he would react to what had happened. He didn't want to hurt his little brother. So far, he has been very jealous of him and has neglected their relationship. Now he understood how much Mikey admired him. Maybe a little too much. And it\u2019s not Mikey\u2019s fault that he\u2019s always been much taller than his contemporaries. And his current height can only be made by Ray\"s own irresponsibility.<br>\r\n\"Well, that situation could have been a lot worse.\" He smiled at Mikey. \"But next time, don't attack a team of teens alone.\" He says laughing.<br>\r\nMikey's eyes lit up with joy and his heart calmed down. \"Ray doesn't hate me.\" He thought happily.<br>\r\n\"Okay, next time we'll run away instantly.\" He answered Ray.<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" Ray nodded. \"Because it was very tiring for me to get revenge if you got in trouble.\"<br>\r\n\u201cWould you take revenge on me?\u201d Mikey wondered.<br>\r\n\"Sure. You're my little brother. It's my job to take care of you and protect you.\" Ray replied emphatically. Then he hugged his brother.<br>\r\nMikey hadn't heard such words from his brother in a long time. Sometimes he already thought Ray didn't like him. He knew himself to be bubbly and sometimes annoying and with that sometimes annoying his brother. Many times he tried to behave differently but when he was near Ray this side of him broke out again. He always loved and admired his brother. He is so calm and smart. He understood everything. And now Ray hugged him. Mikey was incredibly happy and promised himself to do everything he could to make Ray happy. \"And growing up at any height, I'll always call him 'big brother'. And not just because he won the bet.\" Mikey promise to himself.<br>\r\nThey went into the house. Ray took off his shoes. Mikey sat down to take off his sandal.<br>\r\n\"Look, bro!\" He shouted suddenly and raised his sandal feet in front of Ray's face. \"My toes hang a little off the sandals.\" And to prove it he wiggled his toes.<br>\r\n\"Did you just notice?\" Ray asked indifferently.<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" And he laid his foot on the floor. \"This is normal?\"<br>\r\n\"You do not like it?\" Ray asked back.<br>\r\n\"I like it. Just look how long they are.\" Mikey replied.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to play with me, Bigfoot?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeeeeeees!\"<br>\r\nRay followed his brother into his room. \"Well the serum looks like it works and my brother likes it. Maybe I'll start doing one for myself too. But now I'm just having fun with my big little brother.\" He thought</span></div></div>",

The larger boy winced a bit as the door clicked shut; those older kids had tossed him around really hard, and now it was starting to hurt. He rolled his shoulders a bit, and sighed as his back gave a satisfying <b>pop</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay slowly walked down the hall, his fists clenching as he fought through a hundred confusing thoughts and feelings. He was so <i>mad</i>, at Sean, at Mikey, at...at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT!\" Ray howled, punching the wall. His fist broke through the drywall with a loud smacking sound, the gritty material scraped at his hands; damage from the only punch he'd managed to throw, after being saved by his little brother. God, he was so pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ray!\" Mikey cried out, alarmed, and stared at the damaged wall.

But then, something steeled in his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few short moments, Mikey easily cleared the distance and scooped his brother back into his arms, gripping him in a careful, but very firm hug. Ray started kicking his feet, dangling several inches above the ground, into his brother's shins, and pounded with his fists into Mikey's back as he felt the bigger boy's arms around his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said to put me down, Mikey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Mikey answered stubbornly as he carried Ray into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay kept squirming the whole way, shouting and teaching Mikey a lot of interesting new words, but the younger sibling had an iron grip on him. Eventually, Ray just got tired. His whole body sagged, limp in his brother's arms, and the older boy barely managed to hold in a whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair.\" Ray whispered, hating how weak he sounded. How weak he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to keep breaking the house?\" Mikey asked, trying for gentle but a bit too freaked out to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Ray sighed.  \"I'll let you do that when you're fifty feet tall next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey dropped Ray, half in relief that his brother calmed down, half in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be dumb.\" Mikey offered a weak laugh, falling back to fill up the nearby recliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay just shrugged. That probably was an exaggeration, but he didn't feel like being calm and sensible right now. Besides, for all he knew about Mikey and that stupid drink, it really would do that. Already, Ray could see Mikey's stomach easily as his shirt rode up, the kid's torso was stretching out as he wriggled into his chair and Ray didn't think he'd even noticed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no winning this for me, you know?\" Ray sat down on the floor and started tracing circles in the carpet. \"I'm not...mad at you Mikey. I'm...I mean, I'm really proud of you. You're really talented, and brave, and strong. But...but fighting those jerks at the park isn't going to <i>help</i> me, Mikey. I'm either the loser who can't stand up to Sean, or I'm the loser who got saved by his kid brother. I'm not <i>supposed</i> to need your help like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay glanced up, feeling really small weak, and saw his brother looking down on him with a confused expression. Mikey leaned forward in his chair, biting his lip as he tried to figure out what Ray meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" Mikey finally admitted as he frowned and tried to tug his shirt back into place. \"I couldn't let them hurt you. I wanted to help. Why does it matter if I'm younger than you if I can help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shrugged and tried to meet his brother's questioning gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right; it shouldn't matter. But it <i>does</i> matter. Big brothers are supposed to look out for their little brothers. I'm supposed to take care of you. I should be able to stand up for myself, and take care of myself. But I'm not strong enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay froze, staring up at his brother in shock. Mikey nodded, and hopped to his feet. From down on the floor, Mikey seemed to tower above Ray in his undersized clothes, and the older boy waited, confused, as the younger looked down with a determined smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I should get all this extra help, and have you look out for me, and you get <i>nothing</i>?\" Mikey shook his head. \"You're right, that's <i>not</i> fair. You're taking care of the house, making sure I don't get in trouble while mom and dad are gone. Let me help you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey plopped down with a loud <i>thump</i>, and reached forward to swallow Ray's hands up in his own larger ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my big brother. You're always helping me! But you shouldn't have to fight those bullies alone! I'm stronger than you are, Ray; please, just when you need me, can you let <i>me</i> be the big brother and help <i>you</i>?\"<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Faced with the sincere and pure feelings of his younger brother, Ray couldn't stand it any longer. He dropped his eyes and mumbled, \"Mikey...your growth isn't...I mean...it's not normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey, surprised by the sudden change of topic, said, \"Uh...I know? I'm not as smart as you but I'm not a dummy either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled slightly but Ray pulled his hands free of his brother's grip and held them in turn, looking up with a serious gleam in his eye. \"Remember that drink I got so mad at you for drinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm.\" Mikey nodded, his mind already slowly starting to make the necessary links.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it was something I devised myself. It was supposed to stimulate my pituitary gland to help me get...taller. And stronger. But it needed time to settle and that's why it was in the fridge and then...you drank it.\" Ray explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...so that's why I'm suddenly getting so big so fast...\" Mikey said, eyes widening as his mouth opened slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly...but I'm not quite sure how much you'll grow. The formula was never intended to be taken by somebody prepubescent and you were already, genetically speaking, well on your way to getting big naturally so the effects on you might be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intense?\" Mikey finished, heart thumping loudly in his chest, mouth dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good word for it.\" Ray sighed, closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...you didn't think maybe it would be smart to label it? Or even tell me about it?\" Mikey said, laughing incredulously. \"I mean...I guess I just drank it without thinking too but...but...this is so wild! I don't...I'm not sure....I mean, what should I be thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran a hand through his hair and tugged absently at his shirt. \"I never signed up for any of this...but...it's just a lot to take in and I'm not really sure how much I understand, exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay, having never considered how his brother might feel in all of this, a fact that brought about a pang of guilt in his chest, hastily moved to reassure his brother. \"Well how about you let me run some tests on you? I can probably estimate the effects the formula will have on you and we'll have a better idea of how much you'll grow. It might be less extreme than I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How extreme were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Remember my comment earlier about you being fifty feet tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey flopped onto his back, staring at the ceiling, mind trying to process this information. \"That's so...HUGE! Like...bigger than a house, normal people being like toys, ENORMOUS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay walked over to his brother's side and sat down next to him, his hand resting on his younger brother's exposed stomach, rubbing it gently. Mikey's introspective frown turned to a snorting giggle, his body shaking slightly as he forced himself to sit up, scrunching forward, trapping Ray's hand and stopping his movement. \"H-Hey, don't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay smiled slightly and said, \"Lets try to not freak out about all this until we know exactly what we're dealing with...deal? And from now on I'll be more...honest with you about these kinds of things. Does that sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Mikey said, letting Ray's hand go before enveloping him in a bone crunching hug. \"I love you Ray, you know that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do...\" Ray said, awkwardly patting his brother on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...if I DO get to be that big...and those jerks bully you again...can I just step on your school?\" Mikey asked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, before grabbing me and going all King Kong in downtown?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, ooh!\" Mikey let out a monkey like grunt, pounding his chest and jumping to his feet. \"Yeah! But this time, when all those planes fly by I'll just swat 'em down and be all like \"Raaaaaar you dumb army dudes\"!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay chuckled as he watched Mikey stomp around in his now too small clothes, shaking the house. A weight had been lifted off his shoulders now that he had fully come clean to Mikey about the formula. Somehow, it eased the anxiety he had been feeling for the past few days now...though perhaps some of that easing had come from how quickly and willingly Mikey had offered to be his helper and protector. Why had he been so convinced that his little...younger...brother would only tease and ridicule him, making him feel small and weak? Just because the world treated him that way and Mikey liked to tease, as did all brothers, it didn't mean his kid brother would follow suit. It would take a little getting used to (these kinds of feelings didn't just disappear overnight after all) but maybe he could get used to having a giant protector...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted as Mikey crashed to the floor, staring intently at Ray. \"So...when did you want to run those tests? I guess right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be smartest to get them done as soon as possible, yes...\" Ray said, thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey sighed, loudly, and said, \"Yeah, I thought you'd say that...but we did a whole bunch of tests this morning already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey's voice held a slight whine as he said this, his eyes turning up toward the ceiling. Ray pondered for a moment before shrugging. \"Alright, it couldn't hurt to postpone them for just a day...first thing tomorrow morning we'll get it done, how does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Mikey shouted, lifting his arms up in triumph, a loud ripping sound filling the air as his shirt tore down the sides. \"...Ooops...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey rose to his feet, looking himself over. He was quite a sight; his shirt was now ripped, the hem reaching just to the bottom of his chest, while his shorts now were hugging his hips so tightly they looked more like underwear, his long limbs looking thicker, his torso, the same. His proportions seemed to have been catching up with him even as his overall body size increased. The spurts seemed to be evening out, the operative word being \"seemed\". Mikey, fascinated, touched himself all over, the pinching hurt of the growth not nearly as pronounced as it had been earlier in the morning, his body acclimatizing to the changes. He tentatively reached a hand up and pressed his palm flat against the ceiling, without having to stand up on his tip toes at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool~\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mikey didn't spend long pressing the ceiling before his mouth opened in a jaw-splitting yawn. Ray could sympathize. It'd been a long day, and he felt physically and emotionally drained. Maybe it was best to put off any more revelations until morning. Holding back a yawn himself, the older brother took the younger by the hand and helped him to stumble up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Ray?\" Mikey asked sleepily as he tugged his shirt over his head. \"What am I supposed to do for pajamas? I mean... I don't wanna sleep, \"the younger boy looked around shiftily before blushing and whispering \"<i>naked</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay blinked, before taking in his squirming, embarrassed brother. Clothing <i>was</i> kind of an issue, and it wasn't like anything Ray owned was going to help here; he hadn't been that much bigger than Mikey to begin with, so even his baggiest spare clothes would be too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....hold on. I'll be right back.\" Ray hustled down the hall and rifled through his parent's drawers. He was pretty sure Mikey was taller than their dad by now, but he didn't think the kid's waist had gotten that much wider.  Indeed, when he brought over some clothes, Mikey looked down wide-eyed as he tried to tug the t-shirt down to his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is dad's shirt too <i>short</i>?\" Mikey asked in shock. Apparently the idea of outgrowing people besides Ray hadn't really occurred to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay passed over a pair of boxers as Mikey tried wrapping his head around the concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, at least it mostly fits; these boxers should be fine too. You can sleep in those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey bit his lip, considering the slightly undersized clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ray, if I really <i>do</i> get fifty feet tall, what am I supposed to wear? Where would I sleep?\" The poor kid was starting to look a bit worried about his growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sighed. It was a fair thing to worry about, but the kid needed sleep. They both did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk about it in the morning.\" Ray offered, ruffling Mikey's hair. It seemed to help calm the younger boy down, especially since while sitting on his bed Mikey's eye level was a bit lower than Ray's. The older brother supposed that his over-sized kid brother really did still need him to take care of him after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Mikey offered sleepily as he started lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thunk</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay snorted as Mikey accidentally smacked his head on the headboard, misjudging where his head would land. He flicked the switch as he heard the covers rustle as his brother worked things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sighed. \"What, Mikey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I outgrew the bed. My feet are sticking out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....In the morning, Mikey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's dreams that night were an odd mix of images. He had a vision of opening gifts on his birthday to find 'hand-me-downs' from Mikey; shoes that his feet would never grow enough to fill, shirts that looked like tents on his skinny frame. Images of the old doorframe where their parents used to mark the brother's heights, and how ever since around age five Mikey's marks were nearly even with Mark's from two years ahead.  Ray saw himself alone in a giant's house, so big that he couldn't climb up onto the furniture or hope to reach the kitchen counter without a stool. While he looked around in confusion, he suddenly heard a distant, booming thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thump,  Thump,  Thump</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that?  Were those....footsteps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's eyes shot open, glancing around his room nervously. Sunlight streamed in through the windows; he'd managed to sleep in a bit.  Ray was glad; he felt a lot better, his head was clear. It felt like a lot of negative and confused feelings had been let out last night, like lancing a boil, and now he was maybe starting to heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thump Thump Thump</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ray rasped out, slipping out of bed and pulling on some sweatpants.  That sounded a lot like the dream he'd had, though he was beginning to lose some of the details.  Hustling down the hall, Ray followed the loud thumps to his brother's door. Hesitating only a moment, Ray quickly turned the knob and peeked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thump</i> \"Stupid.\" <i>Thump</i> \"Pants.\" <i>Thump</i> \"Gah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey yelped, his arms pinwheeling, and fell on his butt with a loud \"oof!\" Tangled around his feet were a pair of loose sweatpants, much like Ray's. They were clearly Mikey's, and they just as clearly were not cooperating with the kid trying to get dressed. The boy's long toes were poking through the holes in the legs, but both legs were catching on his heels, and although the pair had mostly cleared his feet, the waistband was only stretching up to halfway between his knees and his waist.  With a determined grunt, the younger brother fell back on his back and <i>tugged</i> the pants up, only to yelp again - in a slightly higher pitch - as they popped over his feet and shot up to his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay cocked an eyebrow as his brother clambered up into a standing position, the bottoms of his sweats pulled tight halfway up his calves, and carefully tugged the waistband back down an inch or two with a wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about then that Mikey realized he had an audience, and blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" He muttered, his voice still a bit higher pitched and strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Ray drawled, \"please continue. This right here...comedy gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey huffed as he shouldered past his older brother, taking a vindictive moment to use his greater mass to shove the boy back a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured sweatpants would be okay, even if they're too short.\" Mikey half-whined as he led the way downstairs, his bare feet slapping loudly on the steps. \"Stupid things kept getting stuck on my feet, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay snickered a bit as he slid down the banister. Mikey was usually the playful one who did things like that, but Ray figured he was too heavy now; might as well enjoy being the smaller brother, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuicker than Ray could blink, Mikey snatched him up at the bottom before he could dismount, and swung him around with complete ease before plopping the older brother down in the living room.  Ray winced a bit at the surprise, and at being carried <i>again</i>, but decided to let it go. It was all part of the new normal. Speaking of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think you grew overnight,\" Ray offered, eyeballing his brother. \"Or at least, not very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey shrugged, before reaching up and palming the ceiling and flexing his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels about the same.\" The younger brother agreed.  \"So...how do we do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ray pondered. \"I think to start off we should re-measure. Check your weight, and then I'd like to take a blood sample.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe siblings quickly turned words into action. Mikey was currently a ridiculous 6 feet 5 inches tall, and his hands and feet had grown some too, though Ray mentioned that he thought he'd seen that happening the previous day before they went to the park.  He weighed 195 lbs, and he'd definitely regained some muscle definition. <i>That</i>, Ray thought, had started last evening and may have continued overnight; it might explain why even stretchy clothes like sweatpants were giving the kid a bit of trouble. Mikey didn't object much to the blood draw; he'd been scraped up enough playing that he wasn't scared of a little blood, though he did <i>not</i> want to look while it was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tested the formula on rats over the last year.\" Ray explained as he started making breakfast. \"I've gotten pretty good at running the tests, and your blood should be done reacting in the test tubes in an hour or so. Based on how much the different rats grew, and what their blood showed, I <i>hope</i> I can work out a model to predict what could happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Mikey muttered, looking at his older brother with a bit of awe. \"You're like a super hero, or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ray asked, looking over at Mikey in confusion. \"No I'm not. If anything <i>you're</i> the super hero now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh.\" Mikey waved that idea aside, before looking at Ray, excited. \"Ray, you did something <i>no</i> regular person could <i>ever</i> do, all on your own. Like, like Mr Fantastic, or Iron Man, or Batman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger brother nodded, before getting up and posing, flexing a bit and straining his dad's t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the big mutant thing you made, but <i>you're</i> the mad scientist! I got all this because of you! You're <i>awesome</i>, Ray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...shut up.\" Ray muttered, blushing. He quickly loaded half a dozen scrambled eggs on his smug younger brother's plate and walked back over to refill the skillet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Ray offered in an attempt to change the subject a little, \"I figure best case scenario you're done growing. The formula was supposed to mimic puberty, and you've grown about fourteen inches, which is within the normal amount for the total male growth spurt. Maybe you get another fourteen inches in the next few years, but that wouldn't be the end of the world; at least you'd still fit inside the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'd be like, eight feet tall!\" Mikey grinned. \"I'd be the best side-kick <i>ever</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not a super hero, Mikey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are too...\"<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

Ray immediately was at his brother's side. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...my hands just suddenly hurt...ouch! There it is again! They feel all...hard and tense...\" Mikey mumbled, his fingers looking stiff and awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, can I see?\" Ray asked, Mikey nodding as his older brother took his bigger hand in his smaller ones and began to press and feel it, bending the fingers slightly. \"Does that hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving them doesn't hurt.\" Mikey explained. \"But it's like...it hurts inside, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if the muscles are just sore...come on, let's go to the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay led Mikey by the hand to the living room, Mikey sitting on the couch as Ray massaged the fingers of his hand. \"Does that feel any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...yeah, it does...\" Mikey said softly, closing his eyes as he winced again, a loud CRACK suddenly filling the room. \"Oof, now my feet are hurting too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay glance down at Mikey's impressive stompers, the thick, somewhat stubby toes cracking as they flexed and curled. \"Ouch...ouch! Big bro, my feet are really starting to hurt...can you...uh....you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay sighed. He knew where this was going. \"You want me to rub your feet, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeeeeeease? Pretty please? Just for a bit? It felt really good when you did my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, but just for a bit. I think some heat and pressure will help but so after this I'm going to wrap your hands and feet up in warm towels and see if that helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped to the floor and Mikey lifted his foot up, plopping it down in Ray's lap. The older male immediately pressed his thumbs into the sole of Mikey's foot, the skin soft but firm. Mikey was an active kid but he was still a kid after all. He began to press harder, moving his hands up along the sides of the foot, Mikey's toes twitching and curling in response to the attention. \"Hey...you're pretty good at this! You do this kind of thing often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Ray shouted, blushing slightly. \"I just know a thing or two about muscles and anatomy and know where to press.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey giggled, jerking his foot back somewhat. \"C-Careful! That tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay smirked slightly and said, \"Oh, does it? Does....THIS tickle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed down, running his fingers up and down the sole of the foot and along the sides, moving swiftly and lightly. Mikey snorted and began to laugh, pulling his foot back again, his arms crossing across his stomach as he leaned forward a bit, his laughs coming out in gasps, snorts, and giggles. \"S-S-Stop that! That's not faaaaaaaair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you wanted this!\" Ray chuckled, moving in closer, keeping the pressure on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair, no fair, no fair!\" Mikey laughed, his foot suddenly jerking forward reflexively. The heavy appendage smacked into Ray's chest, shoving him backward roughly, knocking the wind out of him. Mikey's laughter almost immediately stopped, moving to his brother's side. \"Geez I'm sorry Ray! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm fine! I probably deserved that...\" Ray wheezed, sitting back up with a wince. \"You've got...quite a kick there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey chuckled, looking a little embarrassed. \"Heh, well, you know...sports...thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your feet and hands feeling?\" Ray asked, changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They feel better but they still HURT...\" Mikey whined, plopping back down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to try the compresses then. I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay moved from the living room to the bathroom, pulling down some hand towels before turning on the faucet. While he was waiting for the water to heat up he started to wonder...why exactly was Mikey hurting? It was concentrated in the hands and feet, too. Was it possible...? \"No.\" Ray firmly shook his head, testing the water. \"That would be insane. It couldn't be more growth this fast. That's just....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what? Impossible? What exactly about this situation wasn't impossible but happening anyway? Once this was all over the world was going to have to come to terms with what the word \"impossible\" really meant now. He had just began soaking the towels when Mikey's voice suddenly called out. \"Ray! RAY! You have to see this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what now?\" Ray muttered, turning the water off and running out of the bathroom. \"What, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, look! Look at my hand!\" Mikey said, holding it up in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay stared, not quite comprehending what he was seeing. Mikey's index and second finger were much longer and thicker than the others, giving his hand a bit of a lopsided look. However, as Ray watched, the middle finger trembled and with a CRACK and a POP, the finger thickened and extended, the tip stretching just past the secondary finger. \"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it WEIRD?\" Mikey said, watching intently as the next finger followed suit. The process seemed to be speeding up slightly, the thumb bulging into proper size along the other fingers last, the hand itself suddenly widening and stretching like it was a hunk of taffy in a machine. \"Look, now my other hand is doing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up the other appendage and both brother's watched in awe as the fingers trembled and cracked and popped, growing longer, thicker, wider, one after the other, the hand last of all once again. \"Oooh...something weird...my FEET...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's eyes traveled down to the appendages planted firmly on the carpet, Mikey's breathing getting heavier as his little toe POPPED out larger, the other toes moving swiftly after, POP, POP, POP, POP! Mikey groaned as the entire foot LURCHED forward, growing larger and wider, the toes clenching against the carpet fibers, suddenly covering more of them than before. The second foot followed suit fastest of all, each toe popping loudly larger one after the other, the sound of skin stretching filling the air. Silence followed the end of this growth, Mikey panting while Ray started at him with wide eyes. A loud, low grumble suddenly broke the silence, Mikey pressing a hand to his belly. \"Oof..suddenly feeling hungry again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...we...just had breakfast.\" Ray said weakly, heart thudding in his chest as he struggled to swallow, trying to process what he had just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but for some reason I'm feeling hungry again...a little snack wouldn't hurt, right?\" Mikey mumbled, getting to his feet, stumbling slightly again, much to his annoyance. \"Great, now my feet are all big again...come on body, catch up already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey was viewing this entire circumstance through the lens of a child, not really fully understanding how crazy things were. If his growth got too serious that could eventually become a real problem. Ray shook his head; a bridge to cross if they came to it. He followed his brother into the kitchen as he began to look through the cupboards for something to eat, finding a box of protein bars and licking his lips. He reached his big mitt of a hand into the box and grabbed as many as he could fit, walking them over to the table where he began to strip them of their wrappers, cramming the bars one after the other into his mouth. He chewed swiftly, grinding down the bars like they were nothing, swallowing huge chunks, visible lumps traveling down his throat as he gorged himself. Ray watched the carnage unfold with a look that was half impressed and half disgusted. When the last bar had disappeared into Mikey's maw, the kid sighed happily, patting his stomach...before his mouth opened wide and a loud, deep belch suddenly blasted forth, making Ray jump slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Scuse me.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It's...fine Mikey,\" Ray offered, concerned, as his brother shuffled to his feet again. \"Let's just watch some TV while the samples-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gurgle</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey winced, and stumbled his way over to the freezer. Ray watched in shock as his kid brother grabbed the giant plastic tub of \"special treat\" ice cream and a wooden mixing spoon and started shoveling it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were full!\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was!\" Mikey said back, wide-eyed, between bites. Kid could fit the whole spoon in his mouth, easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was full, and then I was hungry, and then full, and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it,\" Ray cut in, crossing the kitchen to peer into the ice-cream tub. It was a 2-gallon tubs the kid was scooping down pint after pint! That had to be thousands of calories of milk, protein, and sugar, and Mikey was <i>still eating</i>.  Ray slowly moved to his brother's side and lifted up on Mikey's t-shirt. Three rows of abs bunched and shifted with each swallow, but there was no swelling. Ray gave Mikey's side a poke, and his brother wriggled a bit and snorted, setting the spoon down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut that out!\" Mikey griped with a distracted laugh, swiping at Ray with one of his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gurgle</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mikey continued his effort to eat through <i>ten pounds of ice cream</i>, Ray grimaced as he heard a faint cracking sound. A very familiar cracking sound. Sitting on the kitchen floor, Ray slid against his brother's long legs and pressed his ear against Mikey's right calf. The steady, strong <i>thump thump</i> of his heartbeat was obvious, and under that a soft creaking noise, like something under pressure. Ray frowned, confused by the sensation, and pulled back sharply as he heard Mikey gasp and shuffle his leg. He looked down and saw his brother's feet flex. The cracking sound was in his feet...again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay scrambled up and peered at Mikey's hands, seeing the same tense flexing, hearing the same cracks and pops. But no growth. Mikey was wincing, but after a moment his brother let out a whining cry and polished off the ice cream tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo, I'm still hungry!\" Mikey glared at his already-too-big arms and oversized hands. \"Where's it all <i>going</i>, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Ray answered helplessly as his brother shoved him aside and scrambled over to the cabinet and grabbed the new jar of peanut butter and started scooping it out. Deciding that the best thing he could do was <i>try</i> to help, Ray turned on the oven (random temperature, just get it hot, figure it out later!) and raided the fridge for sandwich parts. As Mikey finished the peanut butter, all the chips, the cookies, crackers, and spooned up all of the pre-made salads that they bought yesterday, Ray loaded the oven down with fries and chicken nuggets and covered the counter in slapped-together sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey dropped the large wooden spoon and dove at the counter like he was starving...and Ray was starting to worry that somehow he was! Ray's concern only ratcheted higher when he scooped up the spoon so Mikey wouldn't slip on it and saw it had a bite taken out of it! A thick wooden sauce spoon and his brother chomped right through it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour passed in a blur. Ray was barely able to stay ahead of Mikey, but he managed to find a rhythm. Throw something in the oven, or the toaster oven, or into a deep fryer, microwave, <i>whatever</i>, spread out cold foods, let Mikey eat the cold foods while the hot food finished, swap. Stay out of the way as his brother stomped from one side of the kitchen to the other, the floor thudding, and starting to <i>creak</i> as he walked. Again, and again, and <i>again</i>....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>URP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay paused, panting, as for the first time in what seemed like forever Mikey did something different. The older sibling felt his knees go rubbery as he watched Mikey pause with the last apple in the house cupped inside his hand, belch, and sit down on the kitchen floor with a loud <i>thump</i>. Mikey looked pretty rough, too. Both brothers had a light sheen of sweat from rushing around for over an hour, and the heat pumping out from the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was wrecked. Cabinet doors gaped open, empty and ransacked. The fridge and freezer stood nearly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey poked at his stomach, bleary eyes staring as a round ball gut jiggled under his fingers. Eventually it seemed wherever the food was going filled up, and the boy's stomach had slowly pushed out, distending with food, but it had kept demanding more and more. The poor kid gave off a pained moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it over?\" Ray asked, feeling terrible that he was asking Mikey; wasn't it his job to know what was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...<b>urp</b>...I think so,\" MIkey answered weakly, rubbing his tummy with a wince. \"I didn't think I could get fat; I guess you were right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're fat,\" Ray said, walking over and starting to gently massage Mikey's stomach. \"I think that's all food...waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah,\" Mikey sighed, leaning back into the counter, letting his eyes slowly close. \"Waiting for what?\"<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The loud DING of a bell was heard from the basement as the blood tests finished running their course, both brothers looking towards the basement door as it happened before facing each other again. Mikey looked wiped out and mumbled, \"Stuff's ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay nodded and started walking towards the door. He felt the floor vibrate slightly as Mikey lurched to his feet, following behind his brother, his gut bumping into Ray's back, nearly making him stumble forward. Mikey didn't seem to notice and Ray chose not to mention it, both boys heading downstairs. Ray indicated a chair for Mikey to sit in, which he did, sliding down in it, legs stretched out and spread slightly to accommodate his bloated belly. Ray quickly began to study the results of the tests, matching them with the results of the tests against his lab rats. The numbers were so wildly different it was almost useless to match it to previous results but there were some consistencies that Ray was able to tease out. He started to sweat, his heart pounding in his chest. These numbers....they were so high. Even the most successful test against his healthiest rat didn't have numbers this high. Ray moved constantly around his work station, Mikey's eyes following him lazily. \"So...uh...urp...what's up? How's it looking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay, trembling slightly, threw his hands up in the air. \"It's...well it's really complicated Mikey, I'll tell you that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey groaned, head flopping back, stomach vibrating slightly as it churned all the food inside. \"Can you make it...not complicated for me? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will try to explain it in as simple of terms as possible.\" Ray promised, gathering up the pages of notes and sitting down in a chair opposite Mikey. \"You remember what I told you earlier, right? About what the formula is supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, it was...make it so that someone who had already finished growing would...grow some more...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close enough.\" Ray said, holding up a sheet of paper. \"Now because you're prepubescent I was expecting the formula to just work overtime for you, maybe make you a few feet taller...you'd definitely end up as the tallest human ever in history but it wouldn't be too outlandish. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But? But what?\" Mikey asked, sitting up somewhat straighter, his interest rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But these tests all indicate far more dramatic growth. N-Not only that but faster growth too. Your body is slowly acclimatizing itself to the changes forthcoming so the effects have been less dramatic but as time progresses your body will be able to handle accelerated growth and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah!\" Mikey said, holding his hands up as Ray rattled on and on. \"My body is...what? Acclim...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay forced himself to slow down and repeated his findings. \"Your body is...getting used to the changes so they haven't been too extreme. But as your body DOES get more used to it the growth will get faster. It doesn't really look like it'll be slowing down any time soon, either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey let out a long sigh, looking up at the ceiling. \"Woah. That's pretty crazy...but kinda cool, too, you know? This hasn't happened to anyone before...and it's happening to ME! That's so rad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay couldn't help but smile at Mikey's innocence, his mind not even landing on factors like where he was going to live or what he was going to eat if he got too big. Ray continued. \"Not only that but your body has also started to become more efficient. It won't be too noticeable now but your eyesight and hearing are going to improve and your muscles will get denser and slightly larger, probably, improving your strength. Your bones are going to get harder, your teeth are already getting stronger, everything about you is just...getting better! Your lung capacity is improving and circulation is perfect, not to mention--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, I'm getting better that's...good enough for me.\" Mikey said, rubbing his head. All of this was a lot to take on at once. \"So why did...this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey poked at his wriggling gut, frowning slightly. It had shrunk back down slightly as his body started to process all that was within it, the faint hint of his abs becoming more noticeable again. Ray shifted through his notes and said, \"That was your body storing energy for the coming changes. As far as I can tell it's basically your body preparing itself for a big boost of growth by...um...shoring up its defenses, so to speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't get it.\" Mikey said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it like...you can't build a big house without a strong foundation and outline. Your body spurred you on to stockpile calories, vitamins, minerals, basically any energy it could in order to make your body stronger so it could withstand a powerful surge of growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...is...uh...is this something that's going to happen often?\" Mikey asked, letting out a wet sounding belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it really depends on how much growth your body is capable of...\" Ray said, feeling a slight worry resurface under all his excitement at this scientific anomaly. Just how big WAS Mikey capable of getting? His genes were impeccable, making him tall, strong, and athletic for his age even at his normal size. Every visit to the doctor was further proof of how violently healthy he was, how capable of growth his body was and Ray had accidentally supercharged it. Where exactly was this all going to end? Judging by the numbers...not any time soon. Ray's hand shook slightly but he forced himself to stop. The time for worrying and regretting was past. Now it was time for action and understanding. Ray got to his feet and dumped his notes back on the table, thinking hard about his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey, meanwhile, was gurgling and groaning as his belly worked the food down, his muscles bulging slightly, his already bright eyes seeming to shine just a bit brighter, his lips parting in a slight grin as he felt a pleasant tingling in his teeth. His breathing was getting heavier as an indescribably good feeling coursed from the soles of his feet, making the toes twitch and curl slightly, up to the crown of his head, his hair almost feeling like it was static filled and standing on end though it wasn't. The chair creaked under his weight as he got just a bit heavier. The changes were coming slow but Mikey could feel...something...building up deep within and the pure pleasure of it pushed all other thoughts and concerns away. He tugged at the collar of his shirt slightly, cheeks flushed. \"R-Ray...ooooh...something weird is happening...I feel really...good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What?\" Ray said, turning to look back at his little brother and feeling slightly uncomfortable at the prominent bulge in his pants. \"Oh god...it's all part of puberty after all...\" Ray thought to himself as Mikey groped his bulge, hissing slightly as pure pleasure seemed to pulse through his loins and across his body. \"Mikey...uh...maybe you should go up to your room and...uh...take care of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of what? I don't...what IS this...?\" Mikey tried to fight through the fog in his mind but it was difficult, his hands moving on instinct as he undid his pants and reached inside, fingers curling around his stiffening erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's face burned bright red as he turned his back on his brother, heart pounding. This was NOT something he had been expecting to deal with. Could he really just stand here and pretend like nothing was happening? Mikey began to pant and moan, his fingers moving clumsily up and down his length, his arms having a bit of trouble maneuvering around his gut. Ray quickly moved away past Mikey and headed up the stairs, calling down, \"I'll be back after...after...just after!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ran the rest of the way upstairs and slammed the door closed. \"The scientific discovery of the century...and he's doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shook his head and pressed his ear against the door, the pants and moans getting louder. He quickly moved away from the door, not wanting to hear it and not wanting to invade his younger brother's privacy. It was his first time, it was probably going to be over in a few minutes anyway. Ray sighed and decided to wait it out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back upstairs, Ray stared at the kitchen clock as he waited out Mikey's... experimentation, he guessed was the best word for it. Even up one level, he could still hear the faint sounds of his younger brother's moaning, and he gritted his teeth in embarrasment. \"I suppose I should've expected this. I just hope this doesn't ... complicate things any further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to try and take the few minutes he had to think of what the best next step would be. It was probably too late to think about reversing Mikey's growth, but maybe it was still possible to slow it down or stop it before it got out of hand. An eight-foot-tall brother he could probably deal with, but an eighty foot one would be a bit harder to cope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to drive the ridiculousness of the situation home, his thoughts were briefly interrupted by a loud thumping sound coming from the basement. He didn't want to think about what was causing that; he just hoped Mike would finish up soon so they could move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut move on to what? he wondered. Would he be able to do anything quick enough? After all, it had taken him over a year to develop the formula. Finding an antidote wouldn't be overnight, and Mike had already grown so much in just a short time after taking the formula. And how would he be able to test it before giving it to his brother to make sure it wouldn't hurt him -- or even accelerate his growth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions were swirling around Ray's head, but before he could come up with any answers, he heard his brother's voice calling him from downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Ray? Could -- could you come back here? Please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something off about Mike's tone of voice. Part of it was an unexpected sense of urgency, but it also just seemed louder than before. Gulping, Ray took a deep breath and opened the basement door, heading back downstairs and hoping his brother had cleaned up after himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs, though, he gasped and nearly fell backwards, stunned. Mike was now sitting on the floor, the splintered remains of the chair on either side of him-- but his head was still eye-level with Ray! His clothes were now nearly gone, just shreds of which remained clinging to his arms and legs. The swollen gut had disappeared, now back to the familiar lean, athletic torso. Mikey looked much like he had before all this started, just on a larger scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, except for the thing Ray least wanted to see but couldn't turn away from. Sticking out from in between his younger brother's legs was a dick larger than he could ever have imagined. It had to be nearly as long as MIke's thighs, and was still rock hard, jutting straight out, with two cantaloupe-sized balls hugging either side below it. Even with his brother's increased overall size, there was no way his junk should be that big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-- How?\" was all Ray could sputter. What words would be appropriate anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's cheeks turned red in embarrassment. \"I -- I don't know. I was just... taking care of it, as you said. Everything felt so good that I wasn't really paying attention to anything else, until suddenly, the chair broke, and then, well...\" He gestured at the opposite wall, which now featured a large wet spot on it. \"<i>That</i> happened.\" A sheepish grin started to appear on his face. \"How big do you think I am now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shook his head in disbelief; this was all too unreal. \"You must be nine, almost ten feet tall now!\" he finally managed to say. \"And it looks like the whole stockpiling idea we talked about earlier was probably right. And...\" he gestured at the still-prominent erection that was impossible to avoid, \"I guess your, uh... elevated heart rate may have caused the formula to go into overdrive? And cause, um... <i>pronounced</i> effects in areas with higher blood flow. I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, Mikey scrunched up his nose. \"And that means...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means you probably shouldn't do that again, no matter how good it feels. And now it means we have a much more immediate problem than I was thinking we'd have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ray started pacing back and forth in the basement, Mikey instinctively began to stand up, stopping only when he hit his head on the ceiling, causing a bit of plaster to fall to the ground. \"Oops\", he said, giggling. He tried hunching his back over before deciding to get down on his hands and knees. \"So, uh... What can we do about clothes for me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not really something we can really do anything about, at least at the moment. And besides, if this keeps up, it'd be pointless anyways. You better start getting used to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish his sentence, though, Ray found himself interrupted by a sound that caused his heart to skip a beat...</span></div></div>",

The soft sound slowly built up in intensity, changing from a grumble to an easily audible growl, the sound turning into more of a noise, Mike's stomach visibly vibrating at the growl expanded into a thundering roll, the basement window shaking slightly in its frame. Ray and Mikey, in that moment, felt the exact same way, opened their mouths and shouted, \"Oh are you KIDDING me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers looked at each other in surprise and, despite the situation being what it was, snorted out little bursts of laughter. The laughter died out again when the sound returned, ferocious and demanding, Mikey's body needing even more fuel now. \"Sorry uh...\"big\" bro but I think I need to eat more now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no. I know you're hungry, really I do, but that's only going to make this problem even worse. You're already almost passing through the ceiling, another binge eating session might make you too big to even fit out the front door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey had a thoughtful look on his face as he imagined that, tilting his head slightly, a little smile curling the edges of his lips. \"You really think so...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES I really do think so and that's why you have to control your urges, all of your....appetites.\" Ray said firmly, trying to impress upon Mike how important this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound came a third time, Mikey's belly roaring even louder than before, a pained look rising to the young boy's face. \"Control this...why? Because I'll get bigger? That's probably just going to happen anyway. I'm not going to like..feel bad over it. It's not like any of this is my fault anyway. I'm hungry and I want to EAT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay could hear the belligerence in his younger brother's voice and it made a chill run down his spine. \"Okay...I mean, even if you did want to eat anything there's...there's no food left in the house, you ate it all the last time so...I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey leaned forward, hands on his hips, his bigger face moving in close to Ray's, causing the older male to stumble back a few steps. An easy going grin rose to Mike's face as he said, \"Then how about you order me some takeout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay cursed silently in his mind. He had been hoping Mikey wouldn't be focused enough to think of something like that. Now was the time to be brave, to be firm, to not let his little brother call the shots. Ray drew himself up to his full unimpressive height and said, \"No. I said that you need to control yourself and that is what you are going to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey's expression darkened for a moment, his lower lip pushing out in a pout before his eyes widened. He glanced around the room, thinking about something, a mischievous smile rising to his lips. \"So wait...you said my teeth are getting stronger, right? And my body is getting more efficient?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes? What about it?\" Ray replied, happy to get off the subject of food for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just had a thought.\" Mikey said, casually strolling over to Ray's work table, his big feet making the floor shake slightly with his every step, his head scraping along the ceiling, sending bits of dust and plaster down onto Ray like snow. \"If you're not going to feed me one way, you can feed me another way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay watched from a safe distance, honestly curious about what Mike was driving at, the much bigger male gently picking up a glass vial and bringing it up to his face, sniffing it, licking it...and taking a huge bite out of it! Ray immediately rushed over to the table. \"Mikey! What the hell are you doing?! You can't eat glass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey chewed thoughtfully for a moment before swallowing, smacking his lips a little. \"Not much taste...but hey, it goes down easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled and took another bite, finishing the vial off quickly before dusting his hands. \"Let's see...what else does my little big brother have to feed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up a beaker full of chemicals and downed the liquid in one shot before chewing up the beaker itself, licking his lips and letting out a little burp, the air rippling slightly. \"And what's this? Notes? Looks like a sandwich to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay, who had been watching in stunned silence as his monster of a little brother began to devour his work station, broke his paralysis and rushed forward, grabbing the other end of the notebook and tugging it back. \"No! I need these notes! It's for the formula! Mikey, stop! I won't be able to make an antidote without this! STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey lifted Ray clear off the ground as he brought the thick pad of papers up to his mouth, chomping into it, his eyes staring right into Ray's as he munched the notes, bringing his brother closer and closer to his lips, Ray letting go at the last second to avoid losing any fingers from Mike's careless eating, falling to the floor in a heap. Mikey let out a satisfied sigh as he licked his fingers, patting his flat stomach. \"Stop? Come on bro, I thought you were smart! Did you really think that I would just...I dunno...sit around and be constantly hungry? To never do that thingy with my...um...you know, when it felt SO GOOD? To have you poke and prod and do boring experiments to me forever? No way! I want to have fun and do stuff and run around and show off how strong I am! You scientist types always try to lock up your creations and control them but I don't wanna be controlled! So I don't care what happens now! I'm going to do what I wanna do and I'm not going to let anyone stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice had grown louder and more passionate as he spoke, the window rattling in its frame again, Ray wincing at the volume of the noise. His heart was thudding in his chest; he couldn't believe he actually felt AFRAID of his little brother. He wasn't going to let anyone stop him? Ray knew that Mike wasn't invincible, that he could very well be stopped and yet...shards of glass were scattered around the table behind Ray, sprayed from Mikey's mouth while he had been eating, and yet not a single sliver of glass had managed to pierce Mikey's tougher skin. He certainly wasn't unstoppable but he was becoming...more. Something more than normal, more than average, more than human, even...the next evolution? The scientific part of Ray was tickled but that cold fear refused to dissipate. His thoughts were broken when he felt a huge, heavy, warm hand grip his shoulder. Ray immediately looked up into the kind face of his little brother, grinning that energetic grin, same as always. \"Don't worry though...you're the one who helped me get like this so I'll make sure I take care of you no matter what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pure affection in his voice was enough to banish that cold fear, at least for the moment, Ray smiling back...though that smile was short lived as Mikey leaned forward, stepping closer to the work table, gathering up more of his brother's beakers, vials, notes, pencils, and anything else he could get his hands on, stuffing them greedily into his maw. Ray was pinned, his back arching slightly over the table as the wall that was his brother's stomach and chest pushed against him, Ray's hands sinking slightly into the soft skin as he struggled desperately to push his brother back, not able to budge him even an inch. Once Mikey had devoured half the objects on the work table he stepped back and wiped his mouth, his stomach looking only slightly distended again. His capacity was much, MUCH larger now, not to mention his more efficient body was already breaking his \"food\" down faster, allowing him to store more. Mikey pointed to his still rumbling belly and said, \"Okay little bro, I'm going to give you a choice now. Either start ordering some food or I'm going up to your room and eating everything in there...or as much of it as I can, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay, still torn between trying to stop his brother and mitigating the damage he would cause by being refused, chewed his thumbnail as he thought. What was the proper course of action here?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Are t-OO-oo\" Mikey said, playfully shoving his older brother, his voice minutely inflecting downwards in register at the end. He looked at Ray curiously for just a moment, then continued on his way into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay was slightly thrown. He must've just been imagining it. But as they sat down and munched through what Mikey, like a Hobbit, insisted was second breakfast, he couldn't get it out of his head. Was his voice deeper? Was he taller. Ray glanced under the table as Mikey shoveled another shoul of cereal into his mouth. Mikey really was a Hobbit in every way but height. Voracious appetite, and dusting of hair on the top of his fee--. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWAIT. Since when had Mikey had hair on his feet. Ray looked up across the table at his younger brother munching and slurping away at his meal. The kid was so focused on his food, it seemed unlikely he would notice a difference in his own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a curious realization though, on Ray's part. The formula was, after all, supposed to accelerate puberty, right? What did that mean for a boy like Mikey, who prior to drinking the formula was an early bloomer himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's thoughts were disrupted by Mikey pushing his bowl away from himself. It was empty, the only evidence that there had been food anywhere near the table being some splashes of milk, and pieces of cereal on the table and on his brother. Mikey was still working on swallowing and chewing as he asked Ray what they should do next, so he couldn't quite gauge if Mikey's voice seemed deeper because it was muffled by all the food, or it was the effects of the formula. Either way, Ray decided they couldn't take the risk of bringing him out in public today, on the off chance that he grew exponentially, or something else happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of this; we're starting to run low on food, so I'm gonna stop by the grocery store, and when I get back we can have a Star Wars marathon, original, NO prequels. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey acknowledged his older brother dumbly for a second, and then sputtered something along the lines of, \"You-RE letTTing me STAY HOME ALOne\". It was deeper. His voice was definitely getting deeper. He gave himself a self-satisfied smirk, \"WoaH, I thiNK my voiCe is GETTING DEEpeR\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay stared at the young behemoth in front of him. If his voice was changing this fast, he should probably hurry with the food. \"Yeah, I mean you're big enough to take care of yourself at this point, plus I thought you could just use some downtime. So, what do ya say? Movies when I get back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SurE THING LIL BRO\", he said giggling. Ray rolled his eyes, guess he'd have to get used to that at some point. He grabbed his shoes, the keys, and his wallet, with some of the money left over from their parents and headed for the door. \"Alright Mikey, I'll be back in an hour tops! Put your dish in the dishwasher and get ready for this movie marathon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay wheeled through the aisles of store. He had already grabbed the essentials for the next couple of days, and some extras for their movie binge. Popcorn, Twizzlers, mike and ikes, m&amp;ms, the works really. And now he found himself in the toiletry aisle. There was an assortment of deodorant, shaving cream, and razors in front of him. Judging by his little---No---younger brothers voice before he left, he figured he'd need at least one of these by the end of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cashier rang up the toiletries, she gave him an odd look. She was probably his mom's age, mid 40s, and was likely confused as to why a teen, who looked no older than 15 and didn't have a wisp of hair on his face, was buying a pack of razors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that Ray heard when he walked into the house was running water. Mike must be showering. He guessed that was good, responsible, but the man-child had also left his bowl, and mess on the table. Guess he would have to have a word with his brother when he came down. As he was putting away some food on the lower shelf of the pantry, he felt a big hand fall on his shoulder, and a deep \"BOO\" come from behind him. Ray must've jumped a food in the air. His reaction was enough to earn a rumbling laugh from the boy behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you laughing at, and hey what's with you leaving your dishes just lying around after I left, I asked you to do one thing!\" Ray stated indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ray, I took a poop right after you left, and then jumped straight in the shower, I swear I was gonna do it when I came down.\" It was hard to reconcile Mikey's earnestness, with the deep voice that it was carried by. He took in his brother's appearance too. He appeared to be in a pair of their fathers sweatpants, which end several inches above his ankles, which were surprisingly tight taboot, and wore no shirt. That wasn't altogether surprising. He looked thicker though, like his chest had puffed out, and arms had swollen bigger. Hell, he looked similarly proportioned to how he'd been before this mess. He had a clear six pack, and the faintest, barely noticeable line of blonde hair descending into his shorts, to a decidedly non-barely noticeable bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. The formula was definitely accelerating his puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like what you see, little bro?\" He hadn't realized he'd been staring. Ray brushed off his brother's comment quickly, with a snarky remark \"No, just wondering what we'll put you in if you grow any more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay was not, however, prepared for his response of \"Oh, I don't mind, I'm not ashamed of anything, haha...\" Ray gave his younger brother an incredulous look, which only resulted in him laughing harder. He decided it was best to leave it at that, and told him they'd start the movie as soon as he got the rest of the food away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, let me help ya little man,\" Mikey said coming up behind Ray, as he lifted some of the snacks and non-perishables onto a higher shelf, just out of reach of his brother, but at around eye'-level for himself. With that, and a couple more things, which would've taken Ray a whole bunch of maneuvering to put away had it not been for Mike's help, they set off for the family room. They each got their respective candies, and bowls of popcorn, and settled down on opposite sides of the couch, huddled under separate blankets, to watch the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during Episode 5, Mikey had fallen asleep. They had taken a break after the first one for dinner, which Mikey had eat plenty of. They had settled down for the next movie, and Ray looked over 3/4 of the way done to see his brother passed out. He wasn't too surprised, he had been growing in some sort of way today, it only made sense he'd be tired. It was the start of Episode 6 that he caught whiff of a pungent smell of body oder. Mikey's body was stretched out across the couch, his blanket only cover half his body, and relegating Ray to a single cushion. He was snoring with arms outstretched over his head, and a hint of a smirk on his face. As Ray catalogued all of this, he noted the beginnings of hair under his brothers arms, and the light blond dusting that seemed to be making its way up his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay looked to the clock. It was 10:45, so Mikey would likely sleep through the night. No sense in bothering him hear either, he probably wouldn't fit in his own bed anymore. Ray reconsidered though, his parents might be big enough. He jostled his brothers shoulder, who awoke with a slow yawn and bleary eyes, \"Hey Mikey, lets head up to bed, yeah\". Mikey mumbled something in the affirmative, and they made their way upstairs, albeit slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay awoke with a start the next morning. He'd just had the weirdest dream. Mikey had accelerated even faster through puberty than he'd expected, and in this bizarre alternate universe had been twice the height of a normal man, with four times the muscle, and the angry attitude to go with it. He broken from his reverie, however, by a deep yell of suprise from the bathroom down the hall. Mikey! Hopefully nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raced down the hall to the bathroom, and budged on the door but it was locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey, let me in, whats wrong?! Are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its--Everything--Ugh, I don't know---Do you promise you wont scream?\" Ray was thrown, what could possibly be wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey, I promise, just open the damn door\" Ray yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that hit him was the smell, pungent and like a man, it was somehow stronger than the night before. Then he took in his brother's appearance. He didn't seem taller at least, but that just about the only thing that hadn't changed. For starters, he had ballooned up in size muscularly, his pants could barely contain his legs.The biggest difference though was the hair. It was everywhere. On his face, on his chest, on his stomach, his legs, his arms. Everywhere. And it wasn't a dusting like it was yesterday. It was thick and tangled in places. Hell, forget 11, or 16, Mikey looked like he could be 30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7d/fa/73/7dfa73b6cb40c7845f149894c5dd2f75--bearded-men-hairy-men.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7d/fa/73/7dfa7...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" He looked down on Ray expectantly. Had his brother always been so small?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never imagined it would do this, dear lord,\" Ray mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey was taken aback. \"That's all you have to say for yourself, shrimp? I look like I'm dads age! How am I ever going to go back to school like this\" He said angrily, stepping towards his brother, bumping him with the front of his body. Mikey knew it was irrational, but he was mad. Ray had an idea where it may have come from, the increased testosterone levels, but he was was frozen in shock by his brothers sudden hostility, and the apparent shift in the power dynamic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey huffed, and pushed past his <i>little</i> brother.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mikey shoved his way down the hall back to his parents room, where he had slept the night before. The first thing he was hit with as he entered the room was his now pungent body odor. Is this what all boys his brothers age smelled like after a day watching movies, or was he a special case. He went back to the mirror in his parents bathroom and assessed himself, rubbing his hand against his now rough cheeks. He'd always been big for his age, but this was unbelievable, his whole reflection barely fit within the constraints of the entire mirror, and the hair, it was everywhere. He knew from looking at both his father and brother, that generally being hairy didn't run in the family. In fact, if his brother was any indication, it didn't at all. He didn't seem much taller, thank goodness, but he had put on a good deal of muscle. It, coupled with his other situation, made him look closer to to the age of his parents, than the age of his brother. He'd never felt better though, the only thing nagging at him being his brother not telling him, or understanding that this is what the drink would do to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay, who barely came up to his chest now. Ray, who if they went out in public together, would probably be mistaken for his little brother. Why <i>should</i> Ray be able to tell him what to do, it wasn't like Ray could hurt him, Ray couldn't hurt anyone. He was a wimp, who had been dumb enough to put this <i>formula</i> in a place easily accessible to his younger brother. It wasn't Mikey's fault that Ray wasn't growing, and it sure as hell wasn't Mikey's fault that Ray was in the position he was in now. The more he thought about it, the more he got annoyed with his, 'little' brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at himself in the mirror. His muscles looked pumped, color reaching his cheeks as he took in his appearance. He then peered down at his fathers razor. How hard could it be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ray stood astonished in the hallway. Sure Mikey hadn't gotten any taller, noticeably at least, but he was almost a whole different person from the version of his brother he had seen the day before. It wasn't just that his muscles were bigger, or that his whole body had unceremoniously sprouted hair, his demeanor seamed to have changed too. He held himself differently, and dear god did he need to shower. Ray was sixteen and he hadn't even had an inkling of pit hair, let alone as pungent of body odor that his brother had. He decided it would be best start breakfast for the two of them. Knowing his brother, he'd be hungry when he was done doing whatever he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished plating both his and his brothers meals, he heard the heavy footsteps of Mikey come lumbering into the room. He wasn't prepared to see a freshly shaved version of his brother, albeit with a slight mustache. Nor was he prepared for the vindictive glare coming his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8488/8243532654_b6126a00e6_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8488/824...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Bro? Brooooooooo! BROOOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt grunted as he ignored his little brother's voice, loud as it was, focusing on the bicep curls he was in the middle of. He was well built for a sixteen year old, due to his diligence when it came to exercising and diet, and the fact that he played football. His red hair was cut quite short and close to his head, to make it easier to wear a helmet without too much extra matter getting in the way. He let the weight fall to the floor after his last curl, the sound attracting his younger brother to his room. Erik burst in, all smiles, stopping short in the doorway as the smell of his brother's active body hit his nose. \"Woo! Yikes bro, can't you do this at the gym? It smells like a sock in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's forcing you to hang out in here, shrimp.\" Kurt said with a laugh, rising to his feet and grabbing a nearby towel, pressing it against his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik chuckled and walked in, a look on his face that clearly said \"I want to ask you something.\" Kurt ignored his brother for the moment, curious how long it would take before his brother just blurted out whatever he wanted to ask. Unlike him, Erik was short and stocky. He had a solid build but wasn't what would be considered fat, with the same fiery red hair as his brother but longer and with a splash of freckles across his cheerful face. He was as energetic as they came and moved around a ton, despite his size. The extra thickness probably came from his love of food; it wasn't surprising to see him with some kind of food item in hand. Finally, Erik quickly said, \"Can Hiro come over and play? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt pretended to think long and hard about it. Since their parents were away so often on business trips, Kurt had naturally slipped into a kind of parental role for Erik; not to the point that it ruined their relationship as brothers, but enough that, even when their parents were around, Erik tended to come to Kurt instead. \"Sure, he can come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOHOO!\" Erik yelled, throwing his arms up in the air, before plunging his hand into his pocket and pulling out his cellphone. \"Hiro, he said yes! Get over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt chuckled, watching his brother bound from the room. He was still only twelve, not quite at that tipping point where youthful innocence starts to congeal into teenage angst, so he could be a bit of a handful at times, but Kurt wouldn't have traded him for any other brother. It didn't take long before the doorbell was heard. Hiro only lived down the street so it never took long for him to arrive. Erik ushered him in, Kurt catching a glimpse as he moved towards the bathroom to take a shower. Hiro was quite a bit different from Erik. Where Erik was on the shorter side for his age, Hiro was on the taller side. Where Erik was thick, Hiro was skinny. Where Erik had shorter hair, Hiro's was longer and shaggy. Nevertheless, the two had been inseparable for years, since they met in elementary school. They both enjoyed the same kind of things and would often engage in friendly competitions to see who could come out on top. Mental games were usually won by Hiro, who was a bit more talented in the smarts department, where physical challenges usually favored Erik, with his stockier, more powerful build. Still, both boys had managed to surprise the other various times by winning a competition they were sure they had in the bag. By the time Kurt was done with his shower, both boys were already settled in Erik's room, playing some kind of fighting game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang again, much to Kurt's confusion, as they weren't expecting anyone else to come over. Hurrying downstairs, he opened the door only to find a package left on the doorstep. Scratching his head, he brought it in and opened it up. Inside was a pill bottle, unmarked beyond a single instruction which read \"Take one with your meal\", and a note. Kurt read the note, eyes scanning back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revolutionary supplement! Take one with your meal and see INSTANT results! Not intended for those over thirteen, results may vary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt raised an eyebrow and crumpled the note up, tossing it into the trash. He dumped the pill bottle onto the table and broke down the box, tossing it out into the recyclables before pulling his cellphone out, calling his mom's number, which went straight to voice mail, and then his father's number, yielding the same results. Rolling his eyes slightly, Kurt left a message. \"Hey dad, it's Kurt. We just got a really WEIRD package that had a pill bottle in it. You know anything about that? Is this some kind of weird gift? Call me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went back inside and froze as he saw the pill bottle was gone, the cupboards opened, and the evidence of two boys making a snack left out on the table. Rushing upstairs, Kurt burst into Erik's room, both boys yelling at the sudden intrusion. \"Did you two take that bottle?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah!\" Erik said, holding the bottle up. \"There was only two in there though... sorry bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought you left it out for us.\" Hiro said, blushing slightly, eyes cast to the side. \"It looked like a vitamin or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two feeling sick? Light headed? Upset stomach?\" Kurt persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... why?\" Erik asked, taking a bite out of his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... reason.\" Kurt said, not wanting to freak the kids out. \"Look... if either of you two feel... weird, just let me know. And Hiro? I think you should stay the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What really? Awesome!\" Hiro said, lighting up at the invitation. Both boys high fived as Kurt left the room, examining the bottle. So long as the boys were feeling fine he wouldn't worry... but maybe there was some kind of clue on the bottle he had overlooked. Turning it over, he found, on the bottom, a symbol. It was a little hard to make out but it looked like...</span></div></div>",

Squinting his eyes, Kurt made his way downstairs to the brighter kitchen light, then pulled out his cell phone and typed in the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a single ring, a recorded message on the other end picked up. \u201cHello,\u201d said a male voice, with a weird, unplaceable accent to it. \u201cYou\u2019ve reached Kyouto Pharmaceuticals, makers of Revolutionary Supplement! This recording is for you to discover warnings for the supplement. The supplement will not be effective for those over thirteen. To avoid overdose, make sure to include with meal with plenty of protein. And most important, for at least 24 hours after taking supplement, avoid any strenuous activity, including running, weightlifting, and so on. Kyouto Pharmaceuticals is not responsible for any effects that occur if these warnings are not followed. Thank you goodbye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt scrunched up his nose as he dropped his phone to his side. Looking at the chip bags left out on the counter, Hiro and Erik probably hadn\u2019t included any meat in their snack, so that already was a red flag. And It would be extremely difficult to keep the two friends from getting into any kind of strenuous activities, as they seemed to always be doing things like running around or wrestling with each other. The whole thing seemed really irresponsible for a company to send out with barely any printed instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to bring his phone back up to try reaching one of his parents again, but before he could dial their number, he heard a loud crashing coming from upstairs. Dropping the phone, he bolted back up the stairs, taking them two at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool of your brother to invite me to stay the night,\u201d Hiro said as he leaned back in the beanbag chair and grabbed the controller again, brushing his long black hair out of his eyes with his free hand. \u201cAnd my parents are both out of town too, so I would have had to spend the night at my Aunt\u2019s otherwise. You know how much of a dictator she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Erik agreed as he rubbed his hand on his jeans to get rid of the chip dust and grabbed the second controller, sitting down on the edge of his bed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m glad you can stay. But I think I know why you\u2019re really excited to stay over.\u201d He flashed a mischievous grin towards Hiro as he booted up the game console. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller, skinnier boy tilted his head and frowned. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik leaned towards him and lowered his voice to just above a whisper. \u201cBecause you want to sneak into the bathroom while Kurt is taking a shower and spy on him again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro\u2019s eyes lit up as his olive cheeks turned red. \u201cS-shut up. That wasn\u2019t on purpose. I-I just really had to use the bathroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you use the downstairs one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d Hiro started, but couldn\u2019t think of a good response. \u201cJust\u2014shut up about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d Erik said, continuing to taunt. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather sneak in while *I\u2019m* in the shower?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no!\u201d Hiro stammered, becoming more and more flustered. \u201cTake that back!\u201d Throwing down the controller, he jumped to his feet and then leapt at Erik, half-tackling him as they rolled off the edge of the bed and landed on the ground with a loud crash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof!\u201d Erik said as his butt hit the thick carpet, which luckily absorbed most of the impact. After a momentary shock, he then grinned, pushing up against Hiro and forcing the lighter-weight boy over, until he was on top. His legs straddled Hiro\u2019s hips while he pinned his wrists to the ground, his smile becoming even wider. \u201cIs this how you like it? With me on top?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro struggled in vain to try and move Erik off of him, eventually resorting to kicking his legs as much as possible. \u201cGet off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what you\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik\u2019s retort was interrupted by the door to his bedroom slamming open. \u201cWhat the hell are you two doing?\u201d Kurt yelled, his imposing frame filling the doorway. \u201cStop that now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends both knew when Kurt was being serious. Erik rolled off and stood up, grinning sheepishly, while Hiro leaned up against the side of the bed, trying to catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you two both all right?\u201d Kurt asked, looking over both of them carefully. \u201cI called the number on the pill bottle, and you\u2019re not supposed to do anything too strenuous for a while after you take them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, bro, we\u2019re both fine.\u201d Erik said, waving his hand dismissively. \u201cRight, Hiro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers both turned their heads to look at Hiro, who wasn\u2019t responding, and was now leaning forward, hugging his knees. \u201cHiro?\u201d Kurt asked, bending down to get a closer look at him. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Hiro said between gasping breaths. \u201cNo, I just feel really weird. Like all tingly and\u2014and\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish his sentence, Hiro suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was like watching some strange form of nature strip in fast motion, like one of those clips of a plant rapidly growing. One second Hiro was sitting there, his normal self, and the next, accompanied by several harsh gasps, he began to sprout up! Erik and Kurt watched in silent awe as every gasping breath surged Hiro larger, wider, his legs stretching out in front of him across the floor, his back moving up along the bed, disrupting the covers there and tousling them around, his arms lengthening as he his thickening fingers gripped convulsively at the carpet. Hiro's chest heaved with his gasping, his shirt tightening around his chest, the hem riding up along his smooth, olive stomach, revealing it to the two brothers, the hems of his pants following a similar process, revealing more and more of his legs. His socks were bulging and deforming as well, as his feet grew longer and wider, his toes poking insistently at the ends of the socks, the threads straining to hold back his increasing girth... to no avail. With a loud RIPPING sound, those same digits poked triumphantly upward, tearing through the cloth prison attempting to entrap them, gently wiggling in the cool air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his clothes began to creak in similar fashion, clinging to his body as though trying to contain him, every inch of new flesh coming into existence a rude resistance that couldn't be denied. The button on his pants suddenly burst off, flying between the two brother's, pinging against the wall as the soft whisper of a zipper coming undone, Hiro's bulge appearing behind it, clad only in a pair of bright red briefs. Kurt looked away, embarrassed that his brother's friend was becoming increasingly exposed, but Erik looked on in awe, eyes scanning every inch of his friend, watching his growth raptly. The seams began to burst around his shoulders when the growth finally seemed to come to a halt, Hiro a panting mess on the floor. The young Asian man slowly calmed down, pressing his hands against the floor as he, shakily, rose to his feet. He let out a soft gasp as he realized he was looking directly into Kurt's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiro you... you're...\" Kurt stammered, unable to fully process what he had just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You GREW! That's so COOL!\" Erik immediately shouted, jumping up in the air, moving around Hiro as he did so. \"Look at you! You're as big as Kurt! This is AWESOME! Wait until everyone at school gets a load of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro was quiet as he looked over his body. Everything appeared to be proportionate to when he was his normal size... just bigger. It was as though someone had double clicked on him, selected resize, and just kept clicking the + until he Kurt's height. His shirt only half covered his torso now, looking more like a failing crop top, his back visibly rippling under the skin tight material as he shifted uncomfortable. Down below, his pants looked more like shorts, the waistband only held in place at this point from the sheer thickness of Hiro's waist. Even further down, his socks were ruined beyond repair, the ends of them blown open and stretched so much that, if he removed them, the entire thing would look like nothing more than rags. He ran his hands down his exposed skin, warm and soft, and undeniably <i>him</i>. He looked down at Erik and couldn't help but notice how... adorable his friend looked, so small and excited. Turning back to Kurt, Hiro blushed slightly and said, \"So... uh... this is kind of... weird, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than kind of.\" Kurt said, unable to stop a little laugh from escaping his lips. \"I'd have to say this is unprecedented.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hiro, how do you feel? How does being BIG feel?\" Erik asked excitedly, practically vibrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel normal just... bigger. Heavier too.\" Hiro said, moving his stance slightly, the floor creaking more than it used to under his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're stronger too! Think you can lift up my bed?\" Erik said, pointing at the furniture in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro scratched his head and said, \"Uh... maybe? I guess I could try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea seemed kind of silly but Hiro would be lying if he didn't want to know the answer himself. COULD he lift it up? Before he could even try, however, Kurt grabbed his arm and pulled him back slightly, surprised by the heft the boy now held in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Hiro! No physical exertions, remember? That's probably what made you like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro hesitated, relishing the feeling of Kurt's hand on his bare skin. His heart had just started thudding a bit more fiercely when Kurt let go again. \"O-Okay... I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second...\" Erik said, settling down enough to think something through. \"You think that us wrestling around made Hiro grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, after you both took those weird pills.\" Kurt said, frowning slightly again, both at the irresponsibility of his parents, himself at leaving them out, and the kids for just popping them unquestioningly into their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how come I didn't grow? Lame!\" Erik said, feeling a bit cheated now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you just didn't have to exert yourself as much because you're fa-a-aaaaah stockier than me.\" Hiro said, quickly catching himself before he accidentally said something hurtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... you might be right!\" Erik said, a mischievous gleam in his eyes. Before he could move, however, Kurt scooped him up in his arms, holding him fast in a bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't! I'm your brother, you think I don't recognize that look? No exertion!\" Kurt lectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come ON, bro! This is favoritism! I'm your brother, let me be BIG!\" Erik argued ridiculously, struggling and fighting while Hiro looked on, not quite sure what to do.</span></div></div>",

Moving back and forth as much as possible, he simultaneously banged his foot against Kurt's shin and pried at his thumb, forcing a quick but loud yelp of pain to escape from Kurt's lips and his grip to loosen slightly. Not much, but just enough for Erik to wriggle free and slip away. \"Can't stop me now!\" he exclaimed, dashing out the door and slamming it behind him. The sound of his small feet running faded down the two flights of stairs to the basement, where Kurt kept his weight set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erik WAIT!\" Kurt cried after him, grabbing at the door handle. \"Damn thing always sticks!\" It took a few seconds to yank it open, and Kurt then ran down the stairs to go after his brother. Hiro, still not used to his bigger size and partially constrained by the tight remnants of his clothing, followed behind him awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time both of them got to the basement, Erik had already worked up a sweat, struggling to lift the curling bar. The weight that Kurt had left on it was far too much for the twelve-year-old to even budge, so after a few seconds he gave up and ran over to the hand weights, picking up two ten-pounders and swinging them back and forth wildly. \"With this workout, I bet I grow way bigger than Hiro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis taller friend rolled his eyes, grinning. \"Always a competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt ran over as fast as he could and pulled Erik by the shirt collar. \"Put those down!\" he cried, yanking one with his free hand while causing Erik to drop the other, barely missing hitting Kurt's foot. \"What do you think you're doing??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik just ignored his brother, feeling a wave of dizziness wash over him. \"Oh boy, I think this is it!\" he cried out. With Kurt still grasping his shirt, the mess of Erik's red hair began rising upwards. It looked like he was taking a deep breath that never ended, his body expanding outwards and filling out his clothing. His midriff quickly became exposed, and his toes started ripping holes in his socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin twenty seconds, he was already as big as Hiro had gotten, but his growth was nowhere near done! The sound of fabric tearing filled the air as the seams down the sides of his pants ripped apart, revealing his bright green boxer-briefs containing a sizable bulge. Kurt, still doing his best to hold onto his younger brother's collar, now had to reach up slightly, and seconds later that part of the shirt ripped off in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is soooo coooooool...\" Erik exclaimed, his voice booming throughout the basement yet no less childish. He looked down his body, seeing his tattered clothes fall to the ground, except his underwear, which only had a matter of time remaining. \"I'm so much bigger than-- OW!\" He winced as his head bumped into the ceiling, shaking the house slightly and causing the framed posters on the wall to rattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, his growth seemed to stop there for now. Slouching slightly to avoid hitting his head again, Erik surveyed the room, thrilled to see that Hiro and Kurt were both eye level with his chest. Turning to Hiro, he flexed a little for his friend. \"What do you think, Hiro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's-- it's pretty cool,\" the blushing Asian boy responded, averting his gaze slightly but not fully taking his eyes off of his friend. \"Do you think we'll get bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Kurt quickly replied. \"Don't even think about trying! You're already about to outgrow this room, Erik. What would happen if you outgrew the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahh...\" The twelve-year-old seemed to relish the prospect more than Kurt had intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt cursed his parents for not responding to any of his calls or texts and racked his brain trying to think of what to do. If he forced the kids to stay home, they would be concealed from anyone else seeing, but if something triggered their growth again, that could prove disastrous. He could take them somewhere, like a hospital or the doctor's, but that ran the risk of having other people see the suddenly-giant boys which could prove problematic (not to mention Erik would have problems fitting in the backseat of his car). Or, they could just go outside and hide out in the woods behind their house for a while, until hopefully his parents got back in touch with what to do next. After a few minute's contemplation, he decided on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay!\" Kurt said, clapping his hands together, getting Hiro and Erik's attention, both boys turning to look at him. \"Let's go out back into the woods. It's out of the house so we don't have to worry about you two bringing it down and it's hidden enough that nobody will see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't bother to vocalize the thought \"Unless you grow bigger than the tree tops\" but judging by the small, mischievous smile on Erik's face and the more thoughtful, though still excited smile on Hiro's, the two boys had already had a similar thought. Trying not to dwell on that, Kurt waved his arm, indicating the stairs. Hiro dutifully walked up them, with Erik right behind,  Kurt bringing up the rear. It was a shock once again to be confronted with just how <i>big</i> Erik was. Just an hour ago he was a shrimpy little kid but now Kurt found himself hovering just below chest height on him. The basement ceiling was about nine feet tall so Erik, needing to slouch, was at least a few inches taller than that. Already he was the biggest twelve year old who had ever lived, probably even the biggest HUMAN who had ever lived by this point; just how much bigger would he end up getting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they reached the top of the stairs, Erik giggled as he realized he still had to crouch some to fit, trudging his way to the back door, his heavy bare feet slapping against the floor with enough force to make the entire room quake. Grabbing the doorknob, he twisted and pushed with such force that the entire thing came off its hinges, Erik shocked to suddenly be holding the door up like it was made of balsa wood. \"Whoops! Guess I don't know my own strength!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awkwardly stepped to the side until both Kurt and Hiro had left before trying to fit the door back on, his tongue poking cutely out the side of his mouth as he struggled. Finally, he seemed to have gotten it back in place... only for it to fall flat seconds later. \"Aw.. CRUD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt couldn't help but chuckle, covering his mouth as he did so. He could tell that Erik had been on the verge of swearing but had abstained due to his older brother's presence. He slapped the kid on the back and said, \"Don't sweat it, we'll worry about that later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik huffed, stretching up, his arms rising above his head. \"Mmmmm! Okay big bro. Man, it feels nice to be out in the open! Come on, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately took off running, the vibrations in the ground dying off as he got further away, his long legs carrying him far and fast. Kurt had to stumble forward a few steps to avoid being dragged to the ground in the wake of Erik's run, the displaced air pulling at him insistently. Hiro quickly chased after his friend, with Kurt chasing them both, shouting, \"Don't run! Don't exert yourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giggling boys disappeared into the wood, Kurt fast on their heels. He had gone about thirty feet deep, far enough that the house had disappeared and the near silence of the forest surrounded them, when he ran smack into something huge. He fell back onto his butt, shaking his head slightly before looking up into the grinning face of his little...er...<i>younger</i> brother. He had hit Erik's torso and bounced back like he had run into a brick wall, the giant lad not even budging an inch from his spot. \"Sorry about that big bro... just wanted to test something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down, grabbing his brother's hand, pulling him easily to his feet... and off his feet! Erik's grin only widened as he saw how easy it was to lift his older brother up off the ground, leaving him dangling in the air using only one of his arms! He let go and Kurt fell to his feet, a look of awe unable to leave his features. Erik puffed his chest out proudly and said, \"I'm pretty strong now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt slowly walked closer, pressing his hands against his brother's thick stomach. Grunting, he began to push, his arms flexing, biceps bulging, but Erik stood stock still as though nothing was happening, hands on his hips. He watched in amusement as Kurt's warm, slightly calloused hands pushed against his midsection, the flesh giving slightly before becoming immovable. Erik could barely feel the pressure on his body. In fact... he took a deep, deep breath, letting out a little grunt of his own, pushing his stomach out as far as it would go. The sudden inflation shocked Kurt, the once soft stomach he had been pushing against suddenly growing bigger, tauter, his arms buckling as the slight mound of flesh pressed insistently against him, knocking him back onto his butt. Erik laughed loudly, his booming voice echoing around them, but not maliciously. \"Oh man big bro! You should have seen the look on your face! Guess all those snacks didn't hurt me the way you said they would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik, who had learned to brush off taunts from classmates about his weight, who had seen how Hiro looked at him sometimes, in comparison with his brother, finding him lacking, was deeply proud that this thick, mockable body was <i>strong</i>. Hiro watched this whole a slightly open mouth, his cheeks flushing as Erik began to flex, twisting his body into different poses, that infectious grin plastered on his face. He had never really seen him fully in this light before, his eyes usually being drawn to Kurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which... the older male scrambled to his feet and punched Erik lightly on the stomach. \"Okay, you've had your fun now big guy. How about we just sit down and think this whole situation through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whyyyyyy though?\" Erik said, sighing slightly, running a hand through his fiery red hair. \"What's so BAD about this? Being big is AWESOME! I like being big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do but it's not practical! If you stay this big or get bigger you won't even be able to fit in the house! What about school? Or a normal life? Won't you get lonely being so much bigger?\" Kurt insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik pointed at Hiro and said, \"Forget school! Who needs it? I got Hiro and that's all I need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Kurt asked, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry big bro, we'll keep you around too.\" Erik chuckled, clapping his brother on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... I appreciate including me but we really need to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, can't hear you!\" Erik said, turning. \"Too many trees to climb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, Kurt clasped his arms around his brother's middle, clinging to him as he suddenly began to run. Digging his feet into the ground, Kurt was immediately aware of how fruitless this endeavor would be, the ground furrowing up before he was lifted completely up into the air, his legs flapping behind him like a wind sock as Erik barreled through the woods, looking for a particularly sturdy tree to start climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro, watching all of this, thought carefully about his next move.</span></div></div>",

He shared Erik's enthusiasm for growing bigger, and judging by how much the redheaded boy was exerting himself, if Hiro didn't do something soon, Erik would leave him in the dust. Luckily, he knew just what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you can have fun without me!\" Hiro grinned as he took off running after Erik and Kurt, zigging and zagging around the trees in a semi-haphazard manner. His new size was becoming easier and easier to deal with, and his balance and strength were catching up too. He even tried leaping and grabbing a few lower-hanging branches just for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, he caught site of the two brothers again. Erik had stopped in front of a tree that looked to be one of the bigger ones in the forest, at least seventy feet tall. The majestic oak was old and sturdy, its trunk as wide as Kurt was tall, with thick branches spaced out evenly all the way up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Kurt's grip had slipped from hanging onto his brother's waist to be more around his knees. Erik seemed to shoulder the extra baggage like it was nothing, grabbing onto the lowest-hanging branch and starting to hoist himself up. The wood creaked and groaned slightly under the boy's weight, but held firm. \"I wonder if I'll get to the top of this tree before I end up outgrowing it!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I can help it,\" Hiro chuckled, reaching the tree and leaning his hand against it. He had worked up a sweat from his dash through the woods, and his clothes seemed worse for the wear, the rips in the seems having become wider. He considered removing some of them, but as a familiar tingling feeling washed over him, he realized that was soon going to be a moot point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik had reached about a third the way up the tree, his own pulse elevated but still feeling strong. Not able to keep his balance while hanging onto his brother, Kurt had finally given up and slid down to the lowest branch. He was impressed by the stamina Erik was displaying. Typically his brother would have tired out of doing something like this by now, but either due to the increased strength brought on by his growth or another side effect of the pill, Erik seemed to not be slowing down at all. Kurt shook his head, wondering how he'd be able to get out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a higher branch, Erik looked down, smiling at the older teen. \"Not able to keep up, 'big' bro? That's okay, I won't\u2014 WHOA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik stopped mid-sentence as his eyes widened, and his mouth dropped open in a gasp. Turning his head, Kurt saw what had stunned his brother so much. Hiro's head was now rising past the branch he was on, and seemed to be going up faster and faster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Asian boy bit his lip, letting out a moan as he grew. His shirt finally gave up and ripped completely apart, the tattered threads falling to the forest floor below. His ragged pants soon followed, leaving him only in the straining fabric of his briefs and socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels really weird. But kinda... good...\" Hiro's amplified voice trailed off as he looked down at his body, more and more of which kept coming into existence. Since he was standing as opposed to lying horizontal as he had been the first time, he felt a much stronger sense of vertigo than before, the world around him rapidly shrinking away. He had to adjust his stance slightly as he grew, his balance being thrown off by the sheer force of his body's growth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got bigger and bigger, his feet soon overcame the shreds of fabric around them that used to be his socks. A few seconds after that, his red briefs were the last article of clothing to go, splitting down the sides and falling away, leaving him completely nude. Hiro blushed slightly at his sudden exposure, but his arousal from becoming so large also quickly became apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik watched in hushed awe as his friend's head crept up towards him, finally reaching the branch he had paused on. The growth seemed to be slowing there, and Hiro turned his gaze up from his own huge body to see his now (comparatively) diminutive friend gawking at him. He brought up his hand in an awkward wave. \"Hi, Erik.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiro!\" Erik beamed. \"Y-you're so HUGE! A real giant now!\" As big as Erik had previously been, Hiro now stood at least two, if not three, times bigger! Though Erik still had not yet outgrown his own underwear, they were tight enough to reveal that he, too, had become extremely excited about seeing his best friend like this, both with the increased size as well as with seeing his trim figure completely uncovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down the tree, Kurt's own cheeks reddened as he realized he was just below eye level with Hiro's shaft. He tried to avert his gaze, but a sweet, yet slightly spicy smell wafted into his nostrils, what he realized had to be the scent of Hiro's boyhood. He grimaced, as he contemplated just running away as far as he could from the situation, but he couldn't leave his brother behind, no matter what happened to him or how big he got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kurt tried to decide what to do, he suddenly heard a loud sound above that made him look back up, concerned about just what he was going to see next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sky, partially hidden both by the bulk of his younger brother, the intimidatingly tall stature of his brother's friend, and the tree tops themselves, was still visible enough to show dark clouds gathering high above, thunder rumbling through the area ominously. Kurt cursed under his breath as he realized a storm was rolling in, the air pressure noticeably different, the air itself feeling heavier and wetter. Hiro also looked up, curious, squinting as droplets of water slowly began to pepper his face. Erik frowned and covered his head, looking up in annoyance. \"Hey big bro! I think it's starting to rain! What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take cover!\" Kurt immediately shouted, knowing that their next course of action would probably be one he would come to regret. \"Back to the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro nodded and immediately turned to Erik, holding his hands out, ready to help him back to the ground... but his energetic friend was already on the move, dropping down easily, landing with an earth shaking THUMP that made Kurt wobble slightly on his feet. \"Wait, Erik, don't run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt's words fell on deaf ears as Erik's big bare feet began to slap against the ground, propelling him forward, leaving his older brother in the dust. Before Kurt could give chase, he felt a warm, soft pair of hands grab him gently around his chest, his body weight seemingly insignificant as he was lifted into the air as easily as a child. Hiro blushed slightly as he shifted Kurt over to his hip, holding him like he would have a toddler. Kurt chuckled, looking a little embarrassed himself. \"Uh... thanks for the lift big guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No problem!\" Hiro squeaked out, his unnaturally loud voice booming through the forest, almost rivaling the burst of thunder. He quickly began to move, Kurt nestled close to his chest, arms wrapped around his thick torso as best he could. Hiro was weaving through the trees somewhat clumsily, bumping into trees here and there, branches snapping, trunks shuddering, roots creaking audibly as they tried to hold fast in the ground. It wasn't long before he spotted Erik bursting from the tree line, running immediately back into the house. Hiro let Kurt down, the older brother following quickly. Hiro himself, however, was facing a bit of an issue: the door was barely half his height and his body was MUCH wider than it. Sighing, he got down on his hands and knees, approaching the open door. It was like he was staring into a child's playhouse, everything in perfect miniature. Turning himself slightly, he pushed his way through the doorway, head and shoulders. He felt himself stop slightly at his chest. Breathing out as much as he could, he managed to slip inside... until his hips met similar resistance. Sighing, Hiro wiggled, back and forth, his slender hips powerful enough to shake the entire house as he tried to squeeze his butt through. Finally, after several minutes of tense maneuvering, he managed to pull through, his butt cracking the door frame on either side, the opening widening more than it was meant to. Pulling his legs and feet in, Hiro knocked the door closed, the opening mostly filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while Hiro was struggling, Erik had found a towel and was drying himself off, Kurt in fast pursuit behind him. \"Erik! You have GOT to stop moving around so much! This is getting WAY out of hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to the forest was your idea, big bro, did you think I was just going to sit on my butt all day?\" Erik asked, throwing the towel aside and glaring down at his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now? YES!\" Kurt shouted, moving in closer, jabbing his finger into Erik's softer chest. \"Until we can get this sorted out, you need to--OOF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik had pulled his hips back slightly before forcefully bringing them forward, his thick middle bashing into Kurt's body with enough power to knock him back a few feet. Erik immediately moved in closer, pinning his brother against the wall with his bulk, his shadowy face looming overhead. \"I don't NEED to do anything. What YOU need to do is stop trying to order me around! This is the coolest thing that's EVER happened to me, I'm feeling REALLY good about it and you're just... just... trying to get me to stop! I don't WANT to stop! I want MORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though on cue, a flash of lightning shone brightly outside, casting everything in a stark white light before a crack of thunder BOOMED loudly, rattling the dishes in the cabinets. Erik let out a little moan as that tingling sensation filled him up once more. Kurt, still pinned, could only look on in horror as his brother began to expand again. They were currently on the first floor of the house, in the bathroom, and within seconds Erik's head was already almost at the ceiling. His body expanded and stretched before Kurt's eyes, filling his vision with seemed like acres of flesh, his brother's soft midsection pressing more and more forcefully against him, his body rising slightly off the floor as he was dragged up along the wall. A loud creaking sound filled the air as Erik's head pressed insistently against the ceiling, several cracks radiating out from the point of contact, the entire ceiling bulging upward slightly at the force exerting itself against it. Erik's briefs started to give way with barely a whisper of protest, the threads unraveling and failing against the swelling flesh within. Erik's erection had died down somewhat due to the cold water and his anger, but now that he was growing again, it was back in full force. Kurt, much to his horror, could feel the hot, insistent thickness pressing up against his own body from below. The ceiling protested and whined, the cracks growing longer and deeper, until a loud CRACK filled the air, Erik's shoulders and neck straightening out as he was able to fully LIFT his head up past the limits of the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the back of the house, where Hiro was, the sound of the crack immediately got his attention. Lifting himself up on all fours, Hiro carefully wound his way through the house, his knees accidentally smashing a kitchen chair to kindling as he passed through, his hips knocking pictures down off the walls as he made his way down the hall. By the time he reached the bathroom, he was met with a startling sight. Erik's head and shoulders and chest had all passed up through the ceiling and, judging by the commotion overhead, had entered into one of the upstairs rooms, his feet growing wider and longer along the bathroom tiles, cracking and shattering them from their standing weight alone. Shifting, those same feet smashed to pieces more tiles, the entire house shaking as Erik moved around, Kurt now fully trapped behind a belly that was almost as tall as he was, the wall behind him struggling to contain Erik's increasing bulk. Still the younger boy continued to grow, the hole in the ceiling widening, debris falling down around him, some striking Hiro, harmlessly, on his head and shoulders. The Asian boy's mouth dropped open as he realized that, not only was Erik now fully nude, but his erect dick was swinging free, closer to his face than he was strictly comfortable with. He blushed so fiercely he could feel the heat radiating off his cheeks and yet... he couldn't turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik chuckled, his voice thundering louder than the actual thunder, the power in his mirth rattling the windows even as his slightest movements shook the house. \"Now THIS... is AWESOME!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erik's messy crop of red hair had pushed through the floor of his second floor bedroom and continued to rise. The hole he had created continued to expand around the growing midsection of his body as he watched his possessions get knocked over by the force of his growth. His bed, desk, TV\u2014 they all were now so much smaller than before, knocked on their sides without him even trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his shoulders and chest passed into the room, he reached out and placed his had around his dresser. It was made of oak wood, heavy and nearly immovable before, but now he could lift it up off the floor as easily as a jewelry box. He tilted the dresser forward, giggling as his clothes spilled out on the floor. \"Guess none of THESE will fit me anymore!\" his voice boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movement of Erik's torso caused Kurt to become unpinned from the wall, and he slid back down to the first floor bathroom. Momentarily dazed, he quickly jumped to his feet and made a dash out into the hall, as Erik's thick legs and feet began to fill all the available space in the room. Kurt ran smack into Hiro's side, letting out an audible \"OOF\" as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt nearly fell over, but Hiro reached out and wrapped his long arm around his shoulder, steadying him. \"Y-you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding but still frazzled, Kurt instinctively leaned into Hiro's warm, firm shoulder. \"Yeah, t-thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro felt like his entire body was blushing, as his eyes darted back and forth between the older boy he was supporting, and the younger, much larger (and fully naked) boy that was filling up the the space before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP! Within a few more seconds, Erik's head had collided with yet another ceiling, this time with even more force than before. Both Hiro and Kurt felt the impact as it shook the whole house, and caused debris to fall down and mix with the jumbled mess that was already Erik's bedroom. Being so powerful, causing so much destruction\u2014 it filled him with a certain sense of thrill, something he wanted to maximize at all costs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching his hands up, he pressed them against the ceiling, then used the power of his bulk to force upwards along with his head. The ceiling was no match for the velocity of the growing twelve-year-old, and soon startled to crumble beneath his hands. \"Yessss!\" he cried out, delighted at his handiwork. \"Look how strong I am! I can probably bring this whole house down if I wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt grimmaced, realizing that idea was an inevitability at this rate, whether intentional on Erik's part or not. He racked his brain to think of something to calm his brother down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, it's still storming outside,\" he called up as loud as he possibly could. \"You don't want to get soaked again, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Erik's head was in the attic, and his erection had made its way into his bedroom, as hard as he had ever been before in his life. He looked down at it and smiled, ignoring his brother for the moment. He swung his hips back and forth slightly, which caused his shaft to sweep the broken bedframe, desk, and dresser from side to side along what still remained of his bedroom floor. A slight tingle ran down his spine, and for a few seconds, Erik closed his eyes and pictured his cock causing destruction on an even grander scale, knocking over trees or plunging into buildings. The thought excited him even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this brief fantasy, though, he opened his eyes again and looked back up, seeing that his head was still just partway into the attic; this growth spurt seemed to have finally halted. A slight frown crossed his face for a brief moment, but then disappeared with a shrug of his shoulders. \"Nah, I guess not,\" he finally answered his brother's question. \"Still, it would've been cool to break through all the ceilings in the house in one spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Erik's legs suddenly started to bend and lower, as the giant boy moved into a seated position. The house creaked and shuddered as his body knocked even more walls and floors aside, making room for him to sit. Hiro instinctively jerked back away from Erik, pulling Kurt back with him as a mother would pull a child back from a hot stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from a seated position, Erik's head was still in the second story of the house, but enough of the floor had been demolished that he could look down and see Hiro and his brother below him. \"Okay, bro, you got what you wanted. I'm sitting on my butt. What do you want to do now?\" He grinned mischievously as he stretched out his legs on either side of the two smaller boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt gulped, noticing for the first time that his brother's feet were almost as long as he was tall. And, the way he was sitting, Erik was making no attempts to hide his arousal, which still rose up from his hips at full mast. He turned around, only to realize that Hiro, too, had moved to a similar seated position. While he was nowhere near as large as his brother was (at least, not yet), he, too, seemed to be as excited about the situation as Erik was. Unlike his brother, though, he found that Hiro's presence and mannerisms were calming, even as a giant, almost\u2014 attractive? No, that's not how he felt. At least, Kurt didn't think so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window, Kurt saw that the storm seemed to be dying down, though the rain continued. Maybe it would be best to just make a break for it, Kurt thought, and go try and find someone who could help. But who would he go to? Police? A hospital? Who would even believe him? And he couldn't just abandon his brother like that, no matter how big he was getting, could he? No, he decided. He would stick it out with the two growing boys until the end, and try to figure out the best way to handle this so that they didn't get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" Erik cleared his throat, growing impatient while waiting for his brother to answer. \"If you don't have any ideas, maybe I can provide a suggestion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt gulped, fearful for what his brother would suggest</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saul felt anticipation build through him as he watched the familiar sights pass by the wagon window. It had been one year since he had left for Mages Academy to pursue his education in the magical arts. It had been tough, leaving home and living away from his family, but once a year he was allowed to go home and visit his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wagon rolled by, he couldn't help but notice how much things have changed. Some of the stores had closed down and been replaced, some of the buildings had been remodeled, and there were a lot more people than he remembered. Thinking about how things have changed made him wonder if he had changed as well. He was still the somewhat scrawny boy with chestnut brown hair and steel grey eyes. He wasn't very large and would be considered underweight compared to the other village boys, but then again mages weren't known for being muscle bound brutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the wagon stopped in front of his home. A wave of nostalgia washed over Saul as he stepped out and stood in front of his family's bakery, the Golden Crumb. It was a small, humble ordinary bakery that supplied bread and baked goods to many of the locals. The wagon man helped him unload his luggage down and rode off, leaving Saul by himself to take in the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess I should head in and see if they need my help.\" Saul grabbed his luggage's handle and walked through the doors. Immediately he was greeted by the door bell, the sound welcoming him back home. Inside there were shelves were covered with breads, pastries and cakes all ready to be sold...though there were a lot less than he was used to seeing. Before he could make any deeper observation, someone came in from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Golden Crust, how may I- Saul!?\" A small blur rushed from behind the counter and tackled Saul, nearly knocking him down. \"Saul, you're home!\" Tomas said, hugging his brother tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm home.\" Tomas smiled and ruffled the hair of his little brother. Tomas looked exactly like he left him, a small, smiling skinny boy with golden brown hair that resembled wheat and blue eyes. \"Where's Mom and Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom's at the market and Dad went to the lumberyard to order firewood.\" Tomas told him as he pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's running the shop?\" Saul asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\" Tomas said, proudly puffing out his chest. It wasn't very impressive considering how flat it was, but Tomas seemed to think it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I should help you out until Mom and Dad get back.\" Saul said, rolling up the sleeves of his robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but you gotta take orders from me! We can't have you baking any bad bread, otherwise you'll scare off the last of our customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last?\" Saul frowned as he followed his brother to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, ever since that Duke Huffington and his bullying sons bought off most of the stores and land around here, he's been pressuring other shop owners and stealing their customers so he can force them to sell their business to him for cheap. But not the Golden Crust! We're gonna show him that his new bakery down the road can't hold a candle to the bakery that's been in our family for four generations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Saul said, though a part of him started to worry. That would explain the crowd up the street and why there was so much less being sold in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomas didn't seem to dwell on it however, as he went to a sack of flour and lifted it. Or at least, tried to. The poor boy could barely get one end of it a few inches off the ground. He was too skinny and weak to be able to lift a thirty pound sack. In fact, Tomas looked like he was the exact same size and weight as when Saul left him the year before. He should have at least grown a little bit, especially since this was a period when you could practically see a boy grow before your eyes. <i>At least he's one thing that hasn't changed.</i> He thought and went to help his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night their parents came home and they had a splendid dinner to celebrate Saul's return. Their mother and father both didn't show and concern about the duke, and instead focused their attention on Saul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Saul, did you learn any new tricks at that fancy school of yours?\" Their Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh plenty, I've spent hours studying on all sorts of spells, potions and other stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you show us one of your magic tricks?\" Tomas asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spells, not tricks. Tricks are for street magicians with no real magical talent.\" Saul corrected him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just show me a trick already!\" Tomas bounced in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaul rolled his eyes. \"Alright, let me try this new spell I've been learning.\" He pointed at Tomas and chanted the spell. A spark flew out and hit his brother in the chest. The four of them waited anxiously to see the effect, but seconds dragged by and nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" Tomas asked, rubbing the spot the spark had hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, that should have worked.\" Saul frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly what were you trying to do?\" Their mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was trying to make Toma's hair and toenails grow ten inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Tomas quickly reached up to the top of his head, then pulled up his feet to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saul...\" Their father gave a warning tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just joking Dad.\" Saul said, smiling. \"Here, let me show you some other stuff that will are guranteed to work!\" The rest of the night Saul performed simple spells, keeping his family entertained. By bed time they had completely forgotten about the little \"failed\" spell from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling into his old bed, Saul sighed contently. It felt good to be home again. Although he would only be there for a short time, Saul was looking forward to helping out his family. He was especially looking forward to spending time with Tomas, the 10 year old easily got excited about anything. Closing his eyes, he went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

They are very friendly but also very competitive with each other, and when Sean starts to experience a growth spurt that pushes him a little past Ryley in height, Ryley becomes jealous, and finds a way to try and catch up with him, but overcompensates, leading Sean as the jealous one looking for a way to grow, and a vicious cycle begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Jason (17) and Kyle (12) (both foxes). Kyle wants desperately to have his older brother spend time with him, talk with him, and pay attention to him, but Jason is too involved with being a teenager and hanging out with other kids his own age.

His wish starts to take effect the next morning, but as he gets bigger and bigger, he finds that getting Jason to pay attention to him might be harder than it looks!</span></div></div>",

Of course, \"pinned\" wasn't really the right word, as Tyler's legs and arms couldn't even reach all the way around the chest of the bigger, more muscular tiger. But it didn't really matter; after all, they were just roughhousing and having fun with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's two for me, none for you!\" Tyler exclaimed as he rolled off onto the floor. \"I win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, dang it!\" Aaron pouted playfully. \"C'mon, best three out of five?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rolled his eyes and shook his head. \"Nah, Aaron, I know you're letting me win. Thanks, but I think we can stop... for now.\" Leaning in, however, Tyler gave him a playful punch on the arm. \"But some day, I'll be as big as you-- or even bigger! Then we'll have a fair fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Smiling softly and nodding, Aaron nevertheless couldn't help himself from doubting that. After all, the ten-year-old tiger was definitely on the scrawny side. At 4'4\" and 80 pounds, he was even outsized by some of the mouse and bat kids in his class. Why, when he was his age, Aaron would've been almost a foot taller and twice as thick. He knew that Tyler would probably hit a growth spurt at some point, but he was starting to think that might not be enough to help him catch up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, Aaron thought to himself as he watched Tyler start doing some sit ups, I can find something that could provide a little boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall brawny tiger walked down the aisles of the nutrition store, not even sure that they'd have what he was looking for here. Sure, he'd bought plenty of protein shakes and muscle enhancers here before, but he had naturally been graced by a height over seven feet tall, so it had never occurred to him to look for anything that helped overall size before. At least, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to go through nearly three-quarters of the store before he found something that looked like it would fit the bill. <i>QuickSprout Powder</i>, the label read. <i>Can provide up to an extra six inches in height in just eight weeks! Just stir two spoonfulls in with water!</i> Scanning the rest of the shelves around it, Aaron didn't see anything else that looked similar, and he realized he was holding the last bottle. Figuring that it was either a hot ticket item or on clearance, he quickly made up his mind to purchase it, bringing it to the counter along with his regular monthly supplements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps he made up his mind a little too quickly, however, for if he read the rest of the bottle, Aaron would've noticed a warning label: <i>WARNING: Keep out of the reach of children who are going through or haven't yet entered puberty. If a child ingests this product, please call this number immediately...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooping in two spoonfuls into a mostly-full glass, Aaron watched as the powder quickly dissolved. He brought it up to his nose, sniffing it. There wasn't any odor as far as he could tell, and the powder seemed to fade into the water, nearly completely invisible. \"Hmmm, I suppose a third spoonful wouldn't hurt,\" he murmured, as he mixed another one in. Thoroughly stirring the drink, he then brought it into the living room, where Tyler was lying on the couch, watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Aaron said as he handed Tyler the glass. \"Try this. It's something I picked up at the nutrition store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger tiger grabbed the glass and peered into it. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron paused, trying to decide just how much of the truth he should tell Tyler. \"It's... something that will make sure you grow up well,\" he finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Tyler brought the glass to his lips. He slowly lapped at it first, then, as his eyes lit up, he started drinking it faster. Aaron noticed the tip of his brother's tail seemed to flick back and forth excitedly as he drank the mixture. He must like it, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished, he lowered the glass and let out a loud, satisfied sigh. \"Aaah, that was great!\" he exclaimed. \"I might want some more of that soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" Aaron chuckled, \"well, I'll keep it in the pantry next to my stuff. Just let me know when.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Tyler beamed, as he suddenly leapt to his feet, seemingly bouncy and full of energy. This startled Aaron, but after a moment he shrugged it off. Kids, he thought, shaking his head. </span></div></div>",

With the supplement, Tyler should grow up to be around the average size of a normal tiger by the time he becomes an adult. With Aaron's brotherly duty done for the day he was about to head off to his room, but he noticed something strange about his little sibling. The drink seemed to have made him hyper, causing him to fidget about but he could notice a different movement coming from the tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tyler, can you try and hold still for a minute?\" Aaron asks him as he places two paws on his shoulders to steady him. With his brother standing still he could still see him moving, as if he was rising. Aaron's eyes widen in shock as he takes a step away from Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"  Tyler asked. \"Is there something on my face?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back Aaron could see it more clearly. Slowly but surely his brother was getting bigger. \"I uh... Think you're growing?\" He said in disbelief. Didn't the bottle say it would take eight weeks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother's eyes lit up. \"Huh?! Am I really?\" he exclaimed, looking down at his body. By this point his midriff was clearly visible and it was only beginning to show more of the white fur of his belly as his shirt was riding up his body. \"I am!\" He yelled triumphantly. \"That stuff really does help me grow up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron however wasn't so excited, he could tell something was wrong. Grabbing the bottle again he scanned through the label for any clues until he saw that warning sign he neglected earlier. \"Crap.\" was the only thing he could mutter. Tyler's clothes were starting to look tight on his body, his belly button just beginning to show. By now you guessed he had grown a whole foot! Aaron wanted his little brother to grow a bit taller, but as he looked at the growing tiger boy in front of him visibly get bigger he was getting a bit worried. <i>If it stopped right about now it would be great</i>, he thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anxiety welled in Aaron's stomach as he waited for his little brother to stop growing, his clothes clinging tighter and tighter to his lithe form. By now Tyler was passing the 6 foot mark, much taller than any 10 year old had any right to be. \"Wow,\" Tyler said as he grinned up at his bigger brother. \"I might even get bigger than you!\" The thought made Aaron uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is serious, bro!\" Aaron chided at his little brother. \"I didn't notice the warning on this supplement stuff, It's not supposed to be given to kids as young as you! What if you never stop growing or something?\" Tyler flicked his tail in excitement and looked away in thought, that grin still plastered on his face as he giggled to himself. Aaron could almost see what he was thinking about. Him, stomping downtown and crushing cars, only getting bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Aaron wasn't paying that much attention to his brother's growth to realize that he was almost eye level with him. A loud ripping sound brought both of the brothers back to reality. Tufts of orange and white fur jutted out the rips in his shirt and pants as clothes tore apart on Tyler's growing body. Tyler watched in awe as his clothes turned to rags as he outgrew them, his smile widening when he looks at you and realizing he is surpassing you in height. He flexed his arms and legs which caused most of his clothes to practically burst off of him until he was left naked. The only clothing that survived were his white elastic briefs that were doing a good job of containing the increasing mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taller than you.\" Tyler smugly said. Aaron turned his head away and crossed his arms, annoyed and embarrassed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but you're still just a scrawny kid.\" Aaron pouted. It was then a pair of hands grasped his shoulders nearly causing him to topple over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? How about we wrestle then?\" Tyler said as he pushed against his brother with all his might. Aaron quickly retaliated by pushing back against Tyler's bare chest, forcing him to take a few steps backwards. Even though Tyler was a bit bigger than Aaron now, the older brother had a lot of muscle to work with. Compared to their play wrestles before Aaron was going all in, wrapping his arms around Tyler's torso trying to force him to go down. After some struggling Tyler stumbled backwards and Aaron released his hold. They locked eyes for a moment, they both knew that Aaron was fighting an uphill battle. Tyler was about 8 foot now and was only going to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost at they same time they dived towards each other, their hands making contact together as they engaged in a final pushing battle. Aaron was able to push Tyler back at the start but was starting to get pushed back himself as he felt his brother's fingers swell in his hands. Aaron may have been physically stronger, but he starting to have trouble competing with his brother's sheer size. His muscles were beginning to burn when his brother's round ears brushed against the ceiling as he reached the 9 foot mark. He found himself on the defensive as his younger sibling was leaning over him and pushing all his weight onto him. Before long Aaron's arms gave out and he tumbled to the floor, his giant brother collapsing right on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both lay there panting heavily. \"I... Win!\" Tyler finally gasped. Aaron's muscles were burning so much he could barely move and he could distinctly feel the sensation of his brother growing and getting heavier on top of him. After giving some heavy pats on Tyler's sides he eventually gets the message and crawls off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down a bit and sitting up Aaron manages to reply. \"You cheated.\" Was all he could say in-between pants, still sore that he lost to his brother in a real match despite the circumstances. Leaning back and sitting cross-legged, Tyler still looked really imposing with his size. He had doubled in height in such a short amount of time and he was still getting bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler started to stand up. \"Well you-\" A loud crash interrupted him as his head impacted the ceiling. \"Owowow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This house wasn't designed for 10 foot tall kids, Tyler.\" Aaron remarked. The younger tiger just grunted as he rubbed his head. With his breath finally slowing down, Aaron started thinking about the situation. Tyler was still growing and the fact that his growth shows no signs of stopping anytime soon burned in his mind. He had to find a way to stop it. The supplement bottle perhaps? Maybe it has a contact number or address?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The elastic of his briefs had finally stretched past their limit and had ripped apart, leaving Tyler now completely naked. While Tyler didn\u2019t seem to mind in the slightest, Aaron turned his head away and blushed as he crossed the room to the table, picked up his phone, and dialed the number, setting the bottle down as he waited for it to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for a seemingly endless number of rings, the other end finally clicked. Aaron opened his mouth and began to talk, before he realized a recorded message was playing. \u201cThank you for calling Pandora Supplements, makers of QuickSprout Powder. Our offices are currently closed, but if you leave a message with your name and phone number...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap,\u201d Aaron rolled his eyes in disgust. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d, Tyler\u2019s now-much-louder voice filled the room, \u201cis that more of what I had?\u201d Before Aaron could react, Tyler reached down and grabbed the bottle and unscrewed the top. \u201cOh wow, it\u2019s still almost full! If just a little could make me this big, just imagine...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler flashed a devilish, toothy grin, and Aaron nearly dropped his phone in horror. \u201cNo, wait!\u201d he cried out, but before he could do anything, Tyler had lifted the supplement jar to his mouth, tipped it over, and dumped the entire contents inside, swallowing it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuck,\u201d he said, sticking his tongue out. \u201cThat stuff\u2019s not nearly as good without any water. But if\u2014\u201c He stopped mid-sentence as his tail began to twitch back and forth rapidly, knocking books off of shelves and pictures off of the wall, and his fur began to stick out on end, like some sort of electric current was running through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron\u2019s heart nearly jumped out of his chest. Tyler was already too big for their house with just the two scoops from before. After downing the whole bottle, he had no idea what would happen! He had to think fast for what his next step should be.</span></div></div>",

That was all Aaron needed to see to spur him to action, he had to get out of the house before he ends up being crushed! Spinning around he sprinted for the exit of the house while behind him the sounds of chaos grew louder. Floorboards creaking, furniture breaking, it was a cacophony. Darting left and right as he navigated past the rooms to the front of the house he risked a look behind him. Dust and orange fur was all he saw as one of Tyler's arms burst through one of the interior walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron continued fleeing until he got to the street. He cringed at the sound of splintering wood and crumbling stonework, imagining the carnage his brother's growing form is causing within. A foot suddenly burst out the side of the house, followed by a pair of hands on the other side. Through the windows and openings of the house all Aaron could see was striped orange fur. The roof of the house jostled violently as Tyler presumably burst through to the attic. Aaron's jaw dropped as the roof seemingly lifted off the house, carried upward by a mass of orange fur that was Tyler's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no more room in the house to grow, Tyler began to sit up. The roof on his back slid down and crumbled onto the floor with a deafening crash while his legs destroyed the remaining walls of his house as he readjusted to a kneeling position. Tyler straightened his back and looked around as he got used to new perspective. He was at least 50 feet tall and was still rapidly getting bigger. His grin returned as his eyes rested on the ground below him. By now his thighs were spilling out the boundaries of the house and his vision was still getting higher and higher. \"I'm huge!\" He proudly announced, his giant voice echoing throughout the neighborhood. \"I think I'm gonna end up putting Godzilla to shame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was considering running again as his brother kept growing and a wall of fur that was his leg was slowly but surely approaching. He took a few steps back as he observed his sheer size, the neighbor's two story house barely reaching the top of his thighs in his kneeling position. He froze however when Tyler turned his head to look at him. \"Aaron?\" He boomed. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was nearly knocked off his feet as the young tiger swerved his legs around to kneel towards the road, the sheer weight of his body causing the ground beneath him to shake. Aaron guessed by now he was about 75 feet tall now, his brother's knees were even beginning to encroach on the street he was standing on. \"You're so small!\" He teased as a huge smirk appeared on his face. \"You're kinda like a little bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up Aaron couldn't help but feel intimidated. The size difference was immense and was only getting more extreme as time went by. Even now he couldn't help but feel like a trapped bug as both his thighs grew around him. He could almost see the white fur of Tyler's under-thigh thicken as the walls around him got higher. It also didn't help that Tyler was in the nude and not ashamed at all, his package suspended in plain view as Aaron stood below him.\"T-Tyler, this is really bad, okay?!\" Aaron tried to yell up to him. \"People could get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the constant rumbling sound caused by the young tiger's constant growth, he remained silent. Panic was beginning to well up in Aaron's chest as his 100 foot tall brother continued staring at him, silently smiling. Was he planning something? Or did he simply not hear Aaron because of the size difference? Tyler's body began to shift, he would find out in a second.</span></div></div>",

He grabbed on to two fistfuls of orange and black fur, trying to keep his balance as Tyler rose to his feet. Looking out, he could see the entire neighborhood surrounding them, even the biggest houses not reaching Tyler\u2019s knees. The skyscrapers of downtown were visible in the distance, and for a moment Aaron wondered how long it would take before they, too, would be dwarfed by the titanic ten-year-old tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron shook his head and leaned over to get as close as he could to one of Tyler\u2019s ears without falling off. \u201cTyler, we have to find a way to stop this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged. \u201cEven if I wanted to, I don\u2019t know how. I might as well have some fun with it!\u201d He stepped away from the ruins of his house towards the street, giggling as he saw that his foot now filled nearly the entire lane. A few houses down, an SUV was parked on the curb. He walked towards it and raised his foot above it, comparing their sizes. He was delighted to see that his foot was longer and wider than the vehicle, and he began lowering it down, causing the metal to creak and the glass to shatter before the whole thing pancaked with a satisfying CRUNCH sound. \u201cOops,\u201d he said with a snicker, \u201cI guess I need to watch where I step. Or maybe everyone else does!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few other cars were parked further down the street, all of which soon became flattened under Tyler\u2019s increasingly larger paws, each one easier than the last. Aaron could only watch helplessly from his perch as his brother stomped around their street, seeing that even the asphalt was becoming distressed by the weight of the young boy, his paw prints growing deeper and larger as time went on. A few neighbors had stepped out of their house to see what all the noise was about, and either screamed in horror and ran back inside, or stood there watching dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so cool!\u201d Tyler exclaimed after he crushed his fifth car. A funny feeling began forming in his stomach, and he looked down and noticed that his now-exposed cock was becoming longer and harder. It was a new sensation, but one that he unquestionably liked, feeling better and better as the houses shrunk around him. Pretty soon, he had passed 200 feet tall, and the houses were no bigger than his ankles. \u201cWhat to do next,\u201d he wondered aloud...</span></div></div>",

By now a lot of people were running in a panic in the street below and Aaron knew he had to steer his little brother's destructive paws away from them as best he can. His brother wouldn't hurt a fly but given the situation there was no telling what he would do, intentionally or not. As if to prove the point his paw crashed down on the street and narrowly missed a car trying to drive away, causing it to spin out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler!\" Aaron yelled into his brother's ear. \"Watch where you're walking, there are people down there!\" Aaron was nearly flung of as the momentum of the giant's next step suddenly stopped, suspending a growing paw over some random passerby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.\" Tyler said plainly as he moved the destination of his paw and continued walking. A loud, droning siren suddenly started blaring across the neighborhood causing Tyler to suddenly perk his ears up. \"No way!\" He gasped in awe. \"The Monster Evacuation Plan?\" Everyone in the city knew about the Monster Evacuation Plan. It was an evacuation plan submitted on April Fools as joke that turned out to actually be extremely effective if you replaced the giant monster with whatever other real disaster that could possibly occur. Aaron let out a sigh of relief. He had heard about it on the news, people the media lording its efficiency and absurdity. Even more absurd was the fact it was being used for it's original purpose. At least this meant that by the time Tyler reaches the city most of the people should hopefully be evacuated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im a monster!\" Tyler giggled as he continued stomping towards the city, his tail twitching side-to-side violently while he made mock roaring noises. Aaron risked letting go of his ear to get a better look of where his brother was stepping. Grabbing onto the thick fur on his brother's head he slowly crawled forward. The vertigo was intense. With the sensation of being on an elevator constantly going up and the movements of the young tiger's bobbing head, Aaron felt a bit queasy as Tyler stomped through the neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Aaron reached Tyler's brow and was able to see the ground past his short feline muzzle. Presented with a staggering 300 foot drop he instinctively clenched down hard on Tyler's fur but he was relieved at least to see that his massive legs were aimed away from all the people. His relief quickly vanished however when something other than a leg bobbed into view.  \"Oh crap, really?\" He blurted out in shock as he saw the massive erection his little brother was sporting, bobbing side to side with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron could feel Tyler's brow rising as he tried to look up at him. \"What? I'm not stepping on anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's uh... Nothing.\" Aaron managed to spit out, his cheeks burning profusely. \"Don't worry about it.\" Aaron didn't know what to think about that and perched up on his little brother's head he really didn't want to have <i>the talk</i> with him. It's not like he was confused about girls or anything, he was being directly turned on by the act of growing and being huge. <i>Or</i> it could just be a random boner. Aaron desperately hoped it was the former as he slowly crawled back next to Tyler's fluffy ear and laid down and desperately pushed the thought of his brother's junk to the back of his mind. Listening to the rhythmic sound of Tyler's thundering footsteps he watched the clouds above drift by, his own thoughts drifting to the fact that his little brother might end up reaching them soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tyler stopped. \"We're here!\" He yelled excitedly. \"A lot of these buildings are smaller than I expected, though.\" He was standing before a large main road that acted as one of the arteries of the city, cutting straight through to the center. A large eight-lane road littered with lines upon lines of abandoned vehicles. Now standing at 400 feet, the various offices strewn to either side of the road barely reached his belly. \"Looks like the Monster Plan is working, I guess\" Tyler noted as he peered throughout the street. Besides some automated female voice giving directions for any stragglers booming over a speaker, this area of the city was almost completely evacuated. A big grin spread on his face. \"That means I can have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing up one leg he promptly slammed it back down, creating a loud crash as his paw completely flattened an empty bus. Giggling he did the same with his other foot, crushing a group of taxis. Tyler left it and savored how the broken bits of metal felt between his toes. His eyes were trained on his foot, observing how his growing paw began to continually push away more and more cars as it got bigger. As he watched Tyler's heartbeat and breathing was beginning to speed up. To say he was enjoying it was an understatement as his cock pulsed with arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the row of buildings to the side of him Tyler pressed one of his hands down onto the roof and with just a little bit of pressure his paw burst through the ceiling. He kept pushing, feeling his hand break through a couple more floors until he stopped to take a big handful of material from the building. Withdrawing his paw he could see stuff like desks, chairs and computers. He sifted through the debris with his fingers, effortlessly breaking up the shrinking objects. The sight excited him even more and as if out of instinct his other hand reached for his cock causing him to exhale sharply as a jolt of pleasure ran through his body as his fingers wrapped around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden sound of pleasure caught Aaron's attention. He was just passively watching Tyler mess up the empty town in the hopes that he would eventually tire out or grow bored, but sneaking a look down to him with a hand on his cock it confirmed one of his previous worries. Somewhere along the way sensation of getting bigger had become a turn-on for Tyler. Aaron felt a mixture of embarrassment and fear for what his brother would end up doing with arousal clouding his mind. Cock in hand, the gigantic 500 foot tiger continued stomping deeper into the city, his tail swishing around like a fluffy wrecking ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Aaron could see that some of the buildings were actually taller than his brother, Tyler eventually stopped at one of these tall buildings and stared up at it. The side of the building was completely flat and had reflective windows. It was like a mirror. Tyler could see every detail of his body in the reflection and the dwindling scenery in the background and unfortunately for Aaron he could see his brother slowly stroking his erect cock. \"Dude.\" Aaron muttered disapprovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn't even hear him, he was blocking everything out. He was utterly transfixed on his growing body, arousal increasing as he watches his vision slowly pass more and more floors of the reflective skyscraper. He lets out a window-shaking moan as he begins to stroke his cock faster. His mind wandered back to the SUV he first stepped on. How big he was then, how much bigger he is now, how much bigger he will be. \"Bigger...\" He almost growled, eyes glazed over as he stares at his expanding form in the reflection, still jacking off. \"Bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron held on desperately to his brother's massive ear, his movements becoming more erratic as he brought himself closer to orgasm. By this point Tyler was about 600 feet tall, but Aaron swore he was growing considerably faster than he was before. Besides being stuck on the head of his giant masturbating kid brother, Aaron was getting an extremely bad feeling from this. In the reflection he could see his growing brother pound away harder and harder, he would have to think of something quickly if he wanted him to stop. <i>That is</i> if Tyler is actually lucid enough to actually notice anything he does.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beginning to feel light headed, Tyler reached out and grabbed the corner of the skyscraper with his free hand to balance himself, causing most of the windows on that side to shatter instantly and the steel superstructure to creak and moan. His toes curled up, digging up chunks of asphalt and sidewalk from the streets far below. As his eyes rolled back, he let out a booming roar and began to unleash his load all over the side of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sent his growth into overdrive, and Aaron\u2019s stomach lurched as he zoomed upward, his brother gaining dozens of feet of height every second, as evident by the trail of jizz he was leaving. The first splatter coated several floors worth of windows about halfway up the side of the building, while the second and third were separated further up by about ten stories each, becoming more and more voluminous. Aaron tried to avoid looking down and seeing the mayhem his brother was causing, but as he looked out he was dismayed to see that the top of Tyler\u2019s head had now surpassed even the tallest building in the city, which meant that he must have exceeded a thousand feet in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown at ground level, Tyler\u2019s paws were expanding outwards in all directions. His toes pushed forward into the lobby of the building, shattering the large glass windows and doors with ease. The sides of his feet pushed aside several abandoned cars, and his heels had reached the buildings across the way. Glass, debris, and drops of cum rained down from above, crashing all around the empty street. Tyler\u2019s right foot reflexively stomped down as he continued to cum, smashing through the asphalt and causing a water main below to break and begin to spray in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after nearly a minute, Tyler\u2019s orgasm appeared to subside. Taking a deep breath, though, he pumped one last, hard time, let out a long, guttural yell that reverberated throughout the city, and finally released a massive cumshot that was bigger than all his previous ones combined. By this time, Tyler was so tall that it cleared the roof of the building, flying over the city and landing in a small park nearly half a mile away, nearly coating it entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, the only sounds were Tyler\u2019s heavy breathing and the continuing recorded voice. Finally, the young tiger opened his eyes, letting out a small gasp as he realized how much he had grown in the past couple minutes, and how much destruction he had just caused. \u201cWow...\u201d he chuckled, admiring the results of his work as his tail quickly swished back and forth behind him, knocking chunks off of the nearby buildings. He bent down and ran a finger along the side of the building, smearing his seed over the windows. \u201cThat... was amazing! I can\u2019t wait to do it again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron gulped and shook his head, crawling as fast as he could over to the nearest ear. \u201cNo, Tyler, you have to think of something else! Think of all the destruction you\u2019ve already caused, and it will only get worse if you\u2014\u201c He was going to say \u2018get bigger\u2019 but he stopped himself, realizing that was probably counter-productive to his goal of stifling Tyler\u2019s arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t seem to make a difference though, as Tyler\u2019s erection seemed to still be just as prominent as it had ever been, casting a long shadow on the empty streets below. In fact, as far as Aaron could tell, it seemed like it had even grown in proportion to the rest of Tyler\u2019s body during his climax, as it appeared to be almost as long as his thigh. His balls, too, had swelled to reach almost halfway down to his knees. If Tyler had been around his height, his equipment would now have put Aaron\u2019s and all his friends to shame; as a fifteen-hundred foot colossus, it was almost awe-inspiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron shuttered in disbelief, feeling more and more nauseous. At this point, he had no idea what to do. He could only wait and see how Tyler felt now that he had just experienced the biggest orgasm in history, and what his next move would be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler towered over the city. With his growth still tirelessly pushing him higher, he put some of the tallest buildings to shame as he stood above them at over 1500 feet. With his heart beating fast Tyler tried to slow his breathing as the adrenaline from his explosive climax faded away. That orgasm was the single most pleasurable thing Tyler had ever experienced and as he felt his sizable cock bob in the air his urges were returning. Looking down he saw his much thicker shaft still throbbing with arousal, the shrinking city laying just past it. He bit his lip. As much as he wanted to do that again the city would no doubt become to small for him eventually, so he decided on having a little foreplay before indulging himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron on the other hand wasn't so excited. Clinging to the base of his brother's ear he felt powerless, his words as the elder brother meaning nothing to the growth-hungry brother. It didn't help he was the size of a flea, or even smaller, compared to him. With a sigh he looked away from the destruction below, but even that wasn't comforting enough as he saw the ear on the other side of his brother's head got further and further away as he grew. He laid back into the soft orange fur surrounding him as he went through his options. Unfortunately for him, they were very limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tyler began to move. Lifting a massive paw he slowly began to walk through the city, savoring the feeling of the crumbling buildings below his paw pads as they came down with a mighty crash. With each step his toes would clip against buildings, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air. Having already grown another hundred feet, his growth was still going strong. Lowering a foot onto a district crowded with small offices he admired the ring of the destruction growing in a huge ring around his paw as he demolished buildings just by standing still. Tyler just couldn't help himself as he wrapped his fingers around his engorged cock once again and slowly began massaging it as he noticed that even his toes were beginning the outsize some of the buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis path of destruction stopped as he happened across a particularly large building amidst all the offices, although comparatively to him it only came up to his knees. Tyler grinned as an idea formed in his head. Slowly he began to lift his leg, tilting his thigh upward so he could position his paw just above the building. Not pushing too much weight on the building, it was surprisingly firm as he rested his foot on top of it. Again he raised his paw before he violently pushed down onto the building with all his might, causing it to crumple under his weight. Eventually he made contact with the ground creating a huge explosion of smoke and dust. It actually took a second after stomping down until Tyler heard the ear-shattering crash followed by a shock-wave that that traveled throughout the city, smashing all the glass windows in a mile radius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deafening crash was more than enough to make Aaron jump in fright. \"Haha! Did you see that?\" Tyler boasted. \"It was like a big explosion from a movie!\" Aaron didn't get a chance to reply as Tyler began moving again, giggling along the way. He stopped at another building that was about the same size, though on account to his unending growth was much smaller. Bringing his paw above it he repeated the process, slamming the earth below him with all his might. \"Nothing can stop me!\" He mock roared, \"I'm Tyler-zilla!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA statement Aaron would have thought cute if he was rampaging through a cardboard city at his normal size. Not so much with a real city. The masturbating definitely didn't help either. Speaking of which, Tyler was starting to work his shaft even faster, his displays of raw power enough to send a giant bead of pre-cum plummeting down to the city below. Aaron was nearly flung of his head when Tyler suddenly began moving as he lowered himself down onto the ground in a sitting position, his massive tail behind him swaying to and fro as it demolishes swathes of small buildings. Splaying his legs Tyler began to jack off even faster, intent on reaching orgasm once again. Aaron could already feel his growth speed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden both the brothers were distracted as a group of small objects loudly whistled past Tyler's face. They looked like small flies to Tyler, but Aaron recognized them as a group of fighter jets in formation. It took him a while before the heavy realization that they were going to attack your brother actually registered in his brain. Before he could even yell a warning into his brother's ear a series of explosions erupted all around Tyler. The blast of one of the bombs that hit Tyler right on top of the head was enough to send Aaron hurdling through the the air. Grasping for anything and only grabbing nothing he began to fall back down toward Tyler after what felt like an eternity of free fall. He was winded as he eventually landed in the middle of his brother's brow. Aaron barely had time to recover before he could feel himself sliding down. \"Crap!\" He blurted out as he started sliding faster and faster, grasping desperately at Tyler's fur. As the angle of descent leveled out as he reached his muzzle he slowed down and was able to grasp onto the short orange fur before coming to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler on the other hand was more confused than anything. The small explosions coming from the tiny vessels were just enough to cause him slight discomfort and maybe causing a mosquito-bite level of pain when they hit an area with less denser fur. Unfortunately for Aaron, he had to hold on tight as he was flung side to side as Tyler turned his head to look at the small jet fighters buzzing around him. Tyler was just about to get frustrated at them before a trio of rockets suddenly detonated against his cock, causing him to moan involuntarily. That's when he realized that if he could just make himself bigger, the annoying flies won't be a problem. Grasping his cock again he focused on reaching climax once again, intent on increasing his 2000 foot frame even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Aaron had settled on the bridge of his muzzle just before his brother's big black nose. Sitting up on his head he really underestimated how big Tyler was compared to him, but now that he was staring up at his brother's eyes he could truly appreciate the size difference. The massive orbs dwarfed him and only seemed to get bigger. Turning around on his broadening muzzle Aaron could see his hands fervently massaging the entire length of his cock as more explosions puffed up around him. Looking back again, Aaron could also see his brother's huge eyes roll to the back of his head as a huge moan reverberated throughout the city.  He braced himself as his brother began another sexually-fueled growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gained another 200 feet almost instantly as a huge stream of semen rocketed out of his cock clear across the city. As pleasure wracked his body he continued jerking off, determined to make full use of the orgasm. He gasped sharply as another wave of cum flew and hit a skyscraper, the impact essentially cutting the building in half. Aaron was pinned down to his widening muzzle as the younger tiger continued his orgasm, growing upwards at an unprecedented pace as his rear demolishing more buildings with each spurt. In a cone in front of the growing tiger more buildings began to fall as they were barraged by the speeding, gooey projectiles. Tyler moans as he lets out one more spurt of cum, narrowly missing one of the jet fighters circling him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLeaning back Tyler basks in the afterglow of his massive growth spurt as his growing begins to slow back down. Panting, he Looked down and could see all the annoying jets leave vapor trails as they all retreated away from him. Even sitting down he was the tallest object in the city, his latest orgasm giving him a whopping 1000 extra feet of height. The shadow of his body loomed ominously over the city, the boy would be about 3000 feet tall standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was in awe. His brother had doubled in size in under a few minutes. Even the coarse short fur on his brother's muzzle was starting to become overbearing as he tried to get himself into a more safe and comfortable position. He was relieved at least to see that his brother's last jack off session had at least worn him out, evident by his drowsy half-shut eyes. With the military involved though, he was beginning to doubt the safety of both him and Tyler. Frantically, Aaron began waving up to the massive eyes of his giant brother, hoping to get his attention. \"Tyler!\" He yelled fruitlessly, \"Down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some stroke of luck Tyler managed to notice the speck-sized Aaron waving away on his muzzle. Closing one eye he was <i>just</i> able to focus on him. \"Wow.\" He muttered. \"You're like smaller than a flea.\" Aaron flinched as a massive black object came to rest right next to him. \"I reckon you're smaller than the tip of my claw!\" The size of the giant keratin structure was intimidating to say the least, but it gave him an idea. Looking towards the edge of the city Aaron saw where the jet fighters were going to and recognized it immediately. A military base was located on the outskirts of the city, a place Aaron visited a few times with his friends to watch them do drills and such. Being a sibling of the giant ransacking the city, Aaron thought he might be able to convince them to stop attacking or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was very conflicted. One one hand if he did get put down he would have to avoid getting crushed by his growing brother, on the other if he stayed he would have to hide from the ordinance the military would no doubt send their way. With no good option he left it up to the if Tyler was actually able to understand his plan or not. Wildly gesturing and yelling up at Tyler, Aaron tried desperately to convey his idea to his brother. Tyler pulls his claw away and just blinks at him, his eyebrows furrowed in confusion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began to rise to his feet, causing Aaron to lose his balance again and wrap his arms around a strand of fur to keep from falling to certain death. After a few seconds, he made one final exaggerated gesture towards the direction of the military base, hoping to at least get some of his idea across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s massive eyes moved to look out at the horizon in the direction Aaron was pointing, where he saw the jets that had been bothering him earlier coming in for a landing. \u201cAhhhh, I think I know what you\u2019re trying to get at,\u201d he said, a smile returning to his face. He began to stomp off in that direction, this time not even noticing the groups of buildings crushed beneath his feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe base was about fifteen miles from the downtown area, but for Tyler that only took a minute to get to. He mostly followed the highway, flattening dozens of cars along it that had been abandoned when the evacuation order sounded with each step. As he got near, he glanced behind him, chuckling when he saw the trail of destruction he left, and the smoke rising from the city center where he had just been. His tail flicked back and forth excitedly, and his cock began to stiffen again at the sight, though he refrained from touching it for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing forward, he turned his full attention to the military base he was now looming over. He placed his hands on his hips and grinned a toothy grin, letting the sight of a tiger more than half a mile tall sink into the personnel at the base. After a moment, he brought his hands up to his muzzle, cupping them around his mouth. \u201cAttention army guys,\u201d he announced, \u201cYou have one minute to flee this base. I will count down from sixty, and when I reach zero I will start to smash everything here I see, in return for you attacking me earlier. And if you\u2019re still here by then, well,\u201d he giggled, \u201cthen anything that happens to you is not my fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron\u2019s jaw dropped in horror, and he began to wave his hands wildly again. \u201cNo, Tyler, that\u2019s not what I meant! I want you to let me down so I can talk to them!\u201d But the younger Tyler wasn\u2019t paying any attention at this point, as he had already started his countdown. \u201cSixty... Fifty-nine... Fifty-eight...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown at ground level, mass panic amongst the soldiers ensued as alarms blared. Multiple announcements were made over the loudspeakers from generals or colonels trying to mobilize some sort of coordinated defense, but it was all for naught as virtually nobody paid attention as they scrambled around. Some sprinted for the nearest tank or jet to try and do whatever they could to defend the base. Others, knowing there was no way they could defeat such a monster, dashed for the nearest vehicle and sped off as far in the opposite direction as they could. Some just dropped to their knees in prayer, while a select few who had found themselves aroused at the site of the titanic ten-year-old tiger found a private place to enjoy the view, even if it was the last thing they would see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThirty-two... Thirty-one.... Thirty...\u201d Between counting, Tyler licked his lips in anticipation, trying to decide what would be the most efficient and most fun way to destroy the base. Aaron could only watch and worry, knowing that it was now inevitable that his brother would cause a lot of casualties with whatever happened next. All the while, Tyler\u2019s body stretched higher and higher, now reaching 3500 feet tall. Aaron wondered if the growth would ever stop at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFour... Three... Two... One... Zero! Alright, time\u2019s up!\u201d Tyler crouched down, and Aaron braced himself for whatever was about to happen. \u201cHere comes the biggest belly-flop in the history of the world!\u201d Leaping into the air, Tyler stretched out his body and aimed his torso straight for the heart of the base. The force of the air from his body rushing towards the ground knocked over several smaller buildings, and most of what was left were instantly flattened by the acres of flesh and fur meeting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding like that stung Tyler a bit, and he let out a reflexive yelp, then giggled as he rolled on his back, crushing most of what had survived the initial impact. For good measure, he spread his arms and legs out and began moving them back and forth like he was making a snow angel out of the debris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his body to lean on his side, he noticed a few planes at the edge of the runway that had somehow survived his assault, and appeared to be revving up to try and take off. He reached over and moved his hand over these planes, sticking out a single finger. \u201cVvvvvrrroooo-splat!\u201d he cried out as he brought the finger down, squishing all the planes with his fingertip. From the other side, one lone surviving tank approached began to fire all of its ordinance at the reclining giant, but Tyler didn\u2019t even feel the shells hit his backside, and as he rolled back to lie on his back again, the tank was flattened under his massive buttcheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that the base was now destroyed, Tyler let out a content sigh and stretched his arms above his head, still reclining. \u201cLooks like my work here is done!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly rising up and brushing military base debris from his backside Tyler stretched to his full length and yawned, the events of the day finally catching up to him. His drowsy eyes eventually settled on a mountain range that was far outside the city but once again, the walk would only be a couple of minutes for the giant tiger. As he trekked to the mountains the density of houses decreased as he started stomping through an empty neighborhood. He grinned as he remembered he used to actually fit in those small buildings earlier this very day. Now, the houses barely even reached halfway up one of his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground felt much more soft as he began entering a more rural area, the bare vegetated ground breaking up like wet mud between his huge toes. Tyler found it amusing that his steps were creating perfect brown footsteps on the green landscape, each one bigger than the last. Getting closer to the mountain he saw that it was actually taller than him, the uppermost peak sitting about twice as high as him. Circling around the mountain ranges Tyler searched for the most optimal resting spot until he eventually found a flat valley hidden away among the peaks. Dark Green trees littered the valley the entire way through  like a soft carpet until they reached a gently sloped mountain. The location was perfect for the sleepy tiger to have his nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the green valley he reached the end before he turned around and planted his backside against the mountain with a thundering crash, tearing up trees and rock as he adjusted his legs and tail to a more comfortable position. Resting his head against the cool stone of the mountain he stared up at the clouds as he felt his body slowly riding up the mountain as he got bigger. Tyler yawned again before he found himself nodding off, protected from all sides by the mountain range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron however was not in the mood for a nap. He was still registering how his brother literally just declared war against the military. A back and forward argument was raging on in his head as he sat on the length of his growing brother's muzzle. <i>Tyler purposely killed a whole bunch of people. Was it because they were so small and insignificant compared to him that he didn't care? On the other hand, they were actively attacking him and it could be considered an act of self defense. Then there's the fact that Tyler thought he was doing what I wanted him to do. Maybe if I didn't do anything he wouldn't have attacked them? </i> Grunting, Aaron rubbed his eyes and pushed the thoughts to the back of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point dwelling on it. The only important fact was that Tyler was still growing without pause and would have probably ended up wiping out the base one way or another, accidental or not. Looking up at his brother he could see that Tyler had actually managed to fall asleep. Standing up in the dense fur on his muzzle Aaron began to climb up the bridge of his nose. While his current position let him see from his brother's point of view he could easily be flung of if Tyler moved his head around too fast to look at something. If they did get attacked by the military again he also had the benefit of cover, using his massive round ears as protection. Thankfully Tyler's reclining head made it easier for the elder brother, but it was still a mountain climb in it's own right. Grasping onto the vine-sized hairs Aaron slowly ascending back to the top of his brother's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the longer hair atop his head Aaron felt like a tiny flea as he struggled through the fur. Panting heavily he realized that he had just made it to the top of Tyler's head. It was like climbing up a steep on a mountain and then realizing that an even bigger peak was waiting for you  Aaron stared at the imposing set of round ears that were still another lengthy journey away, undoubtedly the safest place he could be if things go south. He collapsed into the soft orange fur, his breath condensing to fog as it reached the cold mountain air that pinched his lungs. He definitely needed a rest first though. The view from his brother's head was spectacular. Before him was a vibrant valley surrounded by two massive mountains before it eventually opened up to reveal the country landscape. Aaron would have just kept looking at the view but a rumbling sound broke his focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around until his eyes rested on the pair of legs stretching out in the valley. <i>Oh right, he's growing still.</i> At this point he was about 5000 feet tall, his legs expanding and pushing his paws further out into the valley as they destroyed more trees just by taking up more and more space. Even his fluffy striped tail was creating a trail of destruction as it curled around the valley. As Tyler's head slowly rose up against the mountain Aaron was still utterly dumbfounded at the situation. <i>How could all of this occur from just giving a height supplement to the kid? Why would they even sell a potential doomsday weapon like this in a local pharmacy?</i> Like he often found himself doing, he pushed the thoughts to the back of his mind again. Laying back down he tried to get comfortable in his brother's fur and tried to take a nap. It's not like he could do anything to stop this in his current position anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron woke up some time later to a rhythmic whirring sound. Adjusting his eyes he could see that it was currently the late afternoon as the sky began to dim,  his brother was still sleeping soundly. Sitting up he only sighed as he realized that his brother was taking up more space in the valley. He didn't even have that long of a nap and it looked like his brother had already grown a couple thousand feet putting him around 7000 feet tall. That whirring sound was still buzzing to the left and right though. He scanned around until his eyes widened at the sight of multiple military helicopters circling around the giant tiger. He was about to yell out at Tyler when he realized that they didn't seem to be doing anything. They just seemed to fly around, some landing and taking off again in the forest below. Aaron kept watching them as they continued to slowly buzz around his brother, unsure of what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes they all regrouped before flying off in a neat formation until the only sound left in the valley was the ominous rumbling his brother's body was producing. Aaron had no idea what they were doing so he just laid down again to sleep. As he was just about to doze off he heard something.</span></div></div>",

Jason never wanted to do anything with him, always hanging out with his friends. Pouting, Kyle trudged up to his room, thinking about all the things he wanted to do with his brother, ranging from playing to simply talking. Catching sight of the time on his clock, Kyle wondered why anyone would want to be out so late - a look out the window confirmed that the sun had long set. <br>\r\nAfter pulling on his pyjamas, Kyle sat on the edge of his bed, not wanting to go to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pinprick of light in the sky slowly moved, a tiny trail behind it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle bolted up in the middle of the night, wheezing, something very tight wrapped around his torso and legs. He was greeted with the loud ripping noise of his shirt tearing to shreds and falling to the floor in three or four pieces, torn to shreds. He reached over and to turn on his bedside lamp and see just what had made a loud sound (and why his legs still felt so tight and constricted but now his upper body felt free), and jumped a little as he heard another loud rip. Turning on his light, he gawked at how small his pajama pants now looked. Looking over onto the floor, he saw the stretched and torn remains of his shirt. His bed seemed to make weird, groaning sounds whenever he moved, much more than it usually did; looking around the room, everything seemed strangely smaller than it should be--he took up more space on the bed than he usually did, he'd almost pulled the lamp onto the floor, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was not just confused by this massive flurry of new information...he was terrified. What the hell had happened? Why did everything look suddenly so small? Why were his clothes so tight? Why...did he have such a large bulge in his pants? The questions swirled around in his head until he let out an exasperated, \"What's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attempted to get up and check himself out in the mirror (whatever was wrong clearly was with him, and not the rest of the room), but his legs were fastened together by his now much to small for him red pajama pants. He reached down and tried to pull them off, but it was no use--they were stuck to him. He sighed heavily as he tried to pull his legs apart, succeeding after a little effort at tearing the pants down the crotch seam. They were still wrapped around his legs, but at least this way he could actually get up, and he managed to hobble his way over to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shocked by what he saw. In the back of his mind, he suspected that <i>maybe</i> he'd gotten a little growth spurt in the night--he was pretty small for a twelve year old, and had been waiting for his growth spurt to kick in for a while. The change in his size was by no means little, however; he was at least six feet tall now, probably closer to six and a half! He also used to be fairly scrawny--the figure looking back at him from the mirror would never be mistaken for a bodybuilder or anything, but he was definitely more muscular than he'd been. He held up his arm and flexed it a little, audibly gasping at how big it had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could have caused this? He couldn't think of anything he'd done over the last day that was really out of the norm, except for...could the wish he made on that shooting star have caused this? He dismissed the thought as ridiculous--it was much more likely that the fox had somehow been exposed to some weird compound in the hamburger he'd had for dinner, and he did think the tap water tasted a little funny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud tearing noise (a sound he was getting all too familiar with hearing at this point...) jarred him from his train of thought. He looked down and saw his right pant leg rip open, followed quickly by his left, leaving him completely nude save for a pair of bright red boxer briefs that were fighting a losing battle to contain his bulge...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle gritted his teeth and clenched his fists as he stormed away from the entrance to the roller coaster. His 17-year old brother Daniel had taken Kyle and his two other 12-year-old triplet brothers, Craig and Clay, to the state fair, which had gone well right up until they had decided to get in line for the Cyclone roller coaster. Of course, they had waited in line for nearly an hour before they got to the front, only to find out that Kyle (being an inch shorter than his same-age triplets, which had been a constant source of irritation nearly since they had been old enough to talk) was the only one of the group too short for the height requirement. Of course, Craig and Clay had taunted him about this even as they got on and he stormed down the exit ramp. Their voice still rang in his ears, even though they were heading up the hill right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid height requirement,\" he muttered to himself. \"Stupid Clay and Craig. If only I could be the bigger brother for once. Then things would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was steaming, he looked up and noticed a strange-looking tent just a few steps away. The tent was tiny, barely big enough for more than two people to stand in at a time. At first he thought that it was something for the employees, but then he saw the small sign that hung just to the right of the entrance flap.  \"WishGiver?\" he read aloud, scrunching up his nose in confusion as he did. What the heck was that? He had been to the state fair each of the last four years, and he didn't remember any WishGiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated to go in, but decided that it was worth a shot. After all, it'd still be another 3-4 minutes until his brothers were off the Cyclone, and what harm could it be. Besides, since he didn't have to use the 8 tickets they did to go on the roller coaster, he had extras and could easily afford the apparent 2-ticket entrance fee for this tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds for his eyes to adjust to the low candlelight of the tent once he stepped inside. Before they had done so, he heard a low, almost whispering voice: \"Ah, yes. Kyle, my son. I have foreseen your arrival. Welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's eyes went wide. How did this guy know his name. He glanced downward, thinking he may have a nametag or something on from a previous booth, but nothing said his name on it. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he replied, \"T-thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have your two tickets?\" Kyle nodded, handing the tickets over to the man, whom he could now see was rather old and bearded, or at least dressed up with makeup to look that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man took the two tickets and quickly placed them below the table's surface. \"Ah, wonderful. And the universe has already heard your desire. You wish to be bigger, do you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Kyle felt his blood turn cold. Either this guy had amazing hearing and could hear Kyle muttering to himself over the noise of the rest of the carnival, or something truly weird was going on. Still, even if the chances that all of this was real were remote, if it <i>did</i> turn out to be true...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle?\" the old man repeated, seeing Kyle lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, Kyle again nodded. \"Yes. I want to be big. Bigger than my brothers, bigger than my parents-- bigger than everybody, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the old man didn't reply, staying still as stone. Kyle began to grow nervous, and was about to say something, when he finally answered, \"The universe has granted your request, and offers you to grow one percent taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One percent?!\" Kyle scoffed. \"That's barely anything at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he could barely see the old man's face, Kyle could've sworn he saw a smile spread across his lips. \"Don't dismiss the power of one percent, my son, for this is not just a single instance, but a cumulative effect, and can lead to amazing results. Not only this, but you have a choice of how that effect will accumulate. Each of these choices will take effect at midnight on October 1st, or about fifteen minutes from now. The first choice represents a quick satisfaction, the second choice will be more long-term, and the third choice will be eternal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only served to confuse Kyle even further. \"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a slight sigh, the old man waved his hand and produced three cards, seemingly out of thin air. \"Our time must draw to a close, so I'll explain it for you as simply as possible, and then you can take these cards and make your choice, as long as it's before the stroke of midnight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed Kyle the first card, which had an image of a wristwatch on it. \"This card represents the quick solution. If you choose this, you will grow 1% a minute for the entire day, but only that day.\" He paused for a moment, then handed Kyle the second card, which had a picture of a calendar on it. \"This card represents the long-term solution. By choosing this, you will grow 1% every hour for the entire year.\" After waiting another few seconds, he finally handed the last card over. At first, Kyle thought it had a figure eight, but then he quickly realized he was holding it sideways, and it was the infinity symbol. \"And this card represents the eternal choice. Select this, and you will grow 1% every day for the rest of your life. Choose wisely, my son, and good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes bulging, Kyle stared at the cards. He had so many questions running through his head, but as he looked back up, he was stunned to see that he was standing back outside, still in the place he was at, but the tent he had been standing in just a moment ago had vanished. Glancing to his left, he noticed that his brothers had just stepped off the roller coaster and were heading down the ramp towards him. Was it just a dream, he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, short stuff,\" Clay said with a smirk. \"You missed a hell of a ride. What do you got there?\" he pointed at the cards that Kyle was holding in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, nothing,\" Kyle said, quickly pocketing the cards. It can't be a dream if I still have these, right? he thought. What the old man was saying is impossible, though. But ... what if it's not...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at his watch, which read 11:57. He only had a few minutes to decide, he realized, or lose the chance, according to what he had been told. As his brothers continued on to the next ride, he hung back a few steps behind them, mulling his decision over in his mind. Finally, he decided on which wish he wanted. He held out one of the cards, saying \"I choose this one,\" just before his watch beeped and switched over to 12:00. As soon as the words left his mouth, the other two cards vanished, leaving him holding only one card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card he had chosen, the one that was still left in his hands, just so happened to be...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThink you\u2019re big enough to ride this one shorty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay\u2019s usual snide remark bounced off Kyle, who was still pondering the wristwatch image staring back at him from the palm of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will 1% a minute do,\u201d he pondered, \u201cFor someone as short as me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of hands suddenly jerked his shoulders. The sudden jolt snapped Kyle up, forcing him to drop the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said, you think you can handle this one\u2026 short stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s skin inflamed. Clay\u2019s constant joking at Kyle\u2019s expense grated on him more and more with each passing year. Clay argued with Daniel, ignored Craig and always reserved special torment for Kyle. Just beyond, the Haunted House loomed above them all. Rows of painted ghosts and snarling demons danced across the tall metal sheets, the endless flashes of strobe lights giving them an eerie life. Clay KNEW Kyle hated this ride. In addition to being the shortest, Kyle was also the most sensitive and HATED to be scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Clay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, Kyle. I picked it out special. Daniel felt so bad you couldn\u2019t come with us on the roller coaster, so I said we had to find one your own size.\u201d Clay squeezed Kyle\u2019s shoulders, holding him in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because the haunted house is on tracks, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a roller coaster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill,\u201d he squeezed harder, Kyle\u2019s flesh giving instantly under his grip, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be so much fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo watch me scream,\u201d Kyle he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that LITTLE brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mechanical cackle stole Kyle\u2019s reply. Huge demonic eyes over fifteen feet in the air glowed with blood red heat. Kyle\u2019s stomach twisted. Taking full advantage of Kyle\u2019s distraction, Craig creeped his head closer and closer to his frightened brother, hanging it mere inches over Kyle\u2019s bony shoulder. Goosebumps ran up Kyle\u2019s neck, all the way through the tips of his short red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay belted a sharp scream, an inch away from Kyle\u2019s ear. Kyle jumped with an uncontrollable yelp! Clay died of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle recovered his breaths as fast as he could. \u201cSomeday,\u201d he gasped, \u201cwhen I grow up\u2026 you will not treat me like this ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay laughed harder. \u201cLike what, BIG man!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay bounded toward Daniel and Craig with a devilish laugh, leaving Kyle alone once again. Taking a small gulp, Kyle reached down to pick up his lost card, but it was gone. He looked again and sure enough, the patches of dirt and grass beneath his shoes were clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle checked his pocket with a few quick shoves, but the other cards too were gone. Kyle wasn\u2019t sure what was more scary, the haunted house staring him down or the old man\u2019s magic seemingly at work. His stomach twisted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I don\u2019t regret this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle finally filed in behind the shrinking line of excited kids and expressionless adults. As he approached the ticket taker, Kyle saw his brothers already seated in the paint chipped carts. Craig and Clay were in the first car, while Daniel saved a seat in the car directly behind them. This relieved Kyle some, happy his older brother was taking an effort to keep Clay away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle reluctantly handed over his ticket to the thin, pot marked teen and sat down next to his older brother. Although Daniel shared the trio\u2019s red hair and pale complexion, he had a more \u201cchiseled\u201d look than his youthful brothers. His eyes pierced with intensity, and his fuller frame held a secret strength his brothers knew well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou actually joined us?\u201d Craig incredulously asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you hate this ride?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Clay interrupted. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? Kyle\u2019s growing up. He\u2019s not scared of a little ride at the carnival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence hung in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 Kyle?\u201d Clay smiled mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel audibly gritted his teeth. Kyle\u2019s mouth opened, but words never emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee!\u201d Clay sneered. \u201cHe\u2019s fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant appeared from nowhere, snapping the metal bar over Daniel and Kyle\u2019s legs. The cold steel loomed inches over Kyle\u2019s thin legs, stopped by Daniel\u2019s larger thighs. This did little to calm Kyle\u2019s panic. He was trapped and going nowhere. Seeing Kyle\u2019s twisting expressions, Daniel leaned in. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you Kyle. Not letting Clay get to you and facing your fears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow little he knew. \u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d Kyle instantly yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sighed. He found it difficult to read Kyle\u2019s moods but always felt compelled to help him. He wrapped one arm around his little brother, gave reassuring squeeze with his thick hand. One long moment later, he finally pulled away. Daniel\u2019s concern released some of Kyle\u2019s tension. Unlike Clay, Daniel would rough house with Kyle, but never intentionally hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrifying laugh buzzed across the mechanical speakers. The car lurched toward the darkness ahead. Kyle instantly tensed again, his hands gripping the cold steel. All of the blood quickly drained out of his face and knuckles. Soon, the darkness consumed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several minutes, haunting flashes and specters terrorized the delighted visitors. Well, all but Kyle. Every bump and scream tensed his thin body more and more. He did all he could to hold his breath, not to give Clay the satisfaction of hearing his screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin crawled with each passing minute. Kyle\u2019s clothes creeped across his skin, uncomfortably gripping him in several places. Even his shoes pinched as his big toes like the claws of a preying mantis. The haunted house must have been getting to him more than he thought. Despite all of the commotion around them, Daniel noticed Kyle\u2019s squirming and tight grip on the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much longer now,\u201d Daniel reassured him with his baritone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot soon enough!\u201d Kyle screamed in his mind, clenching his jaw shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the light at the end of the tunnel emerged. Kyle continued to squirm, still feeling his clothes constrict around him. He had hoped seeing the end of the ride would calm him, but he had used every last ounce of strength to not let out horrified screams. More over, the itching of his clothes was driving him mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to escape this car!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride barely came to a stop. Sweat had visibly beaded across Kyle's forehead and the moment the leg bar released, Kyle shoved it away, sprinting down the wooden stairs away from the glaring lights of the haunted house. He had moved so fast, Daniel lost sight of him. Kyle huffed and puffed, doubling over his legs. The crowd mindlessly moved around him, unaware this inconvenient obstacle was a frightened boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hated the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hated fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he hated Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for another?\u201d Clay\u2019s voice taunted from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough Clay,\u201d Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them bickered, Craig found his brother and weaved his way through the thick crowd of thrill seekers. Once he finally made it through, Craig\u2019s enlarged hazel eyes transfixed on Kyle. He readjusted his thick black framed glasses, just to make sure he wasn\u2019t seeing things. Kyle was still bent over, his back heaving up and down in the air. But Craig wasn't looking at Kyle\u2019s back, he was looking at Kyle\u2019s ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's smooth, pale skin was impossibly exposed. The bottom of his pant legs had rode up several inches to the base of his  undefined calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle?\u201d Craig said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the crowd\u2019s chatter, Kyle heard Craig\u2019s monotone voice. He slowed his breaths, straightened up and turned. At first, Kyle thought he was mistaken. A pair of thin eyebrows starred greeted Kyle\u2019s gaze. It took him a moment to Kyle adjusted and realize he was now looking down at his \u201ctaller\u201d brother Craig.</span></div></div>",

The old man handing him the trio of cards skipped over and over again like a scratched disc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig slowly eyed his brother up and down with continued disbelief. He adjusted his glasses once, twice, then three times , sure that this was some trick of the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is unprecedented, Kyle! Look at you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig gestured to Kyle\u2019s pants, still processing all the ways this could possibly be some dramatic trick of light. Kyle finally looked down and saw what Craig saw. His pants were riding up his legs, revealing his calves. His faded graphic t-shirt looked almost form-fitting now, the bottom stopping just above the copper button of his pants, while the arms clung tight around his biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle flexed his arm back and forth, watching the fabric tug, but never relax. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve worn something this small since Daniel\u2019s hand-me-down\u2019s in fourth grade. You remember, right? You and Clay got the bigger set and, as always I got the leftovers. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world grew transparent to Craig, as he mentally walked through the long halls of his knowledge and memory. His stoic expression never wavered, but could not mask his growing interest. \u201cIn all the books I have ever read there has never been an instance of sudden growth like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinked. \u201cAre you sure, Craig? Never?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiction, yes. Non-fiction? No.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst time for everything,\u201d Kyle lit up, lifting his heels up and down, flexing the tightening band around his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig slowly shook his head with his eyes unblinking. \u201cI\u2019m sure something like this has been recorded at some point in human history. Growing several inches over a year, yes. Months, sure, for pubescent teens. But to grow several inches in a matter of minutes...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle continued exploring his body with childlike wonder. He flexed his fingers, bringing them up to his chest and slowly clenched them into a fist. His sleeves tugged. \u201cAnd it\u2019s happening to me,\u201d Kyle\u2019s voice hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust imagine what this could mean for medical science!\u201d Craig\u2019s eyes remained blurred behind those possibilities. \u201cYou could hold the key to reliably stimulating human growth plates. Imagine the kind of impact this could have on controlling cell reproduction and\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped. Craig stepped closer to Kyle, his nose almost touching Kyle\u2019s chin. \u201cYou could still be growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think?\u201d Kyle\u2019s voice cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe may not know why this started but that does not mean that whatever \u2018this\u2019 is has stopped yet. You could keep growing, be five foot five, even six feet tall in a matter of days! Maybe hours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s green eyes shimmered at the thought. \u201cSix feet tall. Me! The \u2018short\u2019 brother,\u201d he laughed. \u201cNo more hand-me-downs for this guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Craig corrected, \u201cat the very least, you will be at the front of the line, not being the shortest among us any longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought struck Kyle like a lightning bolt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Craig. I\u2019m not the short brother anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s face visibly darkened. He took one long lunge past Craig. His new mission materialized before him, but before he could march one step further, Craig halted him with a hand on Kyle\u2019s broadening shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ARE still growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am?!\u201d Kyle responded with a crackling giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle new \u201cmission\u201d instantly vanished, soaking in the subtle changes between a few minutes ago and now. Kyle\u2019s dog-like focus always sent him zooming full throttle from one idea to the next. The cat he had set upon chasing was instantly replaced by his own delicious looking tail, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be!,\u201d Craig began, clearing his thickly matted hair away from his face. \u201cA minute ago, my eyes were in line with your lips. Now I can barely see over your shoulder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you might be right, my shoes are getting really tight around my feet.\u201d Kyle tried to wiggle his toes, but the bulging fabric locked each digit in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d Craig replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve roughly grown 6 inches since we got on the ride. That was 10 or so minutes ago now. Which means those size sevens are quickly getting too small for your rapidly growing feet. It won\u2019t be long before they just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig pointed down at Kyle\u2019s feet. Some of the seams on top of Kyle\u2019s white and blue tennis shoes were already ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap!\u201d Kyle exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig grabbed Kyle by the arm, noticing it felt thicker than it seemed and lead his brother under a nearby tree. The pool of light surrounding the rides and stands abandoned them here. \u201cWe cannot tell these people about this,\u201d Craig urgently said in a hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wrenched his arm away from Craig, looking even further down to his shrinking brother. \u201cAnd why not! This is amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing for now,\u201d Craig whispered, rising to his tippy toes. \u201cBut if there is ONE thing I know about medical science is that they are NOT going to have YOUR best interest at heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain with the \u2018medical science\u2019 thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig rose even further, putting his mouth within half an inch of Kyle\u2019s ear. Craig\u2019s Willy Wonka like friz tickled Kyle\u2019s cheek. Kyle giggled, but Craig\u2019s serious edge remaind. \u201cYou just grew 6 inches in 10 minutes. You are obviously still growing. If you prove to be some kind of miracle, they will take you apart piece by piece to find out what makes you tick! And all of these people\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026are their spies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle back flattened against the tree. A cold chill crept up his spine as his shirt uncomfortably tugged at his arm pits. \u201cNo way,\u201d Kyle hushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig nodded with a knowing dread before lowering himself back to the ground. \u201cPeople flock to the unusual and this certainly qualifies as--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys looked down as Kyle\u2019s feet ripped more of his shoes away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c--unusual,\u201d Craig concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could not reconcile the sheer amazement, and now prickling dread he felt. \u201cHow big do you think I am right now, Craig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig took a step back, sizing up his growing brother. Kyle\u2019s navel peeked out from underneath his tightening shirt. \u201cYou are several inches taller than you were. Almost a foot taller than me I would say,\u201d he paused, \u201c5 foot 5 inches. Give or take.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slowly pushed off the tree, back on his own two, growing feet. The movement pinched his toes, forcing them to rip more of his shoe apart. His white socks were now clearly exposed in several places they shouldn\u2019t be all along the top of his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I am still growing,\u201d Kyle said assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig nodded, not realizing Kyle wasn\u2019t asking a question. Every sci-fi book he had ever read flashed from start to finish as clear as glass in his mind\u2019s eye. \u201cForget six feet in a matter of days. It could be a matter of hours, even minutes, before you are the tallest person here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s muscles tensed with the same dual emotions he had been feeling ever since Craig opened his big mouth. Another loud RIP followed.  A gentle breeze drifted up Kyle\u2019s side and along his back. The seam under his right arm had just given way, exposing more of his hairless skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right, Craig.\u201d Kyle fell against the tree, sliding to the ground. \u201cThis is so amazing. But you are so right. What happens if someone gets their hands on me? What happens if the wrong person finds out before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig kneeled down, gently gripping Kyle\u2019s lengthening leg, again noting that the muscle underneath felt heavier than it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore?\u201d Craig asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle aligned his emerald eyes with the deep, dark wells staring back at him. \u201cI dunno. Before it stops? Before I can protect myself...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig continued to gently run his hand along Kyle\u2019s leg, wondering how much larger his brother was going to get before this was all over. He couldn\u2019t be sure, but Craig could swear he felt Kyle\u2019s leg swell under his touch. Surely it was, but this noticeably? Craig squeezed Kyle\u2019s leg again. \u201cI may have a thought on that. But for now\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig stood up and offer his hand to Kyle. Kyle took it, wrapping his long fingers around Craig\u2019s tiny palm and jerked back to his feet with another RIP! This time, a seam going down the side of Kyle\u2019s leg gave way. Kyle smiled and laughed. \u201cI had better be careful if I don\u2019t want to end up naked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle laughed for several moments, unaffected by Craig\u2019s blank expression. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke, Craig. Well, I guess it\u2019s not REALLY a joke, but\u2026 you know...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa - Ha,\u201d Craig deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClose enough,\u201d Kyle smiled, tussling Craig\u2019s thick hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled his hand away, Kyle drew an invisible line between the top of Craig\u2019s head and his own chin. \u201cWell. Still growing. What now?\u201d Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig turned away, barely giving Kyle the time he needed to unfurl his fingers from Craig\u2019s tangled hair. Craig approached the nearest pool of light, several feet away from the tree. \u201cWe have another tiny problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTiny?\u201d Kyle followed close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig nodded. \u201cWhere\u2019s Daniel and Clay?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAnd another thing\u2014\u201c Daniel growled, his hand gripping Clay\u2019s thin upper arm like a vice, \u201cYou are supposed to take CARE of your family, not humiliate them at every turn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay winced at Daniel\u2019s grip but dare not show pain. \u201cCare? What about that girlfriend of yours? Telling her how we are a \u2018burden\u2019 and how you \u2018wish you were an only child\u2019 so that you could have \u2018privacy\u2019 and \u2018space\u2019 and all those other things you tell her you want that you don\u2019t have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s different!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay jerked as hard as he could, staggering a few steps away from Daniel. \u201cDifferent! Oh, so when you want to tear us down, that\u2019s fine. But when I crack a few jokes, that\u2019s\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeant to hurt someone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like this?!\u201d Clay exclaimed, revealing the growing bruise around his bicep. \u201cSee bro, you\u2019re no different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay\u2019s rebuke cut Daniel deeply. He felt strongly for his brothers, but it was true there were times he wish he could get away from their endless fighting; times he wished there was someone looking out for him, for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go ride the tilt-a-whirl!\u201d Clay blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hate spinning rides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t care!\u201d Clay shouted, already several feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are supposed to stick together,\u201d Daniel reminded him firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cTell that to Craig and your little baby Kyle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if snapping out of a dream, Daniel noticed for the first time during the entire argument that Craig and Kyle were gone. \u201cThey were just here!\u201d he shouted in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Clay was gone too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Clay must have been fighting for a while; the haunted house was mere glow behind several rows of pay-to-play games and booths. Caramel apples and funnel cakes drifted through the sea of lights and people, but no time to stop. Daniel had just lost all three of the triplets and rather than be glad for a moment\u2019s peace, his frustration grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give to be an only child again!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis siblings just had a way of riling him up, even without meaning to. Clay\u2019s snarkiness. Craig\u2019s endless babbling. And Kyle\u2014well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel always hated to admit this to himself, but while he did have a soft spot for Kyle, he was way too easy to upset. Kyle could be on top of the world or down in the deepest cazem in a matter of seconds.  All the while, Daniel paced up and down the endless rows of games, hoping at least one of the would turn up. No such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel hurried back to the haunted house. Maybe Craig and Kyle were exactly where he last saw them. Doubtful. But better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree pitches for a dollar, me\u2019 boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel instinctively stopped and turned, knowing the older voice was speaking to him. \u201cHow \u2018bout it son? Strong arm like that, I bet you can knock these tin cans over, no problem at all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel took an instinctive step closer to the wooden stall, his bicep tensing. \u201cMaybe later. I\u2019ve got something else to do right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sure,\u201d he snickered. \u201cMaybe I misjudged you. Tall, strapping boy like you must be all bark... and no bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder\u2019s obvious attempt to goad him was working. Heat radiated from pulsing veins in his neck and all of his muscles tensed. Years of being weak and overweight, finally replaced by his hard work would not be slighted by the likes of him. Daniel's shortening temper wouldn\u2019t allow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dollar was gone and first pitch thrown before Daniel realized he had stopped searching for his brothers. \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d he audibly muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLosing, it seems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s bicep balled up tightly, bringing a single vein to the surface, hurling the next ball directly at the top can, swiping it clean off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man, hidden in half shadows laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s better meh boy! Strength. Determination. Think you can get the last 2 with a single ball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel calmed some, his pulse slowing and he returned to the game. With the blink of an eye, he was in an packed baseball stadium. He stood tall on the pitcher\u2019s mound, just waiting to strike out the batter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThrow already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s focus fled, he lost his grip and the ball harmlessly flew past the last two tins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Tough luck meh boy! Don\u2019t forget to take your prize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid hurriedly grabbed the oversized tickets, shoved them in a pocket and ran back to the haunted house. To his amazement, Craig was standing in front of the winding line under a flat spotlight. Daniel breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the heck did you run off to, Craig? And where\u2019s Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig\u2019s enormous hazel eyes blinked back, glancing over his left shoulder. \u201cCraig,\u201d Daniel asked again, trying to soften his voice, \u201cWhere is Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNearby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNearby?\u201d Daniel incredulously repeated, starting down at his brother. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018nearby\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is something you have to see and you cannot breathe a word of it to anyone...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrder\u2019s, Craig? Seriously,\u201d Daniel\u2019s voice heated up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sincere suggestion Daniel.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig turned away and walked out of the harsh lights toward an empty patch of grass and dirt. Daneil followed and noticed a dark, looming tree ahead. \u201cCraig, don\u2019t make me ask again. Where is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments, Craig and Daniel left the blinding glow of the flood lights, passing an empty trash can surrounded by litter.There was a large boy sitting with his back against the tree, about Daniel\u2019s age, so Daniel assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Kyle, Craig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps later, Craig and Daniel stopped at the tree and the sitting boy raised his head. \u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel focused his eyes as Kyle stood up\u2026 and up\u2026 and up\u2026 eye level with him and his 5\u2019 9\u201d inch body. Kyle\u2019s clothes looked like a ripping straight jacket around the huge 12 year old\u2019s thick limbs. A boy standing eye-to-eye with a seventeen year old. Every breath he took threatened to rip his shirt clean off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s mouth slowly fell open. Kyle stood as still as he could, wondering with growing nervousness what Daniel was going to say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel had been the underdog for most of his life. Being overweight all through elementary and middle school did not earn him many friends. Only when he turned 15 did he have his first major growth spurt. The baby fat stretched out, puberty chiseled his face, and he even started working out in constant fear that one day he would slide back to the person he had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Daniel stood face to face\u2026 eye to eye, with his 12 year old, baby brother Kyle. Those emerald eyes reflected worry filling both boys. How could something like this happen?! How could something like this not have happened to him? So many jokes made at his expense. So much work for so little gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could he be mad at Kyle? It\u2019s not like he had chosen for it to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eyes quivered in the dark, desperate to know what Daniel was thinking. He had never seen such a blank expression, impossible to read. Craig turned his enlarged hazel eyes back and forth, looking over a foot in the air at his towering brothers. So many possibilities ran through his mind and Craig was computing all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Daniel\u2019s long arms lurched out toward Kyle. Daniel gripped his hands around Kyle\u2019s shoulders, feeling the twisted and torn threads beneath his palm. Kyle didn\u2019t know what to do. Daniel\u2019s expression was emotionless. Until Daniel pulled Kyle close and gave him a long, tight hug. Once again, Kyle\u2019s worries melted away into Daniel\u2019s embrace. Kyle was safe and David had to be supporting of his baby brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cannot be mad at you,\u201d Daniel recited in his mind, \u201cI. Cannot. Be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daniel held his brother, he felt Kyle\u2019s shoulders shift. Daniel was forced to unlock his arms slightly, mindlessly re-adjusting for the discomfort. Instantaneously, a muffled sound erupted from between Kyle and Daniel\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c--R!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel loosened his grip and both boys realized that Craig was smothered between them. His long twists of red hair tickled Kyle\u2019s exposed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAIR!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel quickly released Kyle and stepped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig violently inhaled and checked his glasses for cracks. \u201cIs this what it is going to be like having two big brothers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle mellowed at the thought, but Daniel flinched. Unaware, and unable to clearly see either of them Craig corrected himself. \u201cWell, so to speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked at Kyle for the first time since Craig brought him to the tree and immediately noticed an obvious detail he had otherwise blocked out. \u201cYour clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Kyle nodded knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shirt had ridden up just below his chest, exposing a smooth, flat stomach. His graphic tee\u2019s sleeve were nothing more than ripped shoulder coverings. His pants button had snapped just before Daniel arrived, forcing the denim to grip his hips feveriously and partly exposing the tightening boxers underneath. And of course, Kyle\u2019s size 10 feet had long demolished his kiddie tennis shoes, leaving ripped socks and bare skin in their wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Kyle began. \u201cI think I\u2019m still growing; before long all of these clothes are going to rip right off of me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sounded worried, but the thought of ripping out of his own clothes, just by the sheer force of his growth excited him a little. He truly was getting everything he had ever wished for\u2026 and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single motion, Daniel removed his blue and black micro-pattern button-down, revealing a tighter, solid black t-shirt underneath. His firm chest and rounded shoulder stood out some, even in the dark. \u201cHere, Kyle. Take off your other shirt and put this one on instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle instinctively started complying with Daniel\u2019s request. He gripped either side of his shirt but as he pulled up, all he heard was one loud RIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s shirt tore in half and hung limp in each hand, leaving his bare torso free for the first time in almost an hour. Kyle didn\u2019t realize just how tight his clothes had gotten until now, taking his first full breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig and Daniel had flinched at the sound, but were unphased by Kyle\u2019s bare skin. Four brothers in a two bedroom apartment left little to the imagination for these redheads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle took Daniel\u2019s button-up and slipped it on. \u201cOnly button it up part way, Kyle. We don\u2019t know how long this one is going to last and it\u2019s got to count until we make it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect fit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways felt a little big on me,\u201d Daniel thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis may solve your shirt issue, but your pants are going to be another story,\u201d Craig chimed in, having reset his glasses in their usual perched position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Craig,\u201d Daniel agreed. \u201cThey look like they\u2019ve about had it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least the shirt covers the button that burst,\u201d Craig inspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they are so tight,\u201d Kyle breathed. \u201cI feel like I can hardly move in them without ripping them apart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Craig realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course?\u201d Daniel questioned. \u201cYou want Kyle to rip his pants?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blushed but tried to steady his focus down on his brother. \u201cYes and no,\u201d Craig continued. \u201cWe know that your pants aren\u2019t going to last too much longer, but we need them to last as long as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle unconsciously twitched, snapping more threads in the butt of his pants. \u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just need to make them look like shorts for now. Long enough to get back to the car and get away from the carnival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle instantly grinned. \u201cLike this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a swift motion, Kyle bent over and gripped the base of his pant legs with a swift pull. Using hardly any effort at all, the denim instantly ripped up the side of his thighs, stopping a few inches below his hips. Kyle instinctively sighed with relief, a pair of deep red rings around the top of his calves being all that remained of his previous discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening his back and looking very proud, Kyle glowed at his brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look a little like a neanderthal, but this should certainly help you for the next little while,\u201d Craig grudgingly approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel readjusted his gaze and noticed he had to crank his neck up slightly to meet Kyle\u2019s eyes. Even in these past few minutes, Kyle\u2019s growth had continued. Kyle hadn\u2019t seemed to notice yet, and how could Craig possibly notice? Kyle was over a foot taller than him now anyway. What\u2019s another inch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncontrollable dread sunk into the bottom of Daniel\u2019s stomach, forcing him to face the question he tried so desperately to block out:. \u201cHow much bigger is Kyle going to get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Daniel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel blinked down, straightening his back. \u201cYeah, Craig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Clay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle exhaled loudly. \u201cWho cares?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe cannot leave him behind, Kyle.\u201d Craig\u2019s intensity did not waver, even with Kyle standing over a foot taller than him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? He\u2019s such a pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s our brother,\u201d Craig responded unemotionally, \u201cAnd mom will be most displeased if we come back with one less than we started with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle let out a small sly grin. \u201cI think mom\u2019s going to have other things to think about when we see her again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what do you mean by that?\u201d Daniel quickly questioned, intently staring down Kyle\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle flinched one step back, expanding his arms to either side. \u201cUm. THIS!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless,\u201d Daniel continued, \u201cCraig\u2019s right, Kyle. We cannot leave him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stamped his foot and fell back dramatically against the tree. \u201cFine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraig, take Kyle to the car and wait for us there. The carnival should be clearing out soon and I won\u2019t be too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel handed the keys over to Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle snapped back up and pounced directly behind Craig. \u201cWhy does HE get the keys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel hardened his face, trying with all his might to block out how Kyle\u2019s eyes now hung half an eyebrow above his. \u201cCool it, Kyle. Craig will take care of you until I get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle instantly softened. \u201cAt least I\u2019m still the big brother,\u201d Daniel rejoiced internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel put a hand on Kyle\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Kyle. I will be right back, and I will take care of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded and realized for the first time he was having to look down ever so slightly at his \u201cbig\u201d brother. He didn\u2019t know what to think, but didn\u2019t get much of a chance to do so. Craig pulled at Kyle\u2019s bigger hand and tugged him away from Daniel. Daniel instantly turned and strode back into the carnival.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Craig firmly led Kyle down the edge of a beaten dirt path with focused intensity. He had his mission; he was sticking to it. Although he was careful to avoid as many lights as possible, it was still tough to hide his growing brother. The occasional onlooker who was not completely consumed in their own activity would wonder curiously why such a little guy was leading their older brother or babysitter by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle mindlessly watched his bare feet pound into the dirt, one thick step after the other. The excitement in him grew even faster than his body.. Kyle knew he was going to get so much bigger, and this was only the beginning. He may have wanted to leave Clay behind, but conceded that it\u2019d better for him to come along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho knows how much bigger I\u2019ll get before Daniel brings Clay back to us,\u201d Kyle thought, an uncontrollable grin stretching across his face. \u201cHe\u2019s going to know what it\u2019s like to be the little guy for once. I would love to see him worm his way out of this one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt his pants rip with every step he took. His hips pulled each tooth of his zipper apart one by one. \u201cHow much longer to the car, Craig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat or turning to stop, Craig replied to open air. \u201cNot much longer. Just have to pass these few stalls and the gate, then our car is out in the dirt lot beyond.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother metal tooth ripped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno if I will make it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason why we have to keep walking. You\u2019ve got long legs now. Use them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s temper flared. \u201cAlight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle immediately broke out into a sprint, leaping yards ahead of Craig in only a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like that!\u201d Craig\u2019s voice called from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThreads from Kyle\u2019s pants ripped apart instantly. More of his thighs exposed themselves to the crowd, and and for the moment, Kyle didn\u2019t care. Big kids don\u2019t take orders. In under a minute, Kyle reached the gated entrance to the carnival and was surprised how different it looked now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once tall, looming gate only came up to Kyle\u2019s chin. The rusted metal bars, once ominous, looked like thin pieces of plastic. The oblivious attendant stood half a head shorter than Kyle now, his long matted hair completely obscuring his face. \u201cHave a good evening,\u201d he robotically muttered, releasing a tiny metal click from his hand held tally counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was more incredible than Kyle could imagine. Everything seemed so much smaller now. So much more\u2026 controllable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle trotted out of out the gate, greeted by a noisy light generator. The clunker bathed him in harsh tones and white light. Immediately, Kyle jumped back, remembering how Craig had told him to \u201ckeep his head down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda tough now. Huh, Craig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle imagined Craig standing before him, half his size. Kyle loomed over the imaginary specter, beat his chest and pushed his image away. Kyle rushed back several steps, ready to show the phantasm what he was made of, but suddenly tripped over his own feet, bumping into something behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear a child sobbing. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going!\u201d a woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining  his balance, he tried to bring his growing limbs back under his control and whirled around. Kyle saw no one, but the sobbing continued. He looked down. A middle aged mother coddled her little boy. He wasn\u2019t hurt, merely frightened when Kyle\u2019s towering legs rebounded off the child\u2019s small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Kyle blurted. \u201cDidn\u2019t even see you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay\u2019s phantom was gone. The mother\u2019s narrow glare and the child\u2019s puffy face were all that remained. The woman reared her head straight up, placing her nose inches away from Kyle\u2019s chin. She pointed her free hand half an inch from his face with fury in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time, LOOK\u2026 before you go hitting little boys half your size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gulped. Shame overtook him as the woman eyed him up and down. \u201cAnd another thing,\u201d she began, jerking her child away, \u201cWear some decent clothes. I would never let my boy out of the house looking like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt the long sleeves of Daniel\u2019s shirt tug along his arms. His pants were holding on by mere threads, and his mostly-exposed, scarlet boxers clung to his upper thighs like a second skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stormed off, the little blond boy looked back, transfixed on Kyle. All signs of distress were gone. Kyle locked eyes with him for several seconds before a nearby car broke the lock. Kyle hung his head, flexing his toes in the dusty, dry dirt. Almost every inch of his long legs were bare for the world to see. Denim threads snapped higher and higher every few seconds, putting Kyle in a private world of amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExasperated gasps interrupted Kyle\u2019s dreamlike state. The sound of an inhaler followed. \u201cYou\u2026 should have\u2026 waited\u2026 Kyle!\u201d Craig huffed through his labored breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s guilt returned. \u201cCraig, I didn\u2019t mean for you to run. I was just-- Well-- when you said--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaid what?\u201d he huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you were coming down on me earlier, I just-- I HAD to run. I had to show you what I could do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig\u2019s breathing slowed. He walked ahead, winding through the field of cars. Kyle followed. \u201cPerhaps next time, act to your full potential without having to be prompted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle kicked the loose grass, unsure of what to say. After several moments of silence, Craig continued. \u201cWhat I mean is: it\u2019s ok to feel things. Happy. Sad. Whatever. But you\u2019re a big kid now. Literally. People are going to look to you for help, just because you\u2019re big. You LOOK like you know what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stopped instantly, only yards away from their car. Craig was right. He was a big brother now. And he was going to act like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how?!\u201d Kyle exclaimed. His face reddened. \u201cI may BE big, but how do I ACT big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig, in his usual matter-of-fact tone, said, \u201cWatch Daniel. See how he does it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys listened to the final stitch come undone, allowing Kyle\u2019s ripped jeans to fall to the ground. Both stood in silence, only the sound of distant light generators roaring in the distance filled the air. Kyle uncontrollably chuckled. \u201cI really am a big kid now huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Kyle. You are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s boxers strained as hard as they could around the growing tween. Every square inch of Kyle\u2019s expanding body forced them to their very limits. In a matter of minutes, he knew that they too would rip clean off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig opened the back passenger door to a 2006 forest green Saturn. The car wasn\u2019t known for its size, but it was all Daniel had. Craig motioned for Kyle to get into the passenger seat. Kyle lumbered inside, immediately realizing the bucket seat was way too close to the dashboard for comfort. He fumbled for the lever and finally pushed back the seat as far back as it would go. Although he could not fully stretch out his six foot frame, it was much better than a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig quickly climbed into the back seat and closed the door. \u201cNow we wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor how long?\u201d Kyle asked, turning his head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever long it takes for Daniel and Clay to return. I don\u2019t know about you, but I do not know how to drive a car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence. \u201cAnd we are NOT leaving them behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle no longer wanted to leave Clay behind. His stomach churned with excitement, awaiting the moment he could finally put Clay in his place. There was only one other thought in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much longer until I don\u2019t even fit in a car anymore?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grrrrrrroooowl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked down, visibly watching his stomach vibrate with another loud growl. He had only been wearing it for a few minutes, but Daniel\u2019s shirt was already uncomfortably tight. He tried to buy some time by opening the buttons, but that time was now running out. His knees creeped against the dash, reminding him that his growth was not slowing down-- if anything, it was speeding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how much taller I\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Kyle asked aloud, fumbling with the band of his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard to say,\u201d Craig replied. \u201cOne thing is for certain, your stomach hasn\u2019t stopped rumbling since we got in the car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing I can do about that. I haven\u2019t eaten anything in hours and growing must be tiring work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly. In fact,\u201d Craig continued, pushing his glasses up the narrow bridge of his nose, \u201cThe amount of energy your body must be exhausting in order to replicate that many cells this quickly for this long must be staggering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn English, Craig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, why didn\u2019t you say it like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long groooowl filled the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you go get me something to eat then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to stick together, Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but I\u2019m obviously starving over here. What do you think will happen if I don\u2019t eat enough, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig considered Kyle\u2019s question. \u201cI will have to give that some thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s good to starve?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. But the question is what effect food will have on you in this state.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Craig. Simple question. Simple answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig sighed. \u201cFine, I will go get you something, but do not go anywhere, understood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither boy recognized the irony of a 4\u2019 7\u201d inch child telling Kyle and his 6\u2019 5\u201d frame what to do with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, Mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Craig slipped out of the car and returned to the main gate. Although the number of cars was dwindling, there were still enough to hide the entrance-- and now Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle tried to readjust in his seat, but his head was less than an inch away from the roof. He was even having to hunch over a bit. He found a lever on the side of the seat and pulled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOMP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was now lying flat. He stretched his legs and sighed with relief. \u201cBetter,\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt the elastic in his hand go slack. He looked down as realized his boxers had finally given up. Apparently, he had been mindlessly playing with the fabric before it broke. A long rip now exposed his dick, releasing it from captivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked bigger than Kyle remembered. \u201cA heck of a lot bigger than Clay\u2019s, I bet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking about it, Kyle\u2019s long fingers instinctively tugged as the limp flesh. Teenage hormones forced it to inflate and rigidly lengthen in a matter of seconds. The expanding rod forced Kyle\u2019s longer fingers apart, but did not unfurl his grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe base of his cock ripped his boxers further, and with an unconscious motion, Kyle finished the job, freeing the plump sack below. A warm drop struck Kyle\u2019s stomach. He knew what it was; didn\u2019t even have to look. Instead, his eyes rolled back into his head as his hand picked up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s feet pushed against the metal of the car, forcing a groan. He imagined what it would be like to keep growing bigger and bigger. He was already bigger than his brothers. Soon he would be bigger than this car. Who knows? He may even be bigger than a house once this was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat beaded up along Kyle\u2019s smooth skin, which had turned a slightly reddish tint. His heart pumped harder. His hand moved faster. Kyle didn\u2019t even notice the moans escaping his mouth, the slight rock of the car, or the occasional headlight rolling past the empty windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle imagined himself a giant, looking down upon Clay like a bug. At first Clay only came up to Kyle\u2019s shin, then only his ankles. Soon, Kyle imagined he was so large that he couldn\u2019t see Clay\u2019s insignificant form at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis member throbbed harder at the thought, growing even longer than it had been a moment ago. In moments, Kyle felt the surge of pleasure sweep over him. A hot stream of thick white cream erupted from the engorged ploom, shooting over his stomach, streaking to a halt over his chest. Kyle\u2019s abs tightened, folding his body in and out with each pulse. His feet immediately banged against the bottom of the dash, but went entirely unnoticed by the horny teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach released another long growl, rippling the pool of drizzling cum now standing in his tight belly button. Another ripping noise sounded-- a sleeve of his shirt pulling away. Kyle relaxed, immensely satisfied, despite the growing chasm in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s emerald eyes slowly rolled back into place. He arched his back with a long, satisfying stretch while he waited for his vision to come back into focus. He realized his head was completely past the head rest and was now being cradled by the back seat instead. His knees still crunched into the air, despite being laid as flat as he could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his eyes finally came into focus, he saw... </span></div></div>",

But what could he do? His clothes were all but gone, cum covered his body, and even laying down he found it difficult to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig moved to the back passenger door and opened it, holding a hot plate of sugar funnel cake in his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stayed frozen, his head half-cocked on the back seat, his hand still gripping himself. What was Craig going to say? What was he going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an eternal moment, he felt like Craig was just staring at him. Kyle watched unblinkingly as his brother finally leaned in. \u201cI won\u2019t say anything if you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief washed over him. \u201cThank you Craig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone touches themselves, Kyle,\u201d he reminded with his usual, matter-of-fact tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle exhaled, a smile spreading on his face. \u201cThis is probably the first time I have ever truly appreciated that mind of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering how much more you have grown,\u201d Craig began, examining Kyle\u2019s enormous, naked body, \u201cThis will probably not be the last time either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle followed Craig\u2019s eyes and saw what he had already felt. Kyle was much bigger than he was when they left the carnival. All of this within a matter of minutes!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much bigger am I going to get anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood question, Kyle. We don\u2019t even know what caused this to happen in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gulped. Craig continued. \u201cAll we know is that it is still occurring, and seems to be accelerating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig handed Kyle all the napkins he had brought with him. \u201cThese were intended for your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grinned sheepishly as he took the stack. Craig waited unblinkingly, causing Kyle to become more conscious of his naked body. \u201cUm, do you mind\u2026 turning around Craig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYou could grow to be thirty feet tall for all we know. Considering there are no clothing options for someone that big, you might want to consider getting more comfortable with people seeing your body in the nude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t argue with the logic, but the feeling remained. \u201cStill\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPractice.\u201d Craig\u2019s voice was firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle immediately started wiping himself down, surprised by the number of spots he had coated himself with. It didn\u2019t help that his hormones were already demanding more attention. His cock had hardly calmed since he stopped, even with Craig standing right there. \u201cMaybe I like being watched?\u201d Kyle wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chunked the huge wad of wet napkins out the open door over Craig\u2019s shoulder. Craig cocked his head. \u201cWas that the best you could come up with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s sheepish grin returned. \u201cBetter than leaving it all in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could have hit the funnel cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s mouth instantly moistened, followed by another, longer growl. \u201cThank! You! Craig!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle scooted his huge, bubble butt along the top of his backrest, crouching over in the back seat. Craig barely had time to hand him the plate before all that remained was a thin layer of powdered dust on Kyle\u2019s lips and fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad I didn\u2019t need any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Craig. I don\u2019t know what came over me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunger,\u201d he immediately responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight as always,\u201d Kyle grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig\u2019s attention shifted for a moment, then was back on Kyle. \u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Kyle looked through the windshield and saw a pair of bobbing redheads in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I need to do?!\u201d Kyle asked, surprised his nerves had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet back in the front seat and cover yourself with Daniel\u2019s shirt. I\u2019m not sure if he will be as understanding as I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded and instantly scooted his hulking form back into the passenger seat. He immediately noticed that the seat was so much smaller than it had been a moment ago. The backrest was back up, still damp with sweat, forcing Kyle\u2019s back uncomfortably forward. He couldn\u2019t sit up straight, and his legs were once again bent into his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, his member had calmed for now, giving him one less thing to worry about. Craig hopped into the back seat at Kyle struggled with Daniel\u2019s shirt. It was way too snug around his arms, stretching impossibly tight at the elbow. As he tried to readjust himself, a loud RIP sounded on Kyle\u2019s back and the pressure instantly disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere goes the shirt,\u201d Craig observed with an even tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle took the two haves, tried to cover himself as best he could, and crouched as low as he could in his seat. \u201cIf Clay doesn\u2019t already know, I want to this be a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay bounded into the back seat, apparently upset by whatever he and Daniel had been talking about. Daniel followed a few moments later and instantly noticed Kyle\u2019s bare body. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d he exclaimed internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get home,\u201d Daniel huffed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig handed the keys back to Daniel. \u201cI know! I know! You said that a thousand times on the way back!\u201d Clay exclaimed as the engine roared to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daniel kicked the car in drive, Clay continued his childish tirade, \u201cApparently, some little GIRL couldn\u2019t stand to stay at the carnival and had to ruin it for the rest of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle knew Clay was talking about him, but he said nothing. He was too excited to be upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel weaved his way out of the snaking maze created for the cars. Despite most of the cars being gone and leaving the empty field, carnival workers were still directing traffic as if it were full. Finally, they were back on a paved road and heading away from the carnival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay continued to boil in his seat.\u201cSeriously, Kyle, why did you have to go and ruin this for the rest of us. We still have plenty of tickets, the carnival doesn\u2019t close for another hour, and Mom said we didn\u2019t have to come back until it was over. So, what did you do? Wet your pants or something? You jumped off the ride kinda fast. Thought you might have thrown up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Daniel erupted, trying to focus on getting everyone home as fast as possible. Street lamps whized by them so quickly, the car was left mostly in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s excitement ebbed into the same frustrating heat he felt when this all started. Clay\u2019s tone grew increasingly more mocking and babyish with each sentence. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was wasn\u2019t it? You got so scared you pissed all over yourself. I knew you didn\u2019t have what it took to get--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle suddenly twisted around and thrust his enormous arm through the opening between the seats. He grabbed Clay by the shirt and yanked him close with hardly any effort. Clay\u2019s snide instantly became fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, Kyle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle-- down! Clay-- Language!!\u201d Daniel barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?!\u201d Clay stammered, frozen in place, both boys ignoring their older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grinned darkly. \u201cI became a MAN\u2026 pipsqueek!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoved Clay\u2019s tiny body away with surprising force. Clay rebounded off the back seat several times before coming to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle spun back around in his seat, having never felt more satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stole several glances at Kyle, in total shock over his size, and his now-apparent strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled at Daniel with the biggest \u201cdid-I-do-good\u201d grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel snapped his head forward. \u201cLike I said Clay, we\u2019ve got to get home!\u201d</span></div></div>",

THIS is not normal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig\u2019s earlier warning looped through Kyle\u2019s mind. What would scientists do if they could get their hands on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo hospitals!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you Kyle! What the hell is happening to you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already told you!\u201d An edge creeped into Kyle\u2019s tone. \u201cI\u2019m growing up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s knees were firmly against his stomach now. No matter how much he tried to ball himself up, he was running out of room, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO ONE grows THIS fast!\u201d Clay\u2019s voice cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Clay? I thought you liked surprises! King clown in our whole grade. Always tricking people and deceiving people\u2026 hurting people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay gulp and redirected. \u201cDaniel. You know something is wrong here. Nobody grows this fast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you like me to do about it?\u201d Daniel gripped the steering wheel even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already told you! We have to go to a hospital or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sick!\u201d Kyle roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how would you know that?!\u201d Clay shot back, \u201cDo you know how this happened?! How DID this happen anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on Kyle, and he felt it. He stammered, \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that I feel fine. BETTER than fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd by my calculations, Kyle is not going to be able to fit in this car for very much longer,\u201d Craig calmly chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel glanced into the rear view mirror. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it appears that Kyle\u2019s growth started sometime around the time we went to the Haunted House ride. He was four feet, seven inches then. As we drove away from the carnival, he was well over six feet tall. He is probably closer to seven now. This means that he has grown roughly a foot and a half in less than an hour. If this remains steady, and we are still half an hour from home, he will be nearly nine feet tall by the time we get home. I seriously doubt that the car will be able to withstand that amount of size and weight for that long before space becomes a serious issue in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s head struck the ceiling with a muffled THUMP, punctuating Craig\u2019s point. Clay, Daniel and Kyle were speechless, their mouths all hanging open. \u201cWas it really true?\u201d Kyle thought, \u201cCould a simple little card make me that big that fast? Is this what 1% a minute felt like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel spoke first, \u201cWhat makes you think he will grow that big, Craig? No person that has ever lived has ever reached that height, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnheard of yes, but--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet to the point,\u201d Clay interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere has been no indication that Kyle\u2019s growth will be stopping anytime soon. Like I said, it appears to be steady. There is even a possibility it could be accelerating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018accelerating\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the moment, I cannot be sure. Not enough information. All I know is that there have been no indications that it is slowing down, and without knowing more about what caused it, it\u2019s unlikely we will find a way to stop or counter it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCounter?\u201d Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReturn you to normal,\u201d Craig replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot on my life,\u201d Kyle thought angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat means a hospital!\u201d Clay shouted again. \u201cWho else would know how to handle this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle almost spoke again, but was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d Daniel exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLanguage, Daniel,\u201d Clay mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the triplets noticed what had caused Daniel to curse. Flashing red and blue lights were following them, quickly gaining on the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe cops!\u201d Clay shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that!\u201d Daniel snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to pull over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t!\u201d Craig replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf the police pull us over now, it is no telling how long they will hold us here. Kyle is growing every second. They are bound to notice something\u2019s up when they see a growing, naked teenager in the front seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019m going to fit in this seat, anyway.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s head was now face down. His shoulders were less than an inch away from joining his head on the ceiling. His body was just so big, much bigger than Daniel. Kyle\u2019s knees could not recede anymore into his gut and was now slowly crushing the dashboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig continued. \u201cWhat do you think a bunch of narrow-minded adults are going to do when they see Kyle and realize what\u2019s happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel nodded and gripped the steering wheel. \u201cAlright, guys. I need you to hold on. I think I have an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Craig both grabbed the handles above. Kyle hugged his huge, smooth legs with his long arms, flaring his calves and pulling himself together as tight as he could. His eyes innocent peeked over his mounded knees, wondering what would happen next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cars whizzed by impossibly fast, all going the wrong way. Daniel weaved the car back and forth along the straight stretch of highway before them. Red and blue lights continued to flash, filing the car with their unsettling light and reminding the triplets just how much they were depending on their older brother right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had never been more focused. Every car before them was just another obstacle to avoid. After all, like Craig said, what would the cops do with Kyle if they noticed what was happening to him? Surely they wouldn\u2019t leave things alone. They would take him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to protect him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s legs expanded into the dash, crushing the plastic in on itself. There was nowhere else for him to go. His right arm and leg filled the passenger window with endless flesh. Kyle could no longer keep his feet off the floor. The course fabric tickled the bottom of his soft soles as the skin literally stretched across it. His shoulders were now on the ceiling, along with his head and neck. How much longer before his body forced its way out of the confines of the car?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engine relentlessly groaned with staccato, metal thumps. Between that and the one-hundred-miles-per-hour air whooshing through every little crack in the car, the sound was nearly deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraig!\u201d Kyle shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to scoot over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScoot where? There\u2019s no room back here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I have no room up here. You are going to have to scoot over in the next few seconds if you do not want my body to crush you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay finally realized Craig's one option. \u201cHell no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?! No other great ideas genius?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig rolled up onto Clay as their was a sudden CRACK! Kyle had released the seat lever, jolting it down flat in under a second. His body instantly expanded into the new found space, filling most of his half of the car. His head was on the backseat headrest, his butt filled the bottom half of his own back rest, and his knees were still over the dashboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle moaned with relief while Craig fumbled for the seat belt. The car suddenly took a hard right, throwing Craig onto Kyle\u2019s chest. Kyle wrapped his arms around his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should stay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig\u2019s glasses had flown off and were now somewhere else in the car. Still, he calmly looked up at Kyle\u2019s blurry face, turning onto his back. \u201cAgreed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay re-buckled his seatbelt as the car struck a pothole, violently shaking everyone inside. Kyle held Craig in place, while his own head bashed against the roof. \u201cOw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry guys!\u201d Daniel shouted. \u201cWe are about to go off the main roads. This is going to be a very bumpy ride!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the car began to constantly shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle, are you hurt?\u201d Craig asked, looking up at his brother\u2019s blurred out chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Kyle!\u201d Clay shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re butt-naked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust noticing, butt hole! There are no big-n-tall stores in here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s half-hard dick shook back and forth, slapping against his bare skin. There was nothing anyone could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave we lost them?!\u201d Kyle shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet! But we should soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hard turn to the left flung Clay into Kyle\u2019s arm. His oversized body stopped him instantly and was much firmer than Clay remembered. Craig was still safely nestled in Kyle\u2019s arms with Kyle\u2019s body absorbing most of the shock from the constant rocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe corn fields!\u201d Clay exclaimed, leaning up toward Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank God they haven\u2019t harvested this part yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are going to take this car into the fields?!\u201d Clay shouted worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot a better idea on how to lose the cops!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I do not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen shut up and let me drive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay threw himself back into his seat and crossed his arms with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the cops are saying something,\u201d Kyle blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaying what?\u201d Clay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably asking us to pull over,\u201d Craig replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike we can\u2019t see those flashing lights!?\u201d Clay shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey can\u2019t assume---\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car hit another hard turn, flinging Kyle\u2019s huge knee into Daniel. The impact forced Daniel to lose his grip on the steering wheel, sending the car into a tailspin. Clay let out a blood-curdling scream, watching the world blur. Daniel immediately flung his weight into Kyle\u2019s leg, forcing it off the steering wheel and regaining control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp, Daniel switched off the lights and took a hard right turn around the gravel road, then an immediate hard left, down a bumpy hill and straight into the corn field. Kyle\u2019s right arm elbow smashed into the passenger window, cracking the glass while his read continuously banged up and down along the back window. Clay couldn\u2019t stop his screaming, while Craig was calm as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the car came to a screeching halt with Daniel killing the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone quiet!\u201d Daniel commanded in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay swallowed his fear. Daniel leaned toward the windshield, gripping the steering wheel with fearful anticipation, wondering if the cops would noticed when they left the road and where they went off to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the hill, flashing lights approached the curve Daniel had taken before. The lights slowed, followed the curve and then sped off along the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel released a staggering exhale. \u201cWe lost them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to see the sight he had blocked out until now. Kyle\u2019s enormous body filled the entire passenger half of the car. Craig was snugly protected under Kyle\u2019s arms while Clay sat motionless next to the impossibly-huge teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! Perfectly fine!\u201d Clay shouted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle had me the whole time,\u201d Craig added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you, Kyle?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Kyle\u2019s torso filled his view. \u201cWe have to get him out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow, genius?\u201d Clay snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s huge! How can we move him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you: Get out of the car!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig strained against Kyle\u2019s limp arm. The thick limb held the boy firmly in place.\u201cSome assistance please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel gripped one hand under Kyle\u2019s bicep and the other on his forearm, giving Craig the sliver of space he need to crawl off of Kyle and out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shook his brother\u2019s wide shoulder. \u201cKyle, you have to wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front seat groaned, like metal was twisting under the dashboard. He must still be growing! Daniel realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get him out of here,\u201d Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe what!?\u201d Clay glared, \u201cAnd how do you suggest we do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClay may be right.\u201d Daniel doubted to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just so much of him. No matter where Daniel pushed, Kyle\u2019s heavy body resisted. Besides, there was nowhere to push Kyle. The only spot in the whole car not already filled was the driver\u2019s seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraig!\u201d Daniel called out, \u201cOpen the passenger door. You and Clay are going to have to move his legs while I move his upper body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see, Daniel. My glasses fell off somewhere in the car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Daniel flushed, \u201cClay, YOU open the door and show Craig where to push!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get anywhere NEAR Kyle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClay! Why do you always have to be so difficult?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m difficult!?\u201d he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Clay! ALWAYS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you ever go out of your way to help the rest of us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot this again,\u201d Daniel retorted as he removed himself from the car. \u201cLook, Clay, I will gladly hash out every little problem you have with me, my friends, my dress-- Every decision I have ever made in my whole life! But your brother is unconscious! He needs our help and I CANNOT do this alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay stared intently at Daniel, then flicked his eyes to Kyle. After a long silence, he threw his hands up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! Just remember the whole, \u2018can\u2019t do it alone\u2019 thing, because we are totally coming back to that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel returned to the back seat, behind Kyle\u2019s back. Clay lead Craig to the passenger door, opening it with a dramatic sigh. \u201cYou may want to step back Clay,\u201d Craig began, \u201cWhen the door opens, the force of Kyle\u2019s leg will likely--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s leg fell free from the open door like a drawbridge, striking Clay square in the chest and shoving him to the ground. Craig could only see the blur of movement in the moonlight. \u201cAre you alright, Clay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay threw himself back onto his feet, seething with hot anger. \u201cThe behemoth just hit me Craig?! What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig thought for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re speaking normally, so I can assume that while the jolt surprised you, you are unhurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Clay could argue, Daniel interrupted. \u201cAgreed, Craig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s other leg eclipsed the stick shift and center console. He had really grown since Clay last got a good look at him. An hour ago, Kyle was a pushover. Now, he was a huge slab of meat that would be impossible to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want us to do, BIG brother?\u201d Clay mocked in a half serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to get his legs out from underneath the dashboard before he grows any larger. If we can work his legs to the back door, we can slide him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Craig chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Clay snapped, \u201cMost of his leg is already hanging out the door anyway. Isn\u2019t that right, four eyes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you need me, Clay?\u201d Craig continued evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay could never bait Craig, no matter how hard he tried. Clay took Craig\u2019s hands, leaned around Kyle\u2019s exposed leg and put Craig\u2019s hands on Kyle\u2019s cock. \u201cYou hold this while I get as far away as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig felt no end to the flesh Clay had handed him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if this will be the best leverage point to move Kyle, Craig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine you spoilsport!\u201d Clay moved Craig\u2019s hands to Kyle\u2019s right calf. \u201cYou hold onto THIS instead, while I work on the other leg. We are going to try to get Kyle\u2019s feet into the back seat with Daniel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter,\u201d Craig nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay huffed away, reappearing in the driver\u2019s seat. Both boys grabbed Kyle\u2019s legs and slowly tried to pull his feet up from under the dashboard. \u201cGeez! These are heavy!\u201d Clay exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Kyle\u2019s left ankle, thudding Kyle\u2019s knee into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful!\u201d Daniel barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike he even felt it,\u201d Clay shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay pulled Kyle\u2019s knee closer to him, but was then stopped by the driver seat backrest. He reached down. \u201cI\u2019ve got his foot! \u2026 And it. Is. Huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s left foot was twice the size of Clay\u2019s tiny, twelve-year-old hands. It took both of Clay\u2019s hands to grip around the sole, pulling it loose from under the dashboard. He had to crawl mostly out of the car, so that Kyle\u2019s knee could go in the driver\u2019s seat instead. Clay finally released Kyle\u2019s huge foot with an \u201cOoomp!\u201d as he fell backward out of the car and right on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright, Clay?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter than ever, bro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you, Craig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s other leg was now out of the passenger door, his foot firmly pressing into the soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too hard to see without my glasses, and I can hardly move this leg by myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay appeared next to Craig. \u201cStep aside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay squated down, grabbed Kyle\u2019s foot in his hand, and forced his leg back into the car, covering his junk and resting on the other leg. Now, both legs were in the driver seat and both feet were in the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! His feet are free. How big do you think he is anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can discuss this later,\u201d Daniel huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle\u2019s foot is bigger than my hands. HANDS! ...With an S\u2026.\u201d And Clay held out that S like the sound of a snake for several seconds for before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why we have to get him out of this car! Now, you come take my spot, while I go to the other door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNear his butt!\u201d Clay antagonized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay kicked his shoes, flinging soil in several directions, but did what Daniel asked. Clay tucked into the car behind Kyle\u2019s back and Daniel stood at the now-open back driver door next to Kyle\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to need your help to slide Kyle out of the car. I\u2019m going to pull on his shoulders while you push his back.\u201d A moment passed with no response. \u201cCraig!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Daniel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuide Kyle\u2019s feet as best you can. Try to make sure they do not get too banged up while Clay and I slide him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will do my best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay eyed Daniel incredulously. \u201cSeriously? You may not want to think about how big Kyle is, but you may want to think about how heavy he is. You think you can \u2018shoulder\u2019 that weight all by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay dramatically shook his head with wide eyes. Daniel continued, \u201cThen on my count, help slide him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel wrapped his hands under Kyle\u2019s armpits, trying to get a firm grip. Both of the other boys got in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. On three. One\u2026 Two\u2026 Three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Craig, pulled Kyle\u2019s feet toward him, seeing how best to move his brother in his mind\u2019s eye. Daniel\u2019s face turned beet-red. \u201cI\u2019ve got the shoulders out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s butt stared back at Clay, daring him to do something awful. But, by some miracle, Clay resisted the urge and shoved it forward with his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalf way there-- guys!\u201d Daniel\u2019s arms flared, his triceps rounding into soft horseshoes. Kyle was much heavier than he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig finally got ahold of Kyle\u2019s quads, which, side by side,. Side by side, the way they were, they filled most of the space between the seat and the roof. All he could see for several moments was Kyle\u2019s bare, smooth legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s body began to sag between Daniel and the car. He was getting too heavy, but Daniel dared not drop him. \u201cClay!\u201d he strained, \u201cGet -- here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel squeezed out two hard breaths while Clay took his sweet time. \u201cGrab his waist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay wrapped his arms under the side of Kyle\u2019s flat and firm waist. \u201cNo extra fat on this kid, huh?\u201d Clay joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull-- Clay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was ready to collapse. In a few short moments, they finally freed Kyle\u2019s legs from the car. His feet thudded to the ground as Daniel collapsed. Fortunately, his tight gut caught Kyle\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid there motionless for several seconds, staring at the clear night above. Clay slowly entered view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever again. Got it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig found his way around the car, up Kyle\u2019s body, and joined his brothers next to Kyle\u2019s head. His body stretched a long way from the car, his broad shoulders crushing a pair of helpless cornstalks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daniel finally stood up, Kyle began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously!?\u201d Clay exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel could only glare at him, too out of breath to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eyes rolled open, slowly focusing on his three brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey buddy!\u201d Clay drew out in an overly cheery tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle groaned, \u201cHey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow ya feeling?\u201d Clay\u2019s creepy cheer continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing special. Stopped off for some frappuccinos. Talked about the latest gossip,\u201d Clay responded with false enthusiasm before continuing in more real, aggravated tones, \u201cAnd barely escaped the police with our LIVES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle swooped his long arm around the dirt, mindlessly smacking a corn stalk before reaching his head. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohnson\u2019s farm. Daniel thought it would be a nice place to go picnic!\u201d Clay fidgeted more and more aggravatedly with every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eyes settled on Craig. \u201cYou\u2019re ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig tipped up the side of his lip. \u201cThanks to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay leaned over Kyle\u2019s face, hovering inches away. \u201cAnd thanks to US, we freed you from the car before you could utterly destroy it! Not like it matters. Daniel pretty much took care of that with his ace piloting skills!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay leaned away, revealing Daniel\u2019s reddened face. He was still breathing hard. \u201cThank you, Daniel. You saved us,\u201d Kyle said., \u201cSaved me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did everything I could,\u201d he huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than enough,\u201d Kyle smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd thank you, Clay, for doing your part!\u201d Clay mockingly told himself, \u201cIt was amazing how you moved hundreds of pounds of flesh out of a broken vehicle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did that?\u201d Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Craig chimed in. \u201cIt took everything they had, but they got you out of the car safe and sound. We were concerned if we left you in there too long, your growing body would hurt itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle considered Craig\u2019s words carefully before shifting his emerald eyes to Clay. Although he could not muster a smile, he did say, \u201cThanks, Clay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore of Kyle\u2019s senses returned, revealing new aches all over his body that had not been there before. He shouldered himself up and in moments stood a full 8 and a half feet in the air. Finally getting to stretch all the way out, without clothes or cars crushing him, was its own reward. All three of his brothers disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, still growing, probably accelerating,\u201d Craig remarked.

Do whatever you need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay erupted with another huffy pant. \"This is so stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked the ground as hard as he could, rocketing loose soil straight at the beaten car, and stamped off down the long line of corn. Daniel hesitated, but soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does he have to always act like that?\u201d Kyle snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to be quiet, Kyle. Your voice is making your skin vibrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe straightened his back and zipped his lips, mouthing \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig stretched his fingers as wide as he could across Kyle\u2019s smooth skin. Tiny, fine white hairs tickled his palm. Kyle\u2019s smooth stomach expanded and contracted in deep, rhythmic breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you try to breathe more shallowly? I need you to be as still as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle instantly tensed his stomach and began a new rhythm of short, quick breaths, locking them in his rib cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter,\u201d Craig said, sliding his hand further down Kyle's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle watched his brother, feeling more mesmerized with him than Craig was with Kyle. He didn\u2019t fully understand what Craig was doing, but a lifetime of Craig being this smarty-pants brother taught him to trust him at his word. He had a way of seeing things and figuring them out in a way the other brothers couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig closed his eyes (mostly blind to the world anyway) and focused on Kyle\u2019s skin. Both of them stood like silent statues. Only the sound of distant, angry voices and a symphony of crickets broke the cool night air. As usual, Daniel and Clay were arguing, but both boys blocked it out of their mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Kyle\u2019s toes bumped into Craig\u2019s tiny shoes, riding up the tip of his soles. Kyle softly Stammered, \u201cI-I didn\u2019t move. I swear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d Craig whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently pulled his foot out from underneath Kyle\u2019s long row of toes, stepping closer and straddled Kyle\u2019s lengthening feet. Craig grazed the top of Kyle\u2019s bare skin with his rubber soul until both feet found firm ground. \u201cIt only confirms my hypothesis,\u201d Craig thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t help but think how small Craig seemed now, how helpless. And he couldn\u2019t help but notice how large his own loose hanging manhood compared to his tiny brother. Craig was now shoulder to shoulder with a firm pair of oversized grapes, gently draped by a slow throbbing shaft. In fact, Kyle\u2019s ensemble was just as large as Craig\u2019s tiny shoulder, maybe even a smidge bigger. Kyle tried to block the thought out, and focus on his breathing. But of course, this proved impossible. He felt his shaft lengthen a bit. The ploom of his dick swelled slightly as it dropped lower to the ground. Not again! he screamed in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s thickening flesh grazed Craig\u2019s short-sleeve shirt. Kyle felt the fabric rub against the head, stimulating it, forcing his thickening flesh to grow even faster. Kyle waited for a response, but either Craig ignored it or didn\u2019t notice. In moments, Kyle was fully erect. Veins wrapped the long shaft as it protruded proudly into the night and Kyle was doing everything he could not to encourage another release, holding his hands firmly in place. Craig gave him one pass earlier tonight, but how many more would he get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour pulse picked up a bit.\u201d Craig\u2019s voice was emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo shit, Kyle thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each short spike of his carefully-styled hair burned in the night like flames. \"Stupid!? Me?! I'm not the one who got us into this mess. I'm not the one growing like some freak of nature, and I am not the one who nearly got us killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why we are down here! If I hadn't escaped the cops, Kyle--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Kyle!\" Clay sharply interrupted. \"It's ALWAYS about Kyle!\" He lowered his voice and took a mocking tone, \"Watch out, Kyle. Stay safe, Kyle! Don't listen to your brother, Kyle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heated tone returned to normal. \"The boy can't sneeze without you coming around the corner to make sure he's ok, while Craig and I could break our bones with you simply saying that it was OUR fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably would be your fault, Clay!\" Daniel snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay's face briefly darkened to a deep purple. Veins erupted along his neck as he bellowed a gutteral yell. \"It's always the same with you, fat boy! You never listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's face darkened. His sapphire eyes narrowed on Clay like a sniper scope. \"I don't know if you've noticed, Clay, but I'm pretty fit-- unlike some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay instantly felt the remaining baby fat in his face, and how it was boiling. \"Fit!? Don't think any of us have forgotten 'Big man Dan' for a second! So you work out now. BIG DEAL. Tried catching a ball lately?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it.\" Pain seeped through Daniel\u2019s anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Clay continued, oblivious to his older brother's emotions. \"how many years have you tried out for how many sports?! ALL rejections!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's long, swooping blonde hair hid the pain welling in his eyes. He clenched his fist, bringing several veins to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, Craig appeared between Daniel and Clay, with his glasses restored to their proper place. \"I've discovered something you two may want to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Daniel didn't flinch, their laser-like focus trying to melt each other. A few hard thuds later, Kyle stood directly behind Daniel, his two hard nipples now hanging above his older brother's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig unwittingly continued, \"I've learned 2 things over the past couple of minutes. Kyle's growth is indeed accelerating, and it is occurring even now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence hung in the tense night air. Kyle looked down at his stone-faced brother and gently set his two giant hands on Daniel's round shoulders. His palm completely enveloped them along with some of his neck, leaving his long fingers dangling down most of Daniel's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel finally broke from his trance, realizing Kyle had a hold of him. He gripped one of Kyle's huge hands gently, feeling how soft the flesh felt under his callus palm. He slowly turned and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're even bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded. \"And getting bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel faced all of his brothers, trying to block Clay from his mind, and addressed Craig. \"What do you mean, 'it's happening even now'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle\u2019s growth is a steady one. It\u2019s hard to see at the moment, but every second that passes, he is getting larger and larger. In the few minutes I observed him, I could feel his skin expanding under my hand. Even his foot widened to the point where I had to readjust my stance several times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were silent. Even Clay cooled a bit, engrossed in Craig\u2019s observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis means, while even though his growth is not as of yet visible to the naked eye, if it doesn\u2019t stop soon... it will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat word, \u201cstop\u201d bristled the hairs on Kyle's neck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason we have to do something!\u201d Clay jumped in. \u201cLook at him! We have got to get this under control before--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore what?\u201d Kyle asserted, stepping out from behind Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, man!\" Clay recoiled in disgust. \"Cover up or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith what?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d Clay snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what did you mean,\u201d Kyle continued, staring down over four feet below him. \u201cBefore\u2026 What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay held steady, but it was getting harder and harder to see Kyle as the little shrimp he was before. An hour ago, he ruled him. And now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said,\u201d Kyle strode forward with a heavy thud, \u201cbefore what?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay craned his neck as far back as it would go. Kyle\u2019s looming torso filled his view, but he had to stand his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you lose control?\u201d Kyle finally answered. \u201cIs that it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it, Clay?! You have always had the power. You\u2019re the popular one, the funny one\u2026 and have always been bigger than me.\u201d Kyle smirked. \u201cWell, look at me now, Clay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you just fine, Kyle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle straightened his back, adding several more inches to his already imposing frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK... Clay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay couldn't do anything but look. Kyle stood twice his height. His amber eyes were dead even with Kyle's cock. There was no question who was the big brother now... no matter how desperately Clay wanted to deny it.</span></div></div>",

He flinched away, while a feeling of satisfaction surged through Kyle.

It only affected Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys continued to bat around possibilities, while all the while Kyle's stomach twisted more and more. <i>I have to tell them,</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You can't,</i> a competing voice in his head battled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why not?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could almost audibly hear the slickness in the reply. <i>Because then Clay could go to the old man and get a card for himself. Then he would grow as big as you... maybe even bigger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No way! I'm already huge!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He could have other cards,</i> the voice slithered, <i>ones that are even more powerful and could once again put you at his mercy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread filled Kyle. The thought of being Clay's puppet again was tough to stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No!</i> Another voice spoke up. <i>Think of everything they have done to protect you. Craig warned you about the hidden evil of others. Daniel risked life and limb to save you from adults determined to take you away. And even Clay helped free you from the car before your soft skin ripped it's way through!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dread receded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another thought could enter his mind, Kyle clenched his fist and shouted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay pounced. \"Know WHAT Kyle?!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Legs crossed, arms up and partially covering his face, Kyle continued with his voice slightly muffled. \"There was this tent at the carnival...\" he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke, Clay, Craig and Daniel watched in stunned silence. Kyle told them everything about the tent, the old man and most importantly, the three cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are these cards now?\" Craig asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay huffed angrily. \"What bullshit!\" This drew a stern glare from Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No its not!\" Kyle blurted. His loud voice echoed throughout the empty air. He continued, softening some \"I was holding one of the cards when you jumped me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didnt--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle glared at Clay through the gaps of his fingers. Clay stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dropped it and when I went to pick it up, it was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stopwatch symbol?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what about the other two cards,\" Clay quipped. \"You said there were 3.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay huffed again, spinning in his spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there was no way they could have just fallen out of my pocket! They VANISHED.\" Kyle dropped his hands from his face and made a poof motion with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig thought for a moment, readjusting his glasses. \"While I'm not prepared to call all of this 'magic',  he began, \"it would make sense whatever power caused this to happen also had the power to reclaim their tools.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else could have done this BESIDES magic?!\" Clay shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any number of sciences beyond our current understanding,\" Craig answered calmly. \"Chemistry. Biology. Even nanites--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine!\" Clay interrupted. \"Don't make our heads explode with another of your science fiction stories!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shyly looked over at Daniel, hanging his head low, trying to decode his neutral expression. Daniel's eyes finally shifted over to Kyle, but his expression was still impossible to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad?\" he finally asked his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stared into Kyle's saucer-like eyes. He didn't know what to make of all the emotions running through him, but it was obvious his brother needed him. He shoved down the emotional war raging within, walked the few steps separating him from his enormous brother, and placed a hand on his knee. Kyle's kneecap filled his palm and fingers with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all wish for something more,\" he said after a pause. \"And for better and worse... you've got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's calm tone soothed Kyle instantly, even if he didn't fully understand what he meant. Kyle straightened his back some, revealing more of his criss-crossed legs, then stretched those out and slowly expanded his arms. Kyle was nearly at eye level with Daniel sitting down. He had grown so much and was now begging to still be his little brother. A brother that needed his warmth and affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, Kyle\u2019s thick long arms swallowed Daniel in a tight embrace. Soon, Kyle rested what part of his head he could on Daniel\u2019s firm shoulder. Daniel tried to reach his arms around Kyle\u2019s widening torso, but fell short. Kyle was a little kid again and completely unaware of the inner turmoil raging through his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow heartfelt,\u201d Clay criticized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slid his left leg aside, nearly toppling Clay. <i>A subtle reminder to keep his big mouth shut.</i> He then loosened his grip on Daniel, sitting up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can feel you growing,\u201d Daniel whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Kyle beamed. \u201cIt\u2019s like the ground is slowly sliding around underneath me. But I know\u2026 it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's firm butt cheeks and the narrow heels of his feet dug into the ground. Tiny clumps of dirt inconspicuously mounted around his steadily enlarging body. It was the first time Kyle could really <i>feel</i> his growth. It may not be much now, but that card promised even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle spread his long, thickening fingers through the loose soil and pushed himself up with a bound. In the short time he had collapsed before his brothers, he had grown another 6 inches and stood up tall at his new 10-and-a-half feet. The whole world was shrinking around the growing, red-haired boy... and he liked it. Never in his life had Kyle felt so fulfilled or assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How fast is he growing anyway!?</i> Clay exclaimed in his mind. Only a few minutes ago, his eyes were level with the base of his cock. Now, two, tight bulb-sized balls filled his view. <i>There is no way he\u2019s that big!</i> Clay's inner voice panicked, <i>Is he growing THERE too!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay\u2019s blood boiled, but he kept his mouth shut. Kyle, on the other hand, continued to see the world anew. His brothers were SO small, like 5-year-olds huddled around a parent. The longer he stared at the tops of their heads, the further away they seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stared straight ahead, directly into Kyle\u2019s navel. The tight, teardrop shape cast a thin shadow in on itself but stared back unblinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Craig's voice broke the silence, \"you said you are going to grow 1% of your current height every minute for a full day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded, digging his thick toes into the loosening ground. \u201cThat\u2019s what the man said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig's already saucer-sized eyes slowly doubled in size. \u201cOh boy.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Craig craned his neck, poking his glasses back in place. Instead of eyes, the full moon reflected at Kyle. \u201cIt\u2019s 1% of your CURRENT height. Not your original height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. So?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re 10 feet tall right now, which is probably a fairly close approximation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Kyle grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFocus,\u201d Clay snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat means you are at least 120 inches tall,\" Craig continued. \"Meaning 60 seconds from now, you will grow one and two tenths inches larger than you were. Over the following minute, it will be even more because you will be that much taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's brain sizzled. \u201cSo... I\u2019m growing... fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. And accelerating like I mentioned before. Now imagine when you reach 100 feet tall, which, at this rate is only a matter of time. You will grow a whole foot taller in a matter of 60 seconds. That's adding the height you are now onto itself every minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe math wasn\u2019t sinking in, but one number did. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a hundred feet tall?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a hundred feet tall?!\u201d Clay repeated with dread in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be WAY bigger than that,\u201d Craig answered, then turned back to Kyle. \u201cYou\u2019ve more than doubled your height in just over an hour. Your FIRST hour. Your smallest hour. Your growth is going to pick up exponentially.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s imagination instantly furnished a whole neighborhood around him. Houses barely peeking above his knees. Cars crushed with ease under the weight of his feet. Once again, and without warning, his member sprung to life. The idea of growing so large allured Kyle in a way he had never thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay gagged, snapping Kyle out of his trance, but then shrank back. A foot-long cock hung heavy above Craig and Clay, throbbing with an entrancing rhythm. All of that size and power, and it was only his cock! Daniel tried to advert his eyes, but could only turn his head down. Kyle felt the thick pulses and instinctively covered himself with one hand. Well, he covered most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-anyways\u201d he stammered, \u201ckeep going, Craig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBottom line, you are going to get much larger than I originally projected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much larger?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe will be over a 100 feet tall within the next few hours. And by noon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stepped closer, holding his throbbing cock close to his skin. \u201cYes? What are we talking?\" he grinned uncontrollably. \"A FEW hundred feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig shook his head. \u201cOver a mile tall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrickets filled the silence with their harmonic strumming as each boy tried to fathom what it would be like for Kyle to be over a mile tall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every step shook whole city blocks. Crumbling asphalt wedged between his long toes before falling hundreds of feet back to the Earth. Each toe filled entire city streets, crushing adorning trees, cars, lamp posts and any other thing stupid enough to be under this titan. The tallest skyscrapers were like playthings, yet he continued to grow. Kyle felt every limb in his body thicken, stretching longer and longer. The sides of his feet crushed entire buildings just by the sheer might of his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was all powerful. Who could stand in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fantasy ended with Kyle\u2019s total domination. In the real world, cricket chirps continued to fill the very real silence between the boys. Kyle felt the mushroom head of his dick swell, begging to break free from his closed fingers. His thick balls ached, churning clear fluid from the tip. Every time he imagined being a true giant, he immediately switched on in ways nothing had ever caused before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay had retreated into his own mind\u2019s eye. All he could see was a looming shadow, miles long, hanging in the clear day sky. The eclipse grew and took shape. It was the largest foot he had ever seen. It stretched on seemingly forever, and was coming down directly on top of him. He tried to move, but his legs were bolted into the ground. As the enormous flesh crushed every bone in his body, he suddenly found himself hovering miles in the air. Kyle\u2019s enormous, devilish face stared back at him, wearing an evil smile. His once little brother licked his lips and raised Clay far above his mouth. Kyle opened his fingers and soon Clay feel hundreds of feet, down into the depths of Kyle\u2019s gurgling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to fix this!\u201d Clay shouted, sweat dripping off his skin. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but we have to find someway to reverse whatever you did, Kyle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay\u2019s words ripped Kyle away from the pleasures his member and imagination offered. It hurt. \u201cWhat do you mean, reverse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard Craig! If you don\u2019t stop growing, forget being the tallest person that ever lived! You\u2019ll be taller than skyscrapers! How will you live? How will you...\u201d he gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGGGGGGRRRGL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay eyed Kyle's stomach with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle put his free hand on his flat stomach, feeling another growl grumbling beneath his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like the funnel cake's gone,\" Kyle joked to Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funnel cake?\" Clay twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said earlier, it's the only thing he's eaten since dinner. And magic or not the fuel for his growth is coming from somewhere. It makes sense that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay snapped a \"zip it\" motion with his hand. \"No more science!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long growl quickly followed. \"Suggestions?\" Kyle sheepishly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid strode a few paces away. \"Well, we are next to a corn field after all,\" he motioned with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raw corn!\" Kyle recoiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as good as cooked,\" David replied, ripping a low-hanging piece off the stalk, \"from a nutritional point of view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it's a vegetable!\" Kyle's inner child reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel chuckled. \"Only Hos Hos and Twinkies for you, huh, Kyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the cupcakes,\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I forget?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stripped the long, brownish-green covers with a few quick motions, revealing a yellow-white corn on the cob. He handed the cob up to Kyle. \"I'd tell you it makes you big and strong, but that's kind of a moot point at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle giggled, hoisting up the cob. \"Like I need to get bigger anyway.\" Clay grit his teeth and Daniel's face hardened, as Kyle's stomach gurgled again. <i>I'm working on it,</i> he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared down the reflective pieces of corn, clenching either side with his thumb and index finger. The undersized cob stared back at him coldly. Like most American preteens, processed sugar was the only food group for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just eat it!\" Clay barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle squinted his eyes shut, opened his hungry jowls, and took his first bite with a loud CRUNCH! Crackling sweetness popped across Kyle's long tongue. Another bite followed, and then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, no so bad,\" Daniel said, already preparing the next cob. Juices flowed from the cracks on either side of Kyle's thick lips, dripping off his chin. Soon, the cob was demolished and dropped helplessly to the ground. A quiet rumble followed Kyle consuming the next piece of corn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pig,\" Clay whispered to Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Energy,\" Craig whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's body expanded, inch by inch as he polished his way through another half-dozen cobs. His head rose through the cool air, while His shoulders widened, along with his stance. The dirt and tiny rocks tickled his soft soles, but did not distract him from his task. Though the corn was not the best-tasting thing in the world, it would do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick feast, Kyle finally came up for air, surrounded by the devastated cobs surrounding his thick feet. \"You finished?\" Clay mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle inhaled and nodded. \"For now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we need to be off,\" Daniel said, pulling the car keys from his pocket. He tried to ignore how his eyes now only came to the small in Kyle's back. Soon, he would be no taller than his brothers legs, and this thought inexplicably aggravated him. He had to do something. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off to where?\" Kyle asked, wiping bits of corn from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The carnival. We have to try and find that old man you met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whyyyyy?\" Kyle drew out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel clenched his jaw. \"You know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm fine,\" Kyle protested, putting on his most innocent face. \"Really. See! Not hungry anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And nearly as tall as these stalks of corn.\" Daniel sighed a heavy sigh, looking at Craig. \"Clay is right, Kyle. If there is a chance we can fix this, then that is what we have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red-hot sword pierced Kyle's gut, twisting his insides like a molten stew. His lip quivered ever so slightly. \"Really, Daniel. ...Fix? ...What's wrong with me exactly?\" His agitation grew more obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's 'wrong' with you Kyle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glimmer of hope! \"Then what's to fix?! I can do things now. I can help. I can protect us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?! Protect?!\" Clay snipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle whipped his head to face Clay. \"Look how big I am. How big I'll become!\" His eyes darted around. \"I bet I can even lift the car now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel tried to speak again, but Kyle instantly strode off to the car back in the dirt pile where they \"landed\" before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three boys followed, hustling to keep up with Kyle's long strides. By the time they caught up, Kyle had already bent over behind the car with both palms firmly set beneath the bumper. In a single motion, Kyle trusted his hips forward, straightened his legs and brought the car's tail end up with him. The front bumper hovered inches above the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's arms wobbled some. \"See! It's a little heavy, but in time it will be light as as feather. Who would dare mess with us!?\" He released the car, slamming the metal and rubber back to the ground with a loud THUMP! The shocks rocked up and down violently, trying to steady itself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle winced. \"Sorry. I'll set it down more gently next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boys couldn't help but be amazed at the feat, Daniel most of all. For a moment, he felt the weight of being \"the older brother\" lift from him. But then the same aggravation from before returned, silencing his hope.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wheels turned quickly in his mind and he had an idea. \"Fine, Kyle. We will merely ask if there's a way to pause the growth, not reverse it,\" he lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're what?!\" Clay exclaimed. Daniel shot him a dark glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stayed silent as he considered Daniel's suggestion. <i>Maybe he's not going for it,</i> Daniel thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Kyle's head slowly began to bob, soon turning into a full nod. \"Yeah. Right. I can do a great job being a big brother at this size, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel faked a smile. \"Yes. You're so big now. You must be the 'biggest brother' in the world. Who would dare hurt us...\" he gulped, \"when we have you?\" This encouragement caused Clay's mouth to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle vibrated with excitement! His wish really was coming true! \"Thank you! Thank you, Daniel! I won't let you down. Here! I'll start getting stronger for you guys right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped down into the push-up position, kicking up a huge cloud of dust around the group. All the boys immediately coughed, all but Kyle that is. Craig's chest immediately tightened, although his solid purple Polo hung loose off his shoulders. His inhaler instantly appeared, followed by two sharp huffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel choked on a mouthful of dust, inflaming his throat, as he fought back his growing frustration. \"Great idea Kyle,\" he coughed. \"I'll take Clay with me and leave Craig here with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay's irritated eyes blazed between Daniel and Kyle. \"You will?\" both he and Craig said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle slowed around his tenth push up, his heart pumping fast. Completely unaware of the mounting distress around him, he rolled on his side and propped his head up on a hand, blocking the car from view. \"I can come with! I know where the tent is and what the old man looks like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel gulped, struggling to steady his nerves and frustration. The wheels in his mind grinded for an answer. \"You were really descriptive earlier. I'm sure we have enough to go on. Besides, you clearly won't be fitting in the car anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked over his shoulder, amazed and excited to see how small the car looked now. His heels rubbed against the back tire while his head stretched all the way to the front bumper. His rear end alone blocked most of the back passenger door with one cheek inches away from cool metal and the other from clear glass. He giggled. \"I guess you're right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sighed with relief. \"Right. And you'll need some steady food, right, Craig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely,\" Craig replied as he pocketed his inhaler, \"but we still do not know where the energy source--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel cut him off as smoothly as he could. \"See. Another great reason to hang here. Wide open fields, no lights, food...\" <i> And no chance to stop me,</i> he thought darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay stomped right up to Daniel and aggravatedly whispered, \"What the hell are you thinking?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now,\" Daniel hushed back, then cleared his throat. \"The real question is...\", he began, looking up the hill they had rocketed down. \"Does the car still work?\" He slowly walked toward Kyle, clenching the keys tightly in his hand. Why was he not excited for his brother? Why were all of these maddening feelings stabbing his mind? Kyle was still huffing a bit, but his eyes glowed. They twisted Daniel's heart upside down, but still he persisted, driven to put things back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rounded his brother's short extended arm and planted elbow, Daniel finally got his first real look at the car since plummeting down here. It may have been over 10 years old and covered in a layer of dust, but so far, seemed its usual self, the narrow dark headlights staring forward unwavering. Daniel kicked the driver-side tire, thankful that the thick rubber didn't budge. Other than the cracked passenger window, nothing else seemed out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, he slide into the driver seat and gave the key a hard crank.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What about the hill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Clay's sarcastic tone, he was right. The hill was a bit steep, and Daniel didn't know where the real road that led from the farm back to the gravel road actually began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle bounded to his feet, shaking the ground as he did so. Even the car rocked some. \"Sounds like a problem best left to the professionals!\" He posed for a second, standing tall with his fists on his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what miraculously 'professional' service do you plan to provide?\" Clay asked, sarcasm still oozing from his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's face flattened though the driver window. He turned slowly and felt a pinch of his earlier dread return. Kyle had grown over half a foot taller since dropping to the ground for those push-ups. Daniel's eyes then moved to Craig, who stood closest to Kyle, his mop of red hair hanging just above Kyle's knee. He watched with some dismay as Craig compared his tiny size 7 1/2 shoe with Kyle's enormous bare feet. The tip of Craig's toes barely reached the swell of Kyle's arch, and the sheer weight of his body visibly sank his heel several inches into the farmland, which was not even noticeable to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Kyle exclaimed, instantly distracted by his new view. \"This field just goes on and on! I can even see the barn and silos on the OTHER side of the field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Kyle was so wrapped up in his own amazement, he didn't even register his shin-sized brothers. Instead, he embraced the entirety of the farm for the first time since they rocketed down the hill. The tops of the corn stalks parted before Kyle, revealing a wide expanse of similar stalks filling the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clear evening sky illuminated pairs of thick metal silos and and a tiny barn beyond the field. Beyond that, prickles of light zoomed past on the indistinguishable highway they had been on before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle turned his head, still caught up in his new perspective. The hill they plummeted down before was still dark and looming, easily twice his current height. But he would not be deterred. He knew the road was up there, and that was where he would help Daniel get started towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, around Kyle's thick steel beams of legs, Daniel's impatience swelled. He'd seen enough, and the sooner everything was back to normal, the better! \"Kyle!\" he called out. \"You see a road? Signs? A path? Anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kyle replied, \"it's just fields, all covered with corn. The only road I know of is the one up the hill and THAT is where I'm going to take you!\" As he turned his gaze back down, he noticed his brothers again, knee-high and smaller than ever. \"Oh my gosh guys! You all all SO SMALL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually--\" Craig began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now!\" Daniel interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think of everything I can do now! I'm so big, I could-- I could---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could what?\" Clay asked, not even attempting to conceal the nervous edge in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's eyes narrowed in on Clay's spiky red hair. \"This for starters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay instantly felt the ground vanish while a tightening pressure crushed into his entire torso and back. He hung helplessly in the air. Kyle's broad eyes narrowed while his thick hands held his tiny body in place. \"Wh-what are you doing, Kyle?\" His voice wavered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle laughed. \"I could probably hold you with one hand if I wanted to.\" The pressure intensified. Kyle's thick fingers dug into Clay's ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what gives, Kyle?!\" Clay stammered. \"I thought you were helping Daniel get back to the carnival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about to,\" he smiled. \"You wanted to know something I could do now that I couldn't do before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeat irradiated from Kyle's heavy palm into Clay's back. The tiny twelve-year-old uncontrollably shook inside of Kyle's mighty grip. \"Th-this is one super skill, Kyle!\" he panicked. \u201cThink of everything you could do now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel watched helplessly below, but this had gone on long enough! \u201cKyle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time! We\u2019ve got to the get the car out of here.\u201d He received no reply, and his face flushed with heat. \u201cYou said this was a job for the professional\u2019s right?\u201d Kyle blinked, his gaze breaking from Clay. \u201cWell, you are THE professional I need right now,\u201d Daniel frustratedly pleaded. \u201cIf you don\u2019t see a road, then that means our only option is to go back up this hill.\u201d He gulped. \u201cWhich means I need you! I need you, Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay slowly descended back to the ground in between Kyle\u2019s huge legs. The moment Kyle released his brother from his grip, Clay collapsed to the ground. Fear trapped him between Kyle\u2019s thick feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He needs me,</i> Kyle thought, filling him with excitement. \u201cTime to take car of the car, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stared up at his brother unblinking. His pulse raced, but he tried to keep a cool appearance. \u201cYes, Kyle. Time to bring in the big guns.\u201d Kyle beamed even brighter, and Daniel turned to whisper to Clay. \u201cGet. In. The Car.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay sat frozen with his head tucked in between his shoulders. His breath shaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClay,\u201d Daniel stated more forcibly. \u201cGet. In!\u201d He instantly leapt up and raced into the passenger seat, slamming the door shut with a bang. Daniel followed, quickly moving into the drivers seat, then leaned out the window, looking up to Kyle. \u201cI\u2019m going to put the car in neutral Kyle. Meaning, we are in your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I won\u2019t let you down, Daniel,\" the giant replied. \"You can trust me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's heart twisted. He then shut the car door. Kyle took his place behind the car, bending down and gripping the trunk with his two thick hands. The car instantly moved and began rolling forward. Craig stepped back, one eye watching the scene, the other continuing their endless calculations about the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked over into the passenger seat. Clay\u2019s shaking head was haloed by the cracked glass. \u201cYou ok, Clay?\u201d He reached out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGET OFF ME!\u201d Clay shrieked, huddling into the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClay\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car continued to rock, Kyle pushing them to the base of the hill. Once they were finally there, Kyle gave a shove and began their ascent up the dusty grass. The weight of the car pushed back, straining Kyle\u2019s arms a bit, but it was nothing he couldn\u2019t handle at this size. Each step thundered up the hill. Rocks and dirt alike parted effortlessly with each heavy step. His heels dug deeper and deeper into the hardening land as they rose higher and higher up the hill. Kyle\u2019s face reddened as the hill became more steep. With a few heavy pushes\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He thundered over to Daniel\u2019s window and crouched down. \u201cTold you I could do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe window rolled down, greeting Kyle with a steel gaze. \u201cI had no doubt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle beamed, his view of his older brother tinted by excitement, oblivious to the tension in his face. \u201cJust you wait, Daniel! You don\u2019t have to be the only big brother anymore! I can help you now.\" He lowered his voice. \u201cKeep you safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel clicked the car into drive. \u201cSee you soon, Kyle. For now, keep <i>Craig</i> safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded vigorously as the car sped off, kicking gravel and dirt up at Kyle\u2019s face. He coughed a bit, standing back up, but was still far too proud of his accomplishment to see anything but his new found confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch this, Craig!\u201d Kyle called down into the darkness. He swung his arms back and suddenly leapt several feet into the air and into the darkness. Craig watched Kyle\u2019s plummeting body grow impossibly fast as he approached, and with a thunderous BOOM, Kyle landed a few feet away, driving his feet into the loose land. \u201cThat was amazing!\u201d Kyle cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich part?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALL OF IT!\u201d Kyle exclaimed, flinging his body back on top the grass with a loud THUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig approached Kyle\u2019s feet first, his eyes fixed on his toes. Each rounded digit flexed in the air, vibrating with the same excitement surging through Kyle. His big toes came all the way up to Craig\u2019s tan belt. Curiosity compelled Kyle\u2019s intellectual brother to slide his fingers between the fourth and fifth digit. All of his fingers were instantly consumed before popping free on the other side. Kyle\u2019s flesh rocked against Craig\u2019s thin fingers, forcing his rail-like arm to shift back and forth. Such strength, and these were only his toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig finally pulled his hand free, gently gliding it along Kyle\u2019s skin. Unlike before, when Craig had to truly concentrate, even his fingertips could register Kyle\u2019s subtle growth. Kyle\u2019s flesh was impossibly smooth. Only the tiniest white hairs flecked against him. He brought his palm to a stop on Kyle\u2019s knee, which rested most of the way up Craig\u2019s thigh, and held still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re growing even faster now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s chest filled with air. \u201cI wonder how fast!\u201d he said as he deeply released, tucking his hands behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver an inch a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stared into the clear sky. \u201cReally? How do you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last half-hour calculating the answers to those questions,\u201d Craig calmly replied. \u201cAnd more,\u201d he said more softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you feel it, Craig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig walked further, sliding his palm up Kyle\u2019s thigh. The muscles below rippled like an undertow beneath Kyle\u2019s otherwise shapeless leg. \u201cYes. Your thigh is sliding out from under my palm even now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could have sworn I saw the corn stalks shrinking earlier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably did,\" Craig nodded. \"It won\u2019t be much longer until the whole world literally looks like it\u2019s shrinking around you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s already shrinking! All of you look so small, even now!\u201d Kyle\u2019s leg continued sliding and expanding from his hips, the side of his leg bumping into Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig adjusted his stance, undeterred from his brother's encroaching body. \u201cWhat is it like to be this large, Kyle? You are easily the biggest person who has ever lived.\u201d Kyle\u2019s member flexed, which Craig instantly noticed. \u201cAnd you like it, do you not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s face flushed, but did not deter the throbbing growth below. \u201cW-why would you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not the first time your body has responded to the thought of your own growth,\u201d Craig responded with the same matter-of-fact tone he always spoke with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle craned his eyes down, still unable to clearly see his brother. \u201cH-how do you know that? I mean, how could--\u201d Words failed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Kyle. Each person is allowed to be excited by what excites them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Kyle\u2019s embarrassment, his shaft lept into the air expanding higher. He sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. Everytime I think about how big I am or how big I could be. Well\u2026 you see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig observed a foot-long cock sailing even taller. \u201cI do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig continued walking up the length of Kyle\u2019s body, one step at a time. He finally stood in line with Kyle\u2019s cock, which was blocked firmly by his hips. \u201cHave you noticed any other changes since this started? Besides your growth, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle thought for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty hungry\u2026 and pretty horny,\u201d he added sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head expanded, reaching eye level with Craig. \"You know,\" Craig said, \"your extreme arousal may be able to help me answer another of my questions about your growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're going to tell me how starting...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig continued without missing a beat. \"The main question I have here is whether your growth is cell enlargement or multiplication.\" Kyle stayed silent, knowing full well Craig would continue explaining himself. \"But without proper equipment, like my microscope, I am unsure I would be able to come to that determination, even at your full potential height.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had begun to zone out, breathing in the fresh air. \"But one quick experiment I could perform,\" Craig continued, \"is to take a 'living' sample and monitor that. For instance,\" Craig eyed Kyle's erect member, \"A semen sample.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kyle blinked, tuning back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I?\u201d Craig asked toneless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May you what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Collect a semen sample?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinked silently. \"Your cum,\" Craig amended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s face crunched, then instantly relaxed. \u201cMay you\u2026 what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to determine---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Science.\" Kyle interrupted. \"And you need me to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ejaculate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn't know what to think. Craig had always been an odd one. Blunt, in his own way. <i>Do I care?</i> Kyle wondered, knowing the answer already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nope,</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do I care if Craig watches me jack off?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock immediately throbbed larger, rocking in the air. <i>We say go for it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Excellent.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His khaki pants gently rubbed against Kyle\u2019s skin, sending stimulated waves all through the relaxed giant. Craig\u2019s foot was immediately halted by a large plump sac and a pumping organ beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, I misjudged how large your scr-- balls were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled smugly. \"Bigger than you thought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig readjusted, sliding his foot underneath Kyle\u2019s thick sack and set his other foot on the ground, but only barely. He then leaned over slightly, wiping his thick head of hair out of his face, and gripped Kyle\u2019s throbbing cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He don't play around!</i> Kyle laughed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore sensations instantly surged through Kyle. No one had ever touched him like this before. The fact that it was his brother didn\u2019t matter to him. This sensation was wonderful and he liked it. In fact, Kyle was coming to believe that he liked people watching him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig ran his hand along the thick shaft, outlining various throbbing veins with his fingers. Every time he stroked one, Kyle\u2019s cock would throb harshly. \u201cThis is rather incredible,\u201d Craig said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle moaned. \u201cYeah it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine, due to your growth, all of your hormones are out of balance, and now they are generating extra stimulants to compensate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig\u2019s words drifted around Kyle\u2019s head, but never into his ears. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid his fingers up to the blood engorged ploom, running them all around the base. Kyle's breath seized through his teeth. His hips instinctually trusted into the air, forcing Craig to catch himself on Kyle\u2019s waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very sensitive,\" Craig noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved his fingers back down the shaft, wrapping them as far as he could. Thick veins and shear flesh were just too much cock for his tiny hands to cover. Craig gently pulled up and down, bringing louder moans from Kyle. The shaft throbbed more, pulling Craig's arm back and forth with jerks. This was the \"Goldilocks\" spot Craig had been looking for, so he continued to pull on Kyle's meat in this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kyle spoke. He hardly sounded himself. Distant. \"Grab my balls,\" he rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig immediately shifted. He gently gripped the closest one and palmed it as best as he could. Kyle's eyes rolled back. Why had he not had someone else touch him before?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig silently inspected the heavy organ with the tips of his fingers, groping deeper into the flesh. Kyle's hips staggered up and down, jerking Craig along with it. The thrusts were slight at first, but grew more pronounced. Craig felt his feet lift from the ground and never set back down. He watched Kyle\u2019s thick ballsack push against his leg and around it slightly. \u201cI wonder if stimulation speeds up the process.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...can... find... out...\u201d Kyle panted, his pulse racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, an enormous hand coiled around Craig, slamming him into Kyle's thick cock. Pre-cum flowed all over Craig's purple polo, soiling his chest instantly. Without warning, Kyle released him and instantly swung the other hand into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig\u2019s legs widened, forced further apart by Kyle\u2019s continued growth. Kyle\u2019s engorged sack enveloped half of Craig's right leg, both balls crushing into either side. Kyle stroked his rock-hard cock harder and faster. He was close now. The whole world fell away once again, leaving behind the same minuscule city landscape he had seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig readjusted, trying to hold on to his brother any way he could. He wrestled a mini-candy tube he had in his pocket, flicked the top open with his thumb, and dumped out the contents. Most of the rainbow-colored, hardshell candies bounced off Kyle's hip and into the dirt. The others bobbed around Kyle's waist for several thrusts as they found their resting places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's hips were like a bucking bronco. Craig gripped Kyle's thick thigh with his own legs using his feeble strength. It wasn't enough to steady himself, so he jammed his right arm down between Kyle's thick sack and inner thigh and coiled his hand up into the crevasse of Kyle's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle instantly picked up the pace. Craig awkwardly held his container, ready to collect his sample. Kyle's ass rhythmically gripped Craig's hand, locking it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ahhh, ahhhh!\" Kyle moaned through each heavy breath. Moments later, Kyle's hips locked up. Inches from Craig's cheek, Kyle's geyser erupted, firing several thick shots into the air, while more drizzled from the tip. Craig tried to twist himself free, but Kyle's rock hard glutes and tightened legs held him firmly in place, with his chest flat against Kyle's hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more surges of sharp pleasure, Kyle instantly relaxed, dropping his hips back to the ground, and Craig along with them. Silence hung in the air for several moments. Kyle's eyes slowly rolled back into place. His breathing slowed. Feeling supremely satisfied, Kyle said, \"Next time you need to conduct another 'experiment', I am first in line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never felt that good before. Was that because of his growth, like Craig said, or because someone else was touching him? Kyle smiled broadly, wiping that question from his mind. <i>Who cares! That was awesome!</i> he thought.</span></div></div>",

He leaned his head up and saw Craig laying face down on top of him. At least, that small person had to be Craig, although he looked more like a toddler now. He reached his hand around and easily plucked Craig up, putting him back in his original upright position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig let out a gasp while feeling returned to his right hand. After a few short breaths, his breathing returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stared down at his tiny brother. \"Now what did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I was stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Craig began. \"You nearly threw me off of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grinned sheepishly. \"I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry. I held on and got what I needed,\" Craig replied, holding the closed candy capsule in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good? I guess.\" Kyle finally noticed the dark blot on Craig's polo. \"What happened to your shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig pulled his leg out from in between Kyle's thighs and slid back to the ground. He tried to take a step forward, but his inner thigh pinched. So instead, he straddled his legs wider and waddled his way up to Kyle's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle laughed. \"What are you doing, Craig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently sitting on your leg like one would sit on a horse did not agree with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My LEG did that?!\" Kyle chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as your pre-fluids did <i>this</i> to my shirt,\u201d he emphasized the darkened stain across his chest. \"And your butt nearly crushed my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle laughed harder. \"Sorry? I don't know my own strength?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect you do not know your own strength,\" Craig affirmed, finally stopping in line with Kyle's eyes. \"And do not worry. I am fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's laughter slowed. \"I'm laying flat on the ground and your HIPS barely come up to my eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig nodded and looked down the entire length of Kyle\u2019s body. \u201cIt is truly fascinating how large you have grown. I estimate you are over 15 feet tall by this point, give or take a foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle rocked his head along the ground in disbelief. \u201cI can hardly believe it myself! A few hours ago, I was begging for a few extra inches, and now I must be the biggest person who has ever lived!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle peered over his flat chest and limp cock to see just how far away his toes seemed. He flexed his toes in the air, each half a foot long themselves, but felt dissatisfied. \u201cThe crazy thing,\u201d he inhaled, \u201cis that I 'look' the same to me. I can feel the ground shifting under me, even now. But my feet still look like my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Craig agreed. \u201cYour entire body is growing proportionally. That means your head, body and feet are all growing at the same rate. So, from your perspective, it probably looks like the whole world is just getting smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES! Exactly!\u201d Kyle nodded sharply. \u201cBut I also have this feeling inside me that tells me how much bigger I am. More powerful. I can\u2019t explain it exactly, but I KNOW that I\u2019m changing.\u201d Craig opened his mouth, but before he could even take a breath, Kyle interrupted. \u201cAnd I do not need the scientific explanation. I know it\u2019s happening and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig closed his mouth and stood silent. Kyle finally turned his eyes back to his quiet brother and noticed little lines across his forehead. Kyle\u2019s stomach dropped. \u201cCraig, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig blinked. \u201cYou didn\u2019t upset me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what are you thinking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow tired I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle did feel relaxed, but not at all tired. Everything that had happened over the past few hours had wired him up. \u201cSleepy, bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig nodded, hanging his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I know something is on your mind,\" Kyle prodded. \"It\u2019s when you\u2019re quiet that I worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig kept his head down. \u201cI am unsure when Daniel and Clay will return and I have no desire to sleep on the ground. With my asthma and other allergies, along with historical evidence---\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe camping trip!\u201d Kyle snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe camping trip,\u201d Craig grimly agreed, \u201cI was wondering--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWondering what, Craig,\u201d Kyle\u2019s huge eyes softened on his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay raised his head and those oversized hazel eyes enveloped Kyle\u2019s heart. \u201cCan I sleep for awhile\u2026 on your torso?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's voice slowly drawled, \u201cYou want to sleep\u2026 on top of me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve reached a sufficient size to host my entire body between your collar bone and hips. But I totally understand if-- What I mean is---\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in Kyle\u2019s living memory, Craig was at a loss for words. He could not watch it go on. \u201cYes. Craig. You are welcome to sleep here,\u201d Kyle pointed to his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant, Kyle saw the corner of Craig\u2019s thick lips twitch up his cheek then back down again. Another first that melted the teen giant\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig never smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments, Craig crawled back on top of Kyle, careful to avoid the streak of hardened cum on Kyle\u2019s right shoulder. The little boy laid his head back, parted his feet on either side of Kyle\u2019s cock, and relaxed. Kyle\u2019s huge frame barely registered the extra weight on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Craig whispered, his eyes hanging lower by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gently wrapped his two thick arms around his brother\u2019s waist, convinced this was what it was like to be a big brother. \u201cAnytime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, Craig\u2019s body slacken with puffs of sound now emanating from his partly gaping mouth. Kyle felt content. He was finally big enough and strong enough to take care of someone, and he wanted to hold on to this feeling for as long as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gazed into the twinkling stars above while Craig slept, and his body continued to grow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clay\u2019s head hadn\u2019t moved from the cracked glass pane since leaving their brothers behind at the farm. Daniel fought every instinct to speed like he had before, knowing if another cop were to try and stop him, they could recognize the car and be in for some serious trouble. But most of all... he could not be stopped from returning to the carnival and finding some way to return Kyle to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a few minutes to go before reaching the main gate, Daniel broke the silence. \u201cYou alright, Clay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shortly tried again with the same, empty reply. So he continued, \u201cListen. I know that we don\u2019t always see eye to eye. In fact, we fight more than brothers should, I guess. But I wanted you to know that I think you\u2019re right.\u201d Daniel waited once again, glancing between the dark road and his inert brother for a reply. Still, none came. \u201cKyle is growing quick. Before we know it, he could be double the size he is now. Forget fitting in a car. What about a house?\u201d Daniel felt these misleading truths twist out of him. \u201cHe could never lead a normal life that way. And what if Craig is right? What if the government got their hands on Kyle? I cannot even imagine--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay stirred, instantly silencing Daniel. The frightened boy hung his head, turning it slowly to face Daniel. Where fury would have earlier been, Clay instead sounded drained of energy. \u201cThen why are you helping him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you were going to help him stay his current size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel gulped. \u201cI did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you saw. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d Clay\u2019s voice shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaw what?\u201d Daniel carefully asked, unsure of how to interact with this ghost of his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was crushing the life out of me, Daniel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle-- when he,\u201d tears welled around his amber eyes. \u201cHis palm and his thumb-- My god! Just his thumb?! He-- was so strong. I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t breath.\u201d Daniel was speechless as he listened. Clay\u2019s face reddened while his voice took on more force. \u201cThat-- That THING-- has to be stopped, Daniel! There is no 'leave him at his current size'. He has no intention of protecting ANYONE except himself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Daniel whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay violently inhaled, ready to lash his next argument, but then stopped. \u201cYou what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you. I agree with you Clay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmotions mixed and stirred within Clay. \u201cBut you said---\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think he would have let us go if I told the truth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of realization washed over Clay. \u201cYou lied to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s voice heated. \u201cYeah. I lied. To make sure that we could get back to the carnival as fast as possible and end this before it gets any worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay blinked slowly, wiping away his now-forgotten tears. It felt weird for him and Daniel to agree on something. \u201cWhen did you make up your mind, Daniel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d he quickly deflected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you realize that, that freak had to be brought under control?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you said, when he picked you up and started hurting you,\u201d he lied again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay was now completely confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like when any of you torment each other,\u201d Daniel continued, wiping the shakes from his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing when you SAY something hurtful, but like you said-- He could have killed you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay once again saw his own mortality and in that moment also saw Daniel in a light he had never seen him before. <i>He cares?</i> The thought bounded around inside of Clay, returning color to his cheeks and removing the fear that had consumed him before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He cares,</i> he affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twist of the steering wheel, Daniel and Craig entered the empty parking lot. All of the life that had filled the carnival just a short time ago was gone. Only dark husks remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, great!\u201d Clay exclaimed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d Daniel instantly replied. \u201cWe\u2019re sneaking in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He really is different</i>, Clay thought. And he liked the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and Clay quietly approached the six-foot-tall metal gate. Chains wrapped it shut with a heavy lock set in the middle. Clay started to admit defeat again as Daniel leapt onto the gate and climbed over it. His shirt rode up a bit, exposing his flat stomach before he landed firmly on the other side. \u201cYour turn, Clay,\u201d he said, pulling his shirt back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay was stunned. Nothing made any sense anymore, but after a few moments, he too was over the gate, and the two brothers started searching for the tent from Kyle\u2019s story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think we are going to find, even if we do find the tent?\u201d Clay whispered. \u201cEveryone\u2019s gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping if there was some magic that could make Kyle like that, then there is more that can reverse it,\u201d Daniel began, refocusing his eyes in the moonlit darkness. \u201cKyle said he was given 3 cards. I bet there are more like them in the tent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay followed closely behind his brother, struggling to see his way through the labyrinth of darkened rides and booths. All of the metal and wood twisted in the empty night, looming higher than Clay remembered. Each of the thousands of bulbs stared him down with their lifeless eyes. A sudden crash of metal startled him, putting Clay right on Daniel's coattails. A long shadow emerged from behind a distant trash can. A cat perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Clay slammed into Daniel\u2019s long back. \u201cWhat happened?!\u201d he yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay bounced back, trying to recover a shred of his pride. He peeked around Daniel and saw the infamous tent Kyle had mentioned. \u201cThat\u2019s IT?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so much smaller than Clay had imagined. The paint-chipped sign that read \u201cWishGiver\u201d hung above the closed entrance flap. The faded multi-colored patterns on the tent almost seemed to glow with a creepy iridescence, like when someone stares at a light for too long. \u201cAre we both going to even fit in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d Daniel said, pushing the main flap aside.</span></div></div>",

A thick, intricately patterned rug covered the ground. Old wooden shelves lined all sides of the tent, and opposite the entrance was a wooden counter with a glass case. More interestingly, a single, tapering candle stood high on the counter, and it was lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Daniel called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so weird,\u201d Clay remarked. \u201cI thought this thing was going to be impossibly tiny and--\u201d he gulped, \u201cwho lit the candle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anyone, but who cares?\u201d Daniel replied. \u201cStart looking around and see if there is anything we can use on Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Sure. Let\u2019s just rummage through an old wizard\u2019s alchemy set. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s safe,\u201d Clay deadpanned, some of his wit returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel glared down at his brother. \u201cYou got another idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay rolled his eyes. \u201cNothing about tonight is making any sense, so no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen get looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel drifted to the right side of the tent a few paces from Clay. He saw mostly books, bound in leather, on the shelves. Their spines has no labels. He grabbed on and flipped it open but all of the pages were blank. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he wondered. \u201cProps?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay slowly worked his way down the left hand side, hesitant to touch anything. He jerked back when he saw a shrunken head staring down at him. \u201cA previous customer,\u201d he thought. Books lined many of the shelves, but other odd trinkets and objects filled the rest. Assortments of crystals and rocks, rows of candles in all shapes and sizes as well as wooden and metal figurines to name a few. One of the wooden figurines in particular caught Clay\u2019s eye and made him instantly laugh: a slender, six-inch tall wooden man with an erect penis longer than he was tall. A heavy ballsack filled the front, obscuring the man\u2019s legs and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay picked up the figure and examined it. \u201cI bet you get all the ladies, don\u2019t ya, dude?\u201d He then noticed that the other figures around him were all similar sizes, but each were extremely exaggerated in some way. One figure looked fatter than the Buddah. Another was immobilized with intricately carved muscles. A third was twice as tall as the others, with a small miniature city carved in the wood at the base. Another had enormous feet bigger than the figure\u2019s whole body. There was even a figure that had the features of a fox, but was humanoid. \u201cSo tell me fellas,\u201d Clay whispered to the collection, \u201care you his treasures or his captives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply. Of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay continued to mindlessly fondle the figure he was holding as he inspected the others more closely. Daniel, on the other hand, had made his way to the counter, seeing multiple decks of cards in a variety of sizes displayed in the case. He went around the back of the counter, and tried to tug it open, but noticed it was locked. \u201cThose could be the very cards Kyle was talking about,\u201d he thought, tugging again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw that the lock holding the sliding door shut looked like nothing more than a diary lock. He gripped it in his hands and began to pull on the tiny hook. With a swift jerk, he snapped the lock and hook it was attached to clean off, allowing him to open the door. \u201cSuccess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for the nearest deck of cards and set them on the counter. They looked like oversized playing cards that were rigid and tan. But rather than numbers, images were painted onto one side of each card in black ink. He thumbed through them, but instantly felt a warm shock pulse throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole world suddenly grew around him. The counter pulled closer and closer to his head. The cards quickly doubled in size, encompassing his palm. He dropped the cards as the tent enlarged more. Within a few seconds, Daniel was eye to eye with the top of the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon realized with paralyzing fear that the world wasn\u2019t growing, he was shrinking! Daniel was already half his former height and still getting smaller. The counter creeped upwards, filling his view. Each shelf within passed him like floors on an elevator. His shrinking feet pulled closer together as his head got closer and closer to the ground. Amazingly, his clothes shrunk with him, and as his shrinking stopped, a flash of light blinded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his eyes, he heard the echo of his own breath. He was high up overlooking the tent. Clay stood a few feet away, but when Daniel tried to walk towards him, he was instantly stopped by a wall of glass. He was now 6 inches tall and encased in a clear bottle on the top shelf of one of the rickety bookcases he had examined earlier. Fear swirled through every fiber of his being. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on!?\u201d he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few moments, Daniel noticed Clay also stop in his tracks. Clay felt a tightening pressure in his pants and knew instantly what was happening. He was getting hard and faster than he had ever gotten hard before. But the hard-on did not stop. He felt his penis grow and thicken faster and faster. His balls churned with an electric vibration and filled every empty space they could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay felt incredible, and watched his thickening cock rip free from his pants. The shaft quickly widened, forcing the zipper apart as his growing meat ripped the metal teeth one by one in quick succession. His inflating sack did the rest, shoving his pants down around his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay\u2019s young manhood had enlarged ten times over and was still getting bigger. His engorged mushroom head flared and stretched further across the tent. He felt the tip rub against the thick fabric, forcing the tent entrance to open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stimulation rolled Clay\u2019s eyes back, weakening his knees, but he didn\u2019t fall; his enormous sack held him up and in place. He felt the weight of his beachball sized balls holding his feet down firmly and now supporting the weight of his body, like a child holds a doll. If it wasn\u2019t for the overwhelmingly pleasurable feelings coursing through his body, terror would have taken him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel knocked as hard as he could against the glass, but barely made soft thuds against the thick pane. Clay slowly came down from his euphoria and realized that his manhood was so large that he was immobilized. <i>Just like the figure,</i> he realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice emerged from the darkness. \u201cWelcome to the WishGiver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old man in a dark hood stood behind the counter, having appeared out of nowhere. Clay could not turn to see him, but Daniel could. And all he could make out was a long, wiry white beard billowing from out of the hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel. Clay---\u201d the voice continued, calmly filling their ears as if he was standing right next to them. \u201cYou are trespassing.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just one of the veins under his hands was thicker than his middle finger. His whole hand could barely cup a fourth of what he could even reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did, Clay,\u201d the old man answered, now standing next to the boy's immobilized body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh--where\u2019s Daniel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne eye shined from under the hood, reflecting the candle light. \u201cThere,\u201d he pointed down Clay\u2019s long throbbing shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel instantly appeared on Clay\u2019s six foot shaft, falling back onto the fleshy ploom behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t see him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's body trembled as he took it all in. He was half a foot tall, standing on his brother\u2019s giant-sized penis. From Daniel\u2019s point of view, Clay\u2019s shaft was like a long, two-way road with Clay\u2019s torso and head hanging in the horizon. Each thick, snaking vein were shin-high hills, forcing him to weave around as he approached his brother. Daniel stepped on one of the larger veins, instantly rising a few inches higher in the air. It held his weight with no difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was so small, Clay could not feel his brother on his shaft. It was only after a long, quiet minute that he could see a form shifting out of the shadows. He recognized his older brother a few feet away, slowly working his way down Clay\u2019s enormous dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel called back, but his tiny voice could not reach those distant ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe hears you, Clay, but you cannot hear him. You will have to wait until he\u2019s at the base. And while we wait,\u201d he continued, shifting around Clay\u2019s thick sack so that he could straighten up his tent, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell me why you are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay gulped. Daniel could hear everything, but knew it would be futile to answer. He continued taking patient steps around the pulsing surface of Clay\u2019s skin. \u201cWe-- we-- err--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpit it out, me\u2019 boy,\u201d the old man calmly coaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, our brother-- he\u2019s--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting larger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay nodded. \u201cAnd-- we were hoping that we could-- that is--\u201d He felt his own body begin to shake, hardly able to keep his voice steady. \u201cWe were hoping we could find something to put him back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man smiled and removed the hood, revealing a thick head of grey and white hair longer than his shoulders. The mane was thickly matted and twisted, like he had never combed it in his life. \u201cWrong,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay gulped audibly. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are <i>you</i> here, Clay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a few moments. What did the old man mean? He was here to fix his brother, just like he said. Or was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a wish of my own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man nodded. \u201cIndeed you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCLAY!!\u201d Daniel shouted, now less than a foot away from Clay\u2019s stomach. Clay\u2019s eyes examined his brother. \u201cWhat happened to you!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay made a gesture to his monstrous protrusion. \"<i>This</i> happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we tripped a trap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe what?\u201d Clay scrunched up his nose, leaning closer to hear his brother better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA trap,\u201d Daniel continued. \u201cWhat were you doing when <i>this</i> happened.\u201d Daniel repeated Clay's gesture towards the landscape of his brother's gigantic manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking at some wooden figurines.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel nodded. \u201cAnd I had just cracked open the counter\u2019s display case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t touch things that do not belong to you,\u201d the old man remarked, instantly standing beside Daniel in a shrunken form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Clay gasped. He tried to move his shaft again and again, but it was like a mountain, rock solid and not going anywhere. Only the gentle throbs of Clay\u2019s pulse moved the enormous flesh, rocking it in a steady rhythm between Daniel and the old man\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is <i>your</i> wish, Daniel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel fired off his questions, filled with anger and fear. \u201cHow do you know our names!? What\u2019s going on here?! What did you do to us!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel, do you think you would not be standing here if I did not want you to be?\u201d The voice was eerily calm and reassuring. \u201cTake a few deep breaths and think. Why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish fulfillment!\u201d he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, \u201cIndeed. So, I guess the question is, what is your wish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s head pounded with question, anger and fear. He couldn\u2019t see straight, much less answer the Gandolf-looking wizard\u2019s question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay was starting to realize just how large his manhood was and how heavy it felt. He stroked the sides of his sack with gentle rubs. The skin was so tight and every touch made his penis bob against the tent fabric. The old man effortlessly held his balance as both of them watched Daniel struggle to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClay!\u201d Daniel cried out in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\" Clay blushed. \"It feels good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I would not like to fall to my death, so can you stop stroking yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one barely bigger than a pinky finger, Daniel!\u201d Clay retorted. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault if every little flex is an earthquake for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel threw up his hands. \u201cJust stop for a second, won\u2019t you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d Clay crossed his arms, suspending them above the miniature people standing on his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked back at the old man, who was obviously waiting for his answer. \u201cI want everything to go back to normal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled, \u201cReally? And what is that, exactly? What is-- normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel felt hot again. \u201cNormal is not having a fifteen foot tall brother. Normal is being my old size. Normal is not giving Clay a six foot dick! Those would be some great starters for \u2018normal\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll that has happened has been each of your doing, not mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Daniel cried in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I ask you to break into my tent? What about destroying the counter\u2019s lock? Or touching the idol? And as for your brother, that was his wish, so I granted it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel rubbed his eyes. \u201cWell, UN-grant it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man gently shook his head as he strode up Clay\u2019s flesh, following one of the veins like a river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean--\u201d Daniel exclaimed, followed by exaggerated, almost-mocking jerks of his head to either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis wish will conclude at 11:59 this evening. By then, there will be a great deal of changes. Challenges. And he is going to need your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMY help?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, am I still here,\" Clay leered down at them, \"or are you two content to keep stimulating my cock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! It\u2019s true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man chuckled. \u201cTeenagers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a simple click of his fingers, followed by a flash of light, all three stood as they once had in the room. Daniel was 5\u20199\u201d, Clay\u2019s clothes and manhood returned to normal and the old man was crouched over his counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man!\" Clay said as a slight frown formed on his face. \"I kinda liked having an enormous dick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ARE an enormous---\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys flared glares at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel took a second to breath. \u201cSorry, Clay. It was just a little disorienting being so small and... seeing you in such a way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you know how I felt when I saw Kyle standing huge and nude for the first time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys turned their eyes back to the old man. \u201cWhat did you mean earlier, he is going to need our help?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am confident that the four of you will figure it out on you own,\u201d he said, then turned to the younger boy. \u201cClay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm-- yeah? --Yes? --Sir?\u201d he stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember the figurines you saw earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay looked back at the collection, \u201cYou mean joke-dick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSelect one, and this time--- to keep, with my permission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay waivered, unsure. \u201cUm, will they make my cock bigger than the tent again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man laughed. \u201cThe one you choose will have an effect of some kind, however, it\u2019s gift will not-- incapacitate you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to eye the idols, Clay briefly considered his options, before making his decision.</span></div></div>",

All of the figure's muscles were intricately carved and hulking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man nodded knowingly. \u201cAn obvious choice, but suitable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Daniel asked. \"What do I get to select?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou already have what you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another click of the old man's fingers, a bright light enveloped the boys. When their eyes refocused, they were standing outside at the carnival, but the tent was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Daniel exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this settles it,\u201d Clay sighed. \u201cDefinitely a wizard. Can\u2019t wait to rub that one in Craig\u2019s face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stormed off in the other direction, blood boiling. Clay practically skipped behind him, eyeing the wooden idol. \u201cI wonder what this one will do? Will I get impossibly strong? Enormous muscles perhaps? Will it be a slow change like it was for Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we'll find out!\u201d Daniel snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, cheer up, Daniel. I promise not to crush you into a bloody pulp when I\u2019m the strongest man alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel couldn\u2019t choke back his own frustration enough to give a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Kyle becoming a giant won\u2019t be all bad, especially if I can kick his ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t CARE that he\u2019s going to be a giant?! Just a little while ago, you were petrified!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Clay began, \u201cThat was before watching some voodoo guy or whatever give me an enormous dick, and then getting to pick this muscle idol off the shelf!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel scrambled up and over the fence. \u201cSwell, Clay. Just swell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t let you pick something for yourself,\" Clay said as he hoisted himself up. \"I guess you and Craig will just have to get used to being the little brothers after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel strode off for the car without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are we going to do with the behemoth now?\" Clay said, ignoring his older brother's dismay. \"Won\u2019t be able to hide him forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel started the car. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past hour, Kyle watched in time-lapse as Craig grew smaller and smaller on his chest. He felt the ground shift underneath him. Craig\u2019s clothes rubbed against his flesh as he grew. <i>How much bigger have I gotten?</i> he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig was so much smaller now. He easily fit along Kyle\u2019s midsection. Craig\u2019s feet hovered just above the base of Kyle\u2019s dick, while his head rested just below his chest. One of Kyle\u2019s hands was almost the same size as Craig\u2019s entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this excited Kyle in more ways than one, once again inflating his cock to its full extent. The thick shaft cast a deep shadow over the sleeping teen. Kyle at first gripped the shaft with only a few fingers, pulling back and forth with gentle tugs, but within a few minutes, he was pulling harder and faster. Ever since he had started growing, he had been incredibly horny, and apparently it was not letting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s whole stomach rumbled with hunger, vibrating Craig\u2019s entire body, but Kyle persisted. In his mind\u2019s eye, he watched himself grow larger and larger, making him even hotter. With his other hand, he rubbed his forefinger gently along Craig\u2019s body, feeling how small he was. The pad of Kyle\u2019s finger was the same size as Craig\u2019s whole hand. He rubbed his brother up and down with gentle strokes, reveling at just how tiny he was. His stomach rumbled again, gently shaking his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt himself getting closer to climax when he felt something stiffen in Craig\u2019s pants. Kyle paused a moment, unsure of what to do, but then continued. Craig had kept his cool every other time, why not this time? Besides, Kyle liked being in control. All the power. All the size. It made him even hornier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stroked Craig\u2019s little bulge with circular rubs as he pulled on his own shaft harder and harder. Once again, he felt his body tighten. Everything was getting closer to the brink when he finally felt more of his seed flow free. He quickly let go of his own throbbing dick to catch whatever dribbled out, not wanting to drench Craig with even more cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s own stream slowed when he felt a wetting spot form under his index finger. He was still rubbing Craig\u2019s dick and apparently he was starting to cum. Craig\u2019s eyes snapped open. He took several uneven gasps as hot white streams shot up his pants and boxers. Kyle didn\u2019t know what all of \u201cthis\u201d was. All he knew was that he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig pushed on Kyle\u2019s hand, feebly trying to force it up. Kyle pulled his heavy hand back a bit as Craig fumbled for his inhaler. After a few quick breaths, he relaxed. Kyle\u2019s stomach growled loudly once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t-- take much--,\u201d Craig breathed, \u201cto set off-- the asthma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Craig. I don\u2019t know what came over me,\u201d he sheepishly lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Just a little warning next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Next time,</i> Kyle wondered. His dick throbbed back in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, Craig was back to sleep on Kyle\u2019s stomach, still clutching the inhaler. \u201cJeez Craig. You MUST be exhausted!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s stomach roared again. \u201cI am going to HAVE to fix this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gently scooped Craig off his stomach, laying his brother beside him on the ground. As he got to his feet, he noticed that Craig was only a few inches longer than his entire foot. \u201cThis is so cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 10 minutes, Kyle stripped whole stalks of corn bare. His body was growing nearly 3 inches per minute and he watched the once \u201ctall\u201d stalks shrink around him. Most were not even half his height anymore. The little sprouts tickled his bare flesh and snapped instantly to his touch. The whole farm was so easy to see now. On the other side of the barn was an entire cattle pasture he had not seen before. And beyond that was a huge pool of glistening water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWater,\u201d he mindlessly muttered, feeling the dryness of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few moments, Kyle drew closer to the farm pond like a moth to a flame. His five foot long feet easily crushed rows of corn that dared to stand in his path. He hadn\u2019t realized how thirsty he was until he saw the water and now that was all he could think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thumped passed the barn, standing half its height, and the one story farmhouse, of which he was already taller than. Off to one side was a field full of harvest oats, littered with a few grain silos. Most were shorter than him, but a few were at least 10 feet taller. And off to the other side was a wide open pasture, leading him to the farm pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped to his knees and bobbed his head into the pond, sucking up gallons and gallons of cool water. The pond level noticeably dropped a few inches before he came back up for air. Taking a few deep breaths, he went back for more before getting his fill. He wiped his mouth clean, although he hair was dripping wet. As he stood up, his stomach growled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this going to be a regular thing with you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, he was ready to head back to the corn field, when the metal silos caught his eye. \u201cGrain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle took several heavy steps to one of the shorter silos, which came up only to his shoulders. He gripped the cone top of the silo with both of his hands and pushed up as hard as he could. The metal groaned for several moments before ripping up and out of place. The huge gaping hole above exposed several tons of processed oats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving his enormous hands into the silo, he pulled out a huge handful of oats. He tilted his head back and swallowed every grain as quickly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe contorted his face and smacked his lips. \u201cSo dry.\u201d He then looked back at the pond. \u201cI got this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle took another enormous scoop from the silo, walked over to the pond and submerged his hands. Most of the oats drifted out of his hands immediately, which was not what he had intended. \u201cDamn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of the oats remained in his palm, soaking up the water instantly. He took another gulp and was pleasantly surprised. \u201cBetter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle repeated this process several times, shoveling the oats out of one silo or the next and filling his gut with all he could eat until he felt uncomfortably full. \u201cAnd that is the last I want to hear out of you, understand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to stand up from the nearly drained pond as he heard a blood-curdling scream. A woman, likely the farmer\u2019s wife, was screaming loudly from inside the farmhouse. Kyle instantly knew that she was screaming at him. \u201cIt\u2019s ok-- I--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle saw a flash and heard a loud bang coming from the house. \u201cThey're shooting at me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instantly ran for it. His long strides took him tens of yards away in only a few seconds. He easily leapt over the knee high pasture fences. They were barely an inconvenience. The forest he had seen earlier was just ahead and he kept running until he was safely inside. Most of the trees were uncomfortably close together, scraping at Kyle\u2019s skin, but better a few splinters than the bullet of a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle crouched down, as far as a 32-foot-tall teen could crouch, and eyed the distant farmhouse across the pasture. A light was on inside, which meant trouble. He knew he needed to get away from here before the family started searching for him, but where to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what about Craig!?</span></div></div>",

Of course, that proved impossible. Every step he took shook the ground and all of the trees rustled with activity as he passed. All of the birds took flight and tiny woodland creatures were undoubtedly running for their lives. So he decided to ditch stealth in favor of speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leapt back out of the forest, bolting across the corn field hoping he would find his sleeping brother quickly. As his feet pounded into the dirt, Kyle saw a pair of headlights up on the winding road along the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease be Daniel and Clay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel!\u201d Kyle shouted at the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Daniel heard the shout and saw a huge shadow growing in the distance. \u201cHoly shit, is that Kyle?\u201d Clay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel honked the horn in reply. \u201cHope he understands that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big is he?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger, Clay. Bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle skidded to a halt, staring down at the car with Daniel and Clay within. \u201cGuys! Long story short, there's a farmer shooting at me and we have to get out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was thrown by how much larger Kyle was. Kyle\u2019s legs were just as tall as the hill they had barreled down when this all began. He was much, much bigger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are what?!\u201d Clay shouted, hoping out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShooting!\u201d Kyle responded. \u201cGet out of the car, both of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\" Clay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOUT!\u201d Kyle\u2019s voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle found Craig sleeping on the ground near where the car had come to a stop and scooped him up into his arms like a doll. Daniel and Clay were now standing together next to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now, Kyle?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to run!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, Kyle scooped up his other two brothers, holding their bodies against his, draping their arms over his massive forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is insane!\u201d Clay shouted as the world suddenly zoomed out from under his feet. He now hovered over 20 feet in the air, shoulder-to=shoulder with his brothers. Kyle ran as fast as his legs could take him, following the perimeter of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere--are--we going!?\u201d Daniel cried up to his brother through gasped breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnywhere but here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou-- are going-- to be seen!\u201d Clay shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m sticking to the forest, short stuff!\u201d Using his free hand, Kyle wiped the sweat beading on his brow. \u201cWhere does this road lead, Daniel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea!\" his older brother replied. \"But the interstate leads to the city, so NOT that way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it!\u201d Kyle immediately twisted off to the right, hurdled over the road and into open grassland, all of which was sparse and brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyle ran, bobbing the boys up and down rather violently, Clay could not get over the feeling of his brother growing around him. As the minutes passed, he could feel Kyle getting thicker under his arms. More fear tried to sneak in, but the idol pressing against his leg in his pocket quickly calmed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d Kyle screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Clay shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe mountains!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay looked ahead and saw the distant hills quickly growing in size. \u201cSeriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot another idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen shut it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patchy grass rapidly became uneven as the boys got closer and closer to the small mountain range ahead. While nothing spectacular, Kyle hoped that these enormous hills would easily hide them until they could come up with their next plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finding a pair of tall hills to hide behind, Kyle slowed and set all his brothers down, heaving deep breaths as he did so. He collapsed against one of the hills that was easily one hundred feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraig?!\u201d Daniel cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle refocused on his three brothers. Clay and Daniel huddled around Craig. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraig\u2019s having an asthma attack,\u201d Daniel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what\u2019s all over him!?\u201d Clay remarked at his rigidly-stiff polo and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel ignored him. \"Help me, Clay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Kyle asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough, superboy,\u201d Clay replied, sneering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was already in older brother mode. \u201cSit him up straight, Clay. As flat as you can.\" He took his gasping brother by the hand. \"Craig, it\u2019s going to be ok, but I need you to try and take long, deep breaths.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig continued to wheeze. His cheeks turned shades redder. \u201cWhere\u2019s your inhaler, Craig?\u201d Daniel asked, patting down his empty pockets. Craig shook his head as he gasped for more air. \u201cClay, do you see it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, God, it must be back at the farm!\u201d Kyle exclaimed. Squatting around his brothers, his legs easily filled their entire view on two sides. His toes dug into the dirt, with the balls of his feet supporting his full weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think!?\u201d Clay shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his bickering brothers, Daniel placed his hand on Craig's chest. \u201cKeep breathing, Craig. It\u2019s ok. Just like we practiced. In and out.\u201d He took slow, exaggerated breaths, trying to calm his brother\u2019s attack. \u201cWe are fine. See. Everyone is here. Nothing is going on. We are fine. You are fine. Concentrate on the breathing, alright, Craig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig did his best to comply, focusing on Daniel and his slow breaths. With each passing second, his wheezes lessened. It was working. Within a minute, Kyle was four inches taller and Craig was breathing normally again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHey guys\u2026\u201d Even though he didn't know anything about the idol Clay had brought back with him, he was the first to notice the changes it was causing to...</span></div></div>",

Within a few moments, hard knots emerged and started to grow beneath his polo. Daniel, too, watched as Craig\u2019s chest expanded before his eyes. Two small bumps quickly developed into thick slabs. A tiny crack developed between them and grew deeper as the muscles grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT IS THIS?! IT WAS MY IDOL!!\u201d Clay shouted at the top of his lungs, pulling back from Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle watched Craig\u2019s legs swell rapidly under his pants. The two sticks quickly took on rounded shapes before literally bursting from their strict confines. Craig\u2019s arms swelled into two large rocks, splitting the tiny polo up both shoulders, which were also getting thicker. His long, thick hair could hardly hide how wide and thick his neck was getting. Two massive chords leaped up on either side of his neck and grew thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig laid back on the ground as his body continued to surge larger. He reached his arms over his head, exposing a tightening and still-growing six-pack from beneath his shirt. His lats flared with growing size and split his polo down the sides almost instantly. Within a few moments, Craig was no longer a tiny little boy, but a musclebound teen. The shred of his clothing could not hide how well defined and huge his body had just become. Every muscle rippled and bulged with impossible strength, even as he laid there on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s lips curled up into a wide smile. Of all the people who deserved a wish coming true, it was Craig. And Craig looked amazing. His calves flared on either side of his shin. His quads were so large they buckled into each other. Every muscle was meticulously defined with each rippling chord vibrating under his taught skin. His vascularity had also increased, revealing just how tight his muscles had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel reached out and touched Craig\u2019s right pec. It instantly popped up as Craig instinctively tightened it. \u201cRock solid,\u201d he whispered under his breath. His fingers followed the thick mound around the top of the bulge and under the cleft where it connected to his eight-pack. Each ab was equally as defined, with deep grooves between each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig finally sat back up and examined himself. He breathed in, snapping what remained of his polo off his chest. \u201cWell-- this is different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig took off his glasses for a moment. Kyle\u2019s enormous form instantly blurred. \u201cStill need these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle came back into focus. \u201cYou know that you are growing an inch taller every twelve seconds or so now, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stood up to his full height of thirty-six-and-a-half feet, laughing the whole way. The boys no longer even came up to his knees, he was so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just underwent all that and you are still thinking about me?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be tough to say for now,\u201d Craig began as he stood up, \u201cBut I suspect my growth is not a steady one like yours.\u201d He looked down at his arm and flexed. His bicep instantly doubled in size. \u201cStill, this will take some getting used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig walked over to Kyle, and laid down next to his foot. \u201cJust as I suspected, I only stretch from the ball of your foot to your heal now. Probably around six feet long-- and growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked all the way down at his muscle-bound brother and felt a warm smile come across his face. \u201cAlways the scientist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn idol!\u201d Clay shouted, pulling it from his pocket. \u201cThat damn, damn, damn, damn idol!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the little figure and chucked it as far as his arm could throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you all pissed about?\u201d Kyle scrunched up his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat growth was meant for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou KNEW this was going to happen?\u201d the larger brother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew SOMETHING was going to happen, and it was supposed to happen to ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle thought for a moment. \u201cDoes this mean the old man gave you a wish, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe gave him that idol,\u201d Daniel gestured towards where Craig had chucked it, surprisingly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he just threw away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it was meant for me!\u201d Clay repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig was standing again, inspecting his body, flexing various limbs and watching the results. All of his muscles were so ripped and huge. He looked more ripped and muscular than even the biggest bodybuilder in the world, but with a 12-year-old\u2019s head. \u201cInitial results would suggest that the idol increased muscle mass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInitial results?\u201d Clay mocked. \u201cThis is so bogus!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get to pick anything while we were in the shop, as you may recall,\u201d Daniel reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happened in the shop?\" Kyle asked, still stealing glances of Craig. \"When is he going to stop my growth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE\u2019S NOT!!\u201d Clay shouted as loud as he could. His voice bounced off the hills several times before quieting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn't help but grin. \u201cHe\u2019s not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Craig said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's ok. We can make it work,\u201d Kyle said rapidly. Craig stared up at his brother with his usual blank expression. Kyle knew Craig was doubtful, and tried to appear more serious. \u201cWe will,\u201d he reiterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you even know how big you are going to get!?\u201d Clay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraig does,\u201d Daniel affirmed, defeat filling his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, I think,\" Craig agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, oh smart and muscular one, what would you suggest we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His feet really were bigger than the boys. Daniel was 5\u20199\u201d and only came up to the top of his arch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew this!\u201d Clay turned away from everyone and started to march off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle instantly closed his feet together, putting them into a diamond shape. They resounded with a loud BOOM when he locked his feet shut. \u201cI think we would like you to stay, Clay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear from before returned, and now without the idol, Clay felt compelled to stay, despite his frustration. Only Daniel could see over the mound of flesh that was Kyle\u2019s growing body, and he knew that wasn\u2019t going to last for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig waddled to the center of the diamond, still trying to adjust to his new physique. Every muscle responded with raw force, trying to follow his commands. More of his pants ripped away, leaving the little titan looking just like the Incredible Hulk, except with shoes and glasses on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, let me put this in perspective for everyone,\" he said. \"Join me in the center, between Kyle's knees.\u201d As the other brothers complied, he continued. \u201cStand quiet for the next 2 minutes and watch Kyle change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle,\u201d Craig called up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink you can stay still for that long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig nodded, adjusting his glasses slightly. \u201cNow, if my calculations are correct, which they should be, he will grow about 10 inches in that time frame. Watch his body as we wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three brothers stood silently as Kyle\u2019s body grew around them. Kyle felt his knees slide outwards, while he kept his feet locked together. The space between his two lengthening tree trunks widened, making the boys look smaller and smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing them there getting tinier by the second had its usual effect on Kyle. Clay started to groan, but a glare from Kyle stopped it instantly. The best part was that Kyle's semi-hard penis was almost bigger than Clay's whole body, making it harden faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s roughly forty feet tall now,\" Craig explained as the boys continued their observation. \"About an hour from now, we will stand no higher than his ankle. And, as I said a while ago, by noon he will be over a mile tall. We need to ensure he has plenty of room to grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe already knew that,\u201d Clay huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your mind, sure. Numbers make sense. But watching it, seeing it. It makes all the difference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence prevailed as Kyle continued growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig\u2019s pecs involuntarily bounced from an itch under the cleft. He reached around his own muscle and dug his finger between the hard slabs of flesh to scratch it. \u201cStill feels odd when they rub together like that,\u201d he commented to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig held his reply to Daniel, still running the thick underside of his oversized chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you think of the WishGiver?\" Kyle blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe--\" Clay began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--how unhelpful the old man was,\u201d Daniel finished, quickly glaring at Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty creepy in the tent, huh?\u201d Kyle rhetorically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe IS magical, Craig! Just in case you were wondering!\u201d Clay gloated, some of his frustration cooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas he?\u201d Craig asked, folding his two thick arms in front of himself. \u201cHow did you determine this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked on at Clay, worried about what he might say. \u201cHe kept clicking his fingers and poofing around the tent for starters!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeleportation?\u201d Craig asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Clay replied, \u201cA bright light would flash and then he, or we, would be in different places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig pondered the possibilities. Thinking fast, Daniel stepped in. \u201cAnd he said that Kyle was going to need our help. He gave Clay that idol and then vanished.\u201d He looked back at Clay with a stern look. \u201cAnd THAT was it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even remember seeing any idols,\u201d Kyle mused aloud, leaning back on his two enormous hands. \u201cIt was so dark and everything happened so quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, that was your experience and this was ours,\u201d Daniel said, Clay finally giving him a little nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what he meant by saying I needed your help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfathomable, I know,\u201d Clay sarcastically cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t sure, and he wasn\u2019t very forthcoming,\u201d Daniel added cooly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I THOUGHT he gave us the idol,\u201d Clay said, glaring at Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it still will be,\u201d Craig replied. \u201cSpeaking of, I need to better determine what kinds of changes have occurred. My appearance could only be cosmetic for all we know. I suggest the two of you get a little sleep while Kyle and I determine the full extent of my new... abilities, if any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay\u2019s face reddened. Daniel placed a gentle hand on his shoulder. \u201cWill do, Craig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay rolled his eyes. \u201cWhatever, Craig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind assisting with a few more experiments, Kyle?,\" Craig said as he placed a hand against the inside of Kyle's knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s penis bobbed. He hoped no one noticed. \u201cSure thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hopped back up on his feet, as Craig continued. \u201cAnd do you mind picking me up? This will be our first test, I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle reached down and picked Craig up. He was small enough to hold in his palm now, but was surprisingly heavy. \u201cYou feel like a lead weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and Clay watched Kyle stride off around another set of hills. \u201cWe are in trouble now, Daniel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe idol buffed up Craig, Kyle is a giant, and we lost the old man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sighed, \u201cAnd you know what? There is nothing we can do about it.\" He shoved his hands deep into his pockets and froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Clay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds passed before Daniel responded. \"The old man said I already had my answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Clay said, rolling his eyes, \"but you didn't get anything in the tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel pulled out the oversized tickets he received at the tin can booth, seemingly a lifetime ago. The symbols on the cards looked oddly familiar. \"I don't think that was the first time I met the old man, Clay.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlikely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle walked a fair distance away from his other brothers, crossing several large hills before settling on a spot near the base of the small mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered his hand to the ground, and Craig hopped off, then looked up at his towering brother. \u201cFirst thing we can do is a series of physical exercises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. While I doubt your physical conditioning has altered, we should see if there have been any changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shrugged. \u201cAlright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several minutes, Kyle and Craig went through a slew of physical challenges. Push-ups, crunches, lunges-- the results were always the same. Craig never tired. No matter how many reps he did, he never reached a state of fatigue. Kyle, on the other hand, started to wimp out rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, apparently my changes were not just superficial,\u201d Craig noted without a drop of sweat on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-- can see-- that,\u201d Kyle huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig removed his glasses and stared at the blurry ground. Within moments, he flung his thick legs into the air and balanced himself into a handstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraig? How are you doing that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother answered without a hint of strain in his voice. \u201cApparently, I am more dexterous now too.\u201d He lowered his body, touching the crown of his head to the ground, then pushed back up again. Every muscle twisted with a life of its own. Deep crevasses emerged, rippled, and vanished, just to be replaced by new ones with every successive push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you not light-headed or something?\u201d Kyle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Craig continued his effortless pushes up and down, the long twists of his hair mopping the dirt as he did so. \u201cIn fact\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig leaned all of his weight onto his right arm. The muscle popped even more ferociously than they had a moment ago. Kyle was mesmerized at just how stacked Craig\u2019s body had become. The huge 12 year old was now balancing his entire body weight on one hand, slowly extending his left hand out and parallel to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncredible,\u201d Kyle whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more so than you,\u201d Craig replied with ease, his face only a shade redder now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered himself again, maintaining his balance, and pushed back up. \u201cSurprisingly easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s mouth hung open at the little Olympian. \u201cThere is no way I could do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig pushed out another 20 before stopping. Kyle had sat down, spreading his legs to either side of Craig, but never took his eyes off of those rippling muscles. Craig wielded some serious strength now. He sprung back onto his feat and set his glasses back on his thin nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind laying down for a moment?\u201d Craig asked as he shook the dust out of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle thudded to the ground, rocking the landscape around him. The night sky still hung silent in the air. Only a gentle wind and the slowly shifting rocks beneath Kyle\u2019s enormous body made any sounds here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now, Zeus?\u201d Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly,\u201d Craig replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can move you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove? ME? You are like half the size of my foot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little more than half,\u201d Craig corrected as he stood next to Kyle\u2019s foot. He squatted down, gripped the heel and lifted Kyle\u2019s foot into the air with ease. Craig\u2019s muscles rippled in the moonlight, his body silhouetted as an \u201cX\u201d under Kyle\u2019s massive limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you are not helping?\u201d Craig asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor sure! This is pretty incredible! I thought there wasn't any way you'd be able to lift me at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s limbs continued to grow, forcing Craig to take small steps back. \u201cWell, I am not stronger than your growth, that is now for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs your body grows,\" Craig answered, \"it\u2019s forcing me to readjust by walking further and further away from your core.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle laughed. \u201cGot it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig continued to take slow steps back as Kyle\u2019s foot threatened to push past him. His palms hardly covered any area of Kyle\u2019s heel at all, and yet he was able to keep the growing limb steady. Eventually, Craig set Kyle\u2019s foot down and waddled up to his hand, his thick thighs barely clearing each other with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping one of Kyle\u2019s log-like fingers, Craig said, \u201cNow to try and drag you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle blinked. \u201cDrag --ME?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig held Kyle\u2019s forefinger tightly, causing Kyle some surprising discomfort. One hand gripped the top digit while Craig\u2019s other hand gripped around the knuckle. It was like holding an oversized rope for a game of tug-of-war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig took several steps back until Kyle\u2019s arm was straight out from his shoulder. He continued to march back with heavy steps, feeling Kyle\u2019s body resist, but after a few moments, Kyle felt the Earth slide a bit from beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, Craig!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s shoulders shifted several feet before Craig stopped, dropping his finger. \u201cYou are considerably more difficult to move, but I suspect this has more to do with the size difference than your weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is that all?\u201d Kyle snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stretching his arms out for a moment, Craig continued. \u201cAlright, time for you to stand up. And this time, hover your foot over me and start pushing down until I yell \u2018Stop!\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stared down at his newly-muscular brother who didn\u2019t even come up to his calves anymore. \u201cYou WANT me to crush you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pressure test. Go slow and listen for me to yell stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\" Kyle answered warily. \"Your funeral.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig put his thickly-muscled arms back over his head as Kyle lifted his eight-and-a-half foot long foot. The smooth flesh hovering over Craig blocked most of the night sky. Kyle slowly brought the arch back down on his brother, then suddenly stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed harder and harder, but couldn\u2019t budge his brother. One hand sunk into the ball of Kyle\u2019s foot while the other slid firmly into the base of the arc. A few moments later, Craig\u2019s feet cracked the ground beneath him and sunk slightly into the Earth. All of this pressure drilling into one spot strained the ground more than Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sat down, putting Craig between his legs. \u201cAlthough I am not ready to perform an impact test, it seems that I am significantly stronger than my appearance would suggest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was amazed. I thought I was going to crush you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did start digging me into the ground,\" Craig nodded, \"and you certainly started to get \u2018heavy\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it is settled,\" Kyle beamed. \"You are an ant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn ant?\u201d Craig asked before instantly answering his own question. \u201cBecause of the weight displacement proportions. I can move weight that is considerably heavier and larger than myself.\u201d He looked up at Kyle, \u201cIt\u2019s as good a nickname as any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think comic book land and movie world already stole this one from us, but it will be our secret, Ant-Man,\u201d Kyle smiled, his shaft still throbbing like the adolescent he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't go unnoticed by Craig. \u201cAnd it appears that your penis has finally grown larger than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's grin became more sheepish. \u201cYeah. It did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou certainly are insatiable,\u201d Craig remarked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A black square and two black, isosceles triangles stared back at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are these supposed to mean?\u201d Clay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cards were thick, like cardstock, and only bore their one shape. There wasn\u2019t even anything on the backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich way are you even supposed to hold them?\u201d Daniel thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would the two triangles be going the same way? Are they a set?\u201d Clay questioned, twisting both cards back and forth. \u201cSee how they both lay sideways on the card. They both \u2018point\u2019 to one of the longer card edges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike playing cards,\u201d Daniel said as a gentle cool breeze threatened to steal the card bearing the square. \u201cAnd I think all three belong to this set.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay looked up at his brother, something else suddenly coming to mind. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell them about what else happened in the tent?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really want them to know what happened to us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d Clay scoffed. \u201cI guess-- I\u2019m not used to you having my back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked away from his card. His eyes softened. \u201cI do, though... even if I have trouble showing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay smiled, still wondering when the other shoe was going to drop and Daniel would start yelling at him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I am sorry about the idol, Clay,\" Daniel continued. \"I know you were really excited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill bogus!\u201d he exclaimed softly, \u201cBut it\u2019s whatever. We\u2019ve got these and once we figure out what they do, we can go from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d Daniel smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was silent for a few moments when it was suddenly broken again by Clay\u2019s laughter. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was more strange, having a six-foot dick or seeing you walk around on it like a little speck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel felt his stomach turn. \u201cI know, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt really felt good though,\u201d Clay reminisced. \u201cNot the part where my balls were crushing my feet, but as the tent rubbed up against the head...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel coughed. \u201cNot listening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay slapped him gently on the back. \u201cLighten up, dude. It\u2019s not like you get to have a dick that\u2019s bigger than your whole body every day of the week! And then watching you walking around on it-- I didn\u2019t even feel you, you were so tiny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel gulped, fearing that he would once again be shrunk down to the size of a toy. Then Kyle\u2019s enormous body filled his mind followed by the same... envy... that always churned inside of him. How could he love his brother so much and be lying to him like this? He should be happy for Kyle. And why wasn\u2019t he feeling envious of Craig? Both boys got something that he could never hope to earn, no matter how hard he worked. And then being on better terms with Clay-- would he wreck it if he came clean about how he felt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped himself out of it, trying to focus on the task at hand. If he could just put everything back to the way it was, maybe things would be different. He wouldn\u2019t loathe Kyle\u2019s size, he could be a better brother to Clay, and just be done with the craziest night of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay laid out the 3 cards before them in different orders and arrangements before stopping on the final layout. \u201cWhat does this remind you of, Daniel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel finally came back to the real world, seeing what Clay had laid before him. The first card was one of the triangles pointing to the left, the second was the square, and the third card, closest to Clay, was the other triangle pointing to the right. \u201cLike a remote control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d Clay said, \u201cWhat if this is what the guy meant? You have been holding the kill switch this entire time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet that is what the square means. Like a 'stop' button.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the two triangles--\u201d Clay trailed off more nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of them is probably a 'rewind'. Meaning everything goes back to normal!\u201d Daniel could not hide his excitement, nor did he care to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the other would then mean...\u201d Clay gulped. \u201cFast forward?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s smile fell away. \u201cOh shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d Clay chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if these are like Kyle\u2019s cards, all of them will disappear when we use one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich means, if these cards do what we think they do, we know for sure which one will stop his growth,\u201d Clay sighed, \u201cBut we do not know which one will reverse it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay looked back and forth between the cards before looking up to Daniel. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

City lights twinkled far off in the distance on the opposite horizon. No roads lead to where they were and the nearest landmark was a camp site and scenic trail a mile to the north. They were, in a word, isolated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s arms were folded behind his head as he stared into the stars, again wondering what the rest of this day was going to bring. Although it was still night, the stars were dimming. A light haze filled the air. Soon, the sun would be up. A few hours later, Kyle would be over a mile tall. \u201cWhat would it be like to be that big? How small would everyone be compared to him? The size of an ant? Smaller?\u201d Kyle wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also wondered when he would get hungry again, still feeling satisfied from gorging himself on corn and grain before his sprint. The sprint that nearly killed Craig-- but look at him now! Craig sat on Kyle\u2019s upper leg, allowing his own thick beams to dangle off on one side. His feet weren\u2019t even half way back to the ground several feet below. He ran his fingers along several massive chords in his quads. He flexed his leg out, feeling everything instantly harden. Then, he lowered his leg again, feeling everything shift into new positions. Even at rest, all of his new muscles hung heavy and thickly. Each twitch would force them to swell. Even his abs fought for space along his torso as Craig crunched over them and back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be like Craig? You being so strong and me being so big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDifficult to say Kyle. I may stand out, but can blend into society. You,\u201d he breathed, \"have outgrown it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outgrown...?\" he repeated, wondering of the possibilities. \"No more bedtimes. No more bullies. No school!\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't have bedtimes anyway,\" Craig reminded, \"but you certainly have a point about the other two. There are no school buildings that would fit you, and who would stand up to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded. \"What about those spies you warned me about? That farmer took one look at me and tried to shoot me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true you won't stay a secret for much longer. And as you saw, people will likely react to you with violence. That's the way of people... attack your fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... FEAR me?\" Kyle blinked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Kyle. You are bigger and more powerful than anything their lives have ever prepared them for. In time, you will be able to crush them with a single step. Your very growth will level cities without you lifting a finger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle imagined those thoughts for a moment. \"I... can do all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You are already giant and wield awesome power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grinned, \"Like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems,\" he replied. \"And you will continue to be an awesome force to be reckoned with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords like \"force\" and \"power\" had never been used to describe Kyle ever in his life. The thought intoxicated him and aroused him. He wanted this power Craig spoke of, and he wanted his hulking brother to be right there with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...\" Kyle trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I...? Craig asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gulped. \"Fear me. Like them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig patted Kyle's leg, rubbing the flesh under his vascular palm. \"You have done nothing but protect me all evening. When Daniel lost control of the car, you were there. When some random stranger started shooting, you whisked me away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's heart pounded in his chest, swelling with emotions he could not describe. Craig continued, \"So, while I recognize your power, I do not fear you. I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle reached one of his enormous hands around, rubbing (and covering) Craig\u2019s rippling back with a few finger tips. \"I love you, Craig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig twisted and held on to Kyle's forefinger, barely palming the tip with his hand. \"I love you too, Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA comfortable silence drifted between the brothers. Kyle\u2019s body continued stretching and expanding, rubbing gently across Craig's rock solid glutes and legs. The constant shifting of Kyle's body along the ground created a soft, soothing hum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig leaned back, sliding his legs along Kyle's and continued holding his giant brother's hand. He pulled Kyle's hand over him like a blanket as a comforting sleep took him.<br>\r\n[<br>\r\nKyle felt his face flush and his eyes moisten. <i>This is what being family feels like,</i> he thought. And that was the last thought he had as Kyle too finally succumbed to much needed rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's heels drug along the dusty ground with slow persistence, while his head slid further and further up the hill. Asleep or awake, Kyle continued his unrelenting growth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The heels of his feet drug themselves along the ground as they pushed further and further away from his core. His head rose higher along the hundred-foot hill as he slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifty feet gave way to sixty. Sixty to seventy. Over the next hour, Kyle\u2019s body swelled to over a hundred feet long. Craig was no bigger than a silver dollar compared to Kyle\u2019s gigantic form, with Kyle\u2019s leg acting like a soft, growing bed under his rock-solid physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez! He just keeps growing, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Clay whispered to Daniel, spying on Kyle from the top of a nearby hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook long enough to find them,\u201d Daniel whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Daniel and Clay finally approached Kyle\u2019s titanic head, which was now slumping back over the top of his own hill. Both of them were only the size of his ear, and that ear was visibly creeping closer and closer to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready, Clay?\u201d Daniel whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! Let\u2019s get this done!\u201d Clay whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle,\u201d Daniel said into his gigantic brother\u2019s ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response, so Daniel tried a few more times before Kyle finally turned his head. Two enormous, emerald eyes stood open. One was as long as Daniel\u2019s legs, the other covered his head and torso. <i>I\u2019m the same size,</i> Daniel gulp silently, <i>as his eyes!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Daniel was standing so close, he was only a blur to Kyle. \u201cDid I-- fall asleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re-- you\u2019re so tiny now!\" Kyle stared at Daniel with youthful amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel steadied his breathing. <i>Not for much longer,</i> he thought. \u201cSo,\" he spoke aloud, \"you ready to halt your growth, Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, still half-dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently, the old man did give us something else. The answer. You can stay this height forever if you like,\u201d Daniel smiled slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou- you mean it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet, Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled. \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel held out his hand with one of the thick cardstock tickets. \u201cAs carefully as you can, take this card and do what you did the first time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, you're a total blur,\" Kyle responded. \"One second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle sat up, gusting air past Daniel and Clay as he moved. His body kept rising and rising into the air. Daniel and Clay gulped simultaneously seeing how much larger he had become. Kyle saw Craig sleeping on his leg, seeming so much smaller than he was when they went to sleep. Kyle didn't know how long he'd been asleep, but he'd doubled his height in that time. <i>So big,</i> he silently grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle set his hand down next to Daniel and Clay with a dull THOMP that shook the boys were they stood. \u201cShit!\u201d Clay exclaimed, trying to stifle his voice. \u201cHis hand is a big as the car!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel couldn\u2019t help but be in awe of his brother, despite the overwhelming and conflicting emotions he also felt. \"We are the same size as his thumb?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous laugh filled the air, coming from stories above the tiny boys. \u201cYou two are SO SMALL! How am I going to get that card from you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you even see it?\u201d Daniel asked, holding it up as high as his arms would reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle strained his eyes a bit, leaning towards the boys. A small movement for him, but from Clay and Daniel\u2019s point of view, his whole body seemed to double in size again. Clay fought the impulse to run. \u201cAlmost there,\u201d he nervously thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cI see your hand and like, a little shadow or something.\u201d He laughed again, his thick high voice vibrating their bodies. \u201cBut it's WAY too small now for me to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so...\u201d Daniel trailed off. He stepped closer to Kyle\u2019s hand. \u201cCan you squeeze your fingers together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s tree-trunk-sized fingers slid together, kicking up a dust cloud all around them. Daniel and Clay coughed, but the tiny sounds were not heard by Kyle. Daniel wiped the dust out of his eyes and wedged the card between Kyle\u2019s first finger and middle finger. The card held its place. His gigantic brother watched from above, but said nothing when Daniel finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel slowly backed up, his calf rubbing against Kyle\u2019s thick, protruding middle finger as he went. \u201cReady?\u201d Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady,\u201d Daniel gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle gust of wind blew against Daniel and Clay as Kyle swiftly lifted his hand straight up into the air. It was so high up now, the brothers could hardly make it out. \u201cLet\u2019s see if this works!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so!\u201d Clay excitedly whispered to Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle waited a few moments before lowering his hand back down. He set his hand right where it had been before. \u201cDo you see the card, Daniel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel approached his brother\u2019s hand again. \u201cLook\u2019s like it\u2019s gone, Kyle!\u201d He held his breath, hoping that his plan had worked and he had chosen the right card.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead, he put his hands flush against Kyle\u2019s ample skin. Moments later, he shook his head. \u201cUm, you certainly have not stopped growing, Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf anything, you have sped up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt the ground shifting more rapidly under his legs and butt. Within a minute\u2019s time, he grew another 2 feet larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel?! What\u2019s going on?! Didn\u2019t the old man say that would work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d Clay shouted. \u201cWrong one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong \u2018what\u2019!?\u201d Kyle\u2019s voice flared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s stomach fell to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said--\u201d Kyle drove his fingers into the hill side around Daniel and Clay, carving a large chunk out of the landscape and into his palm. Daniel and Clay fell back against Kyle\u2019s palm as they rapidly moved up, into the air and a few feet from Kyle\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do, Clay!?\u201d Daniel cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrection, what did WE do!\u201d Clay shouted back, compelled by anger, confusion and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eyes hung wide open, unblinking. One heavy flick zeroed both of those mighty, emerald orbs squarely on Daniel, the big brother who always looked out for Kyle, and protected Kyle-- until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig\u2026 brother\u2026?\u201d Kyle\u2019s voice was black as pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel said nothing, overwhelmed with fear and guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat card was supposed to reverse your growth! Not speed it up!\u201d Clay continued chattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s eyes widened with a horrifying realization. \u201cREVERSE? You-- LIED to me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel forced himself to stand on the wobbling surface of Kyle\u2019s palm, surrounded by crumbling earth. He had to calm him somehow. \u201cKyle! I didn\u2019t mean--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t MEAN to LIE?\u201d Kyle\u2019s breath picked up speed, radiating heat on the tiny figures in the teen\u2019s palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel\u2019s heart sank into his feet. \u201cI was just trying to look out for you. Look at you! How will you ever--?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Daniel suddenly slid hard to the left as Kyle\u2019s hand turned upside down. The boys clung for anything they could hold onto, screaming the whole way. Suspended over forty feet in the air, they were both now hanging onto Kyle\u2019s growing hand for dear life. Clay dangled from Kyle\u2019s middle finger, just above the knuckle, while David clutched his hands around the base of Kyle\u2019s forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trusted you, Daniel! I would expect this from Clay! He sucks! But YOU--\u201d Kyle\u2019s eyes welled up. His breath was like fire. \u201cHow COULD YOU!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel could barely catch his breath as his feet dangled over the empty air. Kyle\u2019s monstrous legs were below, but he doubted that would be much of a cushion if he fell from this height. Clay\u2019s screams grew more exasperated with each yell, quickly tuckering out into whimpers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stared at the boys, hanging on for dear life and realized the power he held. This was nothing to him. They had betrayed him. And it had backfired. A new feeling surged through Kyle as he watched his brothers scream. In addition to his hurt-- rage appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be so easy to just drop you!\u201d Kyle glared, his voice filled with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle lifted his hand above his own head. Clay\u2019s voice rasped with unrelenting screams. Daniel's fear compelled the opposite from him, robbing him of his voice and forcing streaming tears to gush down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter hold on! I PROMISE I won\u2019t let go Daniel!\u201d Kyle growled up to his brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground so far away. Daniel couldn\u2019t bring himself to look down at his brother\u2019s twisted face. He could only stare up at Kyle\u2019s palm praying this was some horrible nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay wailed with tears, trying to call out \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d But the words would not form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle flung his hand back over the hill where he had scared it and jerked his hand from side to side. The boys instantly fell several feet back into the pit, knocking the wind out of both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle drove his heels into the ground with a mighty THOOM! Gravity rolled Craig back along Kyle\u2019s thigh, tumbling off the side and plummeting ten feet to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt and saw none of this, consumed by his growing anger. Daniel\u2019s betrayal burned deeper than he had ever thought possible. Kyle lunged forward with heavy, ground-shaking steps. The whole area quaked as the 100-foot teen took his temper further and further away from his broken brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel laid helpless in the ten-foot pit a few feet away from Clay, sobbing silent sobs. He fought to catch his breath, repeating one question over and over in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What have I done?</i></span></div></div>",

Nearby deer and other wildlife scattered in any direction they could, instinctively fearing the menace rocking the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could no longer make out most of the finer details below him, despite how much brighter everything was now. Dawn was not far away. He knew the ground was mostly grass and dirt. The green and brown smudges showed him that, but that was all. The little rocks and blades of grass he trampled with each massive step went otherwise unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden surge of anger, Kyle jumped into the air and drove his weight as hard as he could into the ground over and over again. Fissures broke open and quickly snaked out in all direction like breaking glass. New ridged and chasms formed, each several feet high and several feet deep. What was a simple tantrum for Kyle wrought cataclysmic effects for half a mile in all directions. He dropped to his knees, and beating the ground with his fists, cracking half an acre of otherwise barren land into increasingly more rigid and distorted shapes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could not confront Daniel\u2019s betrayal without his blood boiling. The one person that had defended and protected him had been lying all along. He wanted to take away the ONE thing that made him special. At least Craig understood\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Craig?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted himself down as if he would find his brother in some phantom pocket before realizing he must be back where he left Clay and Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAMN IT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had he done to Craig? He had been on his leg before, but what now? Had he crushed him when he stormed off? And his brothers? Kyle never saw them hit bottom in that hole he had dug. The possible ramifications of Kyle\u2019s simplest actions worried and infuriated him even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s frustration mounted inside of him. His body shook with fury as he howled with blinding rage at the empty vista. He slammed his hands into the ground, forcing himself back on his feet and moved with hurried stomps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step pounded deeper and deeper into the earth. Kyle\u2019s body continued to grow, slowly filling the otherwise empty landscape with his thickening form. He was growing an inch taller every two seconds now. From Kyle\u2019s perspectives, the changes felt just as subtle as they did when this all began. But it was becoming easier to visualize the difference with each passing moment. His feet filled more and more of the ground as they thickened and widened. His legs propelled him up higher and higher into the air, putting the distant city into better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe city\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of every grade school and middle school bully flooded his mind. That was HIS city just ahead. He had just shown Daniel and Clay what it was like to mess with him, but what about the rest of them? They shouldn\u2019t escape all the pain they had given him over the years just because they were a few more miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt a sudden prickle in the heel of his foot, bringing him to a stop. He lifted up his foot, snapping several power lines instantly before realizing what the dark smudge on his heel was. Kyle dropped his foot back to the ground, instantly crushing another wooden pole and transformer. The sparking electricity shot out across the empty two lane street, tickling Kyle\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle\u2019s raging anger ebbed for a moment with child-like wonder. His foot was longer than an entire two lane street. The power lines rode just above his ankles and the time-worn asphalt crumbled under his weight. The whole scene reminded him of a large, plastic city mat he had played with as a child. He and would craft little buildings all along it made from LEGOs and then stomp around the mat like Godzilla. And this time\u2026 it was for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched his own feet envelop the road more and more.. His toes broke beyond the other side, stretching back onto the dirt. His feet widened and uprooted more poles from either side of the street. The wooden beams looked as thin as tooth picked to the gigantic twelve-year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest just beyond the road glittered in the morning light as the sun finally broke above the horizon. Even the tallest trees only came up to Kyle\u2019s knees now. The gigantic boy stepped closer to what appeared to him as mere shrubs. Was this the forest he was running around in earlier as he dogged the farmer\u2019s fire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle took another step, crushing his massive foot upon several of the nearby trees unfortunate enough to have been growing so close to him. While the branches offered more resistance than the power lines, they too bent and snapped under his weight. Hundreds of birds instantly fluttered into the air, swarming around Kyle\u2019s thigh before bolting in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few more steps into the forest, excited by how small it all was now. Before today, trees WERE the giants. Now HE was\u2026 and he liked it. The trees surrendered faster and faster with each step, shrinking away from the boy as both his growth and his movement continued to accelerate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rays of the sun continued to increase, and Kyle looked back at the long shadow he cast behind him, stretching back to the mountains. Ahead of him, he could see the smaller buildings of the outskirts of town leading to the taller skyscrapers in the inner city. Most of the smaller ones he had already eclipsed in height. <i>And soon,</i> he thought,  none of them will be able to rise above me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought brought his already semi-hard cock to rigid attention. He resisted the urge to touch it, for now, and continued to make his way forward, his presence already being detected by those in the city...</span></div></div>",

Although a part of him wanted the idea to get big fast, he didn't want to grow TOO fast that it would draw attention, but the eternal option seemed like it would be too slow for his liking. He was willing to wait a year for his growth, and enjoy every day of it. Quietly he slipped the card into his pocket for safe keeping. He was still a little doubtful that it would work, but a kid could dream couldn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour Kyle followed his brothers on rides and carnival games, but his focus kept on going to his watch. The man had said he would grow every hour with this card, but so far he hasn't noticed a thing at all. Was he already bigger? Has it already been an hour yet? Kyle waited breathlessly as it got closer and closer, the minutes ticking down on his watch. He felt his heart beat fast as it finally gotten to the last minute. Kyle told his brothers he needed to use the restroom and slipped away, anxious to get his first growth. He looked down at the watch, his heart beating fast as the seconds ticked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n57...58...59...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exact moment it hit 1 Kyle felt something like butterflies in his stomach and a slight sense of vertigo. Excited, he checked himself, looking himself over trying to see a difference. He didn't find anything different however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the card really bogus after all? Or was it so small he couldn't notice? Kyle remembered then that the man said he would only grow 1% at a time. Of course it was so small he couldn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, maybe I should have picked the first card.\" Kyle muttered. At least then he wouldn't have to wait in anxiety for results. Feeling a bit dejected, he headed back to his brothers. On the way, he passed by a height marker for a ride. Curious, he stood next to it and measured his height. He had had it measured at the last ride, so he knew he was 4'8\" even. When he measured himself now, however, he found himself closer to 4 foot eight and a half inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he really just grow half an inch? Or was he just being hopeful? His heart started beating faster at the thought. If he grew half an inch in just an hour, then in a few hours how much will he grow? A bit excited again, Kyle rejoined his brothers with a slight grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter squeezing in one more ride, Kyle and his brothers headed home. When no one was looking, he marked his height on the wall to measure his progress, then went to bed, already eager to see how much he'll have grown in the morning.</span></div></div>",

Kyle was the first one to wake up, excited to see if the change in height was noticeable after a few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even have to go check height mark he had made on the wall the previous night to know something was different; his pajamas all felt tighter, especially around his crotch, where a full morning wood seemed significantly more pronounced than before. As he did go check the wall, though, he was delighted to see that the mark he had made was now closer to his neck than to the top of his head. He had grown over five inches since going to bed, and was now definitely taller than Craig and Clay. \"I might even start having to borrow Daniel's clothes for a while,\" he thought to himself with a grin. \"At least, while I still fit in them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to change into some looser fitting clothes, he paused to look in the full-length mirror in his bedroom as he peeled off his shirt and pants. The growth spurt didn't seem to have any affect on his muscles, at least for now. The bulge in his underwear definitely seemed more pronounced, though Kyle couldn't quite tell if that was just an effect of his overall growth or something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Kyle turned around and smiled as he saw Craig putting on his glasses, gawking at him. HIs exclamation woke up Clay as well, and the two boys jumped out of bed and walked over to him, both staring up at their suddenly-taller brother. \"What happened to you, Kyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle beamed in return. \"Oh, this is just the beginning, believe me. You better prepare yourself for some big changes around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither brother knew what to make of that, and simply shook their heads and went off down the stairs to the kitchen. Kyle folded his arms across his still-bare chest, still amazed by what he saw-- just as he felt the sense of vertigo again, and his clothes became ever-so-tighter. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This story was Written by Rowan. I take no credit for the origins, or subsequent chapters.<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, I can pinpoint the exact day when Davey started changing. At the time, no one\u2013 not Mom, not Dad, especially not me\u2013 had any idea what was going on. No one, that is, except Davey himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that he was just a normal 8 year old kid. A little small for his age, but still normal. My baby brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn\u2019t look anything alike. I had blond hair that looked gold because of all the time I spent outside for baseball. His hair was jet black. My eyes green, his blue. My build was athletic and his was very slight. He was active and healthy, but he always gave off the impression of delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was adopted, but I loved him as if he were blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got along better than most brothers, I think. Maybe because there was nearly a decade separating us, so we never fought over toys or anything like that. Plus we had separate bedrooms, which is always a bonus. The year he changed, I was 17 and a senior in highschool. I was five foot eight and grateful for the height\u2013 my dad was five foot six and I figured that I\u2019d gotten off lucky. Davey was four foot one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember I was just finishing up my homework when my mom asked me to get him for dinner. I hopped up and went into the backyard, knowing that he\u2019d probably be shooting baskets. He had dreams of playing professional ball. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him that it would probably never happen. And besides, he didn\u2019t share any of my genetics, so there was still a chance that he\u2019d get tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the sliding glass door and saw him standing in the middle of the yard, his head tilted back and his eyes closed. \"Hey pipsqueak! Time for dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he didn\u2019t move, I walked out to him. He looked really strange, like he was meditating or something. I put a hand on his shoulder and gave him a little shake. \"Davey, didn\u2019t you hear me? It\u2019s time to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyelids drifted open and he swivelled his head to look at me. \"So soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face had an uncharacteristically serene expression on it, and it disconcerted me. If I\u2019d known what it had really meant, though, it would have done a hell of a lot more than disconcert me. \"6:30, same time we eat dinner every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd little smile played on his lips. \"That means I\u2019ve been here for over an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hand tightened on his shoulder. I was getting worried now. \"You\u2019ve been standing in this spot for an &lt;i&gt; hour? &lt;/i&gt;\" I pressed my palm to his forehead. He felt warm, but not feverish. \"Are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled and my baby brother suddenly returned. \"Yeah. I was just goofin\u2019 off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave me a hug to prove it. Davey had always been an affectionate kid, and I couldn\u2019t help returning his embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" I said, grabbing his hand and pulling him toward the house. \"Let\u2019s wash up for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe skipped beside me. \"Justin, guess what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty soon you won\u2019t be able to call me pipsqueak anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned down at him. \"And why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause I\u2019m gonna grow big and strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let go of his hand and wrapped my arm around his neck, pulling him against my body. \"Yeah?\" I said, running my knuckles over his scalp. \"Well, you still look like an ankle-biter to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled and struggled against me, but I held him tight. \"You won\u2019t be able to do this anymore either,\" he said, his voice muffled just under my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed and released him so we could wash our hands. One thing about Davey\u2013 he always dreamed big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner we all watched in amazement as he cleaned his plate, then asked for seconds and thirds. Normally it was a trial just to get him to finish half, and now he was eating more than the three of us put together. And as I looked at him, I thought he seemed different in other ways as well. I just couldn\u2019t put my finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness, someone must be getting ready for a growth spurt,\" said my mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, we had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning I walked Davey to his bus stop like I did every weekday morning. The highschool was right down the street from the stop, so it really wasn\u2019t any trouble. He was probably too old for me to be holding his hand, but once I\u2019d had to push some other little kids off of him and now I was protective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited until the bus came before letting go. He gave me a hug and then started to climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" I yelled, holding up my hand. \"Aren\u2019t you forgetting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and hopped down. \"Sorry big brother.\" He jumped and slapped my hand before running back onto the bus, sitting next to a boy named Chris, his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI adjusted my backpack and went off to my own school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaseball practice was year round for us. The team always made it to nationals, and since I made varsity freshman year, we\u2019ve won it all every year. We had a great bunch of guys, and I was the only person in our school\u2019s history to never strike out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach called me a \u2018finesse\u2019 hitter, because I could put that ball exactly where I wanted, every time. He said he\u2019d never seen anything like it. The only thing I couldn\u2019t do was hit it out of the park, though not for lack of trying. I just didn\u2019t have enough power in my swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe worked like dogs every single day, both in school sponsored practice and out. A lot of the guys were still trying to catch the attention of this scout or that recruiter, but I already had a stack of offers dating back to my sophomore year, so I wasn\u2019t too worried about college. I just wanted to play. And win, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked back to the locker rooms I caught sight of myself in the mirror and grinned. I wasn\u2019t as big as most of the other guys on the team, but I always liked what I saw. Handling the bat had given me sturdy, broad shoulders and a fit body. And everything on me was in perfect proportion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soaped myself up in the shower, scrubbing hard to get the dirt and grime off of me. Was it possible to have permanent grass stains on your skin? One of these days I\u2019ll probably find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I take no credit for the origins, or subsequent chapters.<br>\r\n -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting when I finally made it home, tired and aching and feeling great. As soon as I opened the door, Davey collided with me. I stumbled back a bit and then was able to hold my ground as an 8 year old boy hung off my torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a second to realize what he was trying to do, and I tossed my backpack to the side before grabbing him and pinning him against floor. \"Trying to wrestle me down, pipsqueak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to jerk himself up and almost succeeded in breaking my grip, which surprised the hell out of me. But I put a little more effort into holding him there and he finally gave up. \"I\u2019m stronger than last time though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally, I just thought I was tired from practice, but I humored him. \"You sure are.\" I got up and retrieved my backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty soon you won\u2019t be able to pin me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled. So we were still on that. \"Sure thing, Davey. Whatever you say.\" I ruffled his hair as I walked past him. \"Where are Mom and Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upstairs getting ready for the movies, I think.\" Davey started hopping in circles around me. &lt;i&gt; Man, &lt;/i&gt; it seemed like the kid got more energetic every day. \"How was practice? Did you hit one out of the park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Getting closer though. I guess that weight set Dad got me is starting to pay off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re really strong, Justin. I tried to lift your dumbbells today and couldn\u2019t budge them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head snapped down and I grabbed his chin. \"You know you\u2019re not supposed to play with those things when I\u2019m not around, pipsqueak. You could get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked instantly contrite. \"I know I\u2019m not supposed to touch your stuff. I just thought since I was getting stronger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI collapsed onto the couch. \"I don\u2019t care if you touch my things, as long as you don\u2019t change the settings on my stereo. All I care about is your safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavey mimicked me and collapsed right beside me. \"Okay, I\u2019ll wait for you for now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good deal.\" I propped my feet up on the coffee table, trying not to smile when he followed suit. \"So was dinner good today?\" I almost never made it to dinner on school days. My parents had offered to push back the time, but I didn\u2019t want anyone going hungry because of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nestled his head against the crook of my shoulder. \"It was alright, I guess. Spaghetti.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced down at him. \"Just alright? I thought spaghetti was your favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"Yeah but... there wasn\u2019t enough meat. I\u2019m still kinda hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy gaze drifted to his feet as I remembered how he\u2019d gobbled up his food yesterday. I noted absently that the cuffs of his jeans were riding above his ankles now. Pretty soon he\u2019d need a new wardrobe. \"Well, while my plate is warming, I\u2019ll make you a roast beef sandwich. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" He leapt from the couch. \"Let\u2019s go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned and got up markedly slower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ate at the kitchen counter, and I watched as Davey tore through two sandwiches. Again I got the impression that something had changed about him. His face, maybe? His baby fat seemed to be dropping away. And the energy around him was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh hell, it was probably nothing to worry about, right? He was just growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents popped into the kitchen, all dressed up for their date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo weird that they still dated. And on a Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sport,\" said my dad, straightening his tie. \"How was practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put our plates into the sink. \"About the same as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to win the pennant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t we always?\" I was too cocky for my own good, but right now I could afford to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and clapped his hand on my shoulder. \"Good good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom kissed us on the cheek. \"Don\u2019t wait up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they left I turned to Davey and made a little gagging motion with my finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he thought it was funny. He was eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got himself a step stool and dried the dishes I washed. \"Pretty soon I won\u2019t need to step on anything to reach the sink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Exactly how big do you plan on getting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDishtowel still gripped in his little fingers, he flung his hands into the air. \"Bigger than this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed and handed him the last cup. \"That\u2019ll be something to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days pretty much passed the same way. Although I did find myself watching Davey more closely than usual. At first I thought it was my imagination, but he really was changing, and fast. By the end of the week his pant cuffs had crept up another half inch. His shirts hung differently, and faint cords were appearing on his forearms. He moved with more confidence now, as if the very act of walking had become easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd every day after practice, he\u2019d tackle me as soon as I walked through the door. I began to realize that my own fatigue had nothing to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe &lt;i&gt; was &lt;/i&gt; getting stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to talk to my parents about it. They just waved it off and said he was finally hitting a decent growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered if they &lt;i&gt; had &lt;/i&gt; believed me. There was no changing the path Davey was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther things were changing, too. Little things. He still struggled with his homework, but that entire week he never once needed my help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was growing in mind and body, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if soon he\u2019d be growing away from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpring break was starting and I was required to go to a baseball retreat. Even so, I seriously considered throwing my future away by blowing it off and staying with Davey. I didn\u2019t feel right about leaving him, not when things were going so screwy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to go?\" he asked, sitting cross-legged on my bed as I packed my suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dropped a pair of shorts into my bag. \"Every year since junior high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you have to go &lt;i&gt; this &lt;/i&gt; year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davey...\" I zipped up my case and sat next to him. \"Tell me the truth now. Are you in trouble? Do you need me to stay? Because if so, just say the word and I\u2019m here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hugged his knees to his chest. I noticed that his legs filled his slacks more than they had yesterday. \"No. It\u2019s just that you\u2019ll be going away to college in a few months.\" His head dropped down. \"Now you\u2019re gonna be gone for a whole week... you might not even know who I am when you come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dragged him against my body, trying not to think that he even felt different. A little thicker. A little harder. \"Listen, pipsqueak. First, just because I\u2019m moving away doesn\u2019t mean we still can\u2019t be close. You and me will always be tight. Second, I\u2019ll always, &lt;i&gt; always &lt;i&gt; recognize you, so stop worrying about that. And third, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you, but I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready to tell me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms squeezed me, reminding me again that he was getting stronger everyday. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood and picked up my bag. \"I\u2019ll see you in a week.\" I glanced at him again, and on impulse I kissed his forehead. \"Try not to change too much while I\u2019m gone. I don\u2019t want to miss anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe broke into a huge grin. \"Sure thing, big brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought once more about staying, then took off to catch my teammates</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was distracted the whole way to the campgrounds, worrying about Davey. But once we arrived, Coach kept us so busy that we couldn\u2019t think about anything but baseball. Drills, laps, weight training, and watching tapes of our teams and those of our rivals\u2013 we barely had enough time to breathe. It sounds bad, but I was actually grateful for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly at night, when I was lying face up in my bunk, did the anxiety get the best of me. I\u2019d want to call home and check up on everyone, but it was always too late. So all I could do was lay there, trying to picture what Davey must look like now, before exhaustion took me over and I\u2019d get a few hours of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the worst spring break of my life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it seemed to drag on forever. Coach even commented that I\u2019d lost a little of my hustle, but I was still far and away the fastest guy on the team, so he didn\u2019t press the issue much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally Saturday morning arrived and we all piled into the bus to head home. Three agonizing hours. I wanted to jump to my feet and order the driver to step on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing that we were the top ranked high school ball team in the country, the school\u2019s budget allowed for curbside service. This was good because we didn\u2019t have to drag our stuff home or bother our parents for a ride. It was bad because mine was the last stop on the route. I was ready to put my fist through a window by the time we rolled up to my house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t even say goodbye to Coach as I snatched up all my stuff and sprinted to my front door. I was lugging a pile of crap, and so I kicked the door several times to let everyone inside know that I\u2019d returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt swung open and both my parents were hugging and kissing me, although I noticed wryly that neither of them moved to help me with my stuff. That\u2019s the problem with being the strongest one in the family\u2013 everybody thinks you can handle everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, honey!\" said my mother, kissing me on the cheek. Gee, if I\u2019d had a free hand I could have wiped the lipstick off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad clapped me on a small free space on my back, almost knocking me over. \"How was the retreat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did it take to get a little help around here? \"Exhausting. Where\u2019s the pipsqueak? Usually he\u2019s the first one here to welcome me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad glanced at each other and my heart dropped into my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? What\u2019s wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom fisted a hand against her breasts. \"Davey... he\u2019s...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God.\" I dropped my suitcase and all of my equipment onto the floor, barely registering the resulting crash. \"What happened? Is he in the hospital?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father covered my shoulders with his hands. \"He\u2019s here, but... it\u2019s hard to explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething vital inside of me snapped, and I grabbed my dad by the shirt and slammed him against the wall. Now, I\u2019d never laid a hand on anyone in my family in anger before, but right now I was mad as hell and scared out of my mind. That\u2019s no excuse, I know, but it\u2019s the only explanation I have for doing it. \"What do you mean, &lt;i&gt; it\u2019s hard to explain?&lt;/i&gt; How hard is it to pick up a phone? If something bad happened, you should have &lt;i&gt; fucking called me! &lt;/i&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on his face was so stunned that I knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to answer me now. I snatched my hands away and ran to the foot of the stairs. \"Davey!\" I yelled. \"Davey, where are you, pipsqueak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn excited voice answered me. Davey\u2019s for sure, but different somehow. \"Justin!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
