Now before you all get off  and start writing...what sort of virus has infected the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpanditis: A disease that causes the infected to rapidly gain weight and have an increase in appetite. Transmitted through saliva and bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSize Disorder A disease that alters the infected's size in some way. Size Disorder S causes the infected to shrink and Size Disorder G causes growth. Caution: those with G have more heightened emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGender Bender Virus: A disease that changes the gender of those who contract it. Gender Bender Virus B changes women into men, men are unaffected. Gender Bender Virus G changes men into women, women are unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgeitis: A disease that directly effects the aging process. Those with the R strain slowly grow younger until they either hit childhood or baby age. P strain makes them grow older until they eventually die of old age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe sure you choose wisely because once you pick a virus, there is no adding any of the others.</span></div></div>",

Something about this new virus fascinated her, and she wanted to learn as much as she could about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she located one of the rooms and entered. Inside was a young woman, around 21 years of age. According to her medical report, she had previously weighed around 150 pounds. But after being infected by... whatever this disease was, she now weight little over 200. She had an obvious pot belly and thick thighs. She was munching on a hamburger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss?\" Elizabeth said. This got the woman's attention, and she turned to look at the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What do you want? I've already been tested.\" The woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Elizabeth replied. \"I just wanted to ask some questions. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shrugged, and Elizabeth sat in the seat next to the womans bed. She took out a notebook and a piece of paper.<br>\r\n\"So, what is your name, for the record?\" Elizabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny Matthews.\" Jenny replied, still eating the hamburger. Elizabeth wrote that down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, miss Matthews. Tell me, when did you start noticing something was wrong?\" Elizabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hours ago.\" Jenny replied. \"I was just finishing up a jog when I saw my neighbor Lauren. We're about the same age, go to the same campus, so we're on good terms. Weird thing is, she looked fatter. A bit bigger then me now. I asked her what happened, and she turned right around and bit me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Elizabeth asked, jotting that down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, right on the arm! It was nuts!\" Jenny replied. \"I went home and bandaged it up, but that's when things got weird. I suddenly felt starving. I wolfed down everything in my house. No joke. And I was STILL hungry. Then I started getting bigger and... well, here I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Elizabeth said, writing that down. \"So bites can transmit this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was writing this down...</span></div></div>",

So, after punching out for the night, Elizabeth made a bee-line right for the nearest restaurant, an all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet she sometimes frequented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the buffet, and after paying, went to the food bar, grabbed a plate, and filled it up with whatever she thought looked good, mostly chicken and pork dishes. Returning to her seat, she began to dig into her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her hunger, she didn't just tear into her food. She tried to eat as quietly as possible. Even so, the meal tasted incredibly good. The place always had good food, but tonight it was just spectacular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, she heard someone walk up to her. Looking, she saw one of the waitresses, a very pretty Chinese-American girl who looked only a little older then Jenny. She seemed worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, you work at the hospital, correct?\" The waitress asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.\" Elizabeth replied, swallowing a piece of pork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is not too much trouble, could I come in tomorrow? I got into a fight with my friend earlier, and she bit me. I cleaned the wound, but it feels so odd. And I've been feeling so hungry.\" The waitress explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth stopped eating, and looked at the waitress. \"Miss, what is your name?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe. Chloe Wong.\" Chloe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, something has been going around lately, and it seems to be transmitted via bite. I would suggest checking yourself in as soon as you can.\" Elizabeth explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded, and returned to her work.

Surprisingly, it was still packed with food. Elizabeth guessed the owners never bothered to clean it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was practically saliviating at the sight of the food, and before Elizabeth could stop her, she bolted to the food bar and started eating whatever she could. Elizabeth wanted to stop her, but was halted by her own stomach growling loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just ate, and I'm still hungry?\" Elizabeth asked. \"Well, Jenny said about the same thing, so I guess it's a symptom.\" She then went to the food bar herself, and started to eat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between bites, Elizabeth tried to get some info from Chloe about what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you got bit by your friend?\" Elizabeth asked, while eating a chicken wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded as she stuffed her face with spaghetti. \"She got mad at me for borrowing a book, and accidentally dropping it in a sink.\" She explained. \"We yelled for a bit, then all of a sudden she grabbed my arm and took a bite out of it. It hurt like crazy. I bandaged it, then came to work. God, why am I so hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a symptom.\" Elizabeth said as she swallowed a slice of pizza. \"Of what, I don't know yet. But I guess it's serious enough that the CDC is getting involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further conversation ended, because the two just kept stuffing their faces.

But, and this is my hypothesis, the virus we've been infected with makes the human body consider all foods as fats. It even increases digestion so the fat can be added on quicker.

She could also feel her thighs straining her pants legs and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was distracted enough by her increased weight that she didn't notice Jenny wake up.

Over the month, the three cleaned out various places.

Also, her body grew proportionatly to her height, so instead of looking thin and gangly, she was still the toned woman she had always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, dad? Why am I so tall now?\" Helen asked, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValac debated with himself mentally. On one hand, he could lie to his own daughter and claim it was a growth spurt, and risk her getting incredibly angry later. On the other hand, he could tell her the truth, and just hope she understood why he did this, and hopefully avoid a screaming fit. He could also tell the truth that she was infected with a virus, but leave out the part of him doing the infecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he decided to...</span></div></div>",

The virus causes men to turn into women and women are immune tho The only thing it seems to affect is there sexuality if they are not straight. Once the virus is in a person it starts of small at first by making the men\u2019s hips and butt slightly bigger and softer skin. But at a month of going basically undetected the virus strikes with a fast sucking in of the men\u2019s penis and testicles and a work vagina quickly forming and they changed it and stop there as seconds after that happened the males entire reproductive system gets changed completely into a female. At this point the man can get pregnant and get periods. He\u2019s sexuality Will also change to that of a straight girl once the reproductive system is complete. This is most probably done to cripple the hope of the men and make them Accept being a girl. However Scientist have realized that the virus Will not proceed any further unless you\u2019re willing to be changed. If resisted the virus is dead in a week but unfortunately right now The man would be stuck with is slightly feminine hips and but and a fully functional vagina. If The change is allowed then the male will receive a very fast growth in breast and butt and hips. The virus didn\u2019t seem to go take it to a small level as The smallest breasts A person has received is DD and they always have big hips and butt. And after those changes over a period of a month The male would be entirely female. And the virus will die within a month. This virus can be spread through intimacy of any kind, blood, and French kissing (regular kissing is OK) . There has been some cases of men being immune to it and The scientist are trying to replicate their immunity but that\u2019s only 2% of the men that are left. Statistics predict that at least 95% of The entire world will be female by the time of a vaccine. Many countries have rules for polygyny to be legal . More news as it comes - News report.

His one previous visit suggesting what she'd chosen would blend in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/e4/ac/17e4ac7b2a7de10bd875f75245d6822a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/e4/ac/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided against burying the grey sweatsuit, not wanting to end up with dirty fingers that might reveal her. Arrival unnoticed, she headed for the main house making use of the statues and hedges to disguise the fact she'd sneaked in. The two bouncers outside spotted her only when she was a few yards from the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison put a sway into her step, and straightened her back. \"Sorry, boys, I just needed to stretch my legs, and get a breath of fresh air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strode purposefully towards the house as if everything were normal. Her act convincing, the large capacity of the mansion and the recent changing in the guards meant they didn't question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir patrol of the back garden was to stop perverts sneaking in and spying through the windows... or just skeevy clients trying to avoid paying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither guard raised any serious objections. She slid between them, a hand straying wide, to brush over each stiffening cock in their uniform trousers. It was a much needed skill for them to work despite being horny. But they weren't made of stone. Each accepted a demure kiss as she rose to tip-toe. Steadying herself with a hand against their muscular chests, a purr of approval, as she stroked those hairy chests appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they'd be missing those chests... those chaste kisses should give her enough time to spread her glory to a few more men, to allow them to discover the blessing she'd received.</span></div></div>",

She walked over to her closet, her eyes gazed over her vast amounts of clothing.Okay admittedly that wasn't true, but she had a nice selection of clothes. She shuffled into pants and a nice T-shirt with a small bunny on it. She looked into her mirror and posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and slim and not spherical.\" She announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of her room.

Sandra wasn't sure if they took her seriously or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Stephanie is in the center now. Please come down as soon as possible.\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, thank you.\" Sandra replied, before saying goodbye and hanging up. She frowned. The voice was rather quick to get her in.<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\nOnly an hour later, Sandra was sitting in the waiting room of the health center. She had to sit on the bench, since her butt didn't fit in the chairs anymore. She was patiently waiting to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandra Caine.\" The receptionist said. Sandra stood up, making her butt wobble, and she made her way to the desk. After confirming her information and reason for being there, Sandra was led to one of the rooms. She sat on the bed, and waited again. It was only a minute before Dr. Stephanie White entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. White was a pretty woman in her early 30's, with straight blonde hair and green eyes. As she entered the room, Sandra saw that...</span></div></div>",

So far, the disease doesn't seem to be life threatening in the least. However, you should be prepared to wear stretchier pants as well as using your backside as a portable chair.

How on Earth was she going to adapt to this new disease? Right now, she felt like she had two basketballs shoved into the back of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandra walked back to her apartment, she passed by a clothing store. Sighing, she decided that, if she had to adapt to this, she might as well get some stretchy pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the store, she saw that aparently, she wasn't the first person to have this idea. She saw a few women walking around the store, some with bloated behinds just like her. She walked over to the pants section of the store, and noticed that a lot of the stretchier pants were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just my luck.\" Sandra muttered, as she grabbed what she could and going over to the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. You've got it too?\" The cashier asked. Sandra took a look at her. She was a woman in her mid-20's wearing goth style clothing. Her name tag read \"Mia\". Looking past her, Sandra noticed that the Mia's shiny black pants were really tight on her bloated rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately.\" Sandra replied. She set the pants down on the counter, and Mia started cashing her out. \"Do you know anything about this disease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Mia answered. \"I woke up like this. And you know, I don't really mind it. Yeah, it's a disease, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't look good with a fat ass. Actually, I kind of want it bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...right.\" Sandra said, as Mia bagged her new pants. Sandra took the bag and paid for the pants, and turned to leave.

Looking around, she counted 14 women in this small group, Mia included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened again and another woman entered. Or tried too. She was a beautiful Asian-American woman in her mid-30's. Sandra noticed that of everyone here, this new woman had the biggest rear she'd seen so far. It looked like it could fill an entire armchair, and her hips were wedged in the doorframe. A few women helped her squeeze her way into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow free of the door, the woman sat in a very wide chair, and noticed Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like we have a new potential member.

But it helped Sandra to know that she wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it was time for everyone to go. As the women left, Gina walked up to Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice to meet you Sandra.\" Gina said. \"We meet 3 days a week.

Unlike everyone else at the reunion, she wasn't wearing some form of dress or suit, instead opting for a black torn tank top with a coffin on it, shiny black shorts, and black heeled boots.
