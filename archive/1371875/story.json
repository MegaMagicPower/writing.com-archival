You politely turned them down saying that you didn't think it would be ok with your family. It is a windy day and other then that it is normal in all ways. You live on Florida near the beach and although it sounds good your life has been turmoil the past week. Last monday you had gotten your report card which didn't include a grade better then a B-. On Tuesday you had sprained you ankle trying out for football, it had healed last thursday but it hurt when you put more pressure on it then you needed to. Yesterday on Thursday you got detention on Saturday for harassing other students. Now you would have to live through Friday before the weekend. Today you were caught by a teacher looking up pictures on the internet and got Sunday detention. Now your weekend was ruined and you were furious. Once you got home you stormed up to your room and banged your door in frustration. The top latch quickly gave in and the door came down and slammed you in the head. Suddenly everything blacked out, when you began to regain sight you were in your bed. You turned around and jumped out of bed. You checked your clothes, they were the exact same ones you woke up in. You opened your window and the wind was blowing like it was this morning. You turn around and see that the door is still intact. You quickly say to yourself deja-vu while looking around your room. You notice one thing different. On your nightstand is the TV remote, on closer inspection you notice that it wasn't the remote. It had 2 big buttons and several smaller buttons and switches. You pick the one on the left and press it while it was still pointing at your nightstand. A short burst of light took out your eyes for a moment but the nightstand was shrunken to the size of 2 inches. You decide to try the button on the right and it came with another blinding flash but the nightstand was reduced maybe gained a little bit. Your mind quickly comprehended that this was a Shrink/Grow remote. You were thinking of all the possibilitys when you noticed it was 6:45. You had to decide what to do and now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had a 'size changer' as you decided to call it. Why bother going to school? You could have plenty of fun with this. The one thing that got you however is 'what would happen if someone else got the remote.' that would be an issue, for now though you had it close to you so that was good, you'd cross that bridge when you came to it. Although you figured a few good places to hide it when/if you needed to. For now however you enlarge your nightstand back to normal as a test. \"Seems to work.\" You nod as you look it over. \"No place for batteries, and no place for anything else, just point and click huh?\" You smile. The way you see it you can do two things. One make yourself bigger, two make someone else bigger. Shrinking yourself made no sense at all. Why lose power and make yourself helpless to no end when you can HAVE power and make others do things for you! You thought of yourself but then you also thought of your girlfriend Alice, Or perhaps Sally? She might be happy, then again...would the power go to her head? You sit on your bed for a moment and think about your choices.</span></div></div>",

You saw Katie a cheerleader who mocked you usually and Brad the captain of the Football team.

Maybe she would be a better idea, she did say to call or visit anytime after all. Another though was Alice, she was your girlfriend...right?
