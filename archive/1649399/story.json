I mean Sir Topham Fatt- Er, I mean Hatt came up to the engines to tell them their duties for the day. \"Percy, You must deliver the special goods train up the mountain and through the town, Toby, you must go to the toast factory and pick me up some of the best sourdough they got and then bring me back some McDonalds, I'd like 7 of everything, Gordon, well, it's like everyday so I'll not bother to tell you all the time....\" Thomas was bored of the Fat Controller's speech and was about to fall asleep. \"And Thomas, meet me at Brendam docks in 1 hour.\" \"Why?\" Asked Thomas. \"That's confidential, I'll have to tell you when we get there, Anyways, I gotta pick up breakfast, see you all then!\" Sir Topham Hatt got into his car and drove off, The engines went over for fueling up and going to their jobs, Thomas Picked up Annie and Clarabel and took off, he wondered what in God's name the fat man himself (Not Santa) had in store for him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter like what seemed like a year to Thomas, He arrived at Brendam at the passenger platform, the \"King of the railroad\" was standing there with a sombrero on his head. Thomas couldn't stop snickering. \"What's the hat for Sir?\" He asked, trying to hold back his laughing. \"It's easy, Both of us are gonna go on a trip somewhere.\" Thomas was amazed, \"Where?\" \"Why, to the North Pole of course! This is the Polar Express!\" The Fat Controller said raising his arms. The blue engine looked at him in confusion. \"Er, It's a new internet fad.\" The fathead said. \"Anyways, I need you to go to Ireland to go to a special port to be loaded onto a ship to the U.S. 'cause the mayor of Hollywood wants to have you over for a Day out with you event, I'm off to the land of tacos, steak and pizza...\" \"Where?\" Asked Thomas. \"New York!\" Smiled S.T.H. even though New York was more about crime and overinflated egos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas had to leave Annie and Clarabel for the time being, He asked Duck if he could babysit his coaches while he was away, Duck agreed as Thomas got some cars to assemble for his journey ahead....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen when he gets there?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thomas had acquired a water tanker, some trucks full of coal, some goods vans, a flatcar for large spare parts and some small coaches for a repair crew to sleep in, He took off the next morning to begin his journey, Thomas was passing by some old sights along the way he remembers, the windmill, the watermill, that one bridge with that kid that waves to him, Farquar Station, He was going by some countryside and would soon head for the bridge that lead straight to Ireland. After an hour or so, He made it to a town called \"Downpatrick\" \"Hmmm...\" Said Thomas, \"Weird name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[ROBOT VOICE]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegin insanity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[NORMAL]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Thomas pulled into a station that had some fuel, He saw some rather big, shiny, electric passenger engines, They were amazed at his cameo to their station. \"Hello there\" Said one of them. \"Hi! I'm Thomas, I come from...\" He was interrupted by a rather famous American singer, \"Yo Thomas, I'm happy for you, Im'ma let you finish but the Chuggington Chuggers are the best engines of all...\" \"BOOOOOO!\" \"Get off the platform!\" \"You suck!\" Said multiple passengers as policemen escorted him out of the station. Thomas had his jaw open like it was disconnected from his face. \"Eeeerrr.... Ignore him.\" Said the express engine, \"He's real angry on how he didn't get the teen engine drivers award this year.\" Thomas had no idea of what to say, After the signal went green, he took off very shocked. After a while, he was driving past towns to get to the other side of Ireland without any other lame interruptions, He went to a town called Cavan so the crew could eat lunch, Thomas just stood there so that his crew could indulge themselves on alcohol and mashed potatoes. Suddenly, there was music... \"Oho!\".... \"Oho!\".... \"Oho!\" (La la la la la, la la la la la!) \"Oho!\" (La la la la la, la la la la la!) The tank engine looked at the Scottish an Irishmen go nuts while singing a song. \"What the bl**dy H311 is going on here!?!\" with a shocked face.... \"French erotic film, An old blue Scot called Dill, A windy shaky driver, Doesn't look like they'll revive her....\" A blue car drove along the road and hit a Princess Diana lookalike, She was taken to the Hospital with only her head and placed on a bed, but the doctors didn't have magic powers to revive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A French erotic film,<br>\r\nAn old blue Scot called Dill,<br>\r\nA windy shaky driver,<br>\r\nDoesn't look like they'll revive her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oho!\" Shouted the lead Scotsman, Thomas was freaked out and tried to call for his crew who were 9155-@$$ drunk to do anything helpful. So he would have to suffer, They picked Thomas up and threw him in a giant soupbowl. \"Oh my God! Hot!!! Hot!!!\" Thomas screamed as he would possibly risk having his boiler explode, but the soupbowl tipped over and poured our hero out, he bounced off giant Barbie doll packages. \"Ow! Oof! Ow!\" He cried, He landed on two dudes and saw a billboard with the cast of Friends wearing Justice League costumes. \"This is getting much more strange by the minute.\" Said a scared Thomas. After at least 6 minutes they stopped and he fell back on the rails, looking rather bruised. \"This is so humiliating!\" He said feeling like crud. His drunken crew got on board and started him up. \"Nesh shtop, Weenieville!\" Said his drunk driver, Thomas left the station very annoyed with how his crew didn't do anything to help him as he chuffed off to Westport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this trip I'm going on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next for him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thomas was almost at the port, after having to go past a leprechaun convention, Meeting fanboys, almost falling in love with some hot dragoness and nearly getting abducted by aliens he was on a fine stretch of track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank bl**dy God it's all over.\" Thomas said, but there was worse to come..... Much worse. He arrived at the port where many oversize freight ships and other crap was afloat, he was lead by some worker over to his craft, he was expecting something big and safe, but when he got to his boat, he saw it was an old yellow steamboat, it had enough room for him but saw it's crew didn't look like they could drive it. \"Oh God no\" Thought our blue hero as he uncoupled from his train and then was lifted by crane onto the rails on the boat, some of the supplies were added onto the boat along with some extra railcar Thomas didn't see, the boat was detached from the poles the ropes were tied to and took off, some musical number began as they got into the open area of the port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Syntisizer tune)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ch'all right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhh 'Ish!\" The tune was about riding a boat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm onna boat!\" (I'm onna boat!) \"I'm onna boat!\" (I'm onna boat!) \"Everybody look at me 'cause I'm sailing on a boat!\" (Sailing on a boat) \"I'm onna boat!\" (I'm onna boat!) \"I'm onna boat!\" \"Take a good hard look at the mother ****ing boat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas was annoyed by this Drunken T-Pain sailor song and looked ahead, Nothing except T-Pain and the crew dancing around and the sea, He looked ahead and was surprised to see the cast of Tugs floating nearby, the tune changed to the Tugs theme as Thomas was floated closer to the tugs. \"Bust my buffers! I didn't know you boats were real!\" \"We are real!\" said Ten cents, \"We were just going\" He was cut off when the Red Baron flew in his plane and shot down the tugs, thus having them sink to the bottom of the literal Davy Jones' locker, the boats sunk into the locker and it closed on them, thus to forever suffer being wedged between a history textbook and the last report card Davy got, he got a C- in spelling. \"Ha! Ha! Ha! Victory is mine! Yay!\" But the Red Baron flew straight into a Tie fighter and his plane blew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip went smoothly if it weren't for T-Pain showing off some of his lousy break dance moves. Thomas spotted pirate ships coming towards them. \"Everyone! Look! Pirates!\" The crew looked over and surely enough, Gay Pirates in pink ships were after the steamboat. Everyone then spoke in some getto girls voice \"Ah H311 no.\" And epic battle occurred as the crew of the steamboat got out their lightsabers while the pirates used their generic swords to fight, blood was everywhere, bombs and missiles were being shot at each other.... That was what was Thomas was seeing on a Tv while the crew strangled the pirates to death. Some beautiful music was heard as some wind was about to blow the ships away, the steamboat crew quickly ran back into the steamboat before the pirate ships were blown away, everyone looked back except for Thomas that Link was riding his boat and used the Wind Waker to blow them away. \"Thanks Link!\" The grew said as Link simply made a welcome \"Yah!\" or \"He-yah!\" sound. He sailed his boat away to some other place nearby. Thomas fell asleep after a long ride but woke up when he heard the boat's whistle. \"Mines up ahead! Mines!\" \"What!?!\" Thomas yelled as he looked forward, he saw a huge sign floating in front of them that said \"Danger: Le mines, Zey vill blow your face off and shall Le-kill you.\" \"French mines?\" Thomas asked \"Don't they mean a Mime field?\" Everyone looked at him oddly then laughed. \"Sorry I asked\" He said as everyone got ready to take on whatever the mine field had in store for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

The tank engine thought to himself. \"This is even worse than watching fan videos on that video website Fatty shown me!!!\" Somehow or other, the plane Sir Topham Hatt was riding was 50,000 feet in the air and he still heard Thomas call him Fatty, He opened up the window and shouted \"I'm not a fatty!\" as the plane flew by, Thomas had vaguely heard it. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat battled the mines for a while before the sky shown some small opening, the entire group of passengers thought this was the end for them, well, most of them, coming out from the sky was Harold the helicopter! He came to save Thomas with his driver and fireman! But T-Pain complained in his autotuned voice. \"Hey! Why are we gonna be left here to die?\" He asked sadly, \"Well, it's because you're only here to keep this story random.\" Harold said as one of his pilots dropped some chains to put under Thomas and hook him up, once attached after a couple of minutes, Thomas was lifted up into the air and then flown off to safety, but the others were sad. \"Nooooooooooo!!!\" T-Pain sang as the steamboat was about to be surrounded by mines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKer-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsert atomic explosion here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold was somehow able to lift a 52 ton, 15 cwt steam tank locomotive with organic attachments on the boiler door 50,000 feet in the air which wouldn't make sense, anyhow, Thomas was looking at the clouds in the sky, very well amazed at the really not-so-great sights but he was impressed, The two suddenly spot a Wal-Mart on some clouds along with a floating house labeled \"Lao Shi's home for imaginary friends\" Harold was stumped at why there was a shopping center and a foster home for people who don't exist, Thomas went back and forth staring at the two places when he suddenly saw things he wouldn't usually see. \"I see dead people, flying around like birds or aeroplanes...\" \"SHUT UP!\" Harold shouted in Knuckles the Enchidna's voice. \"It's just a bunch of..... Um.....\" What the two were staring at were Seedrian ghosts, people like Cosmo from Sonic X only they flew around like any other ghost. The engine and helicopter were amazed, as they went forth, they saw buildings in the sky, this must be a literal ghost town and was like if it were Heaven, The two pals decided just to go through the town and off to Hollywood, or at least New York if they didn't have the fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in space, something really weird was about to go down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... What's next?</span></div></div>",
