This surprises you.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" You say back.<br>\r\n\"Who are you, and where are you? You assume the voice was coming from Kirlia.

You look up to see Kirlia blush.<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n(Kirlia's perspective): Kirlia blushes a bit.

You call out to her and she rubs her ear. You keep calling until she finally tilts her head and you fall out. Luckily you fall on a flower. Unfortunately you were on the edge of a Venus flytrap. You look over to see that Kirlia had fallen on her butt. You scream, not wanting to fall prey to a flower. You close your eyes, screaming until something grabs you and pulls you up. You open to see it was Kirlia, and she was smiling, she wanted to know who you were. After you explain what had happened, she . . .</span></div></div>",

The Kirlia's nostril seemed just like a ginormous sized vacuum hose cranked up at full blast as it started to suck in the scent of the flower. Despite your feeble attempts at trying to get a good hold on the petal of the flower, your actions were proved useless as the shear force of the suction ends up pulling you straight into the depths of Kirlia's nostril. Right when you entered into the dark recesses of her nose, it was almost as if you entered into a dizzying amusement park attraction. The great air continued to pull you deeper inside as the odd surfaces of the walls began bouncing you all about like a pinball. While in the nostril, you couldn't help but realize just how narrow it was all about, however the deeper that you went the more open the area became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were airborne for brief moments of time, you desperately attempted to grasp on to something to prevent you form continuing on with this immense current. Unfortunately, it seemed nearly impossible to actually get a steady grip on anything as you were swept deeper inside her. After what seemed like a minute or so within shear darkness, the force of the suction soon began to dissipate around you. As the air began to vanish however, you soon found yourself freefalling down a deep dark chasm. As you began to descend, your form soon makes contact with one of the strange walls where an odd wet, squishy surface soon breaks your fall. With a grunt you try to gaze at the strange wall, before you suddenly find yourself being gently wrapped about by a similar surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the walls encapsulated your body, to your shock, you soon began to feel yourself descend downwards as the odd walls of what you believed were flesh started to pull. With your body descending downwards, you immediately attempt to wiggle about in hopes of escaping the strong grasp, but in just mere moments you are soon pushed through a strange ring of tight flesh straight into an open chamber. With a loud splash, you quickly swim your way up the odd warm liquid to catch your breath. Once upon the surface, to your utter shock, you find yourself deep within the confines of the Huge Kirlia's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately you gaze about for some safe area while floating upon the pool of her digestive juices. Luckily, you manage to spot a somewhat low mound of pink flesh towards the right of you which you immediately swim to. With no hesitation, you quickly clamber upon the slimy surface as you try to shake your body free of that repugnant liquid. Nervously you gaze about the interior of the fleshy chamber, unsure of what to do now.</span></div></div>",

When she brings her teeth down, you flinch a little. She eats all of it up. She then picks up a juice carton and starts drinking it up. She grabs a cracker and breaks a bit off. She then offers it to you. You grab it and eat it.<br>\r\n\"I just thought you might like something to eat before you are eaten yourself.\" Kirlia said. You simply just nod. She finishes crackers and then yawns. \"I'm actually getting a bit tired. Do you mind if I eat you after taking a nap?\" You look up at the sky to see that it is around noon.<br>\r\n\"Sure, go ahead.\" Kirlia then stretches and lays down on her back. She quickly falls asleep. You climb off of the cupcake and get on her stomach. You can hear her stomach digesting all of the food from before. You climb up to her face and kiss her. You then go back down to her stomach and wait for her to wake up. After about 10 minutes, you slowly rub her stomach. Suddenly, her hand comes down and grabs you. She brings you up to her face. \"She is sleep moving!\" You think. Kirlia stats licking you.<br>\r\n\"You can't escape me, my little treat.\" She mumble in her sleep. You decide to try and wake her because you don't want her to eat you while she is still asleep. You call her name. \"Don't try to persuade me, you won't get away from your fate.\" She mumbles. Her mouth opens. You try to call out to her one more time. Kirlia . . . </span></div></div>",

I guess I'm still hungry.\" You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you still have a tasty snack, right?\" She looks at you for a moment, then remembers why you were tiny. \"Just remember, think of me as food, not a friend. I don't want you to hold back.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, that won't be a problem.\" Kirlia dangles you and licks her lips. She opens her mouth and. Rings you over it. You can see her sharp teeth and massive tongue. She lowers you enough that your hands were in her mouth. She bites them off and swallows. \"You are good, better than any treat I ever had.\" She lets go, making you fall into her open mouth. Her lips close, trapping you inside. You can do much as she swirls you around. She swallows you whole. When you land in her stomach, you felt a little weird inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, we should do that again.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we will.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as you call out Kirlia's name once more, she quickly releases her fingers causing you to plummet to the awaiting abyss below. While you were looking forward to getting eaten by her, you didn't expect to do it during her sleeping. With a loud *Splat* your form soon lands upon the squishy wet surface of her huge tongue. As you raise your head up at the outside light, your whole entire view is quickly shrouded in darkness as her lips close before you. Alone in her mouth, you try your best to kneel up as a small pool of her saliva forms around your knees. her hot humid breath blows behind your bare back almost giving an assuring yet pleasing sensation. As the hot wind blew in rhythmic bursts, the faint scent of her breath fills your nostrils. Oddly enough, her breath carried the aroma of something sweet, almost like sugar mixed with fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to clamber upon the surface of her tongue, you soon find yourself losing balance as the mighty muscle below you suddenly begins to wiggle. In no time, you soon find yourself getting sloshed about the slippery surface as Kirlia begins to move her tongue about. As your body slip and slid all about her huge tongue, there were several moments when you found the it curling around your body. Judging by the satisfied \"mmm's\" emanating down Kirlia's throat, it was clear she was enjoying your flavor. After a few seconds of being jostled about in her maw, even being pinned upon the roof of her mouth, her tongue soon begins to calm down it's motions. Upon lying on the slippery muscle, exhausted from all the movements, you soon find your surroundings begin to change in gravity. Your once stable plane begins to shift upwards as Kirlia begins to lift her tongue up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the slipperiness of the muscle, it seemed impossible to keep a steady grip. As your heart races from the sudden occurrences around you, you quickly remember the reason you were in here in the first place. While it was indeed tense to say the least, you soon take a deep breath and begin to loosen your grip allowing gravity to do it's job. The descent down was speedy, almost as if travelling down a steep waterslide at an amusement park. A small chuckle somehow manages to escape as you descended by just how entertaining the trip down was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second or two of sliding, you soon find yourself free falling for a brief moment before plummeting downwards. Upon falling, your body was soon caught by the squishy surface of her throat muscles as a loud *GULP* sounds off around you. In no time, the wiggling walls around you begin to pull you downwards, shaking all about your body in a sporadic pattern. A small groan escapes your mouth by the odd yet pleasing feeling that the walls were producing as you continue your trek downwards. During your trip, the rhythmic beats of her heart soon pass on by as you seemed o have made it past her chest area. After around a pure minute of being massaged by the wriggling masses of flesh that was Kirlia's throat, your feet soon stumble upon a rather tight area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud *Squelch* and *Slorp* you soon feel your feet being sucked down past the tight mass of flesh. Upon feeling this, a great shudder courses down your body seeing as how you never once experienced a feeling like this before. Soon enough, the tight mass begins to suck up to your knees as you begin to feel your feet now free from the slimy tunnel. Within a matter of moments, your whole body but your head was past the narrow area. Below you could feel your body freely dangle about as you desperately try to pull your way down. Your persistence soon ends up paying off as you slide on through and begin to free fall within the depths of what seemed to be Kirlia's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you descend within the huge pink chamber, a loud splash erupts as you land straight into the greenish liquids of Kirlia's digestive juices. Not wasting time, you quickly swim your way up before popping your head out onto the surface. Drenched, you begin to float about as the sounds of gurgles and groans surround the area. Above, you manage to spot the faint beats of her heart as you soon revert your attention around you. Not too far off appeared to be a remnant of the hotdog she ate not too long ago. Without hesitation, you swim your way up to it before clambering upon the makeshift canoe with quick haste. Now out of the acid, you swipe off some of the dripping juices clinging to your form before gazing about the pulsating walls of Kirlia's tummy. A small smile begins to emerge on your face seeing as how you managed to successfully make it inside of the Pok\u00e9mon's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to revel in your accomplishment however, you soon begin to realize something. Will Kirlia even notice she ate you when she woke up? As you begin to ponder the thought, another idea soon begins to emerge. With you now inside her, you could possibly take the opportunity to explore her insides while she's still asleep. As you float upon the hotdog, you begin to wonder just what course of actions to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
