With short black hair, hazel eyes, and features that many described as being cute on account for his short size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though Justin was short he was 17 years old and was still attending high school. Sadly he lives alone on his farm, and has lived alone for most his life. Justin\u2019s parents work in multiple countries through the world and they would rarely come home to visit, and because of this Justin has lived alone most of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things changed when he received a letter in the mail that made his life a bit more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the boy his parents signed their house up for the newly instated, Interspecies Exchange Bill, which permitted as Interspecies to move in and live in their house.  The idea of having a stranger in his house did bother Justin, but after meeting with the Exchange Officer, Justin felt a little better knowing that every Interpseice creature had a thorough background check and that he was entirely safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the initial inspection of his home, and with slight reconstruction, the young boy was suddenly eager to meet who his new <br>\r\nOn the day of arrival, just stood outside his house and wondered what sort of monster was coming. He didn\u2019t know much about the person coming to live with him, but he hoped that they were nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust saw a black car pull up front of his house and watched as Agent Smith, the officer he first met, step out of the car and smiled at Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey shorty good to see you again\u201d the word shorty cut Justin down to the point turning white. He hated being called short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Miss. Smith, do you really have to call me that?\u201d he asked as the long legged woman approach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I call people as I seem them\u201d she said with a reassuring smile that reminded Justin of how nice of a person that Agent Smith was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow are you\u2019re ready to meet your new house quest?\u201d she asked as Justin looked over at the car waiting for his new loft mate to come out, but out of the blue Justin heard a horn and watched as a large truck appear behind the black car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they in there?\u201d Justin asked as he pointed to the large moving truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed\u201d Agent Smith said as the door to the back of the truck open up and reveal and green skinned troll woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllow me to introduce you to Sarah, she is a Minatour from Greece, she will be staying with you until further notice\u201d Agent smith explained as Justin felt his jaw hit the ground as watched the minatour girl step out of the back of the truck and approach Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a second Justin studied every feature this woman had to offer. She clearly tall, standing near 8\u20190 feet, and Justin could see that she was a muscular woman, with very large breasts, and long white hair. As a Minotaur, Justin saw that she had a pair of large horns on her head, cow ears, a cow tail, and her legs have hooves instead of feet and are covered with fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothing consists of overalls, with no shirt, and a cowbell tied around her neck. Justin casually extend his arm out to the Sarah who eargly reached out and began to shake Justins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you, I\u2019m so excited to finally meet you\u201d Sarah said with a bright smile on her face, a smile that somehow melted Justin\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pleasure all mine\u201d Justin said with a sheepish grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now allow me to introduce you to the next one\" Agent Smith explained as Justin felt his jaw drop in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A clan that was founded in the beginnings of the Edo Era in 1603 an whose sole dedication was to protect the world, sometimes in sight and sometimes from the shadows, and has done so through out the centuries. However, 13 years ago, when you were on your fifth birthday, the clan's village was invaded by a very powerful demoness named Akuha Bloodriver, her generals, Naraku (Inuyasha), Makoto Shishio (Rurouni Kenshin), Sailor Galaxia (Sailor Moon), Boa Hancock (One Piece), Caesar Clown (One Piece), Akua Shuzen (Rosario+Vampire), Seta Sojiro (Rurouni Kenshin), Camula (Yu-Gi-Oh! GX), Sartorius (Yu-Gi-Oh! GX) and Paradox (Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie that features Yugi, Jaden and Yusei) and their army of demons and monsters. They killed almost everyone. With you being the only survivor. And you only survived, because Bloodriver thought it would be amusing to see you struggle to survive alone in the world. However, what they didn't know, was that you were never alone. For, ever since you were born, you were able to see and communicate with the spirits of the Duel Monsters. You had a bond with all creatures on the village's Zen Garden. But there was five creatures with whom you shared an even deeper bond, as they were there, besides your mother the day you were born. Those creatures were Blue-Eyes White Dragon, Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Stardust Dragon, Carbuncle Ruby and Dark Magician Girl. Also, while the village was destroyed, the underground vault of the village had somehow remained intact. Thus you were well off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seiryu were a clan of powerful warriors and magicians. Many times they aided the Regents of Japan in battle and had supported them when needed. Some members of the Seiryu were known and recognized as some of the greatest warriors and magicians of all Japan. And it was considered an honor to be trained by one of them. So great was their reputation. However, the Seiryu didn't answered anyone. No. For them to fight for someone, that someone had to earn their respect. For the Seiryu took principles and honor very seriously. And so, in the times they were summoned, they answered to the Regents ONLY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance, If someone like, say, a snobby noble, decided they wanted to command the Seiryu or drive them around, they would soon find out that they were biting more than they could chew. The Seiryu wouldn't harm them. No. Instead, they simply let the nobbles do whatever they wanted to and ignored them. After they tired, they would give all and every bribe or monetary gift the nobbles had tried to buy them with to the Regents. The Seiryu made a point to keep their motto. Which was, \"Power is not for oneself. It's for the others. It is to be used to the good of everyone. Not for personal gains. It is to be used to protect the innocents. Not to judge and punish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they used their power and wealth to help and protect the less fortunate. Many books and poems were written in their honor, narrating their stories and their deeds. However, if one were to search for history records and other documents about them or tried to find their village, they would find nothing. That would be so because The Seiryu Clan had requested the regents that, if something were to happen to them, that every document about them should be erased. They asked this because evil doers or simply ambitious beings could try to use the contents and information in the documents to cause harm to the people. And the Seiryu would rather be forgotten than allow such tragedies to happen. And so, the Seiryu and the Regents had divided all the knowledge they had in books and other documents in half. Each side had kept one half and decided to place a special spell that was linked to every Seiryu that already existed and to every newborn. That is, so long as the regents knew of their existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect the spell would have, was that if the Seiryu ceased to exist, all and every document related to the Seiryu would automatically be destroyed. However, in the end, and unbeknownst to the regents, only half of the documents were destroyed. Because, while the regents spell wasn't linked to Leon, the clan's spell was. Thus, since there still was a Seiryu breathing, the documents in the clan's vaults and library remained unscathed. However, since the regents at that time didn't knew about that, they thought that the Seiryu clan no longer existed. It was indeed a very dark, tragic and sad day in the history of Japan when the land lost the Seiryu clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon's existence was kept a secret, even from the regents, not only because of the Duel Monsters bonded to him, but also because of the great power he possessed. A power so great, that in order for you to survive, they had to place 7 Seals on your body as a baby. The Seiryu believed that each and every person was guarded by a Constellation. However, unlike most people, Leon was born in an extremely rare alignment of the Pegasus, Dragon, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Pisces and Scorpion constellations during a Blue Moon. The alignment of 6 constellation happened only every five thousand years and always with different constellations. Due to you having so many guardian constellations, your armor was a mix of all six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe year is 2015. Back in 2012, the World Government revealed that monsters did exist. Several species as a matter of fact. However, at least to you, it seemed odd that most were female. And, through negotiations from all countries, an agreement was reached. An agreement named \"Cultural Exchange Between Species Act\". Since then, several human families all over the globe have taken in these creatures to live with them, in order for humans and monsters to reach a peaceful co-existence. Nowadays, one could see many monsters going out with their host families. That is due to one of the most important rules of the \"CEBSA\". Which is \"A monster cannot go outside without at least one member of their host family. Failure to comply may result in deportation\". There is another rule that is extremely enforced: \"Monsters cannot harm humans and humans cannot harm monsters. Failure to comply will result in deportation and will also result in prison of the offender\". Which was good. Because, while most accepted and welcomed these new, mysterious beings, there were others that despised them for being different and wanted them gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you have money enough to buy the most luxurious and spacious mansion, you decided to settle for a nice and comfortable two-stories house. It had two bathrooms, two bedrooms, with one of them being a suite, kitchen, living room, a garden and an underground training room. So far, you hadn't hosted a monster-girl. Until one day, when a woman wearing a black jacket, black pants and black shades appeared on your front door. Another female was besides her. But, unlike the woman, she was a Lamia. The woman identified herself as Agent Smith and told you that you had been selected to be the host family of the Lamia. Shyly, she introduced herself as Miia. You let both of them in and you all sat down on the living room. You asked if they wanted something to drink. Smith-san quickly agreed and asked for coffee. You sweatdroped at how quickly she accepted. Miia, on the other hand, didn't answered. Thinking that she hadn't heard you, you went to her side and bent down on your knees. You shook her elbow and, apparently, she had been lost in her thoughts, for she jumped a bit. You repeated the question and she requested a cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater into the night, after showing Miia around the house, the reforms were done (with Smith-san paying, of course), explaining all the rules too you and Miia and \"asking\" for dinner, Smith-san left. Leaving you and Miia alone. You picked up the dishes and went to rinse them. As you did, you noticed that Miia was quiet and seemed to be trembling. You went to your room and grabbed a spare blanket you had in your closet and covered Miia with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by the action she looked up at you. And you gave her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I hope we'll get along Miia. And that your stay here is pleasant.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiia felt her heart stir. No one, aside from Smith-san and her family, had ever been kind to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Good night, Miia.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"G-good night.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went up stairs, changed yourself, brushed your teeth and went to sleep. Unaware that a certain Lamia had sneaked in while you were sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you woke up a a soft feeling on your face and to your lower half being slightly restricted. You opened your eyes and turned around as best as you could. Only to receive a face full or breast flesh! You blushed crimson and pulled back your face, and you found out why you were restricted. You heard a giggling sound and turned your head up to look at the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Miia?! What are you doing here?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Ohay\u014d, Darling!\"</span>, she said, while giving you a small lick on the nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that you knew that your live had gotten quite a lot more interesting.</span></div></div>",

Hearing about the Interspecies Exchange Bill, he had decided to pay a visit to the land of the rising sun to see first hand the changes that were being set in motion. Mostly it was underwhelming. For the most part, the cities were unchanged. A few stores here or there were designed with Liminal in mind but mostly the city was like that of any other place he'd visited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sigh</i>, I don't know what I was expecting. The exchange bill passed not that long ago; change takes time,\" he spoke aloud with his Yorkshire accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe they're letting these freaks into the country,\" a pedestrian not far from Lance complained. Having taken to world travel, Lance had studied a multitude of languages. Japanese, while difficult, was one of the languages he had learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right. Given enough time they'll be flooding the streets. I'm just glad it hasn't happened yet,\" another said, conversing with the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure. I saw a ton of them not to far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. They were so gross, and they came in so many bizarre shapes and sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where was this place?\" Lance asked as he approached the two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of bizarre shapes and sizes. Who the heck are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to interrupt. My name is Lance, I was hoping to see some Liminal while I was here,\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tourist. No wonder he's so funny looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance looked at his reflection in a window. Being 6' 2\", he was tall most anywhere he went but was especially so in Japan. He had a lean, muscled build do to his long hours of walking, hiking, and climbing in his travels. His black hair was long and dingy do to a lack of maintenance, and he had grown an unruly beard. An overly full backpack was being carried on his shoulders that held all of his essential belongings. The clothes he wore, while not raggedy, were designed more for function than fashion. With a grey shirt, black cargo pants, and brown climbing boots he was definitely not dressed for high society. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm a bit worse for wear,\" the Brit smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I saw them about 5 miles that way,\" the less than pleasant local informed while pointing in a direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Lance said polity and began walking in the direction given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour passed noon, Lance had reached the area he'd been told about. It was an area outside of town that almost resembled a park, but without the fountains and benches. There was a large, cuboidal building, the only one around, with a sign out front. <b>Black Lily Advanced Materials Laboratory</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's a bit odd</i>,\" the wanderer thought as he stroked his beard. He climbed the shallow stairs up to the building and saw that the entrance and the walls surrounding it were entirely glass. Pushing open the doors, Lance entered and was graced with a very nice greeting area with a fountain that fed into plants, a fish tank seated in a wall filled with exotic fish, large paintings and a bulbous chandelier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" a lady at the reception desk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon my intrusion. I just heard this was a place Extraspecies gathered...\" Lance began before being cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you an Extraspecies looking for work?\" the lady asked in a chipper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, no. I'm completely human. I guess when people begin thinking you aren't human that means it's time to shave,\" Lance chuckled before a realization hit \"Extraspecies work here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do. However, unless you are an Extraspecies or have an appointment, I'm going to have to ask you to leave,\" she said in a firm but non aggressive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, I didn't mean to bother you. I just heard that I could meet some Liminals near here. I shouldn't have intruded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lance turned to leave a voice called out across the lobby, \"Wait.\" Turning back around he saw a man approaching him. His hair was black and combed but without product in it so strands here or there poked out giving him a semi professional look. In fact, that was the word to describe his entire appearance. He wore a tie but it was loose and the top button on his shirt was undone. While he wore a nice, long sleeved shirt and slakes, they were unironed. Lastly he wore a lab coat, that was hanging freely from his form. \"So, you came here in search of Extraspecies?\" the man asked as he adjusted his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I travel a lot and have spent my life trying to have as many unforgettable experiences as possible. The Interspecies Exchange Bill is going to change how our world works and that means that I no longer have to travel to see the extraordinary. Japan is the first country to institutionalize these kinds of laws and that's why I came here,\" Lance explained as a wave of memories washed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. You're really interesting you know that? Most people are trying to avoid change, yet you seek it out. If you'll indulge me a minute, I think I can offer you an experience no one else has had.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lance had been sitting in the back of the van for at least two hours. After 10 years of travel he had become used to such things but the fact that the president of Black Lily Research was sending him so far away was a bit troubling. Lance had been given the opportunity to live with multiple Extraspecies on a ranch owned by the company. The law stated that Extraspecies had to live with a human for them to legally live outside of a government facility, but this was not Lance's home, nor was he even a citizen of this country. <i>Skirting the law</i>, is how the president had described it, but this whole situation still felt wrong to Lance. Of course he still agreed, the opportunity was too enticing to refuse but that didn't mean he was going to be entirely comfortable with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreforming the techniques he learned to avoid sore or numbness from long car rides Lance had failed to notice the shift from smooth pavement, to gravel, to dirt. It was a large bump that sent his head into the roof of the car that alerted him to the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" came the drives apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance rubbed the bump on his head as he growled in anger. \"<i>It's not his fault</i>,\" he internalized and began looking out the window. The dirt road carved a path through a thick wooded area. The forests of japan were quite beautiful in Lance's opinion and this one was dense. <i>Perfect for keeping unwanted eyes from snooping</i>, the president said. 10 more minutes of driving and the car entered a clearing. The ranch wasn't too large all things considered. Nothing like other ranches that he had seen in Australia and North America. Along the fencing, Lance could see cattle and sheep freely roaming. Closer to the house, he could see vegetables like carrots, cabbage, turnips and potatoes growing. Of course, the most interesting thing he saw was a Centaur herding some cattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at a lofty 6' 9\", the exquisite equine was something to behold. Her hair was a silky golden blonde but tied up into a bun and covered by a bandanna to keep it out of the way. Her skin was tanned from prolonged exposure to the sun and the fur on her lower half was a bay color. Her legs however were white and had extensive feathering. Of course, her legs were not her most visually captivating feature. Her breasts were massive, double J cups. As she ran, they bounced significantly. Lance wondered how she was able to run at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling as if he was gawking Lance looked away, a sense of shame overtaking him. The Centaur slowed as the cattle began to behave and looked over to see the van approaching the barn. Her blue eyes, followed the vehicle before closing with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping outside of the barn, the van parked and Lance stepped out of the vehicle. Placing his backpack on the ground, he immediately began stretching to insure he wouldn't become sore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You almost done? I got work to do?\" Came a powerful female voice. Lance looked to his right only to be greeted by two monstrous breasts. These were even bigger then the pair the Centaur had. R cups to be sure and upheld by only overalls that seemed to just barley contain them. Looking up to see the owner of such magnificent mammaries, Lance saw that a Minotaur stood before him. She had short hair that liked to flare outward. It was of two colors. Black in the back and a greyish brown in the front, mostly her bangs. A pair of horns spread outward horizontally from her upper skull before curling inwards and then shooting up right at the tips. Two black streaks that ran along her check bones adorned her face. She had light brown skin weather it was from tanning or her natural tone, Lance couldn't surmise. \"Let me guess. You've never seen a Minotaur before. Well quite gawking, I need to show you around, explain your duties, and get everything else I need done around here,\" she informed with authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I'm sorry. My name's Lance Ryland. It's nice to meet you,\" he said holding out a hand to shake her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Alexandra. You can call me Alex,\" she introduced as she took his hand to shake it. \"Powerful grip. That's good. You look strong for a human. That'll make things easier. Grab your bag and follow me,\" she instructed before turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Lance noticed she had a bovine tail and hooves. Grabbing his bag he took a deep breath and thought, \"<i>This is going to be interesting</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This place was built by Black Lily with us Extraspecies in mind,\" Alex explained as she led Lance through the facilities. \"You'll find the doors and hallways in the house and barn much taller and wider than you're used to. There are currently six Liminals working on this farm. They're all women, I expect you to <i>behave</i> yourself.\" She turned her head back toward Lance to give him a partial scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Even if the Exchange Bill didn't forbid such things, that's not why I'm here. I am curious though, why is it only women work here?\" the Brit inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We produce certain <i>products</i> that require an all female staff,\" Alex informed vaguely. With a raised eyebrow, Lance followed Alex into the barn itself. There he saw two Pan gathering sheep into a pen. \"These are Elena and Iris,\" Alex introduced as the two got closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was 5' 5\" while Iris was 5' 4\". Both girls had short, white hair and curled rams horns. Patches of fluffy wool stuck out from the overalls both girls wore, especially around the neck and shoulders. The girls had teal eyes that seemed filled with timidness but a sense of honest joy. As Lance and Alex came within a few feet of the girls Iris grabbed hold of Elena's arm causing their F cup breasts to squish into one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Lance. It's nice to meet both of you,\" he said with a soft voice and a warm smile. The two Pan relaxed a little and Elena began to smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you too. You're the new hire right?\" she asked in a high, sweet voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. I'm excited to work with you all,\" Lance assured and held his hand out to shake their hands. Elena took it and shook gingerly. Iris took some coursing from her fellow Liminal but she eventually took the human's hand. Of course, it was a very limp hand shake and she quickly retreated afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Iris is extremely shy. Give her time. She'll come around,\" Alex informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex than began to show Lance around the barn. The cow milking station, the hay storage, etc. Leaving the barn, Lance couldn't help but feel as if he was being watched. From out of nowhere a body landed in front him and attempted to sweep his legs out from under him. With fast reflexes, he avoided to attack and backed up to see his attacker. His face relaxed when he saw it was a satyr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's quick. That's good, I like a challenge,\" the girl said as she brushed some hair behind her ear. Lance felt the hair on the back of his neck tingle and he once again jumped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's very perceptive too. I hadn't even made a move yet,\" another female satyr purred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sigh</i>. Lance, this is Aphra and Dite,\" Alex introduced as she pinched the bridge of her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were 5' 7\" and had short, dirty blonde hair. Goat horns and pupils as well as fur around their necks. Both girls had H cup breasts, slim waists, and plump bottoms. The overalls they wore were barley secured allowing Lance more then adequate view of their bosoms, but he assumed that was on purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDite went to stand next to her fraternal twin sister and both girls looked Lance up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tall, solid stance and posture. Good muscle tone and plenty of energy from the looks of it,\" Aphra began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hair, skin tone, and skeletal structure means he's not a local. Defensively from Europe, but that grizzled look he's got going means he hasn't been keeping up with himself. His scent has so many lingering smells that he definitely travels a lot,\" Dite added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adventurous, that's great. We can have lots of fun with him,\" Aphra smiled as she licked her lips. Before anyone could make another move, Alex grabbed both Satyrs by the head and lifted them off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you two have work to do?\" the Minotaur asked in a sinister tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just taking a small break to meet the new guy,\" Dite stated with obvious terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get right back to work. All you have to do is put us down,\" Aphra assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll put you done,\" Alex said as she lifted the girls even higher \"Way over there.\" Alex threw the sisters across the field causing Lance to panic. However, both girls manages to flip in the air and land without harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a little harsh don't you think?\" he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two are trouble. You can't underestimate them or you'll be in way over your head before you now it,\" Alex clarified before continuing the tour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex showed Lance the locations of the laundry room, the kitchen, the bath house, the recreation room, and the first aid center all while informing him of the rules of the ranch and everyone's individual duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have two main jobs. Preparing three meals a day and taking care of the laundry. Neither of those things will take you all day, so when you finish each of those tasks you'll find me or one of the others and we'll tell you what else needs to be done. You're going to be our extra set of hands, so your tasks won't be the same every day. This job will require a lot of menial and physical labor so try and get as much sleep at night as you can. I don't expect you to conform to your new sleep schedule immediately but we can't wait a week for you to adjust. We've been backed up on work, so your first few days are gonna be rough. After that, however, things should settle down and you should find the work evening out,\" Alex listed as she walked Lance down a hallway. \"This is your room. You're lucky. Iris insisted on sharing a room with Elena so you get to sleep in an actual bed. Otherwise you would be sleeping on the couch until the president could get a construction crew out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was sparse. Only a bed and a side table with an alarm clock on it. There were two tall windows in the room that gave a nice view of the forest. In the right corner there was a closet for clothes and to the left, a private half bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unpack and change into your work clothes. Dinner needs to be ready by 6 but other than that your free for the day,\" Alex said and walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance put his bag down on the floor at the foot of the bed before sitting down on the mattress. It was the softest bed he had slept on in years. With a deep, relaxing sigh, the Brit took a moment to enjoy the feeling. After a few minutes he turned to look at the clock. 3:24 PM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dinner doesn't have to be ready for hours. And while I should get started soon, there should be enough time for me to take care of something</i>,\" Lance thought as he reached for his bag.</span></div></div>",

A mix of groans and stretches were emitting from the girls after a long day of work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, you girls have great timing, I just finished the first round of food,\" Lance said as he laid out another platter of food. \"I read a synopsis of each of your eating habits from books the president gave me. I hope you enjoy your dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow,\" Elena gasped as she looked at the feast set before them. It was mostly simple dishes. A large tossed salad, beef and vegetable soup, roast beef, etc. \"This looks great. Thank y...\" Elena stopped short as Lance turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce gruff and dingy looking, the traveler was now clean shaven and with clean and spiked hair. \"I'm just glad I was able to get dinner ready in time,\" Lance smiled \"I would've hated to let you guys down on the first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shaved,\" Alex stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Ever since I got to Japan, people have been commenting on my hair, so I decided to clean myself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave yourself a hair cut too?\" Aphra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised how much money you can save by learning to cut your own hair. I keep a razor and a pair of scissors in my pack at all times. But enough about me. You should eat. I'll have seconds ready in just a few minutes.\" The girls formed a line and grabbed plates before serving themselves dinner. Lance stopped the Centaur, whom was last in line. \"We weren't introduced. I'm Lance, it's nice to meat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ailith,\" the equine greeted with a Scottish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Scottish? That's interesting, what part of Scotland are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clydesdale,\" she answered simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I visited there when I was young. I loved the trees there, and the hills at sunset were beautiful,\" Lance reminisced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAilith, looked down in sadness. \"I'm gonna eat dinner now,\" she said as she walked away. Lance watched as she walked away with puzzled concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like it,\" he attempted to recover. \"<i>What happened? Did I offend her somehow?</i>\" he wondered as he returned to the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This food is great,\" Elena cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than the food we were eating before anyway,\" Alex clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can cook, and with that hair cut he's turning out even better than expected,\" Aphra commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Dite concurred. A single stare from Alex caused both sister to begin eating faster in an attempt to avoid her wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris swallowed a spoon full of soup and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the girls had finished off the first batch of food, but Lance was ready with seconds. Three rounds of food passed before the girls were sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fucking great,\" Dite burped as she rubbed her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering her own burp with her hand, Alex stood up and instructed. \"alright, put your dishes up and hit the bath house. We gotta be up and ready to play catch up tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance had already begun cleaning the pots and pans he had used to make dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be joining us in the bath house?\" Elena asked as she placed her dishes in the bin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance stopped and looked at the Pan with shock. \"I don't think that's a good idea. Besides I still have a ton of dishes to do so I better...\" he said as he began vigorously scrubbing a pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I think it would be a good opportunity for us all to get to know one another,\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took about 45 minutes but Lance was able to clean and put away all of the dishes. Cracking his knuckles, the new hire dried his hands before turning off the lights. His eyes caught a glimpse of the clock that was hanging on the dinning room wall. 8:02 PM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I should probably take a bath and head to bed</i>,\" he thought. Swinging by his room to grab some essentials, Lance then made his way to the bath house. As he expected, the bath was empty. One of the things Lance enjoyed most about Japan was its large soaking bathes. Of course, since this one was designed for Liminals it was extra wide and deep. The water was so warm that there was a thin fog throughout the entire chamber. Along the left side there were little shelves to hold belonging and on the right were shower heads and stools for washing. In the far corner there were jets that shot water out of the floor as well a detachable shower head with an extra long hose. \"<i>Must be for Ailith to clean her under side</i>,\" he summarized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking a showering station, the human began to clean himself; making sure that he cleaned his freshly cut hair thoroughly. He used a towel to scrub his skin clean of all grim that he may have accumulated. A variety of scars were scattered across his body and he winced every so often when he ran the towel across them. Taking no more time then necessary, Lance finished showering and gathered his things. Debating whether or not to soak in the bath, Lance stood in the chamber staring at the water. A gasp caused him to look at the door. Standing at the entrance was Iris, whose whole face was red. Frozen for only a moment, the pan quickly covered her eyes before running out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing the proper etiquette in this scenario Lance decided to simply get dressed and leave. Lance walked passed the other girls rooms on the way to his. Passed one of them he heard Iris hyperventilating. He didn't know if it was a good idea to try and help. It was his fault she was like this. Which meant he could either make it worse, or he could help her feel better. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lance rubbed the back of his neck before letting out a deep sigh. As much as he wanted to help, he hand no real idea of how to do that. He found it best to simply give Iris space and head to bed. Wake up time is early so it's best to get to sleep as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening his door, Lance placed his dirty clothes in a hamper next to the closet and laid down on the bed. Wearing only a pair of well worn basketball shots, the human stretched before yawning and pulled the blanket over his body. \"<i>I'll have to find a way to make Iris feel comfortable around me if we're going to work together. Maybe I can ask Elena about that</i>,\" he thought as he tried to fall asleep. It didn't take long for his minor fatigue and the soft bed to whisk him away to the realm of dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Alex knocked firmly on Lance's door. When no response  was given she knocked louder. \"Hey newbie, get up. There's work to be done,\" she spoke through the door. \"Trust me, it'll be better for you to get up than to force me to get you up,\" the Minotaur warned. With a sigh, Alex opened the door and shouted \"get up you lazy...\" Her anger was halted as she found an empty room beyond the door. \"What the?\" she wondered. It was 5:00 AM, Lance's bed was made, and there was no sign that Lance had slept there. \"Did he bail?\" she asked herself before turning around and closing the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the kitchen to start breakfast herself, she was surprised to find Lance already hard at work. \"Alex great timing,\" he said as he spotted her, \"any ideas for breakfast options for the other girls. I can only think of oatmeal and apple crepes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, we haven't really made anything fancy for breakfast before,\" she answered with a slight confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waking up can be daunting, especially if you know you have a long days work ahead of you. A delicious breakfast is a good motivator to get up and start the day,\" Lance said as he cracked some eggs into a boil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I'll go and make sure the girls are awake. You... keep doing what you're doing,\" the ranch head informed before turning around and walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Lance responded as he continued cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, all the extra species girls were present and the food was ready. Lance made plates for everybody and greeted each girl with a warm smile and a hello. That is until Iris, whom was at the end of the line. \"Good morning Iris. I'm sorry about last night. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable,\" he said as he loaded a plate with some food and the special crepe he made just for her. Iris blushed, looked away, grabbed the plate, and dashed toward the table to sit next to Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he mean by <i>sorry about last night</i>?\" Dite asked the silent Pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris walked in on the new hire in the bath house last night,\" Elena informed as she put a hand on her friends to calm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she now? Do tell us all the juicy details. His build, his trim, his <i>girth</i>,\" Aphra insisted causing Iris to bury her blushing face into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough of that,\" Alex asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. You can't tell me you're not the least bit interested about what's under the hood,\" Aphra probed Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more concerned about finishing breakfast so we can get started on today's chores,\" the Minotaur stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried the newbie will hear you asking about this?\" Elena questioned the sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's more than welcome to answer these questions himself,\" Dite said and turned to look over her shoulder. Much to her chagrin, Lance was busy making seconds and hadn't heard any of the conversation. \"Oh well, I'm sure we'll find out for ourselves tonight in the bath house,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I offered for him to join us in there last night, but he refused,\" Elena informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Alex asked as she turned to look at the human as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he wanted to finish up his tasks first. Said he didn't want to let us down on the first day,\" the pan elaborated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Playing hard to get, or is he just a shy virgin?\" Aphra pondered as she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough of that. Finish eating and let's get to it,\" Alex said as she got up from the table to grab more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast continued and before long, Lance was left alone in the kitchen to finish dishes. Thanks to better planning, Lance was able to finish dishes quickly and headed toward the laundry room to start on his next task. The sight of the laundry room was a shock. Overalls were flung everywhere. Baskets upon baskets were overflowing with towels and other clothing. The smell was also alarming. He wondered if laundry had ever been done here. With a deep breath, Lance got to work and began to sort, clean, and then hang each of the clothes to dry in the sun. This took longer than he would have liked and caused him to cut into his prep time for lunch. Rushing back to the kitchen he began to prepare several dishes that would satisfy and give the girls the energy to finish the day. Lunch was much faster than breakfast. Very little talking took place as the girls mostly wolfed down the food before heading back out again. The human once again washed dishes before heading outside to gather the dried clothes from the lines. He then folded and placed the clothes inside of hampers. Ailith's skirts were a bit of a challenge thanks to their size and the wind but Lance was able to manage. After taking the baskets of clean clothes and placing them outside of each girls room, Lance looked at a clock and saw it was 2:00. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex said I should find her or another of the girls after I finish my tasks for the day,\" Lance said to himself. </span></div></div>",

Born with incredible power, your family had taught you to control that power at an early age. How to harness it, and how to keep it in check. However, before you could truly train to hone your skills at age 8, your clan was attacked by demons. Your brother, Itachi had taken you to a safe house and attached seals all over it, telling you to come out ONLY when the seals have deactivated, which you obeyed to the letter. However, once you walked out of the safe house, you saw the entirety of your clan butchered, your mother, brother, and father dead in the street. You were overwhelmed with emotions and you swore revenge. Seven years later you were well taken care of due to the fact the Uchiha had a considerable bank account, and as the sole heir to it, you had great funds at your disposal, yet you didn\u2019t go nuts with it by any means. You bought a simple home, with a training grounds for you to train, a little Zen Garden to relax, and the necessities. You had a special room for some gear that you knew one day you would need again. However the world changed when the government revealed monsters were in fact real, and they began to make an \u201cInterspecies Exchange Bill.\u201d which would allow monsters to pursue cultural exchange. Though three years have passed since then, not once have you been a host family to such monsters, and you continued to live your life normally. However you were soon surprised with an Interspecies Coordinator named Smith had arrived at your home with a Lamia named Miia. You were quite surprised by this, and quickly learned the law of this bill. Later on that same day, Miia seemed cold, and you decided to get her some very warm blankets, and welcomed her with a smile and open arms. And while you were fully happy to accommodate her, especially since the government remodeled the house to make it more comfortable in each room for her, due to her tail was about 6 to 10 feet in length, but what you didn\u2019t expect is that one act of kindness, she had fallen in love with you REALLY quickly, and the instant you heard her call you \u201cDarling\u201d you knew your life was about to get much more complicated. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s morning, wake up.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cFive more minutes\u2026.no, wait until I warm up five more degrees.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait, Miia, what are you doing in my bed?\u201d </span><span class=\"cred\">\u201cIt was too cold to warm myself up. I thought you could warm me up, darling. Lamias are cold-blooded.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019ll draw you a bath then.\u201d</span> you said sitting up. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cNope.\u201d</span> She used her tail to grab you and bring your face right into her chest. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI want you to warm me up, darling. You\u2019re so warm. I can feel your body heat warming me up.\u201d</span> As she said this the top she wore moved a bit exposing even more of her chest.<i> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHer Oh hell! Calm down Sasuke. Don\u2019t get any weird-\u201d </span></i>your thoughts were cut off when Miia coiled around you, and tightly for that matter. <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhoa, whoa! My neck! She\u2019s cutting off my carotid artery! Time out Miia! I\u2019m gonna pass out! I give up, I give up!\u201d</span></i> You thought tapping her coils twice <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling, don\u2019t be so rough.\u201d</span> she said half asleep. <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou kidding me?! I need to break out somehow.\u201d </span></i>Despite your efforts you couldn\u2019t get free. <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo good. She squeezes tighter wherever there\u2018s a gap. If I don\u2019t escape soon, I\u2019m as good as done. Must\u2026escape\u2026!\u201d</span></i> you thought grabbing the end of her tail which caused her to gasp. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cD-Darling, not the tip of my tail\u2026\u201d</span> <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHave I found her weakness?\u201d</span></i> you thought and scratched at it a bit with your index finger, and she gasped once again. <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIts extremely effective, it might be the only way out of this.\u201d</span></i> you said as you continued to use force on her tail, stimulating it as her coils loosened up.<span class=\"cred\"> \u201cD-Darling, no more\u2026\u201d</span> <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAlmost there\u2026\u201d</span></i> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling!\u201d </span>you were so desperate you made a hard twist on that tail with a tight grip and she gasped once more and started to drool, you quickly took in a lungful of air. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI thought I was toast\u201d</span> Miia once again force your head into her chest, but she was painting with pleasure.<span class=\"cred\"> \u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t take it\u2026I\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019m coming!!!\u201d</span></b> she yelled as she tightened around you with a climax, and you nearly passed out from the sheer force of it. About 2 minutes later Miia finally got out of your bed. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cOh, fine. I\u2019ll get up. You were so feisty this morning.\u201d</span> she noticed you were just laying there. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cGive give me a minute or two.\u201d </span>you said catching your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit you drew up a bath for Miia, and you couldn\u2019t help but comment on the sheer size of each room now, though your thoughts were interrupted by Miia. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIs the bath ready?\u201d</span> she said walking in. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cUh, yeah. I just-\"</span> you covered your nose as it bled seeing Miia naked. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThank you, Darling. I\u2019ll take the first bath.\u201d </span>As she got in a good amount of water flowed over the sides. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIt\u2019s so warm. Japanese bathtubs are so great. I read that Japan has hot springs, too. I\u2019d like to go to one with you someday.\u201d</span> she said sliding to the side closest to you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell, um\u2026\u201d</span> your nose let out a burst of blood. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat are you looking at? So naughty.\u201d</span> You had to get out of there and fast. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI-I\u2019m going to get breakfast ready now\u2026\u201d</span> Before you could escape Miia grabbed you with her tail and pulled you into the bath. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMiia! You\u2019re in the bath! You don\u2019t need me to warm you up!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI know hot springs have something called mixed bathing, too.\u201d</span> Her breasts pressed to your back. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait\u2026Miia..\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSo we can bathe together.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMiia, given that its prohibited, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIs mixed bathing that bad? Do hot springs have such naughty practices?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d </span><span class=\"cred\">\u201cThen let\u2019s experience mixed bathing together.\u201d</span> she said as your hands were bound and was trying to remove your shirt <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAfter all, I came to Japan to experience its culture.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to do mixed bathing with anyone but you. I want my first to be\u2026\u201d </span>Before she could do anything you got free for a moment and turned the shower on cold, and she gasped in surprise.<span class=\"cred\"> \u201cIt\u2019s so cold! My body heat!\u201d </span>As she moved you fell right back in the bath with her. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat are you doing Darling?!\u201d</span> You got out of there and looked at her <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis facility doesn\u2019t offer mixed bathing.\u201d</span> you said walking off. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAww! You\u2019re no fun!!\u201d</span> As you got out of the bathroom, you had one hell of a nosebleed and started to hit your head against the wall to snap out of it. The law with this bill is not easy to follow, especially when Miia gets your blood boiling like that. Once you calmed down you went down to make some breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you decided to make plenty of eggs since that's Miia's favorite dish. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Man, a few weeks ago, I never thought my life would be like this.\"</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"You can say that again.\"</span> A woman said behind you, causing you to jump. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Good morning, Sasuke Uchiha. What's wrong? have you forgotten me? I'm your Interspecies Coordinator, Smith.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Yeah I know who you are. What are you doing here?\"</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Could I get breakfast too?\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"You came here to eat?\"</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm also here to make sure you're not engaging in any prohibited activities. Anyone who hurts the girls, who are here for the purpose of cultural exchange, will be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Since you, as her host, are ignorant of the law, I came to check on you.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Ignorant? Now hold on. You're the one who accidentally brought Miia here. I'm not her intended host family.\"</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"I don't recall.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Talk about lax! Anyway, I would never hurt her.\"</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hurting her can me popping her cherry too.\"</span> she said as he got behind you.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"I wouldn't-\"</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"You've got genitals. You could do it if you wanted to. Has she ever approached you? The girls are rather passionate. However, damaging the purity of her species' representative at human hands would be a diplomatic issue. If you did this, you would be arrested and Miia deported. it's sad, but it's the law.\"</span> You stayed silent for a moment. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"So did you have sex?\" </span><span class=\"cblue\">\"No!\"</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"But surely you've thought about it. Her lower body's a snake, but she's got a nice body, big breasts, and she's beautiful. Above all, she's madly in love with you. And besides, you don't look like you could put up much of a fight\"</span> She said getting close to you, almost in a teasing manner. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Hey...\"</span> Before you could react Miia grabbed you by the neck and pulled you toward her with her tail.<span class=\"cred\"> \"Hey! What are you doing? You'll pay if you lay a finger on my darling, Smith-san!\"</span> <i><span class=\"cnavy\">\"He's got it rougher than I thought.\" </span></i> <span class=\"cred\">\"Are you listening?\"</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"I was just joking. I have other matters to see to, so i'll be going.\" </span>As she walked she stopped and looked at you. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Darling-kun, please refrain form any prohibited activities. Bye.\"</span> As she left Miia held you close to her. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Uh, Miia? you'll get cold again if you don't dry off.\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"Are prohibited activities that big a deal?\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Huh?\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"Back when I first arrived here...Since lamias have the lower body of a snake, most people hate us on first glance. So I was afraid you wouldn't accept me, but you accepted me with a smile. It made me so happy.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"I see your species on TV all the time, you aren't scary.\"</span> You were pinned to the ground gently as she coiled around you and got on top of you. <span class=\"cred\">\"What's prohibited makes no difference to me. Because I don't care what you do to me. You could even hurt me if you want.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">Miia...\"</span> Miia used the tip of her tail to unzip your paints and she force it into your underwear. <span class=\"cred\">\"I wouldn't mind...if you gave me my first permanent scar. After all, I love you.\"</span> she said leaning in to kiss you, but you tilted your head back. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I'm sorry. I can't.\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"Why? Is the law that important?\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"That's not what I meant.\" </span>Your face turned a bit blue there. <span class=\"cblue\">\"My arm...is about to snap...\" </span>She gasped and before she could release you, your shoulder was dislocated.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"YEOW!!!\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"DARLING!!\"</span> Smith came back shortly and helped get your shoulder back into place. Miia crying and saying \"I'm sorry\" multiple times. Your life sure is a roller coaster now. </span></div></div>",

She game you the ground rules, like you cant leave her alone, and of course, no love hotels. After getting into something else, and waiting for Miia to get dressed the two of you were off. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cA date. A date. Today I\u2019m on a date with my darling. A date!\u201d</span> she sang excitedly. You were just trying to keep your cool. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cLet\u2019s go, darling. Let the date begin!\u201d</span> she said grabbing your head with her tail and slithering off with speed. <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMiia try not to break my neck here!\u201d</span></i> you thought. Through-out the course of the day, the two of you went to all sorts of places, starting with a nice restaurant, then she took you to an arcade and kept playing the claw machine until she got a stuffed snake. Of course she took you in a photo-booth and while it was a bit small, you did get a little bit crushed by her coils, as was to be expected. But when the two of you went to a karaoke club, the private room wasn\u2019t that big, and again you got crushed. But needless to say, she was having a blast. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThis is so much fun. I thought Japan would be more formal, but it has a lot of fun places. But I\u2019m a little disappointed everything was so small and designed for humans. I wish we could have done karaoke together.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWell private booths are pretty small. And not everything has been adapted for all species yet, so it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</span> Miia spotted a special store. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cLook, darling. There\u2019s a store for all species. Let\u2019s go inside!\u201d</span> she said as she practically dragged you there. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey don\u2019t pull.\u201d</span> When the door opened you were a little surprised by the type of store it was. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026a l-lingerie shop?!?! I think I\u2019ll wait outside.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cNo.\u201d </span>she said grabbing you with her tail, pulling you in.<span class=\"cred\"> \u201cSmith-san said we have to be together at all times/</span>\u201d Miia approached a clerk after she let you go. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cExcuse me. Do you have anything for lamias?\u201d</span> \u201cOver there. Take your time.\u201d <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cI feel so uncomfortable\u2026\u201d </span>you said to yourself.<i><span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cDoes Miia even wear underwear? How??\u201d</span></i> your thoughts were interrupted by Miia. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling, which do you think looks better?\u201d</span> You moved back a little surprised. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI don\u2019t wear bras too often, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d</span> she said opening her shirt, causing your nose to bleed. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about bras either, why don\u2019t you try them on??\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cTry them on? Good idea</span>.\u201d she said dragging you in there too. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou don\u2019t need me in here you know!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWe have to be together at all times. So I want you to look at them and pick which ones you like.\u201d</span> she said dropping the bras in your hands, causing you to blush. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI want to wear whatever you like. I want you to love me even more. So look carefully before you choose</span>.\u201d she said as she showed off parts of her body. You blushed and just blurted out the answer. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThey\u2026They all look great! Let\u2019s get them all!\u201d</span> you said rushing out. As you sighed with relief, you noticed something triangular in your hand. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat is this? Silicon? A Nubra? No, it\u2019s the wrong shape. The back seems adhesive, and it\u2019s warm.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cD-Darling\u2026\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry for dragging you into the changing room, so give me back my panties.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEh?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling, you\u2019re such a pervert!\u201d </span>she said taking the object back with her tail. And soon you got an image in your head of how that actually works. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo you <i>do</i> wear underwear.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDummy!\u201d</span> she said while slamming you with her tail hard enough to send you flying out the window. After a bit, the two of you are walking down the street. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSheesh, darling...only perverts play with panties, you know.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it, I didn\u2019t even know what it was!\u201d</span> She giggles. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cBut if you\u2019re that curious, I\u2019ll show you, darling.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI told you\u2026\u201d</span> Just then two by-standers hear that. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhoa! What is that? Damn! She called him darling!\u201d \u201cTalk about gross!\u201d</span> they said laughing, Miia got frustrated and soon tried to smack them with her tail, but you took the hit instead. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling! Why did you?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMiia, remember the law. Humans cannot harm other species, but the reverse situation also applies.\u201d </span>More people started to show up and take pictures, Miia wanting privacy, though sadly the only thing available was indeed a love hotel. You sat on the bed nervous as all hell while Miia was bathing, but then she came out in only a robe. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThis bath isn\u2019t as big as yours, but it\u2019s still pretty big.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cM-Miia, are you okay?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYeah. I feel better now. But this is a hotel right? I don\u2019t have any of my stuff.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIts fine, we wont be here for very long at all.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cEven though it\u2019s a hotel? Then what do people do here?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI wonder!\u201d </span>you said playing dumb. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAnd what is this?\u201d </span>she said pulling out a condom. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cJust leave that there!\u201d </span>you said embarrassed. She did as you asked and you sat there for a bit. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI guess human\u2019s still don\u2019t like us.\u201d </span>You looked at Miia confused. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cPeople are only nice to us because it\u2019s required by law. Are you being nice to me because you\u2019re afraid of being arrested, too?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d</span> Miia removed her robe and fell back on the bed. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cLook, darling. I'm not scary. See how defenseless i am? I wouldn\u2019t do anything, even if you hurt me. Are you still afraid of me?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMiia\u2026\u201d</span> Before you could say a word, Smith burst through the wall with some troops. She was prepared to take you in, until she saw you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo how did you find us?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate out skills on getting information. But in truth, we used twitter</span>.\u201d You were just dumbfounded. Once Miia got dressed you all went downstairs and the same couple saw you and they started mocking Miia again. But before she could attempt to hit them again. You charged them and landed a punch to the guy\u2019s face so hard, it forced the two of them through the glass door. Back at your house, Smith patched up your arm and told you that they settled things with the couple outside the courtroom, but you knew it was because Smith intimidated them. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cAbout that cut on your cheek\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI tripped and fell on it.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThat\u2019s fine then.\u201d</span> she said leaving, and Miia came into the room. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling. Why did you do that?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI jumped in front of your tail to keep things from getting bad. Its no big deal.\u201d </span><span class=\"cred\">\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLook, if I do it, it\u2019s just a normal fight. Hitting guys like that isn\u2019t worth you getting deported. Besides\u2026you may be of another species, but you\u2019re a girl first and foremost. I couldn\u2019t forgive them for being so mean to a girl. That\u2019s all.\u201d</span> Miia smiled having tears of joy in her eyes. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling\u2026Darling!\u201d</span> she said tackling you to the ground, nuzzling your chest. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt\u2018ll always end like this\u2026huh?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI\u2019m so happy! You really see me as a girl! Shall we pick up where we left off, then?\u201d </span>she said revealing her chest, and started removing your clothes. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait! We just barely avoided you getting deported!\u201d </span><span class=\"cred\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m ready for my first time now!\u201d</span> Smith came back before it got out of control. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh, Darling-Kun, what\u2019s for dinner tonight?\u201d </span>both of you were sitting upright with your backs to her. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat are you doing Smith-San?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhat am I doing? I\u2019m hungry</span>.\u201d <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re so demanding!\u201d</span> She started to whine at how the negotiations wore her out. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWe\u2019re having curry, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d </span><span class=\"cred\">\u201cJust when things were getting good\u2026\u201d </span><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh Miia-chan, you left these at the hotel.\u201d</span> she said holding her panties. Miia let out an embarrassed scream and you just rolled your eyes. Knowing that things would never be dull here.</span></div></div>",

Something happen?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cOh, Darling. You\u2019re so shameless!\u201d</span> she said repeatedly hitting your back in excitement though it did sting a bit. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cOf course I\u2019m in a good mood. You were so cool yesterday.\u201d</span> From the look on her face it was easy to tell she was fantasizing of your response to her last night. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIf you\u2019re ever in danger, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</span> she said going inside to get more clothes. You went to follow her but something grabbed you and you hit the back of your head, knocking you out. Miia heard this and rushed to you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling?\u201d</span> At that moment she saw a harpy holding you in her claws, and flew off with you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling!!!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you woke up hanging in a tree. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh? Where am I?\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d </span>You looked seeing the harpy that grabbed you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cPapi! I\u2019m Papi. Papi the Harpy.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cPapi Harpy Papi?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHarpy the Papi.\u201d</span> She stumbled around with this for a while and you decided to get things back on track. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAnyway, where is your host family? You\u2019re not supposed to be alone.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s why I brought you here.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou kidnapped me for <i>that</i>?\u201d</span> She noticed an ice cream truck and you quickly lost her attention. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that? Is it food?!\u201d</span> she said excitedly. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cListen to me!\u201d</span> She grabbed you out of the tree and dropped you to her feet, and then started to pull you to the truck but after about three steps she looked at you in confusion before taking a step back. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWho are you?\u201d</span> <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShe\u2019s a birdbrain!\u201d</span></i> It took a minute but you finally got back on track and bought her some ice cream and sat with her on a bench. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI'm not allowed to go out until I memorize the Interspecies Ceremony.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou mean \u2018Interspecies Exchange Bill.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s too difficult for me to remember though. So, when the terminator wasn\u2019t looking\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cCoordinator you mean.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI ran away!\u201d</span> \u201c<span class=\"cblue\">That can\u2019t be good!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo worries. I've run away a few times, but I didn't get in trouble. But they said next time I ran away, they'd incest me. What does that mean?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI think you mean they would \u2018deport\u201d you! You\u2019re in huge trouble!\u201d</span> Her face grew pale. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cTrouble\u2026\u201d</span> she then accidentally dropped her ice cream. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI haven\u2019t even had a single bite yet! It's so hard to hold!\u201d</span> she said crying. <span class=\"cblue\"><i>\u201cAww. With hands like that, it\u2019s no wonder.\u201d</i></span> You held out the ice cream pop to her <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHere, you want this?\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cReally?! Okay, thank you.\u201d</span> she said not even taking it, but just eating it right on the spot. Needless to say, this didn\u2019t look good. You asked why she didn\u2019t take it and she\u2019s afraid to drop it again. Though you were getting some looks and you weren\u2019t comfortable with it. When you took it from her mouth, a good amount of it got on her.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cI-I\u2019m all sticky\u2026\u201d</span> she said coughing. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201c Then, let\u2019s get you cleaned up, come on there\u2019s a faucet over here.\u201d</span> you said moving in a slight hurry, but when you turned around you noticed she was naked and getting in the fountain. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cBathing!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNo, I meant your clothes!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t you know you\u2019re supposed to bathe naked?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201c<i>A birdbrain just made fun of me.</i> Just get out of there!\u201d</span> She ignored you and started to bathe in the fountain. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThis feels great! It\u2019s so nice that you have baths in the city!\u201d</span> It didn\u2019t take long for a crowd to gather. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis girl is absolutely clueless about human society. Even as a bird you can only be so bird-brained.\u201d</span> she then grabbed you and pulled you in the fountain. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there! Play with me!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cKeep me out of this!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI found you!\u201d</span> You turned your head to see Miia, and she was pretty ticked. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou bird brat! You kidnapped my darling, and now this?! I\u2019m so jealous!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d </span>She got right into Papi\u2019s face and started going off. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI want to steal away my darling and elope with him, too! You make me so jealous, it can't be legal!\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat?! You want to fight?\u201d</span> Both of them were right in each other\u2019s face. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey, both of you calm-\u201d</span> You were cut off by Miia grabbing Papi, and you as well. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou bird brat! I\u2019ll make chicken soup out of you!\u201d </span>Of course Papi clawed her shirt tearing it, and you cot scratched too. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat did you say? What was that about chicken boobs?\u201d </span><span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhat are <i>you</i> talking about?!\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBoth of you are putting on quite a show with- huh? No one\u2019s looking?\u201d</span> Then you and the girls noticed why, a little girl was stuck in a high tree. Papi volunteered to help by pecking her down until she falls, but she was weighed down by her wet wings. Miia started to climb the tree and when she accidentally startled the girl, she fell and Miia tried to grab her, but missed. Papi caught her with her body as she jumped but she couldn\u2019t fly and when she landed, she saw you had cushioned their fall. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cG-Good work, Papi.\u201d </span>you said giving her the thumbs up. As the mother got her child people clapped for Papi, but as you stood with Miia she let out a few tears <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI tried too\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know. Good job.\u201d</span> you said getting the leaves from her hair. But then a cop showed up too later when called for the little girl. When he asked Miia and Papi about their host families, you stood up for Papi, which both she and Miia were touched by, but then when you were asked for the papers you were in a bind until smith showed up, and you all went back to your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo how did you get Papi\u2019s papers so fast?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI already had them.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI couldn\u2019t find a family that would host a repeat runaway. So I was on my way to have her stay here.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWait- that means\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cPapi-chan. This is your new home.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cReally?!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cHe\u2019s the master of the house, so make sure to listen to him.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYay! Yay! Yay!\u201d </span>she said kicking her legs in glee. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait, can they both stay here at the same time?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhy not?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSmith, you really are careless aren\u2019t you?\u201d </span><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cPapi-chan, don\u2019t run away again.\u201d</span> she said with a wink. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt's okay! I don\u2019t understand complicated stuff, but i did learn one thing. I just need to stick with my master from now on, right? Take care of me, Master! Hey, Master, let's take a bath! Let's pick up where we left off! Come on, come on, come on.\" </span>she said pulling you to the bathroom. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t pull! And, actually\u2026\u201d</span> you looked at Miia not sure how she\u2019d react. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhy not? Darling, please keep Papi-chan company.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOkay.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cCome on.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDon\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cMiia-chan, you\u2019re taking this surprisingly well. I thought you\u2019d object.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI-it\u2019s no big deal. I'm a little upset a nuisance has found its way into the home i share with my darling... But Papi-chan's a child. Also, she's a child. And most of all, she's a child. An adult like me can handle her.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh my, Papi-chan\u2019s your age actually.\u201d</span> She got shocked at this development. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cHarpies evolved to have smaller bodies so they could fly, so they're often older than they look.\u201d</span> Miia quickly rushed to the bathroom and broke in, and you were slammed between the wall and the now detached door. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling, never mind! I\u2019ll keep her company!\u201d</span> It didn\u2019t take long for them to start bathing. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cJust to be clear, Darling is <i>my</i> Darling. If you lay a finger on him, you will pay.\u201d</span> <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI don\u2019t have fingers.\u201d </span>As they talked, you thought to yourself <span class=\"cblue\"><i>\u201cCan my body survive this crap?\u201d </i></span>After a while you were pleased to see them sleep together, Papi\u2019s warmth keeping Miia out of your room for the night, but when you went to get a drink you knew you had to restock ASAP. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It must be fate! My name is Centorea Shianus. I'm a member of the dignified centaur race. Are you the one destined to become my master?\u201d</span> she stopped for a moment when she realized you were semi-conscious and helped you up, even helping pick your items up again. Giving a quick call to Smith, she once again just asked you to take care of her before she hung up to sleep.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cShe\u2019s so careless.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAnyway, Japanese spells are no joke.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSpells?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cIf you charge into an intersection, the one you run into is your soul mate. It\u2019s an ancient spell, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIf you did that you\u2019d just cause a traffic accident. Someone could have been hurt.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI see.\u201d</span> she says handing your bag back to you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m not your soul mate. That\u2019s also not a spell. It\u2019s a manga clich\u00e9, and an old one at that.\u201d </span><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWh-What? I knew I should have put toast in my mouth?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhere did you learn that one? And why are you looking for your sole mate like this anyway?\u201d </span><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWell, because\u2026\u201d</span> the conversation got interrupted by a man on a scooter who snatched a woman\u2019s purse. He about ran you over but Centorea grabbed you and pulled you close. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cDamn you. Committing more crimes?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u2026.\u201d</span> She looked at you and noticed you were in her chest. She let go and moved back. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s the guy who\u2019s been snatching purses around here lately.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhat? As a proud member of the centaur race, I cannot ignore this. I swear upon my blade, I will capture him! But, according to the Interspecies Exchange Bill, I cannot touch him. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been looking for a master to fight alongside me.\u201d</span> <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAren\u2019t you already violating the Weapons Control Law?\u201d</span></i> She quickly grabbed your arm. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped though. It matters not if you aren\u2019t my master.  Come with me.\u201d </span>she says as your arm touches her breasts. <span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cI get it, I get it! I\u2019ll ride you.\u201d</span> you said as you were about to get on her back, but she responded with a kick that you just barely dodged. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat was too close!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhat are you doing?! I\u2019m not a horse! If you aren\u2019t my master, then cease your rude behavior. Unbelievable. Japan\u2019s spells are really useless.\u201d </span>she said crossing her arms her face red. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThen what do you suggest?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief checks his prize as he rides the scooter, but Centorea catches his attention, and you\u2019re holding onto her sides. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThief, come quietly. Otherwise, you will taste the weight of your crimes and the edge of my blade!\u201d</span> She looked at you as she ran forward. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cTouch me inappropriately, and I\u2019ll throw you off, got it?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThen slow down!\u201d</span> This quickly turns into a wild chase, the thief first using water jugs to try to slow her down, but that blade just cuts right through them. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d</span> You were blushing pretty bad due to the fact you could see through her shirt. She noticed that fact too and covered herself, giving the thief a chance to go down a steep ramp. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYou think you can get away so easily?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWait, you aren\u2019t seriously going to-\u201d</span> you were interrupted when she just jumped into the air and landed on a truck, before jumping off it and is right next to the guy, her blade as his neck. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYou wont escape. Hey, I need you to..\u201d </span>She just now noticed your hands were at her breasts trying to get a grip even though her wet shirt makes it harder, now she was trying to get you to stop. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhere, do you think you\u2019re touching you idiot?!\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cif you keep kicking, I\u2019ll-\"</span> you were almost thrown off but clenched your arms around her breasts. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cY-you\u2019re doing this on purpose aren\u2019t you? I swear you will pay for this later.\u201d</span> You once again lost your grip and accidentally opened up her shirt, which made the biker lose control and crash, however Centorea froze up like a deer in the headlights, and you both crashed into a wall. You were buried under a pile of boxes as Centorea caught her breath. She tried reaching for her blade but the thief got it since she dropped it earlier. As he tried to slice her, you shielded her with your own body, your own instinct taking over. <i><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m dead\u2026\u201d</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u2026or so I thought. So it\u2019s a replica huh?\u201d</span> You said as you were talking to Smith on the phone, your injury being a cut across your body, but nothing to worry about. As you and Smith talked, you told her about the chase and she asked if you tried to ride her. \u201cUh, why?\u201d She explains how basically, finding a master is like marriage to a centaur, and forcing one to let them ride them is like rape. You noticed Centorea lingering in a door and you quickly hung up and quickly got on your hands and knees. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m so Sorry Centorea! I had no idea how important it was, I didn\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d</span> You looked up to see her kneeling before you as well. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cInstead of Centorea, I want you to call me Cerea. That's what my close friends call me.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI'm the one to blame.

Therefore, I, Centorea Shianus, acknowledge you as my master, and swear my lifelong loyalty to you.\u201d</span> You let out a surprised gasp. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cMaster, will you accept my loyalty?\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cC-Cerea\u2026\u201d</span> Just then Miia and Papi walked in. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling, did you get another girlfriend?\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMaster, I\u2019m hungry!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cDarling?

Though just as Miia was talking about the fact humans and non-human species cannot harm each other, you walk in with a horseshoe imprint under your left eye. Naturally Miia wasn\u2019t happy about it. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cEasy Miia, I can explain. I was going to get you a bath to warm you up so you wouldn\u2019t need me again, but I accidentally walked in on Cerea. I honestly didn\u2019t think she was in there, so the fault is mine.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cN-Not at all. I had worked up a sweat from my morning run. If I had locked the door, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </span><span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt\u2018s okay, I\u2018m used to it.\u201d </span>Miia separated the two of you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling, you're always defending Centorea! Centorea, hurry up and fill out your homestay application!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAlright.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI swear, centaurs are so violent. He only saw you naked!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhat? How dare you ignore your own faults? Lady Smith told me everything. I heard you dislocated his shoulder.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI just couldn\u2019t contain my emotions\u2026.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cIn contrast, my master jumped in front of a evildoer\u2019s blade to protect me!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWell, my darling beat up some delinquents to protect me!\u201d </span>The two of them started going at it and you ended up getting a slap from Miia\u2019s tail again. But before you could intervene, you noticed Papi have a mental overload. Needless to say, the Exchange Bill was extremely confusing to her. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMy head feels so hot, I want to take a bath.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThen go take one.\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cLet\u2019s take one together, Master!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhy not ask Miia or\u2026\u201d </span>You continued to watch them argue on how far one has gotten with you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOn second thought, you\u2019re better off with me.\u201d</span> As you made a cool bath for Papi, you also showed her the new swimsuit Smith got her, though it was a school one. You helped her get into it but your hand did touch her breast, and when she gave you a look, you jumped in the bath to cool off, which Papi laid right on top of you on her back, causing you to chuckle. After giving a comparison to otters, Papi compared the two of you as siblings, and explained how there are only female harpies, and she never knew what having a brother was like. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI guess I don\u2019t mind being your big brother.\u201d</span> She then grabbed your hand putting it on her breast. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cLet\u2019s get closer as siblings. My heart jumped when you touched my chest, I want to feel that again.\u201d</span> she tried to kiss you but you resisted. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSiblings aren\u2019t like this!\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou\u2019re resisting me? Fine then, I\u2019ll have to use force!\u201d </span>Just then Cerea came in and shot arrows at Papi pinning her to the wall, but she didn\u2019t hurt her. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cUnbelievable. I've been tolerant because i believed you to be a child, but you\u2019re my age? I wont allow you to behave this way.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cNice shot\u2026\u201d</span> you said getting out of the bath. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cMaster, please get on my back.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh? Alright then.\u201d</span> Miia tried to stop all this but Cerea just trampled her. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cPapi should cool off, given some time.\u201d</span> She said as she sped up, which forced you to grab onto her breasts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take too long before the two of you ended up at the park when Centorea finally stopped running.<span class=\"cyellow\"> \u201cAre you alright, master?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. The wind from riding on your back dried off my clothes.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cReally? In that case, could you, let go, please?\u201d</span> You realized where your hands were and you let go. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cS-Sorry, it wasn\u2019t on purpose.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cN-No, it\u2019s fine. For one who serves you, it\u2019s not a serious problem.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cServes me? You\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</span> She then started to go on about how her people are proud warriors, which you can relate to in that sense. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBut this is Japan. I know centaur culture is important to you, but you could let your hair down a little.\u201d </span><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI could never.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou should take advantage of the Interspecies Exchange Bill. That\u2019s why you came here. Isn\u2019t there anything you want to do?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAnything I want to do?\u201d </span>She then looked at a couple for a moment. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cUm, I\u2026No, never mind.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cDon\u2019t be shy.\u201d </span><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cMy hand.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYour hand?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d hold my hand\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span><span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI\u2019ve only ever held swords and bows, so I thought\u2026I just thought that\u2019s what girls do in human society. There\u2019s no deeper meaning. No, as one who serves my master, that was an unbecoming outburst. Just pretend I never-\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cJust relax.\u201d</span> you said softly as you grasp her hand. The entire area was quiet. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cCerea?\u201d</span> You looked at her face and it was actually very cute. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cCerea?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cD-Don\u2019t look. Even I don\u2019t know what I look like right now.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI told you not to look!\u201d </span>Just then both of you were startled by Miia falling out of the sky, causing Cerea to pull you close. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat\u2019d you do that for, Papi?!\u201d </span><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYou told me to let you down.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to drop me!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhat are you two doing here? You said yourself that you\u2019re not allowed out alone!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine if no one finds out!\u201d</span> Miia\u2019s eyes widened seeing your face in her breasts. Cerea herself failed to notice that until now. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cCentorea!\u201d </span>As she tried to explain this, Miia grabbed you pulling you into her chest and started arguing with her, and then Cerea pulled you back, but then Papi got involved and you felt like you were in a tug of war. The three of them were just about to use force and Smith got out her gun to tranq them before it got out of hand. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHey that\u2019s enough!\u201d</span> But before you could stop them, the three tranq\u2019s meant for the girls hit you in the back. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOh, come ooooooon\u2026\u201d</span> you said before passing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the house you woke up woozy as hell. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWow, I cant believe I shot Darling-kun. They may have been tranquilizer darts, but I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re okay after getting hit by three</span>.\u201d <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWho taught you how to shoot?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI could get in trouble for this. Don\u2019t tell anyone okay?\u201d </span>she said with a wink. You were astounded by the woman. But then you quickly sat up. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhere are the girls? Normally they\u2019d come running.\u201d</span> She pointed them out as they were staring in. They apologized and said they would restrain themselves. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat are you talking about? Sometimes you do go too far, and it\u2019s not good to fight.\u201d </span>You stoop up but nearly fell. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDarling!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBut it\u2019s really Smith who\u2019s to blame here.\u201d</span> She spat out her coffee in surprise. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cProblems happen. Isn\u2019t learning to overcome them part of doing a homestay? And since this is a homestay, that makes us a family. So you don\u2019t need to hold yourselves back.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThat\u2019s perfect then!\u201d </span>You were confused but then Smith brought up that they were moving to change a few things in the Interspecies Exchange Bill, namely that marriage between humans and non-human species will be possible, as such, you were chosen as the experiment to this whole thing. Which Smith dropped on you before she left with Centorea\u2019s homestay paperwork. <span class=\"cblue\"><b>\u201cSAY WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!\u201d </b></span></span></div></div>",

Eventually, you were rescued after 8 long years have passed. By then, you had built up a reputation among both the warlord's soldiers and his enemies, known only as \"Aar libaax oo cad\", which was Somalian for \"The white lion\", due to your proficiency of dual-wielding a large serrated knife in each hand, delivering lethal strikes up-close with almost inhuman speed, just like the notorious feline of the African Savannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough your family was fortunate and relieved to see that you were still able to remember who they were, that moment of happiness didn't last very long when the Orcs violently slaughtered most of your family, despite you killing a few of these creatures with steak knives out of self-defense and lusting for vengeance. And this was before the Cultural Exchange Between Species Act was ever established.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you didn't come out of the tragedy....intact. Eventually, in retaliation for you killing some of their brethren, the Orcs broke the lower half of your legs, your right arm, and ripped out your right eye. This left you crippled for life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\nPresent Day<br>\r\nLocation: Tokyo, Japan<br>\r\nTime: 1:57 AM<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up with a cold sweat, heart pumping at an almost panicked rate before calming yourself down. Unable to return to sleep, you sat up in your bed, hearing the muffled mechanical sounds of your Cybernetic Enhancements. Although it did give you back the body parts that were painfully stripped from you by those damn Orcs, you could still feel the invisible pain from the limbs you lost, as you stood up and slowly walked toward the large pane of glass that led out toward the balcony. Nowadays, in place of your original body parts, your cybernetic enhancements had this intimidating look to their appearance. The legs and right arm looked as if they were based off of General Grievous from Star Wars, while your right eye looked straight out of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, your childhood friends, Cody Hollard, Mitch Stanic, Garrett Hendrickson, and the oldest of the bunch, Steve McCain, offered to have you stay with them in their spacious penthouse within Tokyo's Shinjuku Ward. After all, they heard what happened to your family and decided to give you a home. Standing up, you looked out toward the skyscrapers that lit up the night sky, as you began to ponder about what had occurred only yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you remembered, Cody and the tear of your friends managed to land you a job within the government-led police task force known as \"The Cultural Exchange Security Squad\". However, they also introduced you to your new *ahem* commanding officer, the woman known only as \"Ms. Smith\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mr. McCain and his associates have informed me about you.\" </span>A woman said to you, drinking what appears to be a cup of coffee. In appearance, she had silky jet black black hair that reached below her hips in the back, but extended to just above her collarbone at the front, along with a pair of brown eyes. Currently, she wore the attire of the typical government agent, sporting a white dress shirt with a black tie, a black blazer and matching professional business skirt, black pantyhose and heels. And to complete the government agent motif, the woman wore a pair of black sunglasses, which were framed at a slightly lower angle to allow one to look her in the eyes, all while she sat on a moving chair, crossing her right leg on top of her left. This woman was none other than Ms. Smith, Representative of the Cultural Exchange Security Squad, and the Liaison/Commander of M.O.N, Monster Ops: Neutralization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where she sat, Ms. Smith was currently facing you, as you sat on the L-Shaped couch, hunched slightly forward, arms propped on your thighs in a balancing position, looking back toward the female government agent with a serious but subtly angry look on your face, still feeling  this invisible pain from the cybernetic enhancements Steve and his corporation, McCain Cybernetics &amp; Robotics, have installed on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a moment of silence between the two of you, Ms. Smith broke the silence as she spoke toward you after taking another sip of her coffee and answered, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"I am deeply regretful about what happened to your family all those years ago, Mr. Xavier. My condolences.\"</span> <span class=\"chunter\">\"......I'm used to it. So.....what exactly did my friends told you, lady?\" </span>You asked coldly, as you slowly moved your head upward slightly to look at Ms. Smith, still sporting a serious look on your face. After all, you lost your family to a bunch of monstrous Orcs, along with being crippled by them in the process, so recovering from such a traumatic experience would take time to heal on it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you couldn't help but having a hunch that this Ms. Smith isn't just some pretty woman masquerading as an agent of the Japanese government, just as she set the cup of coffee gently onto the coffee table, then sat back into her original seating position, looking at you with a calm but no nonsense look in her eyes and said, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"A lot. Or to be more precise, more than enough intelligence to take interest in you, Dalton. My....superiors wanted more information on you for our dossier. And besides.....I am aware of your occupation as a child soldier, Aar libaax oo cad.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that infamous name the Somalians call you made you go from calm to violent in a heartbeat, lunging toward Ms. Smith, knocking the chair backwards in the process, causing your friends to jump back out of shock, as you held Ms. Smith in a vice-like grip with your right cybernetic arm, baring your sharpened teeth made from being filed by the warlord himself, making this inhuman snarling growl toward Ms. Smith, still remaining calm under the tense situation while you stared her down and violently growled, <span class=\"chunter\">\"How. Much. Do You Know? ANSWER ME!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\">\"All of it, Mr. Xavier. From when you were first kidnapped by the guerrilla fighters when you were only 9 years of age, to when you've been brought into their ranks, all the way up to you carving a bloodied path of carnage through Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and South Sudan. I must admit, you are a rather dangerous beast, having the militia forces in the Horn of Africa trembling with fear.\" </span>Ms. Smith answered, almost sounding if was impressed by your handiwork in Africa underneath that calm demeanor of hers, just you suddenly snapped at her and roared, <span class=\"chunter\">\"I never asked to become a goddamn bloodthirsty killer, bitch! Besides, how would you like it if you were taken as a kid by men who works for an African warlord who wants blood diamonds and loves torturing those who trespass on his turf in the most fucked up ways you can imagine!?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Take it easy, Dalton! She didn't mean to get you ticked off like that!\" </span>Cody said, trying his best to reason with you, despite your current mood at the moment, doing his to prevent you from bringing harm to Ms. Smith. From there, Steve sided with Cody on this matter and replied, <span class=\"cindigo\">\"With all due respect, Ms. Smith, you're not exactly helping with easing tensions between you and Dalton here. After all, he's basically been through Hell for a long time, and he's still recovering from the trauma involving the death of his family.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, your friends that you were seeing reason, but when they saw you raising your cybernetic right arm to deliver a Concrete-busting punch, Cody, Mitch, Steve, and Garrett yelled at you in unison and said, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Dalton NO!!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened so fast, as your four friends heard a very loud crunching noise, thinking you might've killed Ms. Smith out of anger. But instead, they saw that she was still alive and mostly in one piece, with the only thing that suffered the attack was the very chair Ms. Smith sat in, with your closed cybernetic hand just centimeters away from actually hitting Ms. Smith's head. From there, you slowly pulled your cybernetic arm out from the chair you damaged, flexing your mechanical fingers and thumb a little to see if there was any internal damage done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, shortly after you got up and walked toward the kitchen to grab a bottle of Sprite to drink, Steve went toward Ms. Smith and help her back onto her feet as he spoke toward her and apologized, <span class=\"cindigo\">\"Ms. Smith, I am so sorry for Dalton's behavior toward you. He isn't usually this violent.\"</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Although he spilled my coffee in his little violent outburst, I will make an exception for Mr. Xavier's violent antagonistic behavior. That is.....if he is able to fulfill a certain condition, of course.\" </span>Ms. Smith replied, as she dusted herself off a little, obviously unaffected by your enraged outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\"And what sort of condition do you have in mind?\"</span>Mitch asked, raising an eyebrow in confusion, as you listened in on the conversation while drinking Sprite. <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Well, as  Cultural Exchange Coordinator, I assign members of each extra-species to a Host Family, along with providing information and advice, supervising and support homestays and host families, you name it. All I am requesting is for Mr. Xavier here and his.....friends, to be the host family for a certain representative candidate for our Interspecies Homestay Program. Do this, and I will ensure Mr. Xavier will be hired as a member of the Cultural Exchange Security Squad. After all, it will help to improve his resentful attitude toward the other extra-species.\"</span> Ms. Smith answered, presenting the offer in full view, already aware of the potential of having a squad member with cybernetic enhancements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"I don't hate every extra-species, lady! Just those damn Orcs!\" </span>You snarled, lashing out at Ms. Smith for the misinterpretation of your resentment. From there, you vented out some of your anger when you violently slammed the door to your bedroom behind you, threatening to mercilessly rip the door hinges from the wall. Despite you leaving the room, Steve and your friends accepted Ms. Smith's arranged deal, while you sat there in your bedroom, venting out your inner rage somewhat in an effort to calm down.</span></div></div>",

Either way, you were definitely not going to be getting a good night's rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"*sigh* Sounds like I won't be getting any more sleep tonight.\" </span>You said to yourself, obviously disgruntled  by getting a lack of sleep from the construction work outside your room. Knowing that you weren't going to be sleeping soundly for the rest of the night, you went over to the lamp sitting on the nightstand, flicking the switch to shed some light through the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what caught you a little off-guard was the stack to reading material laying on the drawer nearby, causing you to raise your right eyebrow in both confusion and curiosity. Carefully, you slowly approached the stack of reading material, hearing the tapping sound of the curved talons on your cybernetic feet each time they made physical contact with the floor. After treading across the room, you reached the reading material, revealing to be a file of sorts and a large hardcover book underneath the file. However, you then noticed that there was a note placed on top of the file, as you peeled the note off to get a better look, reading it as it said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">Dalton,<br>\r\nWhile you were still sleeping, Ms. Smith gave us the documents related to the extra-species candidate who will be living here with us. Lucky for you, she's not an Orc. Me and the guys all signed our signatures, all you have to do is sign next to the X, and we'll turn the file in to Ms. Smith when she and the extra-species representative arrives here tomorrow. Also, we managed to buy you a book that has a lot of information on her race. You know, just in case you don't know how to care for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Mitch<br>\r\nP.S: If you hear some loud noises outside your door, that would be the construction crew readjusting our home for the homestay. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"*sigh* Too late for that, Mitch.\" </span>You thought to yourself shaking your head from left to right in a slightly disappointed manner, crushing the note into a ball of crumpled paper and tossing it into the trash bin. Fortunately, since you were calmed down from your violent outburst earlier, you're able to be reasoned with, as you stood there looking at the file and book stacked on the drawer. At first, you wanted to just ignore what the note said and just watch some TV in your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, looking at it now, you approached the stack, thinking to yourself and thought, <span class=\"chunter\">\".....Well, I guess.....it wouldn't hurt to find out who exactly is staying with us.\"</span> From there, you grabbed both the book and the file, carrying the reading materials with you toward the bed. Although you did turn on the TV, you changed channel until you hit Japan's Weather Channel, as you opened up the file to read through the information before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Name: Centaurea Shianus...... Monster Species: Centaur, Gender: Female...... Well, at least she isn't an Orc.\" </span>You thought, as both your left green eye and your cybernetic right eye thoroughly scanned through the intel printed onto the file's pages. Of course, you were already familiar with what a centaur actually was; a living being with the upper body of a human, but the lower body of a horse. After all, you've seen a small handful of centaurs while you were taking a stroll through the streets of Shinjuku a few days ago, only they were female centaurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Hair color: Golden blonde......Eye color: Blue.... Furcoat color: light chestnut..... I'm guessing they're talking about the color of the fur on her horse half.\" </span>You thought for a moment, just as you continued reading through the file's dossier, as you then read her measurements and thought, <span class=\"chunter\">\"Breasts: 103.....Hooooly Shit, she's gotta be an I-Cup with melons at that size!\"</span> Knocking yourself out of your testosterone-filled stupor, you punched yourself with your cybernetic right arm, despite bruising your jaw some, where you then spoke to yourself and growled, <span class=\"chunter\">\"Goddammit, Dalton! This isn't the time to act like a damn pervert!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after recovering from inflicting some self-harm onto yourself, you returned to reading through the dossier's info, reading to yourself and thought, <span class=\"chunter\">\"Waist: 61..... Hips: N/A(Immeasurable)........ Hmph, guessing that Smith's lackeys couldn't measure a centaur's hip size due to this girl's horse half.\"</span> Unfortunately, you were unable to get any information on Centaurea's weight and height, since the height info had 3 question marks instead of actual numbers, while the weight info only said \"Secret\". However, you pardoned the lack of info on her weight, since that's sort of inappropriate to find out from a woman, human or not. Though as for the height, you could guess that she's most likely taller than the average human male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the information about Centaurea's physiological attributes, you also found out that Centaurea Shianus' biological family happened to be one of the bravest and strongest family lines amongst the centaur race. <span class=\"chunter\">\"So, this Centaurea Shianus happens to be the latest in a long line of centaur badasses...... *chuckle* Well now, maybe having her here might not be a bad idea after all.\" </span>You thought to yourself, unable to stop yourself from crack a smirk of intrigue, a little....impressed by Cerea's family lineage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you inevitably signed the contract, you began to read through the book Mitch and the others had placed along with the file. Turns out it was a book about centaurs, from their culture, to the subspecies within their race, right down to their laws, basically everything about them.</span></div></div>",

You were currently sitting on the couch alongside Garrett and Mitch, while Steve and Cody were using a laptop on an island table in the kitchen, negotiating with the corporation's next project in cybernetics. After all, you were sort of a willing test subject to the cybernetic enhancements that you were now augmented with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough while Mitch and Garrett were playing in an online cooperative mode against other players in Grand Theft Auto Online via the giant Flatscreen TV, you sat there in the same position from yesterday, looking directly at your cybernetic right arm, slowly flexing your mechanical digits in a forward and backward motion, expanding and contracting, all while patiently waiting for Ms. Smith to come through those doors with the centauride known as \"Centaurea Shianus\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, even though you were given a good fistful of info about the female centaur, the dossier didn't include a photo of what she looks like in appearance. Your guess is that Ms. Smith wanted to make it a surprise. Since it was currently in the 60s today, you were wearing an olive-drab green T-shirt with a pair of modified stonewashed jeans due to the cybernetic enhancements on the lower half of your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, you didn't have to wait long, as the 5 of you distinctively heard the sound of a doorbell ringing, prompting Garrett and Mitch to forcefully resign from the online match, while Cody momentarily put a hold on the company's project. <span class=\"cgrey\">\"Sounds like our guests have arrived, boys.\"</span>Garrett said, just as he and Mitch were approaching the altered double doors, then proceeded to look through the door's peephole to make confirmation if it was Ms. Smith or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Garrett confirmed that it was them, you stood up from the couch, while Steve and Cody moved away from the island table and made themselves visible for the centauride that would inevitably pass through those doors. Then, both Garrett and Mitch opened each side of the double doors simultaneously, allowing both Ms. Smith and Centaurea to enter the McCain Penthouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you and your friends heard what sounded like the clopping noise of a horse's hooves tapping against the tiled floor, as Ms. Smith and Centaurea walked through the front door, giving you a good long look at what the female centaur's physical appearance. Turns out the dossier was right on the money about her physical attributes; sky blue eyes and golden blonde hair, which was very long in length and tied up into a high-ponytail. Her skin was a fair Caucasian hue, as her white/pale beige buttoned-up sleeveless shirt showed her exposed arms on display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the hair on her head, Centaurea's horse tail was a golden blonde as well, poking out from a tailhole in her black skirt, while the ebony skirt was large enough to extend halfway down the equine legs of her horse half, allowing her hooves and horse legs to be physically visible. She had what appeared to be a red handkerchief wrapped around her neck like a business suit tie, all while noticing that instead of having human ears, she had what appeared to be horse ears instead, as they were visible enough to see that those weren't fake ears. Finally, what caught your interest the most was what she had in her possession: A large, two-handed sword known as a Claymore, a notoriously lethal great-sword used in Scotland. You remember seeing this medieval weapon on Deadliest Warrior, witnessing how it was capable of multiple decapitations in one swing with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the book you read from earlier, female centaurs, while known for their beauty, were just as strong as their male counterparts, favoring technique and refined skills instead  of focusing on strength like male centaurs would. This meant that Centaurea could easily wield a Claymore with one hand instead of both hands. Overall, you were become a bit more intrigued by the female centaur, crossing your arms and showing a small smirk on your face and thought, <span class=\"chunter\">\"Well now, things just got a bit more interesting. I always wanted to see a Claymore up close.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you noticed that the Claymore that Centaurea was carrying with was sheathed for the time being. <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Greetings, masters. Thy name is Centaurea Shianus. 'Tis an honor to meet all of you.\"</span> She said, greeting you and your friends in a chivalrous manner, speaking in a somewhat archaic manner. <span class=\"corange\">\"Well, it's nice to meet you too, Centaurea. I'm Mitch, that's Garrett, Cody, Steve, and the guy over there with the robot arm and legs is Dalton.\" </span>Mitch replied, greeting the blonde centauride and introducing himself, the others, and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, just as the bellhop brought in what appears to be a case for a second sword, Centaurea calmly approached you, showing both her experience as a warrior at such a young age, along with showing her maturity almost like a badge of honor, despite her physical age. It wasn't until she stopped just 4 and a half feet away from where you currently stood, forcing you to look up to make eye contact with her and vice-versa, as she then spoke to you and said, <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"So, thou must be the one called Dalton Xavier. Ms. Smith explained to thee about your....troubled past. Thy deepest condolences for what thou have endured.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"I guess. Although I do appreciate your sympathy Centaurea, the stuff I've done in Africa isn't something to write home about.\" </span>You replied, losing the smirk on your face , still having your arms crossed. However, Centaurea quickly spoke to you and answered, <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Tis alright, thou can call me Cerea if you want.\"</span> Normally, you were calm but somewhat distant due to the traumatic experiences you have gone through. However, there was something.....comforting about Cerea, almost familiar. Either that, or your hormones were making you focus on her hefty I-Cup boobs, despite your right eye being cybernetic instead of organic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about an hour or two, Cerea sat there as she watched you play Bloodborne on the PlayStation 4. After all, while Mitch and Garrett preferred games like Grand Theft Auto that allows one to screw with the game's denizens, you preferred to play a video game that has an overwhelming difficulty but rewards you for the effort in defeating enemies without getting killed yourself such as Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you were fighting against one of the game's bosses, The Blood-Starved Beast,  you moved your character on-screen to quickly dodging it's charging attacks, where you staggered the grotesque creature with your character's firearm, then performed a Visceral Attack on it's head, inflicting a good chunk of damage on it. However, while you were fighting against the Blood-Starved Beast on-screen, Steve and the others handed the signed contract over to Ms. Smith, sealing the deal with Cerea's stay here. <span class=\"cbrown\">\"The Cultural Exchange Program appreciates your cooperation, Mr. McCain.\" </span>Ms. Smith answered, storing the signed document in a briefcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she turned to face you as you were halfway through the battle against the Blood-Starved Beast, despite that she was behind you currently, and said, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Oh! And before I forget, Mr. Xavier. We managed to induct you as a member of the Cultural Exchange Security Squad. However, I dislike being the bearer of bad news, but you will have to patiently wait for a month until we fully legitimately have you join the squad.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"What?!\" </span>You exclaimed, quickly turned around to face Ms. Smith, long enough for the Blood-Starved Beast to land that fatal blow toward your character on-screen, killing him as those infamous words appeared on-screen saying \"YOU DIED\", which was a notorious staple to the work of Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of the Souls franchise and Bloodborne. Quickly turning back around to face the screen, you saw what happened, causing you to instinctively yell, <span class=\"chunter\">\"NO!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from how you were reacting, Cerea could most likely tell that what just happened on-screen wasn't a good thing to you. Why, even Ms. Smith  was caught off-guard a little by your yell of frustration. From the perspective of your friends could already tell what was going to happen, as they spoke in unison and said, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Uh oh.\"</span> \"<span class=\"cbrown\">What do you mean 'uh oh'? It's just a game.\"</span> Ms. Smith, obviously underestimating the problem she unintentionally had created.</span></div></div>",

When your character gets killed by whatever you're fighting against, you lose all of the game's currency in the process, known as Blood Echoes.\"</span> Garrett explained, speaking after Mitch had spoke toward Ms. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"And judging from the way that Dalton is reacting, I'm guessing that he had a whole lot of Blood Echoes on him.\" </span>Cody answered, crossing his arms out of confirmation. <span class=\"chunter\">\"Smith: You've got 5 seconds to leave, so start.

So left with no other choice, she complied with your threat, and left the penthouse, briefcase in hand.

Besides, ever since your family members were murdered by a group of Orcs, your anger issues had become slightly more unstable, but not enough to make you a complete psychopath.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-------------------------------------------<br>\r\nPresent Day<br>\r\nLocation: Sakura Sakimasu Hotel Gym,<br>\r\nTokyo, Japan<br>\r\nTime: 2:31 PM<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the 6th floor, you were currently within the hotel's gymnasium, pushing yourself to the very limit, taking your anger out on multiple training dummies, using a hybrid mix between Thailand's Muay Thai and Somalia's own form of stickfighting known as Istunka. Normally, you would use a set of 14 inch serrated blades when fighting. But since you weren't exactly allowed to bring your blades down to the gym, you were left with no other choice but to use 14 inch metal rods, acting as substitutes for your weapons of choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to your Cybernetic Enhancements, you're able to use your mechanical talon-like feet as a second set of hands, grabbing a training dummy with inhuman speed with your talon-like feet while doing a backflip, tossing the training mannequins around like ragdolls. Although there might have been a few onlookers inside the gym who were impressed by your fighting prowess, a small handful of veteran martial could see the rage in your fighting style, displaying how brutal you possibly were when you're enraged, delivering attacks that would be very painful if the training dummies were actually living people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you were moving from mannequin to mannequin, delivering blow after blow upon the lifeless entities, you didn't notice that the Claymore-wielding centauride herself, Cerea, had entered the hotel gym, escorted by Steve along the way. After all, according to the laws of the Cultural Exchange Program Act, homestays are not allowed to roam outside the residence without being accompanied by a member of their assigned host family and their documented proof of homestay, unless said homestay carries an approved special exception permit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn laymen terms, Cerea wasn't allowed to leave the penthouse without either you, Cody, Mitch, Garrett, and/or Steve to accompany her. <span class=\"cindigo\">\"Well, there he is. Sorry you had to see Dalton lash out like he did a few hours ago, Cerea. He's been like this somewhat since his family were murdered by the Orcs.\" </span>Steve said to Cerea, being polite toward the female centaur, as he rubbed the back of his head a little from what happened earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Cerea turned herself around a little to directly face Steve and reassuringly replied, <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Tis no problem, master. Thy understand that master Dalton yields a dangerous flame within.\"</span> <span class=\"cindigo\">\"Look, I fully understand that your race's culture is important to you. But with all due respect, Cerea; just call me 'Steve-O'. The other guys do. After all, since you are a part of our family.\" </span>Steve answered, informing Cerea not to call him 'Master', along with showing he meant no disrespect toward centaur culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Oh, I almost forgot! Here, give this to Dalton. He needs to know that he needs this to prevent confusion with law enforcement.\"</span> Steve said, handing what appears to be an ID card as proof for being a host family member to Cerea, who took the ID card from Steve's hand and nodded in response. From there, Steve waved goodbye to the centauride, as he proceeded to leave the hotel gym and head back up to the penthouse, which left you with Cerea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the all-too-familiar sounds of a warrior honing his combat skills, Cerea approached you with a calmness in her stance, like she was very familiar with seeing and experiencing combat. However, you didn't become fully aware of the blonde centaur's presence until you heard the sounds of her hooves making contact with the floor with each step, making these loud clopping sounds against the floor's white tiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the realization that you had a visitor, you stood back upright on your cybernetic legs, turned right and took notice of Cerea standing only several feet away from where you're currently standing. From there, you spoke toward the centauride and said, <span class=\"chunter\">\"Don't tell me: You came down here to find me?\"</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\"Yes. Master Steve accompanied thee to find you, Master Dalton. Besides, thou were verily impressive when I was watching you home your skills.\" </span>Cerea answered, as she approached and sat down beside you, obviously taking a bit of interest in you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Thanks.... It's a result from my forced captivity in Africa when I was a kid. Nothing new to me.\" </span>You replied, almost unfazed from the traumatic experience of becoming a child soldier while you talked to Cerea about it a little.  You weren't completely sure why you're not going berserk yourself toward Cerea like you did with Ms. Smith. You thought that maybe it was because she seemed not so pushy, you don't know for sure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you took notice of Cerea's sitting location, you took a bottle of Sprite from the nearby vending machine, carrying it to a vacant  gym bench, sitting down and drank the cold tasty beverage. From there, you walked toward a nearby bench, sat yourself down to consume some of your drink. <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Forced.....captivity?\"</span>She asked, turning her head to face you, cocking an eyebrow out of confusion, almost as if this was sudden news to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until you realize why she said such a thing, as you quickly turned your head to face Cerea, having this slightly shocked look on your face and said, <span class=\"chunter\">\"Wait a minute, Smith....never really.....told you about what happened to me.....did she?\"</span> Cerea could do nothing but slowly shake her head from left to right in confirmation. In theory, your guess was that Ms. Smith didn't give Cerea a good enough explanation to your backstory, figuring that you might give the centauride the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after letting out a frustrated sigh from Smith's laziness to explain things a bit, you then spoke toward Cerea and answered, \"<span class=\"chunter\">Alright, Cerea......I'll give you the details. BUT! I warned you; it's not exactly.....pretty to hear. In other words, listen at your own risk.\"</span> <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"I understand.\" </span>Cerea replied, displaying how courageous she was when facing the truth, displaying her bravery like a badge of honor and bravery, you could even swear she had this fearless look in her eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she was obviously undeterred by your advanced warning, you moved both your left green eye and your cybernetic right eye, directly looking at Cerea. At first, you were a little hesitant yourself due to the traumatic experiences from being a child soldier in the Horn of Africa, since what you've experienced had taken a slight toll on you psychologically. So, after taking another short but rejuvenating drink from the bottle of Sprite in your left hand, you let out a long sigh before speaking toward the centauride and said, <span class=\"chunter\">\"Normally, I don't usually....confess about what happened to me all those years ago. But.....I'll make you as an exception, Cerea. *sigh* I....I was taken away from my family during a trip to Africa. I was only at the age of 9 when I was taken. The soldiers who took me from my family.....they were known  as 'Ciidamada ugaarsadaha'. It's Somali for 'The army of Hunters'.....and they called themselves by that name for a good reason.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Somali?\"</span> Cerea asked, still listening to what you were telling her, looking as if this was new to her. Becoming aware of the slight confusion from Cerea, you continued to speak toward the female centaur and explained, <span class=\"chunter\">\"It's basically the main language of the country with the same name, Somalia. It's located at the very tip of the Horn of Africa. From what I remember, Somalia's capital city is known only as 'Mogadishu'. For the rest of my childhood and most of my teenage years......I've only known war, growing up throughout the decades-long conflict known to history as the Somali Civil War. Growing up around this constant cycle of violence can take a toll on you, where every day felt like a fight for survival. There would've been a good chance I might have lost all forms of my sanity if I didn't come to bear with the truth: Even humans can become our own monsters.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her royal chivalrous bloodline, Cerea could see that you spared almost no detail with explaining your time in war-torn Africa, almost shocking her that you were forced to experience such nightmarish horrors, including being caught in the middle of the dreaded Somali Civil War, having no choice but to either grow up and survive or become a casualty of the war. However, as you continued to explain your story with such a grim and somber tone in your voice, Cerea couldn't help but feel somewhat.....sympathetic toward your plight, especially since had to learn how to kill a man at such a young age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, when it came to being immersed into the life of another warrior, Cerea would show respect for said warrior's combat prowess and martial skills. But no, that wasn't the case for you. After all, your rise as a deadly warrior was much darker and tragic than what a race of violent militaristic demihumans who've lived around the art of combat could even stomach in a normal combat situation. All the more reason for Cerea to feel genuinely sorry for what you were forced to endure, causing her centaur ears to bend at a slightly lower angle, showing her sympathy toward you on display as she said, <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"I am sorry, I.... I was not aware of your....tragic upbringing.\"</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But then, before you were able to say anything back toward Cerea, you heard the sound of an all too familiar yet mercilessly annoying male voice come out of nowhere as it said, \"Hey! Who the hell let this freak in here?!\" Hearing what was heard, you and Cerea turned around to see who it was. In appearance, the man looked to be in his mid to late 20s, sported black semi-spiky hair, had pale brown eyes, and bearing a scrawny physique. He was wearing gray cargo pants, boots, white sleeveless shirt and jacket belonging to one of Tokyo's notorious anti-extraspecies gangs, The Humanists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Tetsuo Fujiwara, lieutenant of The Humanists. What does that freaking asshole want this time?\"</span> You thought, looking at Tetsuo with an ire-filled glare, as you set your Sprite  down on a nearby table, stood upright, with obvious intent on giving Tetsuo a piece of your mind. However, just as you were circling around Cerea to approach the Humanist member, Tetsuo threw an empty beer bottle in the female centaur's direction, as the launched projectile missed Cerea by only a few centimeters, causing the empty glass bottle to shatter upon impact with the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this displaying of antagonistic superiority reminded you of the first few hellish weeks of being kept at the warlord's militia camp, where the older child soldiers would throw broken bottles at you to either strengthen your ferocity or to break you. That alone made you more hostile toward the almost anorexic gang lieutenant, as you approached Tetsuo, both hands clenching into fists. \"Stay out of this, tin man! This here's Humanist business!\" He said, as he noticed you approaching him, calling you by that infamous name you've gained ever since you received your cybernetic enhancements: tin man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as you were only a short few feet away from him, instinctively punched Tetsuo right in the face with your left hand, fracturing a of his teeth in the process. From there, shortly after he recovered from your left hook, Tetsuo wiped a bit of the blood leaking from his mouth, where he then proceeded his attempt to retaliate as he yelled, \"Why, you little...!\" Unfortunately for him, your reflexes were drastically sharper than his own, as you quickly used your cybernetic right arm to counter Tetsuo's fist, stopping it in it's tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you used your cybernetic arm and hand to squeeze tightly on the gang lieutenant's fist, causing Tetsuo to fall on his knees out of physical pain while he yelped, \"OW! OW! OW!\"  Normally when a fight would break out in the hotel gym, someone would try to stop the conflict. However, from what Cerea had observed with her own jade green eyes, she could obviously see that nobody was attempting to stop you from grinding the bones in the man's fist into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"If there's one thing I hate as much as those damn Orcs, it's people. Like. YOU.\"</span> You snarled, showing your rage toward Tetsuo and the faction he belongs to, nostrils flaring, sharpened teeth exposed, causing you to squeeze a little tighter on Tetsuo's fist, threatening to fracture the lieutenant's bones in his hand. From there, you looked at him right in the eyes, continuing to speak and said, <span class=\"chunter\">\"People who they're the superior ones. People who think they're the apex of the human race. But you and the douchebags you call your friends have forgotten one important thing: Even humans can become their own monsters.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"So you better damn listen, Tetsuo! The female centaur in here with us, she's with me. And if EVER see you, your comrades, or both coming anywhere near her...\" </span>You growled, leaning your head forward to get right in Tetsuo's face, showing just how serious you were, intimidating the gang lieutenant in the process. From there, you continued what you were saying and snarled, <span class=\"chunter\">\"....I'll make you and your merry band of racists pay with your lives. UNDERSTOOD!?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that he could do in response was rapidly nod yes out of fear and being intimidated by you, so you've looked at Tetsuo with a fearsome look in your eyes and answered, <span class=\"chunter\">\"Good. Now get out of my sight, and never come back here again. NOW!!!\"</span> Hearing you roar at such a volume was more than enough to send the frightened Tetsuo fleeing, as you let go of his hand, allowing him to run out the door and as far as his legs could carry him, desperate to get some space between you and him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After around a minute or two had passed since Tetsuo had bolted out of the hotel gym (and hopefully out of the building as well), you were able to calm down from that violent outburst of yours toward the cowardly Humanist lieutenant, inhaling and exhaling several deep breaths. From there, you suddenly heard the sound of horse hooves slowly clopping against the floor tiles, as you turned around somewhat to see a calm but reasonably concerned Cerea approach you, hands in front of her, touching her abdomen a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Master, are you unharmed?\" </span>She asked, stopping only a few feet away from you, obviously aware of how hostile you were toward Tetsuo, along with checking to see if you were alright. In response, you tilted your head slightly upward to speak to her, rubbing the back of your head with your left human hand, scratching it a little, and answered, <span class=\"chunter\">\"*sigh*....I'm fine, Cerea. It....This isn't exactly what I would call a good day for me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Let's...*frustrated sigh* let's just head back upstairs. Besides, I think I've already unintentionally caused enough public disorder for one day.\" </span>You said, turning around to walk out the gymnasium exit, allowing those who were participating in exercising to resume their daily/weekly workout uninterrupted. Cerea soon followed suit, walking behind you until she was slowly trotting beside you, as you both reached the 6th floor elevator lobby. Then, you pressed the Up button to have the elevator ascend to the upper floors. And after waiting for almost 20 minutes, you both saw the elevator doors open, where you entered the elevator, with the female centaur proceeding inside with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the elevator doors when you pressed on the button that leads to the 24th floor, Cerea made an obvious attempt to pass the time, as she spoke toward you and asked, <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"So....who was he? It seems that you and this Tetsuo whoreson have a hateful rivalry towards one another.\"</span> Hearing Cerea call Tetsuo a 'whoreson' obviously amused you, as you displayed a smirk, subtly chuckling in unison for a second or two, figuring that the word itself seemed very fitting for a man like Tetsuo and the group he's affiliated with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, having a feeling that Cerea wasn't exactly going to let this slide, you figured that you might as well give the centauride an explanation, so you crossed your arms and explained, <span class=\"chunter\">\"His name is Tetsuo Fujiwara. As for who he is, Cerea; that scumbag happens to be a lieutenant of the Humanists.\"</span> <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"And what are these....Humanists?\" </span>Cerea asked, cocking an eyebrow a little toward you, obviously she hasn't heard of the Humanists before until now. Despite her lack of knowledge of the group, you continued to explain to the female centaur and answered, <span class=\"chunter\">\"....They're scum. A gang of extremists who believe in keeping their territories pure. Out of all the racism toward your kind and the other extra-species, these bastards are the ones who have done the most damage, putting more gasoline on that damn bonfire of theirs.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"*sigh* My apologies, Master. It seems that thy arrival has burdened you and your friends.\"</span> Cerea apologized, her voice sounding somewhat somber in a sense, feeling like she unintentionally brought trouble along. However, from seeing the almost depressed look on her face, you couldn't help but feel....sympathetic toward this plight. In an effort to at least brighten her mood, you spoke toward Cerea and replied, <span class=\"chunter\">\".....To tell you the truth, Cerea.....the Humanists don't just hate Centaurs and other extra-species, they....they also hate people who happen to be cybernetic....like me.\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the words you said obviously knocked her out of her depressed stupor, coming to a realization, as she turned her head to face you and asked, <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"So...thou are accustomed to their hostility?\"</span> <span class=\"chunter\">\"In a way, yeah. The Humanists happen to be a gang of purists, which means they hate anyone who isn't human or fully human. Hmph, too bad for them they didn't know I was a cold-blooded killer. Otherwise, they would not have so many of their members injured.\"</span> You answered, Cerea could tell that you obviously had come to terms with the realization that you were capable of killing people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Overall, we're basically in the same boat, Cerea.\"</span> You replied, just as you both felt the elevator stop moving, where the doors opened to the 24th floor, where the McCain Penthouse was located on. Shortly after you both stepped out of the elevator, you turned right and slowly approached the double doors leading into the penthouse, where you looked at Cerea and said, <span class=\"chunter\">\"And Cerea....\"</span> <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Yes?\" </span>She asked, turning her head to face you, curious about what you're going to say. From there, you answered, <span class=\"chunter\">\"...Don't call me Master.\"</span></span></div></div>",

You took it  then you moved to Tokyo with you'r family then at age of 21 \"it happened\" you'r family (minus your little sister of 6 years) had come for a tour which you would lead(you'd seen a lot more recently with the Interspecies Exchange Bill being passed since Vermehren firmly supported it) but during the tour the building was attacked by a Human superiority group, you hide the tour group inside your shuttered off office, you felt like you were back in warzone and you'r security forces were losing ground fast you made the choice to go back escort the tour group out of the building but as you were pass a Military tech research lab you got rocked by a explosion from the next room which tossed you thru the reinforced bullet proof glass of the Mil tech lab then you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\nCurrent Day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTokyo Japan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5:30 am<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to wake from that stupid buzzing from the alarm <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right time to get up\" you say getting up and look at yourself in a standing mirror examining you'r Augs while moving them \"Don't seem stiff.Well at least I don't have to deal with that anymore\" then you hear a knock at the door \"Alright lets see who that is\" you turn on Smart Vision to see thru the house and door. You see.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A clan that was founded in the beginnings of the Edo Era in 1603 an whose sole dedication was to protect the world, sometimes in sight and sometimes from the shadows, and has done so through out the centuries. However, 13 years ago, when you were on your fifth birthday, the clan's village was invaded by a very powerful demoness named Akuha Bloodriver, her generals, Naraku (Inuyasha), Makoto Shishio (Rurouni Kenshin), Sailor Galaxia (Sailor Moon), Boa Hancock (One Piece), Caesar Clown (One Piece), Akua Shuzen (Rosario+Vampire), Seta Sojiro (Rurouni Kenshin), Camula (Yu-Gi-Oh! GX), Sartorius (Yu-Gi-Oh! GX) and Paradox (Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie that features Yugi, Jaden and Yusei) and their army of demons and monsters. They killed almost everyone. With you being the only survivor. And you only survived, because Bloodriver thought it would be amusing to see you struggle to survive alone in the world. However, what they didn't know, was that you were never alone. For, ever since you were born, you were able to see and communicate with the spirits of the Duel Monsters. You had a bond with all creatures on the village's Zen Garden. But there was five creatures with whom you shared an even deeper bond, as they were there, besides your mother the day you were born. Those creatures were Blue-Eyes White Dragon, Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Stardust Dragon, Carbuncle Ruby and Dark Magician Girl. Also, while the village was destroyed, the underground vault of the village had somehow remained intact. Thus you were well off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seiryu were a clan of powerful warriors and magicians. Many times they aided the Regents of Japan in battle and had supported them when needed. Some members of the Seiryu were known and recognized as some of the greatest warriors and magicians of all Japan. And it was considered an honor to be trained by one of them. So great was their reputation. However, the Seiryu didn't answered anyone. No. For them to fight for someone, that someone had to earn their respect. For the Seiryu took principles and honor very seriously. And so, in the times they were summoned, they answered to the Regents ONLY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance, If someone like, say, a snobby noble, decided they wanted to command the Seiryu or drive them around, they would soon find out that they were biting more than they could chew. The Seiryu wouldn't harm them. No. Instead, they simply let the nobbles do whatever they wanted to and ignored them. After they tired, they would give all and every bribe or monetary gift the nobbles had tried to buy them with to the Regents. The Seiryu made a point to keep their motto. Which was, \"Power is not for oneself. It's for the others. It is to be used to the good of everyone. Not for personal gains. It is to be used to protect the innocents. Not to judge and punish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they used their power and wealth to help and protect the less fortunate. Many books and poems were written in their honor, narrating their stories and their deeds. However, if one were to search for history records and other documents about them or tried to find their village, they would find nothing. That would be so because The Seiryu Clan had requested the regents that, if something were to happen to them, that every document about them should be erased. They asked this because evil doers or simply ambitious beings could try to use the contents and information in the documents to cause harm to the people. And the Seiryu would rather be forgotten than allow such tragedies to happen. And so, the Seiryu and the Regents had divided all the knowledge they had in books and other documents in half. Each side had kept one half and decided to place a special spell that was linked to every Seiryu that already existed and to every newborn. That is, so long as the regents knew of their existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect the spell would have, was that if the Seiryu ceased to exist, all and every document related to the Seiryu would automatically be destroyed. However, in the end, and unbeknownst to the regents, only half of the documents were destroyed. Because, while the regents spell wasn't linked to Leon, the clan's spell was. Thus, since there still was a Seiryu breathing, the documents in the clan's vaults and library remained unscathed. However, since the regents at that time didn't knew about that, they thought that the Seiryu clan no longer existed. It was indeed a very dark, tragic and sad day in the history of Japan when the land lost the Seiryu clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon's existence was kept a secret, even from the regents, not only because of the Duel Monsters bonded to him, but also because of the great power he possessed. A power so great, that in order for you to survive, they had to place 7 Seals on your body as a baby. The Seiryu believed that each and every person was guarded by a Constellation. However, unlike most people, Leon was born in an extremely rare alignment of the Pegasus, Dragon, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Pisces and Scorpion constellations during a Blue Moon. The alignment of 6 constellation happened only every five thousand years and always with different constellations. Due to you having so many guardian constellations, your armor was a mix of all six.</span></div></div>",

In 2012, the government revealed the existence of monsters, or Sub-Species, as they're called, to the world. At first, it was expected that people wouldn't agree with that. That there would be conflict and fighting. However, none of that happened.In fact, humans actually welcomed them, despite them ranging from several different species. The government held a meeting at the UNO's (United Nations Organization) headquarters and an agreement was reached. It was named I.E.B (Interspecies Exchange Bill). With it, humans were allowed to take it monster girls into their homes and serve as their host families. However, in order to avoid conflict and abuse from either side, several rules were implemented. Some where more enforced than others. But there were three that were always strongly enforced. And violating any of them would bring severe consequences. Those three most important rules were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>\"A monster cannot go outside without at least one member of their host family. Failure to comply may result in deportation\".</i><br>\r\n-<i>\"Monsters cannot harm humans and humans cannot harm monsters. Failure to comply will result in deportation and will also result in prison of the offender\".</i> Which was good. Because, while most accepted and welcomed these new, mysterious beings, there were others that despised them for being different and wanted them gone.<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n-<i>\"Humans and members of the sub-species cannot commit consummate a sexual act unless they are married. Violation of this rule will result in prison to the offender(s) and deportation of the sub-species member(s)\"</i>. This last one ensured that nor humans or sub-species abused sexually of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou currently lived in a two stories house that counted with a single bedroom, a suite, a social bathroom, a small library, a living room, a kitchen, a larger than normal service area and a guest room. While you were well off, you preferred to keep your home a simple one. Today, a saturday, you woke up and did your morning routine, which consisted in bathing, brushing your teeth, dressing yourself and fixing breakfast. Since that day was sunny, you decided to drive around on your bike and run some errands while you're at it. You grabbed your keys and your helmet and went to the garage. Once there, you took your bike outside and made sure to lock your home. This was a peaceful neighborhood. But it was always better to prevent than to repent. You then got on your bike and drove of to the market to buy some groceries. On the way there, you stopped at a fruit and vegetables store that, while it was small and didn't have that much variety of products, you had come to learn that the owners, an adult man and his teenager daughter, always kept them fresh and clean. You got off your bike and entered the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Oh! Ohay\u00f5, Leon-kun! Came to do some shopping? Or... Maybe you have come for my little Konata? *wink*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a little at that. Mr. Izumi was always trying to hook you and his daughter, Konata, together. In the 6 years that have passed since you've known them, you've learned that Mr. Izumi is perverted lolicon otaku. Konata was an otaku herself and tended to compare daily situations to things form Anime and games. You always were welcomed here. Especially because you had helped Mr. Izumi in raising Konata. Thus, Konata saw you as an older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Ohay\u00f5, Mr. Izumi. And I've come to buy some fruits and vegetables.\"</span>, you said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, my Konata has two fruits that are quite fresh, you know~?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made you blush again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"*Ahem!* Oto-san. I think you're making Leon uncomfortable. By the way, ohay\u00f5, Leon-nii.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Ohay\u00f5, Konata-san. And don't worry. I've long grown used to Oji-san's delusions and perverted thoughts and comments.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Hey!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Be quiet, Oto-san. You know it's true!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, yeah! But no need to rub it in the face!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Anyway, what will it be today, Leon-nii?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Two lettuces, 5 tomatoes, 4 carrots, a pot of oregano, four apples, two tangerines, two kiwis and a tray of strawberries please.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Okie dokie lokie!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonata went to pick things up quickly and, within 5 minutes, she had everything at the counter, ready for you to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Arigat\u00f5, Kona-chan.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"No problem Leon-nii.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid and, once that was done, you came out of the store, after saying good bye, got on your bike and went to get some meat at the supermarket. After that, you went home. When you arrived, you parked your bike and got out of the garage. As you were nearing the door, you heard an uncommon sound. It sounded like, galloping. Then you heard a shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Look out!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see who had shouted, only to have your face covered in two soft mounds of flesh as you and the mysterious female rolled in the ground until you both hit a wall, with you ending on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Owww.\"</span>, she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get up, only to accidentally place your hand on something soft, big and firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Aah~\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes to see that you had grabbed one of her tits. She looked at you and, when she saw how you were grabbing her left breast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"G-get off me!\"</span>, she said, while getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"S-sorry!\"</span>, you said, whit your face as red as a strawberry. <span class=\"cred\">\"Are you alright?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Y-yes, I believe so.\"</span>, her face was quite red too. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Thank you. And I apologize for running into you like that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"No need to worry. I just hope the things I bought survived.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you went to your original starting point, and saw that most of the groceries were either, inedible or smashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"S-sorry.\"</span>, she said with her head lowered in shame. She was utterly embarrassed! Her first encounter with a human and she already had blundered! <span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"*How unfit of my kind!*\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure she had angered this human and that he was going to report her to the police! Then she would be arrested or deported! And her honor would be forever tarnished! And she would never get to meet her master! She was surprised when she felt a gentle hand on her right shoulder. She opened her eyes and saw that the young man was giving her a warm smile and his crimson eyes were gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she heard right? This, admittedly handsome, young man had forgiven her so easily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"A-arigat\u00f5.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"No problem.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, for the first time, you took a good look at your new acquaintance. She was a beautiful and tall centauress. She had long shoulder length blonde hair tied in a ponytail. Her horse half had a beautiful light brown coat and a blonde tail and she had what had to be the biggest pair of breasts you had ever seen. She then noticed you were staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"W-what is it? D-does it frightens you that I'm a centauress?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook you head. <span class=\"cred\">\"No. Not at all. Rather, I think both, your human half and your equine half are beautiful.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made her blush like a tomato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"ctan\">\"*He thinks I'm beautiful on both halves?!*\"</span></i> She was glad that, although her first human encounter was terrible, she was lucky that it was with a kind and understanding young man. She found herself wishing that this human, this young man, was her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a black van appeared seemingly out on no where! It stopped right in front of you. Out of it came several men with weapons ready to be fired and, after they had come out, a woman in a black business suit with brown stockings and black shades. She had long black hair that reached just below her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"We finally found you, Centorea Shianus-san.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Ms. Smith.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Why did you run? We were going to-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I know. But, us, centaurs, prefer to find our masters on our own.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I know. But the law says-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I know what the law says.\"</span>, Centorea said, with a stern and annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"*sigh* And you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Hm?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Would you happen to be Leon Midnight?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Who would like to know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Ah, right. I didn't introduced myself. I'm Ms. Smith. I'm the coordinator of the I.E.B. You were selected to be host family to a sub-species member.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Oh? I see. Pleased to meet you Smith-san. Yes. I am Leon Midnight. Now, who is it that I will be hot family to?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Right. Uh... Who was it?\"</span>, she asked to someone inside the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"A bit irresponsible and unreliable, isn't she?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"*sigh* I've come to learn that the hard way.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Alright. Here it is. Now let's see here... Well! Isn't this fortunate?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Huh?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Eh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"According to the information I have, Leon Midnight is to be the host family of Centorea \"Cerea\" Shianus. Seems like we ended in the right place after all! Is this alright with you both?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Sure. I have no problem with it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"And you, Centorea-san?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. Her wish had come true after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I accept as well!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you signed some papers with Ms. Smith, you and your new friend Centorea, or Cerea, as she asked you to call her, entered your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(continued...)</span></div></div>",

She did so and, while your house was of a moderate size, the rooms, furniture and facilities were too small for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"L-Leon-kun?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Please, just Leon will do.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"O-okay Leon.\"</span>, she said, a bit shy.<span class=\"ctan\">\"Um, I do not wish to bother you but-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"It's okay Cerea-san. I can see the issue. Don't worry. I'll have some workers do some reforms and make the house suitable for the both of us.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I see. But, please don't add the \"san\" to my name, alright? If I am to call your name without honorifics, I would like it if you did the same.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled warmly at her, which, although she didn't quite understood why, made her feel as if her heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Fair enough. Anyway, since the workers are going to be working, I think I could go and get some groceries. Would you like to come with me?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Yes! If it's not too much trouble I would like to help reposing what I ruined. It's the least I could do!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Well, I already told you not to worry about it. All right then. Wait for me outside please. I'll make the call and I'll meet you outside in a few minutes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Very well.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Quite formal aren't you?\"</span>, you said with a raised eyebrow. <span class=\"cred\">\"Is that a common trait among Centaurs?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Yes. We are taught to be formal since foalhood. And that is because we are a noble race from England that descends from the knights of old!\"</span>, she declared with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Hmmm... Interesting. Once we get back, I would like to hear more about that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTough she simply smiled and nodded on the outside, Cerea squealed internally. Glad that her new friend, and possibly her master, was interested in her people's history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"But, in echange, I would like to know about you more as well.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Alright then. It's settled.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerea then went outside while you called for the workers. After a few moments, she heard the garage door open and saw you come out with your bike. When you looked at her, she was looking at your bike and was with her jaw on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Do you like it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"W-what is that... thing?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"This? It's called a motorcycle. Commonly called \"Bike\". I take it you never saw one before?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerea shook her head. And, as she saw you mount the \"Bike\", she felt, strangely, angry and, slightly jealous. <span class=\"ctan\">\"*Why am I feeling this way? He's not my master. At least, not yet. And yet, seeing him mount that, that, metallic beast makes me feel as if I should be in it's place. As if he should be mounting <i>me</i> instead of that <i>thing</i>.*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of Cerea's distress, you started your bike's engine, put your helmet on and gided your bike to line it up with Cerea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Ready to go?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerea merely nodded with what seemed to be a forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Are you alright Cerea?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Yes! Yes. Don't worry about me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Well, if your sure...okay. Let's go then.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you could depart, a total of four black utilitarian vans showed up. From out of them, came several men in worker's clothes, as well as your coordinator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Hello again Leon-kun, Centorea-san.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Hello Smith-san.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"What is the meaning of this?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Well, we knew your house wasn't fit for a centaur. And our Architecture and Construction branch intercepted your request for workers. So, these men and women are here to make sure the house is a comfortable place for the both of you! Now, any specifications you would like to make before they begin?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Cerea sweatdroped. It seemed that Ms. Smith could be a responsible woman, when she wanted to be so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Well, not really. Just make it so it remains the same style. A mix of modern and traditional Japan. Although I do want for you to leave the house's outline as it is. Meaning that each room must remain where it already is. Also, please refrain from going into the basement and the training room. The basement because it has things meant for me and for those whom I choose to share them with. And the training room, because it is very dangerous and it's programmed to launch attacks at any stranger that enters it unauthorized.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I see. But we're going to-\"</span>, you interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I know you intend to cut the house's power. But the training room has a separate energy source that is within it. So, please, for your own safety, do not go there.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Very well. Alright people! Get to work!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the workers began breaking parts of your house and reforming others. Following your instructions and leaving the basement and the training room alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Well then, shall we go?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Eh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"What do you mean \"we\" as in, including yourself?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"You're going to buy groceries no?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"How do you know that?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Please. Don't underestimate our intelligence networks. Although I just assumed you were going to buy things because of the groceries I saw on the floor before.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, both, you and Cerea sweatdroped. Only this time, you also sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Also, there are somethings I wish to discuss with you, Leon-kun.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Oh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Besides\"</span>, she said, as she got close enough to you that you were almost within kissing range. Much to Cerea's discomfort and chagrin.<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I want to make sure that not you nor Cerea-san do any...improper things, if you know what I mean. *wink*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth, you and Cerea's faces became tomato red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Just what are you thinking you twisted and perverted woman?!\"</span>, said Cerea completely flushed and with her eyes looking like spirals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"That's right! Even if Cerea and I were dating, which we are not, there's no way we would do that yet!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerea's ears perked at that. She wasn't sure what to make of your statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Oh? Is that so? Why? Don't you think she's beautiful?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Of course she's beautiful! And I mean all of her!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused Cerea to blush further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Heh? Then why-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"One, because I'm fully aware of the laws of the I.E.B! Which states that a human and a member of the sub-species can not commit sexual acts unless they are married. And two, I would never force myself on her! I would only do this kind of things with her if she was willing to do so!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth, Smith-san and Cerea smiled at you. Smith-san was glad that they had picked the right guy to be host family for Centorea. And Cerea was happy that you would think so much of her and that you cared so much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"*I have decided! He's my master! I can't possibly have anyone else as my master!*\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmith-san then straightened herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I'm glad to hear that. Anyway, shall we get going?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both nodded. Then, Smith-san got into one of the vans and the three of you departed to the market.</span></div></div>",

He stands about an average height of 5' 6\", have a slim build weighing in around 173lbs, and have nice decently cut short brown hair. His is around twenty years old and is now attending college for a degree involving cyber security and computer sciences. Most of his classes are online, which means he stay home a lot. He lives alone, and has lived alone for about the first year of the college semester. However, now everything had changed. Akira looked for some company, but not just normal company; he wanted his life to be a bit more interesting. When the Interspecies Exchange Bill was passed, he knew exactly that he had found it. After the Exchange Officer inspected the home, and with slight reconstruction, the young boy was waiting. Akira was slightly excited, constantly having to adjust his glasses to prevent them from falling off. He wondered what monster was coming. The only thing he knew was that she was originally working for Monster Ops: Neutralization, or M.O.N. for short. So that meant she had first hand training on how to handle some situations. He saw the car pull up, gently holding in his excitement. Once the door opened, however, the excitement turned to surprise. Out stepped this massive monster girl! She must had been over two feet higher than him! She had nicely tanned skin, long flowing hair, and a red horn growing out from the top of her skull. However, the horn was not the takeaway for the boy. Two massive breasts hung at the monster's girl's chest, and judging on how she walked, they were full of bounce. Just watching made Akira blush slightly. Now he knew why his doorframes were built higher. She approached him with a gentle smile and wave as she tugged her suitcase behind her, \"Hi! My name is Tionishia! But my friends call me Tio!\" She bowed, giving Akira a full landscape view of her massive mammaries. \"Its nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira blushed as he tried not to stare, \"L-Likewise...\" he rubbed his head in slight embarrassment. \"So uh...can I...give you the tour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please!\" She quickly grabbed the small human and pulled him into the home in one full motion. The car driver chuckled before she went back inside and pulled off. Akira's home was nothing too special. It was originally built with two floors and additional bedrooms since it was originally built for more than one. He got a good deal since he had a friend in the marketing of this neighborhood. The boy showed Tio the kitchen, living room, and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I believe this is your room\" he spoke as he opened a large door on the ground floor. Tio walked in very excited, seeing everything her size was very nice. Akira had to marvel at the size of everything; it made him feel like he was a little kid. \"So, once you're all settled in I can get dinner started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait!\" She grabbed his hand and pulled him back, making him bump into her but not moving an inch. \"You never told me your name\" the oni asked as she lifted him to her face by his one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira did his best to smile aside from the pain from her grip. \"I-Its...Akira...Akira Sakka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was suddenly consumed by her twin mountains in a tight hug. \"Thank you so very much for letting me stay here! I promise I will be the best thing you ever asked for!\" The boy's face became bright red, and stayed bright red even after the hug ended and he left her room. What did he sign up for? That remains to be seen.</span></div></div>",

He too was a meat lover, and he always bought more for later, so cooking for two wasn't a problem at all. However, cooking for someone like Tio would be trouble. She was far larger than him, so he had no idea how much to really prepare. \"Tio?\" he asked, \"How hungry are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you make is good!\" he hears her shout. He shrugged and then attempted to guess. After about twenty minutes, the meal was prepared. Two bowls, one larger than the other, or delicious pork ramen was made with additional sides of various foods. \"Tio, dinner's ready!\" He sat down as his new friend came out. She smelled the air with a delighted smile, quickly taking her seat and began to eat. \"I hope I made enough for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke with her mouth full, unable to be properly heard. But he assumed she said something along the lines of \"This is fine.\" Aside from the sounds of chewing, the meal went quietly. Tio finished her larger bowl before Akira even ate half of his. Eating some of the sides, the gentle giant smiled, \"So Akira, tell me about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he looked up from his food. \"Well...what do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" she thought it over cutely. \"What are you doing? Any jobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm in college right now\" he smiled back. \"I'm working with computers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she smiled, \"So you're really smart.\" Akira blushed at that remark; even if it was kind of stereotyping. \"But if you're in college, how do you pay for everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also do repairs and help run some business's stocks. Its keeps a fair amount of money in my account.\" The ogre smiled to this. I cannot believe how cute she was. She was so patient too. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a member of M.O.N. I...well I forget what it stands for.\" Again, she was too cute to be displeased at. \"I am usually the escort or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of how big you are?\" That comment appeared to have set something off, because she gasped and huffed at Akira. Before the human could ask, she got up and walked back to her room; leaving the human confused. A door slam was heard to signify her annoyance. Akira sighed as he sat up and started to clean off the table. Obviously he said something wrong, the human tried to think of what he said, but could not think of what he exactly said to her. But he did know that he needed to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later he approached her door, gently knocking on it. The door opened and Tio peered out. \"Yes?\" she replied with a slight tinge of annoyance in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" he told her, \"I'm sorry for what I said.\" He lifted up something for her, \"And I got you t-\" The door was whisked open with such a strong force Akira was almost sent forward. He had a decent sized piece of chocolate cake, leftover from a party he attended a while ago. Tio grabbed the plate and ate the piece in one large bite. Chocolate smeared all over her face and some landed on her cleavage uncovered by her clothing. \"So...\" Akira spoke, \"Is that apology accepted? Or is it a-\" He was taken into another hug, being smothered once again. He REALLY needed to get used to this.</span></div></div>",

You wore a white shirt and blue jeans along with a pair of red glasses and black sneakers. You were already a senior and on the verge of graduating number one in your class and today was a leisure day for you. However, it wasn't one you were spending alone...even though it felt like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all began a few months ago when an Interspecies Exchange officer came to your door with an offer you couldn't refuse. She said that you'd been selected as the host family for a Monoeye named Manako. Apparently, she'd become fascinated with the human world and was able to take a leave of absence from her work in  Monster Ops: Neutralization, or M.O.N. for short, to attend the Inetrspecies Exchange as a representative of her people. You'd long since been fascinated with monsters, so of course you accepted; even though the woman who gave you her threatened to jail you if you harmed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were walking in a park with her only...she was very far behind. Manako had short purple hair and one eye in the center of her forehead with a blue iris. She wore a blue sunhat with a pink rose in it, a light blue sweater, a white blouse, a knee-length blue skirt and white shoes. She was supposed to remain with you at all times, but she was too nervous to even come within a few feet of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Manako?\" you asked hesitantly, which made Manako freak out and fall down in shock. You hurriedly ran to her side and held her in you arms. \"Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManako opened her eye and blushed profusely when she noticed you staring. At first, she thought that you were freaked out by her eye, but she noticed that you weren't. She then blushed even more to the point that steam was coming out of her ears. Unfortunately, this made her remind herself of something she'd neglected to take care of before they went out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Aito?\" Manako asked nervously. \"What is it?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\"</span></div></div>",

She then jammed both hands into her crotch and appeared to be on the verge of crying. \"I...I...need to pee.\" Manako softly whispered. You gasped in shock, which only made Manako feel more embarrassed. \"Can you hold it?\" you asked. Manako promptly shook her head side-to-side. \"I drank too much dandelion tea before we left the house. It's going to come out!\" Manako squealed desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you stood up and offered your hand to her. \"Well, then...let's go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManako looked at you in confusion. \"Go where?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the bathroom. I'll help you.\" you retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-Help me?!\" Manako asked incredulously as she briefly experienced a fantasy of you pulling her panties down while she was on the toilet and watching her pee before you kissed her. Manako blushed profusely at the idea and looked on the verge of fainting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH! NO! NO! NO!\" Manako yelled as steam came out of her ears and her eye became swirly. \"I can't let you see me like that!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are talking about?\" you asked innocently. \"I was just going to get you to the bathroom before you pissed yourself. Jeez.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManako stared at you in confusion before she erupted into uncomfortable laughter. \"Oh, of course! That's okay then, Aito.\" Manako said unconvincingly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you promptly took her hand and walked with her to the bathroom, unaware that her blush was intensifying. However, it wasn't out of the fact that her bladder felt ready to burst, but that she was so close to you. Despite that, she used her free hand to keep the flood in and clicked her knees together in desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached the bathroom...</span></div></div>",

You knew that the Interspecies Exchange Bill forbade you to engage in any...physical activities with her, otherwise you'd be jailed and she'd be deported. However, that didn't mean that you couldn't like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you two, you heard a toilet flush and out came a human woman with white skin, blond hair, and green eyes. She wore a black businesswoman's suit with matching heels and started to laugh at you two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I've never seen a cyclops freak before!

Couldn't get someone with two eyes, huh?\" the woman mocked,much to your ire. However, Manako was getting more desperate by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aito...my bladder is going to explode.\" Manako whispered, shuffling her feet together rapidly, on the verge of crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, does the one-eyed freak need to piss? Get comfortable, I'm going to record this!\" the woman declared as she took out her red camera-phone. \"There's a lot of pervs on the internet who'd love to see a cyclops girl wet herself!

She landed painfully onto the ground while you stomped on her phone until it was nothing but bits. She then slipped into unconsciousness, all to the astonishment of Manako. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aito-kun. Did you just...?\" Manako trailed off, blushing warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, she didn't deserve to make you cry.\" you said sincerely.

You paid and got an orange ice pop while Manako got an ice cream sandwich. You then sat together on a bench and enjoyed your respective treats.

Do you really want to know?\" You then grasped her hand and stared into her eye, which made Manako blush heavily. \"Yes. You're my friend Manako.

But, even if the IEB allowed such things, I wouldn't do any of it unless Manako-chan was willing\".</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you both heard a voice coming from the kitchen's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"A-Aito-kun...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Manako-chan?! S-since when were you...?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I heard it all.\"</span>, said Manako with tears coming from her eye and a warm and bright smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then run towards you until she was a few feet away and threw herself at you, pushing Ms. Smith to the side (more like shoving her). As soon as you grabbed her, she wrapped her arms around your neck and gave you a tender hug, while she pressed her face on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Manako...chan?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm so happy, Aito-kun! Most people see me as hideous and as a freak because I only have one eye. But you... you see me like a girl... a cute one at that...and you are willing to do such naughty things with <i>me</i>...Thank you, Aito-kun! Thank you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Manako-chan...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled warmly and hugged her back tightly, while using your right hand to caress her soft, dark purple hair. Ms. Smith was smiling all the time. She cared for all of the member of her squad deeply. They were like her own family to her. And she wouldn't forgive <i>anyone</i> who dared harm any of them. She was happy that Manako-chan was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you smelled something that seemed like it was burning. Then you remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"The pancakes!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly put Manako-chan, who was a bit reluctant to let go of you, down and got the pancake off the fire just in time. Ms. Smith and Manako-chan sat on the table, waiting for you to finish cooking. Once you did, you put a stack of five chocolate-chips pancakes on each plate and took them to the table, along with a 2Lt bottle of Maple Syrup for anyone who wanted to add it to their pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of breakfast, half of the bottle's content was gone and no pancake was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Thank you for the meal, Aito-kun!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Yeah. That was good.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"You're welcome. And thank you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Anyway, I should get going. Ja-ne!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Ms. Smith was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"What now, Aito-kun?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Well, why don't we...\"</span></span></div></div>",

So, you simply caught his punch with your own left hand and held it there, while lowering the jerk's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"What?!\"</span>, he said, not believing what he was seeing. However, when we looked up, and saw the rage and ire filled death glare you were giving him, he began regretting his decision of challenging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an act of desperation, he managed to free his hand and threw another punch with it aimed to your face. But you simply tilted your face a little to the left, making him miss. Then, you used all of you strength to kneel him sight on his stomach, making him bend in pain and grab his stomach, in a futile effort to stop the pain and also making him cough some blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Y-y-you... b-bastard!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply looked down at him and, in a venomous tone that was as cold as ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Know your place. You piece of trash.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then jumped up and delivered a strong kick to his back, slamming him on the ground. The kick was so strong, that it created an outline of the jerk's body and caused him to bleed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then calmed down and went to where Manako-chan was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Are you alright, Manako-chan?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe merely looked at you, wide eyed and with her mouth slightly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Sorry if I scared you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"A-ah. No! Not at all! Thank you, for defending me.\"</span>, said Manako with a bright blush; Happy and touched that you would go so far to protect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you heard a clapping sound behind you. You turned to look and Manako-chan and you saw one of the girls clapping at you. And soon, everyone was clapping as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Congratulations, Aito-kun.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Manako-chan and you turned, this time, to the pool's entrance, and saw none other than Ms. Smith, followed by Manako-chan's team mates, Tionishia, Zombina and Doppel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Smith-san!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Tio-chan!

But if I did that, only bad things would come out of it. I would go to prison, Manako-chan would be deported, if not held as an accomplice, and I would make her sad. Along with my parents. Not to mention possibly worsen the relationships between humans and monoeyes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nManako blushed. Happy that you thought of her well being. Smith-san and the other just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Either way, you two better get home.

Manako had worn the dress from the other day when you got ice cream and you were dressed in a regular black suit that itched madly. You never knew why, but suits always made your body itch. Anyway, you both decided it would be best to change clothes, so you went to your respective rooms to do so. When you got out, you wore a blue dress shirt with black shoes and matching pants, but you noticed that Manako was still not ready. You approached her door and knocked softly; Manako was easily startled by loud knocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Manako-chan, are you ready?\"</span> you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clilac\">\"In a minute, Aito-kun!\"</span> Manko replied frantically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited on the couch for a few minutes before you heard the sound of high heels clacking. At first, you thought it was Ms. Smith, but you turned around and got the surprise of your life. Manako wore a bright red dress that tastefully showed off her petite frame with matching heels and a purse. She wore a red sunhat, only it didn't obscure her eye and you noticed that she wore a little red lipstick that made her beautiful lips look even more tempting. Fortunately, she avoided eye-shadow and blush, so she looked like a refined woman with just a hint of sexiness that made you have a nosebleed when you saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clilac\">\"What do you think, Aito-kun?\"</span> Manako asked teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no words. All you could do is give a long, approving whistle that made Manako's face as red as her outfit. <span class=\"clilac\">\"AIto-kun, stop it!\"</span> Manako said halfheartedly, mostly because she was enjoying this. <span class=\"clilac\">\"You could turn a girl's head with a whistle like that!\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Sorry, Manako-chan. It's just...now I feel under-dressed.\"</span> you admitted, blushing heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clilac\">\"Don't be ridiculous. You look...handsome.\"</span> Manako admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you two left and drove off into the night, but not alone. Inside a black van was Ms. Smith and Manako's old squad from M.O.N. Ms. Smith's glasses shone brightly as she drove the van and followed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\">\"Remind me why we're following them?\"</span> Doppelganger asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Yeah, It's Mana-chan!\" </span>Zombina dismissed. <span class=\"clred\">\"She can take care of herself!\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"That doesn't matter.

Business, huh?\"</span> Zombina said sardonically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ckhaki\">\"Um...Smith-san, we have an emergency.\"</span> Tionisha said shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Huh? What's wrong, Tio-chan?\"</span> Ms. Smith asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Smith and the rest of M.O.N. got their answer when they noticed Tionisha squirming and jamming her hand in her crotch armor. <span class=\"ckhaki\">\"I drank too much coffee! We need to stop!\"</span> Tionisha begged, on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Smith sighed in exasperation. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Don't worry, Tio-chan.

You managed to drive to the first restaurant you took Manako to during her first week of living with you. While she bolted before either of you could eat the first time, Manako seemed to be more confident around you and she even recommended going here. The two of you sat where you would've sat during that first week and looked over the menu. Soon enough, a waitress came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Hello.

In fact, by the time you reached the dress shop, Manako's face was a bright shade of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the place, Manako?\" you asked. Manako looked at the sign, which said, \"Monoeye Boutique: Don't Be Ashamed of You\". Manako gave you a polite nod and you went inside with her. Inside, the store appeared to have several Monoeyes like Manako; however, there were several Momoeye sub-species here as well. Ms. Smith gave you a manual on all the known monsters and sub-species, so you were able to notice the subtle differences between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you also noticed that they were all staring at you and Manako, much to your confusion. \"Manako, why are they staring at us?\" you asked. \"They aren't used to seeing a human and Monoeye together. Just ignore them.\" Manako answered as she got some dresses on sale. She then stepped into a vacant change room and shot you a teasing smile. \"Don't look.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you knew that you wouldn't, this was actually one of the few times you'd ever seen Manako smile, which made you blush a little.

Now then, since you might have no idea as to what a Lamia or Echidna is exactly, then allow me to elaborate on the subject:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLAMIA<br>\r\nA Lamia is a Demi-human with the lower body of a snake. Like snakes, lamia regularly shed their skin, and are cold-blooded as well. Their personalities are persistent, conjuring the images of snakes. They are carnivores, known to have a special preference for eggs. However, the tip of a Lamia's tail is an erogenous zone. Because their species consists only of females, Lamias require human males to reproduce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nECHIDNA<br>\r\nBecause more of their bodies are covered with scales compared to the Lamias, Echidnas are surprisingly closer to lizardfolk, despite their serpentine attributes. In translation, their name means \"Viper Women\", and true to their name, they possess a pair of poisonous fangs inside their mouths. According to biological studies, an Echidna's venom is a type of hemorrhagin, which must be treated with caution if one wants to avoid being accidentally bitten. And like the notorious family of venomous snakes, an Echidna's lower body is covered in a unique pattern reminiscent to the infamous viper.</span></div></div>",

Anyway, getting back down to business. Since there might be a few of you who have never heard of these two subspecies, then allow me to explain:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMELUSINE<br>\r\nA lamia subspecies with dragon wings on it's back, Melusines actually share some characteristics with Dragonnewts. However, they are more similar to sea snakes than terrestrial snakes, preferring to live by the shore. Unfortunately, a Melusine's wings aren't powerful enough to their serpentine lower bodies, making them useless. There is little information about this Lamia subspecies aside from what's already been mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEDUSA<br>\r\nAlso known as Gorgons, Medusas are a subspecies of Lamia with snakes for hair, adopting the name of the most famous of the 3 Gorgon Sisters in Greek Mythology and Legend. According to the myths &amp; legends, a Medusa's gaze can turn any living creature into stone. That is, if said creature wasn't made of stone already. But in actuality, they possess no such ability. However, their gaze is very keen, and a Medusa's glare makes living creatures unable to move, immobilized, almost as if they have been truly turned to stone like in the legends from Ancient Greece. In reality though.....it's another story entirely. Turns out they have poor eyesight and only appear to be giving one the legendary gaze, despite a Medusa's lack of ill will. Because their is simply made of snakes, Medusas are troubled by the fact that they are unable to change their hairstyle.</span></div></div>",

You also heard a group of people saying things you couldn't quite make out, and then you realized the same alleyway you were walking towards. Concerned about what was going on you rush down the alleyway, and to your horror, there were a group of beating a little girl. Upon closer inspection you learnt she was a harpy being attacked by racists. The moment you began to confront them, one of the racists slammed a metal bat onto her wing breaking it and causing the harpy to scream in major pain. \"W-w-why are y-y-y-you doing this to me?\" said the harpy, \"you came into our country you little freak\", said the tanned racist. \"But I have the p-p-papers\" she said struggling to point to it on the ground next to a bag. Once you got there you yelled, \"Just what in the hell are you doing to this innocent harpy!\" you said in pure rage. \"Teaching this freak a lesson thats what\" said another racist with a smirk. In your fury you kicked the bat wielder in the groin, took his bat and used it to knock the rest out. After tying them up (somehow) and calling the cops you rushed over to the cowering harpy. Like most harpies, she appeared to be a child despite likely not being one, and as a result have a small chest. \"it's ok your safe now little one\" you said with a concerned look. Hearing this, the harpy slowly came out of her hiding spot, you took notice of her appearance, she had crimson short hair as well as crimson feathers. You noticed the right wing was forcibly clipped, as you see scissors on the ground, and the left wing appears broken. She was wearing a blue tank top that looked torn, and black shorts. Looking at her face, she wore prescription goggles though the right lens was broken with a closed black eye behind it, and her open eye revealed a blue iris. As she limped towards you, she fell down again, so you picked her up along with her bag. </span></div></div>",

Now for those who are slightly confused about what the Dairy Breed Centaurs are like, then allow me to elaborate:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDairy Breed Centaurs are a centaur subspecies that produces an exceptional amount of milk. Among the already well-endowed female centaurs, Dairy Centaurs have particularly large breasts. Because of this, they often serve as wet nurses for other centaurs who have trouble producing milk (like Lightweights), and due to this, it is common for Dairy Centaurs to live among groups of other centaur subspecies. Though they are about the same size as standard centaurs, their waists and legs are especially thick. Dairy Centaurs are easygoing and meek. Their maternal instincts are strong, and they love small animals.</span></div></div>",

Now, since there might be a few people who are possibly new to Monster Musume, here's some information about these two Centaur subspecies:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHEAVYWEIGHT CENTAUR<br>\r\nKnown for their sheer strength, Heavyweight Centaurs are the most muscular members of their species, so powerful that they can move around unimpeded even while wearing a heavy set of armor. However, since they rarely have opportunities to wear armor in modern times, Heavyweight Centaurs apply their strength towards farming and agriculture. They are the largest and most muscular of centaurs, and their legs are far thicker than those of other members of their kind. However, most Heavyweight Centaurs are gentle, good-natured, and absent-minded, and they are often dim-witted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLIGHTWEIGHT CENTAUR<br>\r\nAlso known as racing centaurs, Lightweight Centaurs are a subspecies that excels at running, due to being smaller than the standard centaur, with slimmer and tighter bodies. Though they approach their ranks and records with a stoic attitude and love running, Lightweight Centaurs can be easily injured, and they devote much of their attention to studying health care. They can be rather moody, but this can be attributed to timidity or physical and mental innocence, since their bodies aren't as large as the other Centaurs, neither are their breasts.</span></div></div>",

Due to the toxins in their bodies, green slimes bubble and are always surrounded by floating bubbles. A theory of their poisonous nature comes from the fact that they live in forests with poisonous plants and animals. Unintentionally, they always sprinkle their conversations with venomous remarks.

Whether they are depicted as the hypnotic Sirens who lure sailors to their deaths with their enchanted singing, or as beautiful princesses of the ocean like in Disney's The Little Mermaid, these aquatic beauties have been around for more than centuries. However, these aren't the Mermaids you've read about in Greek Mythology or watched on the big screen. And here's why:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMERMAID<br>\r\nLike one would expect when they hear the word Mermaid, these aquatic entities are a non-human species with the upper body of a human, and the lower body of a fish. Because they are known to live in the water, Mermaids have difficulty moving on land. However, as long as a Mermaid's gills remain moist, they are able to breathe above water. Due to their physiological anatomy, most Mermaids use the aid of a wheelchair to get around on land. To prevent their bodies from drying out, they are covered in what appears to be a moist mucus,  which keeps them wet and stable enough to be on land. Oddly enough, their entire species loves the tale of \"The Little Mermaid\", longing for a tragic love like the one depicted in the famous fairy tale. Standard mermaids live within the waters of warm tropical oceans, and their scales and fins are known to be very colorful, much like tropical fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEEL<br>\r\nEels are mermaids with long bodies like the serpentine Lamia. Unlike most mermaids, Eel Mermaids have little to no difficulty living on land. However, because they produce even more mucus than the standard mermaid, Eel Mermaids have difficulty wearing most clothes. Surprisingly, their massage techniques utilizing their mucus is highly advanced. However, an Eel Mermaid's mucus also possesses cosmetic properties as well, making them popular amongst the other mermaids. In addition, Eel Mermaids have a tremendous amount of stamina, often staying up all night. As a result, this makes sleep-deprived most of the time.</span></div></div>",

Unlike their fellow mermaids, Shark Mermaids are entirely carnivorous, which is a rare trait among the predominantly omnivorous mermaids. Like the hostile Bull &amp; Tiger Sharks, the personalities of a Shark Mermaid could only be described as wild and aggressive. In other words, if you intend on being the host family to a Shark Mermaid, use extreme caution when caring for such a ferocious creature. In the past, they engaged in pirate-like activities. However, in more recent years, Shark Mermaids have begun to abstain from piracy. Like a real shark, the skeleton in their lower bodies are made of cartilage instead of bone, making them very delicate. Also, they happen to be mentally weak as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow onto more important matters at hand.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Kasai Sendo. You are a twenty-year old African-American man who has lived in Japan your entire life. You were about 6 feet 10 inches tall with a shaved head and amber-red eyes. You usually wore a white shirt, blue jeans, and black boots. You had the Kajin for fire tattooed in black on your right hand, which was coincidentally your name in Japanese. It seemed fitting, considering what you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never knew your parents and you didn't have any relatives that lived in Japan as far as you knew. You grew up in a broken-down orphanage under the care of Ms. Bellamy, the closest thing you ever had to a mother. She was a kind and sweet woman, even though her own children died in a horrible car accident alongside her husband. Everyday you wondered if you and the other orphans were just a way to fill the hole in her heart. Still, she always pushed you to aspire to greatness. She could never explain it, but she knew that there was something...extraordinary about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were about 5 years old, a family came in to adopt you. Before they could, however, something happened...something bad. You felt mysterious headaches, but the doctors could never find out what was wrong with you. However, the worst one happened when they arrived to sign the final papers to adopt you. It was then that your eyes glowed pure white and you shot fire from your hands. Unfortunately, it hit the wife's face and they immediately rescinded the adoption process. To this day, you couldn't stop blaming yourself for what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the other orphans hated you because families were too scared to even come near this place. They constantly bullied you and goaded you into setting yourself on fire, which you never did. After what happened, you were too afraid to sue your powers ever again. It wasn't until a week later that Ms. Bellamy let you in on a secret; you were a mutant. She kept the secret from you because she wasn't sure how powerful you were. The only reason she knew was because she was a mutant as well, but she could control the plants. Based on what she told you, mutants were rare and very powerful humans with various powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor their own protection, mutants' existence was kept in secret. Fortunately, that wasn't a problem for you since no one would believe a five-year old boy could control fire. After that, the orphans managed to get adopted, all except you since they were too afraid of you to try before. When you turned 18, you said goodbye to Ms. Bellamy and went on your own way to find some peace in this world. Fortunately, monsters had been revealed to the world a year ago, so mutants were shelved for now. This gave you two years to make something of your life. You manged to make a lot of money as a street performer using your fire, which Ms. Bellamy taught you to control. The first thing you bought, however, was the tattoo, so you'd never forget what you could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to make enough money to get a down payment on a house and you currently lived alone. Today, you had to buy some groceries, mostly meat; you loved meat. As you walked back home...</span></div></div>",

You knew you had to act fast so you felt your feet tingle before they shot out flames that slowly lifted you up, but not before you set your groceries down. As soon as you were high enough in the air, you laid flat on your stomach and rocketed at supersonic speeds in a blaze of orange fire. You caught up with the girl just before she crashed into the ocean and lifted her up as he wheelchair fell in the water. You then set her down and gasped in shock by what you were seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl appeared to be a young Caucasian woman, most likely your age, with boyish blue hair, amethyst eyes, and a small scar on her right cheek. She wore a black bandanna around her head, a white shirt with vertical blue stripes that exposed her belly button and barely contained her impressive cleavage, and a red skirt with a fake dagger holster on her right hip....only it wasn't a hip. Rather than legs, this girl had the lower body of a gray shark! You then remembered that there were sub-species of monsters and that this one must've been one from the mermaids.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed you, but rather than thank you, her teeth turned to fangs and she let out a venomous scowl. \"Idiot! What have you done?!\" You then stared at her angrily. \"Uh, news flash, shark bait, I was trying to save your life!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, la-de-da!\" the shark-girl said rudely. \"Thank's to your little \"rescue\", I can't move around any more to find my host family!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then flew up using your fire and effortlessly retrieved her wheelchair, much to her surprise. \"There. Happy now?\" you asked as the shark-girl merely huffed. \"Hmph. Took you long enough, mutant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" you asked, feeling offended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what it means. Your kind is just as hated as ours, but at least our kind's sexy!\" the shark-girl flaunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.\" you said sarcastically. \"I'll bet every man wants to do it with a shark-girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right!\" the shark-girl replied, apparently either unaware of ignoring your sarcasm. She then took out her papers that were in her water-proof backpack. \"Hey, do you know where Kasai Sendo lives? He's my host family.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her incredulously and only let out two words. \"Oh, crap.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

She wore a white dress shirt with a black tie, a black blazer and matching professional skirt, black pantyhose and heels. This was Kuroko Smith, better known as Ms. Smith, a Cultural Exchange Security Squad Coordinator. She smiled brightly when she saw you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Kasai Sendo. We've been waiting to officially meet you.\" Ms. Smith said as she approached the duo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this mutie is my host family?!\" the shark-girl yelled incredulously as she propped herself back on her wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mizu.\" Ms. Smith said, only to give her a venomous glare. \"That's an offensive term for someone who saved your wheelchair and your life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please!\" Mizu brushed off. \"I was going to land in water!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, at the speed you were going, you would've broken your neck upon impact.\" Ms. Smith revealed. \"If Kasai hadn't intervened, you would've died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizu was speechless. If that was true, she really owed him an apology, but that would have to come later when you interrupted her train of thought. \"Wait, how do you even know that I'm a mutant?\" Kasai asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My department keeps track of monsters and those with powers. We've had our eye on you for some time, Kasai. It's exactly why we chose you as Mizu's host family.\" Ms. Smith revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your hands before you shot her a glare. \"If you know what I am, then you know I'm dangerous. I can barely control my powers when I street perform.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be true, but Mizu is too dangerous for an ordinary human to take care of her. She needs someone who can keep her in check.\" Ms. Smith reasoned. She then shot a teasing smile. \"Besides, all the paperwork is filled out and the renovations are finished. You're stuck with her.\" Before you could attack her, Ms. Smith departed in the car, which made you and Mizu sigh in disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're stuck with each other.\" you conceded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are worse humans. I guess you're not bad.\" Mizu said, suppressing a small blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of you headed back home. Later...</span></div></div>",

The amount of money you earned as a street performer allowed you to buy a two-story house in Akihabara, which you moved to due to your love of otaku shops. Ever since you learned that you were a mutant, you were fascinated by the world of otaku, specifically anything that could be a new technique for you to master. Fortunately, Ms. Smith's organization put in a wheelchair ramp for Mizu, much to your surprise. You then wheeled her inside, unaware that she was feeling guilty about what she said earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><i>\"Oh, what should I do? He saved my life and I was a total bitch to him. He could have roasted me alive and make shark-sticks, but he didn't. Oh, what should I do?!\"Mizu silently lamented. </i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Mizu, you were also thinking of how to apologize. <span class=\"corange\"><i>\"Uh, what do I do? Mizu might be as mean as a shark, but she didn't deserve me calling her \"shark bait\". I should know better. If everyone knew what I was, they'd call me things too. I've gotta figure out how I can tell her.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, when you wheeled her inside and shit the door, Mizu said, <span class=\"cteal\">\"I'm sorry.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there for a few moments before you responded. <span class=\"corange\">\"What did you just say?\"</span> you asked, flabbergasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Look, this is really hard for me to admit, so I won't say it again. Just, take it or leave it okay?!\" </span>Mizu bellowed, suppressing a heavy blush. Unexpectedly, you then replied, <span class=\"corange\">\"I'm sorry too.I should've known better.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the two of you stayed in blissful silence before you wheeled her to her room, which looked more like a dungeon to you. While it appeared to be a large swimming pool, the interior heavily resembled a cave and the pool had spikes jutting out of it's perimeter except for the stairs. While you thought this looked weird, Mizu unexpectedly smiled and revealed her dark-gray shark ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"It's just like home!\"</span> Mizu yelled jubilantly as she jumped into the pool and started to swim with great fervor. While you couldn't understand this, seeing Mizu smile from this made you smile a little. She then shot a teasing smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"What's wrong, matchstick?! Afraid you'll douse your flame if you come inside?!\"</span> Mizu playfully taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Nah, but things are about to get hot!\"</span> you said as you lit your hands on fire and touched the pool water. Instantly, the water boiled and out came a very heated Mizu who flopped around comically, but still smiled. <span class=\"cteal\">\"You'll have to do better that that, Inferno!\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Inferno?\" </span>you said in brief reverence. <span class=\"corange\">\"I like that.\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

You weren't sure if it was because of your mutant ability to make fire, but there was something about cooking that you couldn't help but love. As such, you started to cook the meat, which Mizu smelled and instantly wheeled herself into the kitchen, drooling hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Is that meat?!\"</span> Mizu said hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Yeah.

However, if you are either confused and curious about these unique creatures, then here is some information about them for reassurance:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nARACHNE<br>\r\nLike the Centaurs, the Arachne are a non-human species. But instead of the lower body of a horse, the Arachne have the lower body of a spider. According to their physiology, Arachne have between  four and six eyes, and are completely carnivorous. Like the average spider, the Arachne can secrete thread from the tip of their abdomen, which they use to spin webs and traps. These hunters normally capture their prey in traps, but as hunting is unnecessary in human society, the Arachne pass the time by making knitted goods and dolls with their thread. Their hunter instincts compel them to tie people up and play with them, almost like they were marionettes. And like a human would get drunk from alcoholic beverages, the Arachne can get drunk from consuming drinks with caffeine in said beverages, such as coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLARGE ARACHNE<br>\r\nOut of all the Arachne, the Large Arachne is a subspecies that is drastically larger the standard arachne, with thick legs and a covering of hair. In addition to being the strongest of their species, Large Arachne are known to be very wild and aggressive, biologically equipped with venom, making them extremely dangerous to approach without caution. Fortunately, the Large Arachne's venom isn't particularly strong or harmful. Due to their near-feral nature, Large Arachne are not well-suited to interspecies exchange programs. According to police reports, when Large Arachne have interacted with humans, they're most likely expected to be arrested for assault and causing other problems. However, if you intend on being the host family to a Large Arachne, expect your time with her to be a rather....difficult experience. In other words, keep her at your own risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. The Arachne! Now then, which member of this species of monsters do you want? The standard Arachne, or the deadly hostile Large Arachne? Time to pick your poison!</span></div></div>",

Yet our opinions have no permanence; like autumn and winter, they gradually pass away.\"</span><br>\r\n-Zhuangzi<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Elijah Prentiss. You are a 19 year old Caucasian male from the United States, more specifically from the urban oasis known commonly as Las Vegas, Nevada. In appearance, you stand around 5 feet 10 inches in height, have short snow white hair, and two different eye colors. Your right eye was a jade green color, while your left was colored a pale icy blue hue.  Your usual attire consisted of a dark red T-shirt with a large kanji symbol on the front, dark jeans, black and neon green basketball sneakers, and a dark grey trench coat with light grey faux fur stitched inside, as you walked down the streets of Tokyo in the midst of a cloudy autumn day, the extended ends of your trench coat flapping in the breezy wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you passed by pedestrian traffic, as the locals attempted to warm themselves up for the inevitable winter that was approach months from now, you were unfazed by the cold air. And there's a good reason why. Your father happened to be the leading scientist in a secret project funded by a corporation known as Medici Cryogenics, who use the scientific expertise on cryogenics, which involves dealing with using very low temperatures, not just a concept with the realm of science fiction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something....happened at the age of 6 years old, when you were brought in to see your father's work, as part of the occasional \"Take Your Kid To Work Day\". Acting like a kid your age would do, your childish curiosity got the better of you, as you were caught right in the middle of one of your father's experiments, forcing him to turn off the experiment when he saw you screaming from the painful shocks and the frosty wind whirling around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously, you survived....but, you were changed as a result. The experiment turned your dark blonde hair white as snow, your left eye changed into a pale icy blue color, and your hands felt as cold as ice. And yet, the most drastic change of all: you now had the power over ice and anything that was just as cold. At first, your family was caught by surprise when you suddenly sprung to life and a set of ice shards suddenly shot out from the palms of your hands. And yet, your condition was made clear when you fainted from Nevada's notorious triple-digit heat, just seconds after you've been cleared to leave the hospital. Since one of your uncles owns a refrigeration truck, your father called him to get the truck over to the hospital ASAP, despite telling him \"I'll explain it later\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut over time, your mother, your sister, older brother, and younger brother coped somewhat with the realization that you now have ice powers, with differing opinions of course. Your younger brother, Jason, thought that you were awesome, since he was into superheroes, and seeing you have superpowers made him think you're the best brother in the world. After all, he was only a baby when you got your powers, so he was the most well-adjusted of your family towards your chilling abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as for how you managed to arrive here in Japan, turns out there was more than just one singular reason. Apparently, shortly after the existence of monsters was made public to the world and the Interspecies Exchange Bill was passed, the Japanese government had taken interest in your abilities, obviously for law enforcement. By then, you were already 16 years of age. In exchange for your services, the government would give you and your family a place to stay, which came in the form of a penthouse within Downtown Shinjuku (one of Tokyo's districts), giving you a good view of Tokyo Bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, due to your newfound abilities to control ice, your body had difficulty managing the dry temperatures of the Mojave Desert, so your parents figured it would be a good time to move, despite your sister being upset about the ordeal. Then again, you don't blame her for what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to the present, you were currently walking through a busy street market, just simply taking in the sights. However, you noticed what appeared to be a female centaur with long blonde hair wearing an insulated jacket and long black skirt for the current weather, as she was accompanied by a young many with black hair wearing jeans, tennis shoes, gloves, and a brown coat with a fur collar, along with a navy blue beanie hat on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you figured that they were here for groceries, you couldn't help but feel a little envious. After all, you had trouble getting a girl due to your chilling abilities. Either the girl you wanted to date would just laugh at you for making up what she thought was an excuse, or she would faint from seeing you using your powers as proof, which dampened your mood from the aftermath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you were about to leave the street market......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just when you were about to call your older brother to let him know where you are, something quickly caught your attention, which came in the form of a woman screaming, <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hey, stop that! Leave me alone, you creeps!\"</span> \"Sorry freak, but you're not allowed here!\" A voice replied, as you distinctly recognized it as male. At first, you thought it was some group of assholes giving a girl a hard time, but it wasn't until you moved through the crowd a little and saw what was actually occurring; a gang of racists picking on a female Arachne. Sure you were familiar with what an Arachne actually is, but from what you were witnessing, these guys definitely wanted to beat her up, as they were backing her into a corner, carrying what appeared to be rusty pipes and baseball bats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously pissed off at what these full-grown men were about to commit, you pulled up the neckwarmer scarf around your neck, covering up the lower half of your face, all while having this angry look on your face, nostrils flaring. Fortunately, there were a decent amount of puddles surrounding the nearby area, giving you some water to freeze with your ice powers. But as your walking pace became more aggressive, you quickly grabbed a baseball bat from a nearby vendor, dunked the upper quarter of the bat into a large bucket of water, then quickly used your ice powers to harden the water into solid ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you aggressively approached the nearest thug, you got his attention by yelling, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Hey asshole!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even react, WHAM!! You violently swung the ice-coated bat right at the man's face, knocking him off his feet and becoming unconscious from hitting the back of his head against the pavement. Both the Arachne and the remaining gang of racists were caught by surprise from what just happened. However, the racists quickly recovered, shifting their focus from the female Arachne and onto you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you dodged one man's attack, and lunged toward a nearby puddle, dunking your fist into the water, as you froze the water around your hand, then instinctively delivered a brutal backhand into the man's head, and quickly swung the baseball bat into his friend, KO-ing both men in unison. But while you continued to fight against her attackers, the female Arachne looked at you with a mix of awe and fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as another guy was charging toward, you quickly froze the puddle he was standing in, covering his feet and ankles in ice, where you then struck at his head from behind with a powerful dropkick, both feet making direct contact with the man's head, as he lost consciousness from the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as the last remaining guy attempted to get away, you quickly froze the water he was still kneeling in, restraining him from doing anything harmful aside from making threats. Approaching the downed racist, you noticed some papers in the back of his cargo pants. Out of curiosity, you took the papers out of his back pocket, unfolding them to see what he had. What you found apparently, were the documents for the female Arachne to be assigned to a host family. And it had the signatures of your parents: Maxwell &amp; Josephine Prentiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"These are her documents. You and your buddies stole them to beat her up, didn't you?!\" </span>You growled, your tone seething with venom toward the man, connecting the dots together from what sort of crime they were about to commit, aside from assault and battery. In response, the man spoke toward you , stuttering from his decreased body temperature, and growled, \"S-So w-w-what?! That 8 l-legged f-f-freak d-doesn't b-b-belong h-here! S-She- GAAAH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSick of the man's hurtful rantings toward the female Arachne standing nearby, you grabbed a nearby bucket full of water and chucked the cold water in his direction, interrupting him, as he felt his body temperature drop just a little more. From there, you put a foot on his back and pressed down on the man's back, looking down at him and yelled, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Insult her one more time, and I'll show you what hypothermia feels like!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm s-s-s-SORRY!!\" He apologized, obviously coming to the realization of his....current situation. For you, it was better than nothing, as you use the handle of the bat, butting it against the man's head, knocking him out cold from the concussive blow. <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Jackasses.\" </span>You muttered, as you stood back up from the unconscious thug, turning around to face the female Arachne, just to see if she was injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the female Arachne had fair skin, six violet eyes, and long pink hair that reached a foot below her waist and hips, right her upper human half connects with her spider half, where her hair was put into a slight bubble ponytail halfway down her long hair. Her spider half was a mahogany red color, which has this white jolly roger pattern on her rear abdomen, minus the skull. Like her lower half, the Arachne's clawed hands and forearms were a mahogany red hue, covered up by these green silk sleeves. Covering her ample chest, she wore what appeared to be a green silk nightshirt, something not suitable to wear during the autumn or winter seasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you noticed that her arms were wrapped around what looks like a suitcase, gripping tightly to it like a kid would hug a stuffed animal out of comfort. From seeing the fear in her eyes a little, you tossed the bat off to the side, showing her that you're not a threat to her, slowly approaching her while she backed away from you until she felt her rear abdomen bumped into the wall behind her, leaving her with nowhere else to go as you spoke toward her and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Hey, take it easy there. I'm not gonna hurt you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill silent as she was earlier, the Arachne didn't speak to you. And yet, you continued to ease the tension between you and her,as you slowly extended your hand toward her, just as she flinched some from the friendly gesture, and you said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"......Name's Eli. Any chance you can tell me yours?\" </span> Shortly after your attempt to introduce yourself, there was this awkward moment of silence between you and the female Arachne. However, just when you figured you might as well give up on her, you suddenly heard what sounded like a young woman's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice sounded timid and frail, but youthful, as you heard the Arachne's voice for the first time when she answered, <span class=\"cviolet\">\".....Alma. M-My name is...Alma.\"</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Coming to the realization that you weren't going to actually harm her like those thugs were, the timid female Arachne, who introduced herself as Alma, slowly extended her mahogany red clawed right hand, showing how edgy and timid she was from the ordeal. However, you carefully held her hand in response, slowly shaking it out of compassionate reassurance, just as you lowered you neckwarmer scarf to reveal your face to her and answered, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Alma, huh? That's a cute name.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You....y-you really th-think so?\"</span> Alma asked, shocked at first, but it resolved to a beet red blush on her cheeks, obviously showing the tell-tale signs that she was feeling bashful about having a boy holding her hand, her eyes attempting to look away from you a little, just as you then let go of her hand. However, you then began to notice her body was shaking, as Alma wrapped her arms tighter around herself, her sharp clawed digits squeezed tighter. And yet, you could swear that you can hear the sound of chattering teeth emanating from Alma's closed mouth, all while still gripping tightly onto the purple suitcase in her possession, along with looking a little exhausted, her six eyes struggling to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming concerned for her well-being, you snapped the fingers on your left hand some, placing said next to Alma, gaining her attention, and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Hey. Are you okay there, Alma? You....don't exactly look alright.\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Uh...U-Uh huh *shivering mixed with quick labored breathing*.\" </span>Was all that Alma could mutter, her body physically shivering coupled with quick-paced laboring breaths. Although you didn't exactly have much knowledge on whether Arachnes were warm-blooded or cold-blooded, you could see the universal signs of a person shivering from the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you quickly took off your coat, as you hoisted it around Alma as you spoke toward the shivering Arachne and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Here, wear this.\"</span> In response, Alma wrapped the coat around her a little tighter, absorbing the warmed-up trenchcoat while still holding onto the suitcase with one clawed hand. Shortly after receiving your coat to warm herself up, Alma then noticed that you didn't have anything to warm up with, looking at you with worry and asked, <span class=\"cviolet\">\"B-But....what about y-you? W-Won't you get cold a-as well?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you could understand Alma's concern, your powers over ice allowed your body to negate ice and ice-based attacks, ignoring the effects it has on the human body, as you flexed your digits, cracking your knuckles and neck as well. From there, you looked back at Alma, still wearing your dark red T-shirt, dark jeans, and black &amp; neon green basketball sneakers, where you spoke to her and answered, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"I'll be fine. Besides, I'm not exactly what you would call 'fully human' anymore.\"</span></span></div></div>",

Are you alright, sir?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"It's okay, Adrian. I'm fine. However, I am going to need a ride back home. Think you can do that?\" </span>You replied, reassuring Adrian that you're unharmed, asking if he can escort you and Alma back to your family's penthouse manor here in Tokyo. But then, you heard Adrian say something as he asked, <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Is this about your family adopting one of these...extra-species, Master Elijah?\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"....Adrian, you're making me a little worried here. What are you talking about?\"</span> You responded, becoming just a little concerned and slightly confused as well, cocking an eyebrow while speaking toward him, just as Alma began to eavesdrop on the conversation a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"My apologies, Master Elijah. Your father was contacted by a woman from the Japanese government, a Ms. Smith. I believe she is a Cultural Exchange Coordinator, sir.\" </span>Adrian explained, his British accent showed signs of reassurance in his explanation toward you. <span class=\"cpblue\">\"*sigh* Of course it had to be someone from the Cultural Exchange Program. So, what exactly was the reason why she paid my father a visit? .....Adrian, you still there?\"</span> You said, checking if Adrian was still on the phone, only to receive the voice of a mature adult woman on the line instead, catching you off-guard when she answered, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"So, you must be one of the sons of Dr. Maxwell Prentiss. Your parents must care about you to allow you to roam the streets of Tokyo all by your lonesome.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Who are you? What have you done with Adrian?\"</span> You growled, showing a sliver of hostility toward the mystery woman substituting the man you call Adrian, obviously concerned for his well-being. In response, you heard the woman's voice once more on the phone, as she spoke toward you and replied, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Now now, Mr. Prentiss; I did not bring harm to your butler friend. In fact, he just left, possibly to drive one of those fancy limos your family owns to pick you up.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite you were in relief to hear that Adrian was okay, the woman continued to speak and said, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"As for my identity however, my name is Kuroko Smith. But you can call me Ms. Smith. Now, my reasons for visiting your family's.....expensive residence, I am here on business. You see, the extra-species your family was to receive, has....wandered off on her own, possibly to find her assigned host family. Her name is Alma Spinnerette, and she is an Arachne.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the woman, now identified as Ms. Smith, explained the situation to you, you looked back at Alma, who blushed some from you simply gazing at her, where your mind put two-and-two together, already realizing why Alma was out here by her lonesome. From there, you interrupted Ms. Smith and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Don't tell me: Does she have fair skin, six violet eyes, long pink hair, and has a lower spider half that's colored a mahogany red hue with a pattern that looks like a pair of crossed bones on her rear abdomen?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after you spoke, there was this awkward moment of silence between you and Ms. Smith on the phone line, even though Alma was in a mix of confusion and slight concern when you gave an accurate description of her physical appearance toward the female government agent. However, you then heard Ms. Smith's voice once more, only it sounded like there was a subtle hint of shock under the female agent's calm alluring demeanor, where she spoke back and asked, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"....Actually, yes.....that's basically an accurate description of Ms. Spinnerette! But.....You're right next to her, aren't you?\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"No Shit, Sherlock! I mean, what's wrong with you, lady?! If you even call yourself a Cultural Exchange Coordinator, next time: Don't leave your extra-species clients to be attacked  unprovoked by a bunch of racist jackasses!\" </span>You exclaimed, obviously just a tad pissed off at how lazy this Ms. Smith was when doing her job, plus showing that you care about Alma's safety for the first time, aside from giving her your trenchcoat to warm up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\">\"Oh? And did you, say, beat up these 'racist jackasses' with , oh....I don't know, ice powers?\" </span>She smugly replied, retaliating for you berating her on how she should run her job. However, hearing what Ms. Smith had just said to you gave you cold feet (no pun intended), your eyes widen out of surprise. Your thoughts racing a little as you spoke in your subconscious and thought, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"What the?! How the hell did she know about my powers? I always try to cover up my identity when I use them, Dammit! Unless....\"</span> Slowly, you looked around your surroundings, noticing several things that....stood out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed was an Ogre girl, who stood close to 3 meters in height, sporting long golden blonde, with a single horn sticking out from her forehead, towering over the crowd somewhat, sticking out like a sore thumb. Then, you noticed what appeared to be a Zombie girl, her hair a magenta pink and placed in a semi-spiky fashion, her right a golden yellow, while her left eye was a jade green, having what appeared to be stitches on her face, since Zombies were basically undead. And finally, you noticed what appeared to be a female Monoeye on one of the lower rooftops, holding what appeared to be a military-grade sniper rifle, aiming directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Of course. They were blending in with the crowd.\" </span>You thought, letting out a frustrated sigh, looking straight at the Monoeye sniper while you heard Ms. Smith's voice over the phone once more as she said, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Judging from your silence, I can tell you've noticed my agents then.\"</span> \"Obviously. So tell me: If you had agents keeping an eye on Alma, then why didn't they just help her when those assholes were haing her?\" </span>You asked, still angry at how something like this could happen to someone like Alma. In response, you heard Ms. Smith as she answered....</div></div>",

However, one thing you didn't like about it was the immunity Humans would get from being harmed by one of the extra-species, which gave the racists free reign to harass innocent extra-species like Alma as long as they don't get caught, which was all the more reasons why it felt so satisfying to deliver an ice-coated baseball bat to the faces of these oversized bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"So you're basically saying that these cocky pricks are untouchable and your non-human agents can't lift a single finger to stop them?\"</span> You said, obviously irritated from why Ms. Smith's agents couldn't do a damn thing to stop Alma from being harassed by the group of jerks before you arrived. From there, you spoke back toward Ms. Smith on your cell phone and growled, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"You see, this is one of the reasons why I do the whole vigilante thing: Because you can't seem to do a damn thing when people like these dumbasses harass innocents like Alma.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously aware of the venomous tone seeping through your mouth just now, Ms. Smith still remained as calm as ever, speaking to you from herend of the phone call and replied, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Although I understand your....assertive ranting, Mr. Prentiss, but this is one of the reasons why I've sent Ms. Spinnerette to live with you and your family.

After all, being a Cultural Exchange Coordinator requires having some finesse when it comes to the matters of diplomacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you couldn't help but have this feeling of paranoia, as if Ms. Smith had some ulterior motive with sending Alma to live with you and your family, where you then spoke toward the Cultural Exchange Coordinator and asked, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Why do I get the feeling that you're hiding something from me?\"</span> Instead of hearing a response, there was this short moment of unexpected silence on Ms. Smith's end of the line, where she then spoke once more and answered......</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, you recognized it as your family's limo, just as you noticed the front car door opening, revealing it to be none other than than Adrian, your family's butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked out of relief, thankful that Adrian was very much alright. From there, you gently held Alma by her clawed right hand, guiding her toward the limousine, all while doing your best to keep her calm. After all that has happened moments ago, you thought it would be best to take her someplace safe, like your family's manor-like penthouse. You didn't notice at first, but Alma's cheeks began to blush slightly, just from the fact on how nice you we're being to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of chivalry, you allowed Alma to enter the limousine first, due to her overall size, as she leaned forward and ducked down to fit inside the doorway, where you then entered into the limo next, while Adrian closed the door before stepping back inside the driver's seat and proceeded to drive the vehicle toward your family's estate.</span></div></div>",

So, in an effort to ease her worries before the two of you arrived at your family's estate, you decided to stir up a bit of a conversation with the timid Arachne, hoping to lower her stress some, as you spoke to her and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"So, um..Alma, what made you.....decide to have my family as your host family?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Alma didn't respond to your question a little, so you gently tapped her on the shoulder to grasp her attention, causing the female Arachne to jump a little out of shock, which in turn, you attempted to reassure her and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Hey, Hey! It's okay. I just wanted to ask you a question and you weren't listening.\"</span> Fortunately, Alma managed to calm down some, letting out some deep breaths in the process.<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Wow, she must be really timid if she reacted like that. Better be more careful  on what I do, not that I want to give the poor girl a heart attack.\"</span> You thought to yourselfwarning yourself to be more cautious in your behavior, since Alma seemed to still be recovering from what happened earlier with those racists that harassed her earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clilac\">\"I'm.....l-l'm sorry, Eli. Did....d-did you say something?\" </span>She asked, slowly tightening her grip around her suitcase out of stress, obviously feeling like she was being interrogated. However, in response, you gently put a hand in her shoulder out of reassurance, trying to make her feel more relaxed, especially since you gave her your jacket to wear due to it currently being the middle of the autumn season. From there, you gently spoke toward Alma and replied, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"...Look, I'm not trying to force anything out of you, Alma. I just want to what made you go with my family as your host family. Nothing more, nothing less.....alright?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, Alma appeared hesitant to answer your question upon first glance. But then, she let out a deep exhaled breath, probably as a way to steady her nerves, as the Arachne slowly turned to look at you and answered, <span class=\"clilac\">\".....Ms. Smith recommended that I-I would be assigned to....to your family.\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"*sigh* Of course, that would explain a lot.\" </span>You thought to yourself once more, now realizing why such a timid Arachne would be sent to you and your family. Of course, you couldn't blame Ms. Smith's decision to send Alma to you and your family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, from what you've learned from the phone conversation with the Cultural Exchange Coordinator, Ms. Smith has kept an extensive eye on you for a good amount of time. In other words, it seemed fitting to send such a frail Arachne to an individual whose capable of protecting her easily. And what recently happened involving a gang of racist jackasses definitely proved your mettle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in response to Alma's answer, you looked back at the shy Arachne known as Alma Spinnerette and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"....I see. Well, I guess that explains why she was at my house.\"</span> <span class=\"clilac\">\"But....why would you say that?\" </span>Alma asked, confused over why you said something like that, only to realize something: Ms. Smith probably contacted you on your phone, where Alma then looked back at you and said, <span class=\"clilac\">\"She.....She called you, didn't she?\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the limousine turned right, leading into another street leading toward your family's home estate, you nodded once in confirmation toward Alma and explained, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Yeah....she did, Alma. She did. She called me on the same phone line I used to contact an old friend of my family, Adrian. He works for my parents as a loyal butler. It's how I was able to get us a limo instead of us just walking all the way home.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, Alma was somewhat surprised at this revelation, since she knew little about you and your family aside from the recent fact that you had superpowers. <span class=\"clilac\">\"I, um..... I-I didn't know your family has a butler, Eli.\" </span>She said, becoming a bit more lively with each passing minute of her conversation with you. In response, you looked back at the female Arachne and confessed, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"....The truth is, Alma, is that my family's known to be among the Upper Class in society. It's due to my father's research into Cryogenics that we're able to have such luxuries, not that I'm bragging about it or anything like that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were glad that she was able to open up a little to you, Alma still seemed somewhat hesitant about something, which involved.....</span></div></div>",

I want to know how you got your....your powers.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, you weren't expecting Alma to present such a personal topic for you quite so early. Then again, she witnessed what you were actually capable of with such superhuman abilities at your disposal. So, left with little to no choice on the matter, you spoke back toward Alma, displaying a bit of your power in the process, causing your right hand, wrist, and forearm to be coated in a layer of hardened ice, which made these crackling sounds while you flexed the fingers on your right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you calmly spoke toward the female Arachne sitting before you and explained, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"....To be honest, Alma: I've never asked for this kind of power. It was thrusted upon me out of sheer accident. Remember when I told you that my father was researching Cryogenics?\"</span> In response, Alma nodded yes, where you then continued your explanation and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Well, he was personally researching into an untested form of Cryogenics, simply known as Cryostasis. It's where you can freeze someone who's very much alive, preserving them, and then thawing them out and reviving them at a later date. Originally, this is something that could only exist in science fiction. However, my father found a way to make such a concept a reality. However, when I was 6 years old and he took me to his lab as part of a \"Take Your Kid To Work Day\", my childish curiosity got the better of me. Somehow, I ended up being caught in the middle of my father's experiment, changing me into what I've now become. Of course, he turned off the experiment and rushed me to a hospital. Miraculously, I survived.....but I had changed as well. Originally, I used to have dark blonde hair and a pair of green eyes before the accident. But now, not so much, as you can see before you. I used to live in a city called Las Vegas in the United States, but due to the desert's hot temperatures, I couldn't stay conscious for long back then, which forced my family to move someplace with a more.....tolerable  climate. But over the past 10 years, I learned how to control my powers, master them. After all, you saw what I was clearly capable of back when those bastards were harassing you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing of your detailed backstory, Alma now understood you a little more better than she previously thought. After all, you were being very truthful to her involving the origin of your ice powers, seeing as how you've saved her from that gang of racists from earlier. And yet, one thing still kept buzzing around in her mind: the motive, as in \"Why would you do things like this?\" . Those kinds of questions. So, Alma then spoke to you and asked, <span class=\"cviolet\">\"But Eli.....W-Why would you behave like such a, um......such a.....\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"-A vigilante? .....Well, it's because neither the police or the Cultural Exchange Security Squad can't seem to lift a damn finger to stop the harassment and stigma that you and the rest of your fellow monsters are forced to endure. By the time the authorities DO get off their lazy asses and try to stop crap like this, the damage has already been done. Some people have the tendency to fear or outright hate those who are different. This happened with the African Americans during the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s &amp; 1960s, and now the exact same thing is happening with the coexistence of monsters, despite there being laws against such acts of violence.\"</span> You explained, revealing the motivation behind your career as a vigilante, just as the two of you felt the limousine come to a full stop, parking next to a a large 12-story building, indicating that you've arrived home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Well, looks like we're here.\" </span>You said, exiting out of the limo. From there, you held out your hand to assist Alma in exiting the vehicle, pulling her carefully out the door and onto the sidewalk. From there, as Alma still clung to her suitcase, you gently shut the door behind her, prompting Adrian to drive the limousine into the underground parking garage nearby, disappearing from your sight in the process. </span></div></div>",

So in an effort to ease the internal tension within her, you gently held Alma's left hand in reassurance, as you then looked at her with a calm and compassionate look on your face and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"....It's okay, Alma. I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you. Come on, let's head inside.\"</span> In reaction, Alma couldn't help but somewhat blush, almost as if you're the one person who has shown her kindness since she first arrived here in Tokyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little more at ease, you gently guided the timid Arachne inside the hotel, treading through the spacious lobby and approached one of the private elevators. Fortunately, this place was one of the handful of hotels/apartment complexes that was designed for both humans and monsters in mind. Upon approaching the elevator doors, you pulled out a green and white keycard, inserted it into the nearby scanner, where it then flashed green in approval, causing the elevator doors to open, revealing a spacious 9 by 9 foot elevator in front of both you and Alma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you carefully led Alma inside the elevator, where the doors slowly closed simultaneously, shortly after you pressed an elevator button that led all the way up to the 12th floor, where your family's penthouse estate was located. Though, you couldn't blame Alma for being nervous. After all, aside from you and Adrian, Alma was only moments away from meeting her host family for the very first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the elevator finally reached the top floor and the doors opened in unison, you saw that your mother was currently setting up some Halloween decorations. After all, it was the 3rd week of September, and your mother was known to set up holiday decorations earlier than most people would normally do. <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Mom, I'm home!\" </span>You exclaimed, causing your mother to turn around, noticing both you and Alma. From there, she quickly climbed down the ladder to greet you, where she then wrapped her arms around you in the process, just as you let go of Alma's hand for a second there, as your mother then spoke to you and said, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Welcome home, honey.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, your mother released her embrace on you, as she then turned to confront Alma, who became a little nervous. However, your mother reassured the shy Arachne, as she looked at Alma and said, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"So, you must be Alma Spinnerette? Welcome to the Prentiss household. I'm terribly sorry for what you had to endure, Ms. Smith told us what happened and how my son saved you.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Alma couldn't help but blush in embarrassment and hesitation. After all, your mother was doting over her like she was a little girl. However, you interrupted your mother and answered, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Uh, Mom.....I think that's enough. After all, you're making her nervous enough as it is.\"</span> <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Oops! My bad. But don't worry, Alma, I won't bite.\" </span>Your mother replied, comforting Alma some, along with reassuring the timid Arachne in an attempt to make her feel right at home with some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as she gently guided Alma toward the direction of your room, you then looked back at your mother and asked, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"So, where's Adam?\"</span> In hindsight, Adam was the name of your older brother, who was currently 20 years of age, while your sister, Julie, was 15 years of age, and your younger brother, Connor, was 10 years old. Of course, in response, your mother turned her head to look at you and answered, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Adam is currently in your father's workshop, Elijah. I'm not sure why, though.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Okay, thanks.\" </span>You replied, now knowing where your older brother was currently located. Obviously, you knew what exactly Adam was doing in your father's workshop. Ever since you began your vigilante career, Adam's been your go-to expert on building gadgets for you, along with providing useful information during your vigilantism. In other words, he had become the Oracle to your Bruce Wayne/Batman. </span></div></div>",

Upon turning the large circular valve that acted like a highly-secure doorknob, you forcefully pulled the large door open, just enough for you to proceed inside the large workshop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, you heard music blasting throughout the workshop. Knowing your brother, Adam was known to listen to music while he was working on some new gadgets. However, if there was a song he absolutely loved, he could not help but sing along with the lyrics, as he sung, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Consentes Dei Juno Jupiter Minerva Apollo Mars Ceres, Mercurius Diana Bacchus Vulcanus Pluto Vesta Venus! Madoromi no fuchi de, mabuta ni tayutau. Musou no kami wa yuuga ni hohoemi shi o kudashi, Jikuu o suberu inga no kusari wa karamidasu! Kami no ataeshi kuusou Program! Saa eins zwei drei! Kasanariau. Saa eins zwei drei! Shi o kawashite. Shoumetsu no yuugi ni, kogareru kiseki o ubau! SURVIVAL GAAAAAME!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you couldn't help but be impressed by your brother's ability to keep up with the song's pace, not to mention having a superb set of vocal chords made for singing. However,  you needed to talk to him, so you spoke toward your brother and exclaimed, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Hey Adam!!\"</span> As if on cue, Adam instantly stopped singing, recognizing your voice in the process. From there, he turned down the volume on his iPod stereo set, so he could hear you more easily, as he then approached you, where the two of you bumped fists in a friendly gesture and he said, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Good to see you're still in one piece, bro.\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Same here, Adam. Same here. So, what exactly were you singing to, anyway?\" </span>You asked, still somewhat curious about what that song was you just heard moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Oh that? That, my younger brother, was Kuusou Mesorogiwi, by Yousei Teikoku and Yui Itsuki. Apparently, it was used as the opening song for one of my favorite anime, Mirai Nikki. Pretty cool, huh?\" </span>Adam explained, as he slicked his jet black hair some, so it would spike up a little more. However, it was then you noticed what exactly your brother was working on: A voice modulator, which was designed to alter one's voice to disguise themselves from being identified and/or exposed by anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"I'm guessing you made that for me, right?\" </span>You asked, prompting your brother to nod in confirmation, as he then put the voice modulator against his Adam's Apple and throat, causing his voice to sound significantly deeper than his original voice, where he then spoke to you and answered, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Damn straight, Eli.\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\".....Wow. Didn't know your voice can sound so deep.\"</span> You remarked, noticing how deep Adam's voice sounded just now thanks to the voice modulator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that little demonstration, Adam carefully placed the voice modulator back on the workshop countertop where he grabbed it from. Then, you spoke toward Adam once more and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"So, I'm guessing you've already heard the news that we've got an Arachne staying with us.\"</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Mm-hmm! I did. You can say I saw the whole thing that went down back in that street market thanks to me hacking into the city's CCTV cameras.\"</span> Adam replied, confessing that he hacked into the city's surveillance system to use as his eyes and ears throughout Tokyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing your brother, he wasn't just a good inventor, Adam also had become quite the expert hacker these days, allowing him to discreetly access Tokyo's municipal systems with ease, whether it was classified information or just the nearby security cameras. Either way, Adam had become an invaluable asset in your vigilante career. <span class=\"cpblue\">\"I take it you saw what happened and know who those assholes were then, Adam?\" </span>You said, approaching the various sets of monitors gathered around multiple keyboards. In a way, this was your very own Batcomputer.....minus the Batcave, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Of course, obviously. I've managed to identify each individual member of that gang of *ahem* \"assholes\" you've taken down. However, there's one member of this group that caught my attention. Here, see for yourself.\" </span>Adam answered, sitting in the chair that faced the Batcomputer ripoff, typing away on the keyboard with rapid succession, pulling up various digital police files on each member of that gang of racists. However, what Adam wanted to show you was the dossier he put together on a certain racist that you instantly recognized, as you spoke up and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Hey, I recognize him: he was the prick that stole Alma's documents when I interrogated him!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"That's right, brother. Glad to see your memory is intact. Anyway, the guy who stole those documents was identified as Yuichi Gasai. From what I can dig up, he's a very active member of The Sons of Susanoo, an anti-Monster faction known for their extremist views that has become borderline terrorism lately. Recently, this group has claimed responsibility of several bomb attacks upon a Supermarket in Ginza, a Maid Caf\u00e9 in Shibuya, an Arcade Center in Akihabara, and the most recent of these attacks, a Clothing Store within the Tsubaki Shopping Centre in Shinjuku.\"</span> Adam thoroughly explained, leaving no detail undiscovered in his report to you about the Sons of Susanoo faction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, these scumbags did name their group after the legendary warrior Susanoo, who was best known for defeating the 8-headed serpent Yamato-No-Oorochi. However, you had a feeling that this group didn't exactly set up bombs in these random places just for laughs, as you crossed your arms in the process where you then spoke toward your older brother and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"I assume that these places have been extensively renovated to suit both Humans and Monsters?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're definitely becoming quite the detective, aren't you? .....Anyway: Yes, all five of these locations have been heavily renovated to accommodate both Humans and Monsters. The most recent of these places to receive the renovations was the Arcade Center in Akihabara. But the question still remains on what their motivations were for attacking these public areas with explosives.\" Adam replied, contemplating on what the Sons of Susanoo's motives were behind the bombings, seeing this as more than just a mere coincidence or simply another act of hateful violence against monsters. Of course, you theorized that their motives were.......</span></div></div>",

But....what kind of message are we talking about here?\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"That humans and monsters can never peacefully co-exist. Think about it, Adam: all four of these places are known to have a concentrated amount of both humans and monsters mingling and interacting with one another. This shows that there CAN be a peaceful co-existence between humanity and the monsters, something that a group like the Sons of Susanoo would absolutely despise with a burning passion.\" </span>You answered, giving your older brother a theorized guess on what the Sons of Susanoo's motives were behind these inexcusable acts of terrorism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"In other words, they're simply committing these acts of violence out of pure malice.\" </span>Adam remarked, seeing how obvious the motives were when it came to the Sons of Susanoo. However, you then turned your head a little to look at your older brother, arms still crossed, as you then spoke to Adam and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Malice, spite, hatred, stigma. No matter what people call it, it's still prejudice, Adam. I believe the Sons of Susanoo are attempting to create a schism in society between humans and monsters with all these bombings, build up some tension and paranoia as a whole.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Jeez, since when did you get all philosophic on me, Eli? It's as if you're taking this threat seriously.\" </span>Adam replied, noticing how philosophical you sounded just moments ago. Of course, you were taking this situation seriously, as you then spoke toward Adam, your voice sporting a serious no-nonsense tone, and answered, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"I am, brother. After all, the Sons of Susanoo won't stop these bombing attacks until their demands are met: A war between humans and monsters. Like it or not, Adam, we've gotta stop them before they escalate into assassinating people.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Like who?\"</span> Adam asked, raising an eyebrow at you in both curiosity and a sense of uneasiness. From there, you then typed on one of the two keyboards, bringing up some digital newspaper articles about a convention where both humans and monsters are welcome to attend called \"Mon-Con\", as you then highlighted a section of the article where Adam looked at it and said, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Wait a sec, is that?\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"-Mon-Con? Exactly. According to the information on here, Mon-Con is a big convention that promotes and celebrates the friendship between monsters and humans, a prime target for the Sons of Susanoo to engage. However, from what I heard, there are rumors speculating that there's been a recent development regarding the Interspecies Exchange Program, one that allows interspecies marriage between a human and a monster.\" </span>You explained, revealing some startling new information to your older brother in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised to hear such a revelation, Adam's eyes opened wide in both shock and realization, as he then spoke to you and said, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Interspecies Marriage?! Wait a minute: If the Sons of Susanoo get word of such an announcement-\" </span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"They'll start assassinating the representatives of the Interspecies Exchange Program? That's exactly how they will respond, Adam, which is why we need to stop them before their plan bears any fruition.\" </span>You answered, confirming your brother's worries and concerns in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such news, Adam slumped back in the chair a little, where he then looked at you and asked, <span class=\"cgreen\">\".....This is going to be one of those long cases, isn't it?\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Afraid so, brother. After all, Mon-Con doesn't start until 2 weeks from now, meaning we have an ample amount of time to figure what exactly the Sons of Susanoo are planning, stop them from carrying out their mission, and save countless lives in the process. Besides, we've handled tougher cases before, why should this be any different.\" </span>You replied, reassuring Adam that the two of you can do this. Of course, this helped ease your brother's mind some, as the two of you then bumped fists in agreement.</span></div></div>",

After all, you've only just met Alma nearly an hour ago. So, in response, you scratched the back of your head somewhat, as you then spoke up and replied, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Well, I.... I, uh.....\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Oh come on, Eli! You like her, don't you?\"</span> Adam remarked, tugging on your strings a little, just to get a response from you, which was obviously working somewhat.

I'm just not sure if she feels the same about me though.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing those words from you, Adam then stood up from the chair, turned around to face you, as he then put his right hand on your left shoulder and answered, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Eli, I saw her blushing when the two of you entered the hotel lobby. That alone can tell if a person has feelings for you or not. So here's some advice for you: Spend some time with her. You know, get to know her better.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling reassured by your elder brother, you then bumped fists with him once more, as you spoke to Adam and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Thanks for the advice, Adam.\"</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Anytime, brother. Just be careful on what you say to her.\" </span>Adam answered, wrapping his arms around you in a brotherly embrace for a short moment or two before letting you go. From there, Adam returned to sitting in front of the monitors and keyboards, cracking his knuckles, ready to get to work and said, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"In the meantime, I'll use the Ice-Computer to scan for any locations the Sons of Susanoo would use as safehouses. With luck, we should be able to get some useful data.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you were about to exit the workshop, you turned back to look at your brother, raising an eyebrow at the odd name he gave to the Batcomputer ripoff stored in your father's workshop. <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Ice-Computer? Really?! Was that the best name you could come up with for our ripoff of the Batcomputer?\" </span>You asked, questioning why Adam would give it such a horrible name in the first place. But as you facepalmed yourself, Adam looked back at you and replied, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Don't like the name? Okay, \"Ice-Man\": you got a better name than what I got?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Adam had to call you by that unoriginal name the press has dubbed you, since there was already an Ice-Man in the X-Men comics and movies. So, in friendly retaliation, you fired back at your older brother and remarked, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"How does \"The Frost Engine\" sound to you?\" </span> After thinking about it for a moment or two, Adam then spoke back and answered, <span class=\"cgreen\">\".....Frost Engine it is.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, Adam returned to the newly titled Frost Engine, typing away on the two keyboards, searching the city via hacking into Tokyo's numerous CCTV cameras.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally, you would usually bump into your father or your younger brother Connor. Instead of those two however, you accidentally ran into your slightly younger sister, Julie Prentiss. Out of all the siblings in your family, Julie had undergone the most amount of changes since she got here to Japan. One of those lifestyle changes included your sister devoting herself to a hobby she's become quite fond of: Cosplay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you have heard of cosplay before from a few people you knew. From what you've gathered, it was where various people, both male and female, create their own highly detailed costumes and dress up as their favorite character, whether said character came from an anime, manga, movie, TV show, or any other form of media. Although you didn't mind your sister's hobby, you knew for a fact that Julie got into this sort of thing from her 4 newfound friends, Ayame Tatsuno, Shizune Akagami, Ryuko Ginoza, and Kasumi Sotoya. They basically attend the same school as Julie, known as Tsunemori Academy. Also, from what you've overheard, Julie and her 4 friends were part of a school club they've created, aptly called \"The Cosplay Club\", due to all of it's members being avid cosplayers, attending various conventions to show off their handiwork, which has gained them quite the cult following in convention circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, shortly after you unintentionally bumped into her, Julie dropped what appeared to be rolls of colored fabric onto the floor, causing to yell at you a little as she exclaimed, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Eli!! Watch where you're going!\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Sorry! Didn't see you there, sis.\" </span>You apologized, as Julie then bent down to pick up the rolls of fabric dropped on the floor. However, as Julie grabbed each roll of fabric, you managed to get a good long look at what she was currently wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, her hair was now a set of long bright pink hair, which was currently styled into a pair of curly twin tails. Your guess was that she was wearing some sort of special wig, covering up her brown hair in the process. Her skin appeared to be painted a pasty white, while she wore a pair of specialized contact lenses that made the white sclera of her eyes black and her irises a bright red hue, along with sporting blood red lips and red nails. Her clothes were also different as well, which seemed to be close to punk and gothic fashion, as she wore a lowcut red corset with frilled black trim, and paired with a black ruffled miniskirt with a white belt. Not to mention, she also wore a set of red flower earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her neck, Julie was wearing a black leather spiked choker, while she wore a set of black, shoulder-length fingerless gloves with white spike bands. And finally, she currently wore a set of black thigh-high stockings underneath a pair of white zip-up high heel boots. If you had to guess, she looked like some sort of sexy female vampire. <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Uh, Julie? You do realize that it's not exactly Halloween yet, right?\"</span> You sarcastically remarked, obviously letting her know that you're aware of what she's wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I know that! I'm just making sure that everything's set for Mon-Con.\" </span>She answered, just as you got a glimpse of the artificial fangs she implanted on her upper canines. After all, your sister seemed quite excited to go to Mon-Con, since she and the Cosplay Club are allowed to attend the convention as a way to promote their school club. However, it was then she noticed you looking at her as you asked, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"....So, what are you supposed to be? A sexy female vampire?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"What? No! I'm cosplaying as Megumi Shimizu from Shiki!\"</span> Julie exclaimed, feeling a little insulted by your lack of knowledge of the character she was cosplaying as, fuming a little in the process. In response, you then spoke to her and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Okay, okay, I'm sorry! But still, what's with the fabric, anyway? Did Mom put you up to this?\"</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Obviously, yeah. Apparently, she wants to make a costume for your Arachne friend over there.\" </span> Julie explained, just fully aware of Alma's presence, as she carried the rolls of fabric in her arms, walking toward the nearby room where your mother designs fashionable clothes and costumes.</span></div></div>",

After all, you could easily tell that she wasn't exactly the type to strip down in front of people she just met, where you then heard Alma's voice from inside the Sewing Room, as she hesitantly asked, <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Um....A-Are you sure th-that this is necessary, Mrs. Prentiss?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"I'm positive, Alma. After all, we need your exact measurements in order to make sure the costume fits you comfortably. And please, call me Josephine.\" </span>Your mother replied, reassuring the timid Arachne that what she was doing was necessary in making Alma's costume. From there, as Julie entered the room with the rolls of fabric in her arms, you noticed how Alma became a little unnerved upon seeing Julie in full cosplay attire, since your sister did look exactly like Megumi Shimizu from Shiki, right down to the pasty white skin and artificial fangs in her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after placing the rolls of fabric upon a nearby table, Julie turned around and noticed how unnerved Alma was. So in an attempt to calm her down, Julie carefully approached Alma and said, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Hey, take it easy. It's just a costume.\"</span> From there, Julie carefully removed the colored contact lens from her right eye, showing her light brown human eyes toward the female Arachne and said, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"See? It's just makeup. Even my fangs aren't real, they're just for show.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, upon seeing what was shown before her, Alma slowly but surely calmed down, just as Julie re-inserted in colored contact lens into her right eye once more. Obviously confused on what she had just witnessed, Alma then spoke up while your mother began to wrap the measuring tape around Alma's spider abdomen and asked, <span class=\"cviolet\">\"But....I-I don't understand.....W-Why would you dress up like that?\"</span> <span class=\"cdorange\">\"My daughter loves to dress up as characters from Japanese cartoons. She joined her school's costume club and has been like this ever since.\"</span> Your mother answered, explaining to Alma why Julie was dressed up like she is now in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"It's called Cosplay, Mom! And it's anime, not Japanese cartoon! There's a difference.\" </span>Julie explained, correcting her mother in the process. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Sorry, sweetie! You know I'm not exactly into what you kids watch these days.\" </span>Your mother apologized, seeing as how she wasn't as devoted as Julie when it came to watching anime, just as he had finished measuring Alma's physique......well, most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Now then, let's see if we can measure your breast size, dear.\"  </span>Your mother said to Alma, which caused the timid Arachne to wrap her arms around her bra-covered breasts in both defense and embarrassment, as her cheeks blushed a deep crimson hue all over. Of course, Julie attempted to reassure Alma and said, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"It's alright, we're simply just going to take your measurements, nothing more.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Alma slowly lowered her guard, lowering her arms to her sides in the process. From there, your mother then proceeded to wrap the measuring tape around Alma's breasts, causing the Arachne to blush even more than earlier. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Oooh, you're an F-Cup! My, for an Arachne, you're excellently well-endowed, dearie.\" </span>Your mother excitedly said, complimenting  Alma's developed bust, making the shy Arachne blush even more, unsure if she should be embarrassed  or relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you've stayed hidden the whole time during their conversation. However, it was there that you then heard Julie spoke toward Alma and asked, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"So, Alma......what do you think of my brother Eli?\"</span> In turn, this took Alma by surprise, as she put her clothes back on and said, <span class=\"cviolet\">\"W-Why would you say something like that?\"</span> <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Oh it's alright, honey. Julie's a little curious is all. So tell us: What do you think of my son?\" </span>Your mother replied, becoming involved with such a question as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Alma obviously didn't want to answer such a sensitive topic. However, she eventually opened up about the subject, while you keenly listened in on the conversation, where Alma then spoke up and hesitantly answered, <span class=\"cviolet\">\".....He's, um...... H-He's very nice, caring, and um......\"</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">\"It's okay, I think we get kinda get it, Alma.\" </span>Julie said, telling Alma that she doesn't need to say much more, judging from the look of how red the Arachne's cheeks were for that moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think it's time I start my search for Yuichi Gasai. Maybe he can she's some light on his \"friends\" are truly planning.\"</span> You thought to yourself, your face displaying this stern serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 hours later, night had begun to fall upon the city of Tokyo, as you quickly traversed across the numerous rooftops using a combination of parkour and your ice powers. Currently, you were dressed in your vigilante attire, which featured some sleek grey and blue sneakers, grey cargo pants, a pale blue t-shirt with a white snowflake insignia on the front with a lightweight kevlar best underneath to protect yourself from small firearms like pistols, shotguns, and submachine guns (SMGs), along with a grey aviator jacket and black fingerless gloves. Of course, you also had your neckwarmer as well, which covered up the lower half of your face all while wearing a set of winter goggles to disguise yourself better from identification. Underneath your neckwarmer, you had Adam's voice modulator strapped around your neck, with the voice modulator currently touching your adam's apple in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traversing from rooftop to rooftop, you stopped on a rooftop overlooking a bar/strip club, as you then knelt down on one knee to examine the streets below. From there, you then heard your older brother's voice via wireless Bluetooth earpiece on your right ear, where you then heard him speak and asked, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Frost, have you reached the vantage point?\"</span> Of course, just to prevent being compromised, you both decided to use aliases during your vigilante patrols. Adam went with alias \"Eagle Eye\", while you went with the most obvious choice for an alias, \"Frost\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to your multiple patrols, your reputation as the vigilante Frost, has grown considerably, becoming more than just rumors that people gossip about throughout Tokyo, but the local news station, TNS (Tokyo News Station), have begun a \"Frost Forecast\", as a way of spreading the news of your exploits as Frost. Anyway, in response, you spoke into the earpiece and spoke to Adam, the voice modulator masking your actual voice, causing you to have a deeper voice when speaking, and answered, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Affirmative, Eagle Eye. Judging from your extensive research on him, I'm guessing Gasai frequently visits this establishment.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Correct, Frost. According to the CCTV cameras within the area, Yuichi Gasai frequently visits this specific bar strip club combo every day for the past 2 to 3 weeks. Of course, we're not sure of what his reasons are for visiting this place in a regular basis, but that's for you to find the answer.\"</span> Adam explained, only speculating as to why Yuichi Gasai would regularly visit this certain place for the past several weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"And speaking of that bastard.....\" </span>You said, just as you quickly noticed him exiting the bar/strip club, straightening his jacket in the process. From there he turned left and started walking down the sidewalk, as you then stood up and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"He's heading down Tsubaki Avenue. I'm going to cut him off and have a \"nice\" chat with him.\"</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Just remember, Frost: We need him alive and conscious if we're going to get any information out him.\" </span>Adam answered, reminding you of what was required to interrogate him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Noted. Frost out.\" </span>You replied, as you then used your ice powers to launch yourself onto another rooftop across the street, where you then landed in a nearby alleyway, ready to intercept the Sons of Susanoo member. From there, as he was clearly in your view, you quickly yanked Gasai into the dark alleyway, where he landed stomach first onto the pavement. \"What the hell?!\" He said, just as you then pinned him down with your ice powers, since he landed in a large man-sized puddle, which was rendered frozen by your ice powers, encasing his legs and arms in the icy trap, as he laid there in a crawling position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as you put your foot on his back, you looked down at him and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Hello, Yuichi Gasai. Remember me?\"</span> Obviously, he didn't recognize you at first due to the voice modulator altering your voice, but he easily recognized the same situation he was in from earlier, as he turned his head and noticed you as he yelped, \"Oh no, it's you! You.....Y-You're Frost!\" <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Aww, you remember me. I'm touched!\" </span>You replied, where you then gave him a swift kick to the abdomen, as he then spoke out of fear and asked, \"W-What do you want?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you grabbed Gasai by the back of his head and answered, <span class=\"cpblue\">\".....What I WANT!!, Yuichi, is information. I know what you and those overzealous fanatics are doing, and I don't like it one tiny bit. I know of the bombings in Shinjuku, Ginza, Shibuya, and Akihabara. And I know that your fellow Sons of Susanoo are directly responsible for these acts of terrorism. So if you want to live with all of your limbs still attached, then tell me what your comrades are planning!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Yuichi didn't talk, he tried to block out the numbing pain but to no avail, as you then made the ice creep further up his legs, causing his body temperature to be lowered by 7 degrees fahrenheit, making him shiver in the process. Eventually, he yelped, \".....Okay, O-Okay, I-I'll t-talk!!\" <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Then start talking!\" </span>You demanded, squeezing the information out of Yuichi Gasai, as he then spoke up and confessed, \"The Sons of Susanoo are trying to stir up tensions between humans and monsters. T-They'll kill anyone who sympathizes with those damn freaks! B-But our leader, Kenji Takamoto, wants to attack a convention that's c-coming up in the next two w-weeks!\" <span class=\"cpblue\">\"You're too kind.\" </span>You sarcastically remarked, as you then quickly knocked him unconscious, now knowing that the Sons of Susanoo's next target was confirmed to be Mon-Con. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Did you get anything out of him?\"</span> Adam asked, just as you then responded and answered, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"I did. Turns out they are going to attack Mon-Con after all. Give an anonymous call to the TMPD. Let them know I got Yuichi Gasai in the alleyway in Tsubaki Avenue.\"</span> Of course, when you meant by TMPD, you were referring to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, as you then quickly traversed back up onto the rooftops while Adam spoke to you and replied, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Understood, Frost. Police cruisers are on their way now.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that your hunch was right, you now knew that the Sons of Susanoo were definitely gunning for the Mon-Con convention in the next two weeks, which meant you had to find out how their plan will play out once they commence the attack.</span></div></div>",

Having to alternate between the life with your family and the life of the vigilante Frost, you pretty much had your hands full. However, over the course of 7 days, you noticed a slight change in Alma: she seemed to be slowly gaining some self-confidence over the course of a single week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as for how confident she was, well......she seemed to have become more social with your family, including your 3 siblings, your mother and father, and even your family's butler Adrian. However, the female Arachne still showed signs of being timid from time to time. You figured that maybe the reason why Alma was gaining some self-confidence was because of the time she spent with you and your family, almost as if she had a bit of an anxiety disorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she was occasionally confused when your sister Julie would change up her cosplay outfit and appearance, almost looking like a completely different person. After all, you remembered when 6 days ago, Alma expected Julie to walk out dressed up as Megumi Shimizu from Shiki, but instead, Julie came out dressed up as Suiseiseki from Rozen Maiden. Fortunately, unlike you and your brothers, Julie wouldn't yell at Alma while bluntly telling her who she's supposed to be. Instead, Julie would allow Alma to guess who her character is, which eventually resulted in your sister calmly telling the female Arachne who she's cosplaying as. You figured that it was between two girls on why Julie wasn't yelling at Alma like she would with you, Adam, or Connor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Frost, your investigation into the Sons of Susanoo's planned attack on Mon-Con has gained some momentum, shedding some light into what sort of attack they were going to execute upon the upcoming convention. Apparently, the Sons of Susanoo were planning on using bombs packed with a devastating cocktail mix of White Phosphorus and Napalm, which were considered as highly illegal contraband in Japan due to their destructive potential on both hostiles and civilians alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, due to your investigation into their operations, the Sons of Susanoo attempted to stay hidden for a while, having discreet meetings, covering their tracks, and destroying any further evidence regarding their planned attack on Mon-Con. However, with Mon-Con only seven days away, you knew you had to dig deeper into their operations, i.e the bomb schematics, where the bombs would be placed during the convention, and how to disarm the explosives, along with finding out how many of their operatives are already inside Mon-Con. Overall, the situation had become a bit more dire than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as for what you were doing right now, you were currently.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Currently, you were eating breakfast alongside your mother, Adam, Julie, and Connor, with Alma sitting beside you, using two stools as a makeshift chair for her lower 8-legged spider half. However, your father already left for work, as you ate some Belgian waffles with pulp-free orange juice, while your sister had some cereal with milk, your mother had French Toast with a cup of tea, Connor had two Cinnamon Pop-Tarts, and Adam ate a small stack of pancakes covered in maple syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlma on the other hand, had a completely different kind of breakfast. Due to her Arachne physiology, she would be known to drink blood like a real spider would, due to the small fangs on Alma's upper canines, as she drank a cup of blood from a glass chalice, using her fangs to suck up the blood inside her mouth. However, you decided to strike up a conversation, as you looked at Julie and asked, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Julie, you said earlier that you were getting everything set for Mon-Con, right? So, why are you attending that convention, anyway?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"....You know one of my friends at the Cosplay Club, Ayame? Well apparently, her family was chosen to be the host family of a female Lamia. I think her name was Irenka. Anyway, she was given permission to attend the same school as me, Ayame, and the others. Irenka's now the first extra-species member of the Cosplay Club, and thanks to that, we can attend Mon-Con. Currently, we plan on having her cosplay as Cassiopeia from League of Legends.\"</span> Julie explained, going into detail on how she and her friends were able to participate in Mon-Con.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"That sounds nice, Julie. Perhaps you should invite your friends over someday.\" </span>Your mother replied, drinking a sip of her tea in the process. From there, Julie then spoke once more and answered, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Actually, Mom. They're coming over here today. Ayame, Shizune, Ryuko, Kasumi, even Irenka.\"</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">\"But, why are your friends coming over here, Julie?\" </span>Alma asked, a little confused and hesitant, especially when it came to meeting new people right off the bat. Fortunately, Julie reassured Alma some and explained, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"...Don't worry, Alma. Ayame and the others are really good friends of mine. After all, I've met Irenka twice now, and she seems pretty nice. Though as for why they're coming over here, well we're trying to prepare for Mon-Con, since we got ourselves VIP Access passes due to a contest we've won almost a month ago, not to mention we're trying to choose our costumes to wear during that time. So yeah, we got a lot of work to do.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after taking a sip of his coffee, Adam then spoke toward his younger sister and said, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Sounds like you've got a lot on your plate, Julie.\"</span> <span class=\"clkhaki\">\"Speaking of stuff, have you seen the news about Frost?\" </span>Connor asked, bringing up the topic about your vigilante alias, since your younger brother was a fan of superheroes. In response, Adam decided to satisfy his little brother's question and replied, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"What did you find out, Connor?\" </span> <span class=\"clkhaki\">\"Well, from what I've heard on the news, the police were called by someone to arrest Yuichi Gasai. When they got there, he was pinned down by ice. That man said it was Frost who did this to him.\" </span>Connor answered,  obviously enthusiastic about proving the existence of the vigilante known as Frost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing skeptical about what she heard, Julie then spoke toward Connor and said, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Alright, then why would Frost call the cops on some guy?\"</span> <span class=\"clkhaki\">\"Julie! It's because Yuichi Gasai was part of that terrorist group, the Sons of Susanoo! You know, the people responsible for bombing those places all over the city.\" </span>Connor explained, disclosing the information at hand. From there, your mother put her two cents into the conversation as well and said, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"I heard about them.... They're the people who hate extra-species like Alma, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\">\"That's right, Mom! Apparently, the Sons of Susanoo are very much against the Cultural Exchange Between Special Bill, as well as the Interspecies Exchange Program. In other words, they really really hate monsters with a passion. They went as so far as terrorism in order to make a point.\" </span>Connor answered,  explaining even more of the topic at hand.</span></div></div>",

From there, as the doors slid open simultaneously, there stood Julie's BFFs from the Cosplay Club at Tsunemori Academy: Ayame Tatsuno, Shizune Akagami, Ryuko Ginoza, and Kasumi Sotoya. Along with them, Irenka was also present as well, currently wearing a winter coat due to her cold-blooded physiology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, Irenka had a long scaly blue snake tail, which had these white tiger stripes on the back. She had long blonde hair that was put into a braided ponytail, showing her blue pointed Lamia ears and her sky blue eyes. Aside from that, you noticed that she had a modest breast size underneath that coat of hers. Of course, in response to seeing her friends, Julie wrapped them in a big hug and said, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Girls! It's so good to see you again!\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"It's great to see ya too, Julie! So, how's it going?\"</span> Ryuko asked, where Julie then lets go of her friends and answered, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Oh, it's going good so far. Anyway, welcome to my home! Come in, I got everything set up for us.\"</span> From there, your sister gestured both her four friends and Irenka to exit the elevator and enter her home. In all honesty, Julie's friends were amazed that Julie's family was able to afford this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Shizune noticed you and your family, as she spoke toward Julie and asked, <span class=\"corange\">\"So, I'm guessing that's your family, Julie?\"</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Yep, that's them, Shizune! This is my older brother, Adam.\"</span> Julie explained, as she began to introduce each of your family members one by one. Of course, Adam looked at them and said, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Nice to meet you, girls.\"</span> \"That's my slightly older brother, Eli.\" Julie said, shifting to you, where you looked at Julie's friends and replied, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Hey.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"That's my Mom, Josephine Prentiss.\"</span> Julie explained, now shifting over toward your mother, who waved at the four girls and one Lamia and answered, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"You must be her friends. Julie told me a lot about you and your school club.\"</span> From there, Julie then shifted the focus toward Connor and said, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"That's my younger brother, Connor.\"</span> <span class=\"clkhaki\">\"Hi there!\"</span> Connor replied, waving at them in greetings. Finally, Julie introduced Alma to her friends, making the timid Arachne turn around to face them and said, <span class=\"chotpink\">\"And this here is our friendly neighborhood Arachne, Alma.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Alma was very shy at first, but she eventually waved to them with a shaky hand and hesitantly replied, <span class=\"cviolet\">\"...H-Hello.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Wow, seems my family's not the only one that was chosen to have an extra-species live with them.\" </span>Ayame said, admitting that Alma did look cute as a shy Arachne. But then, you heard Irenka speak for the first time, as she examined Alma for a second or two and said, <span class=\"cindigo\">\"Funny. I thought Arachnes were supposed to be.....sadistic.\"</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Well, she was harassed by a gang of racist jerks until my brother Eli arrived and kicked their asses, Irenka.\"</span> Julie explained to Irenka, confessing why Alma was behaving like she was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Irenka took what your sister said with a grain of salt, backing away from Alma in the process as she said, <span class=\"cindigo\">\"....I suppose that you have a point there, Julie.\"</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Now then, what do you say we get to work on our costumes for Mon-Con?\" </span>Julie asked, as her friends nodded in agreement.

However, the locals prefer to call it by it's more popular name, \"Tokyo Big Sight\". According to the information that Adam managed to get access to, Tokyo Big Sight was confirmed to be the location for this year's Mon-Con. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently you stood there, looking down at the blueprint schematics that showed every section of the Tokyo International Exhibition Center, including the Conference Tower, the East Exhibition Hall, and  the West Exhibition Hall. After all, you were looking for areas within Tokyo Big Sight that would create the most amount of casualties when those White Phosphorus-Napalm bombs are detonated. In other words, you were searching for areas where the most amount of both people and monsters would gather in a crowd, which in turn, would accumulate numerous casualties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"So, remind me what we're looking for exactly, Eli?\"</span> Adam asked, who was currently examining the schematics of the bombs that the Sons of Susanoo were making for their attack on Mon-Con within the week. From there, you spoke toward your brother while continuing your examination of the building schematics and answered, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Figuring out a way to prevent as many casualties as possible.

It's just that....I can't help but feel like there's more going on than what we're actually facing.\" </span>Adam explained, feeling as if there was some shady individuals working behind the shadows, supporting and manipulating those who want to eradicate any and all extra-species. For a moment there, you too thought of such a scenario as well, agreeing with your older brother somewhat, just as you looked back at him and replied, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"....Maybe. But if there is someone behind the scenes pulling strings like some twisted puppeteer, we'll find 'em eventually.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"*sigh*....I hope you're right.

I can't say I'm disappointed in my hunch, Mr. Prentiss.\"</span> A voice rang out, causing both you and your older brother to look toward the voice's source, only to see an adult woman you weren't exactly familiar with. In appearance, she had a slim but voluptuous figure, sporting a pair of pale brown eyes, which were covered by a set of black sunglasses, along with displaying long straight black hair that reached just above her rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her choice of clothing, she appeared to be some sort of government agent, wearing a white dress shirt with a black tie, along with a black blazer jacket and matching professional skirt, complete with black pantyhose and heeled shoes. However, you couldn't help but feel like you've met this woman before, as Adam stood up and went to greet her, shaking her hand in the process as he said, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Ms. Kuroko Smith, glad you decided to come over here.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it hit you like a bed of nails, you HAVE met her before! On the phone, back when you've called Adrian to pick up you and Alma a little over a week ago!  This was the same woman who knew about your vigilante career as Frost: Ms. Kuroko Smith. <span class=\"cpblue\">\"WHAT THE HELL, ADAM!?! Why did you invite her over here!?!\" </span>You yelled, obviously not too happy at what your brother has done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Calm down, Eli! I invited Ms. Smith over here to look over the evidence we've gathered from our investigation into the Sons of Susanoo. After all, this is something that the Cultural Exchange Security Squad and M.O.N should be fully aware of. So please, give her a chance.\" </span>Adam explained, trying to get you to relax some, despite the fact that Ms. Smith blackmailed you a little sometime ago. Of course, you pounded your fist once onto the table surface out of frustration, then looked at your brother and Ms. Smith and answered, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"....Fine! But if she starts leaking out info about me being a vigilante, I'll kick her ass. Got it?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\">\"Crystal. So tell me, Adam: What have you and your *ahem* brother discovered in your investigation?\" </span>Ms. Smith asked, which prompted Adam to show her the bomb schematics, as well as the information on what the Sons of Susanoo's plans are for these anti-personnel explosives, while he spoke toward Ms. Smith and explained, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"To be quite honest, Ms. Smith, it's somewhat worse than we expected. Judging from the schematics, the bombs that the Sons of Susanoo were making have a cocktail mix of White Phosphorus and Napalm. Both are highly flammable chemicals, along with being highly illegal contraband in Japan due to their destructive potential.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"In other words, these bastards want to burn and maim as many people as possible, as well as cause numerous casualties, on both humans and monsters.\" </span>You bluntly replied, still looking through the municipal blueprints of the Tokyo International Exhibition Center AKA Tokyo Big Shot. Of course, you knew what M.O.N stood for: Monster Ops: Neutralization, which was a specialized unit comprised of four extraspecies girls. It was created to handle \"untouchable\" situations regarding to any extraspecies lawbreakers, since regular police are unable to do their jobs and arrest them due to the certain flaws within the Cultural Exchange Between Species Bill, whether it was the human law enforcement is unable to arrest extraspecies lawbreakers, or the other way around with extraspecies law enforcement unable to arrest human criminals and lawbreakers. After all, this was the very reason why you decided to become a vigilante, because vigilantes work outside the law, just like Batman, Daredevil, or even the Punisher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was there that Ms. Smith noticed this annoyed look on your face, as she looked at you and remarked, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Oh I'm sorry, am I bothering you?\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Heh! Says the woman who happens to be very irresponsible at her job.\" </span>You said, revealing some information you've discovered on Ms. Smith, as you then continued and said, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Oh yeah, I know your dirty secrets, Smith. The reason why you've been so damn irresponsible and careless at your job is because you've been overworked with all your current duties, never getting a single pay raise when you take on new responsibilities by your superiors.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this somewhat easily got on Ms. Smith's nerves, as her smug of a smirk turned into a look of frustration, where she then spoke to you and asked, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"And what makes you any different from me? You had your whole lifestyle handed to you on a silver platter.\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Maybe. But unlike you, I worked my frozen ass off to protect the people of this city. Being a vigilante isn't about hoping you get paid for your deeds, it's about doing the right thing. I get it: You've been stressed out from your job, but that DOESN'T give you a goddamn excuse to make other peoples' lives a living hell!! So if you want MY help, I suggest you stop whining and complaining like a spoiled brat, and start acting like someone who wants to preserve the peace between humans and monsters!\" </span>You answered, saying what you had on your mind at full blast, which felt very satisfying to you personally. Of course, the reaction on Ms. Smith's face was priceless as well, for she had this look of....</span></div></div>",

After all, if the Sons of Susanoo do want to cause as many casualties as possible, that's where they'll strike.\" </span>Adam explained, pointing toward the West Exhibition Hall on the Tokyo Big Sight blueprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as she crossed her arms, Ms. Smith then spoke toward Adam once more and asked, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"And what happens if there are survivors, or if we do disarm the bombs?\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"They'll most likely send in their soldiers and lieutenants if something has gone awry in their plans. They'll be armed with automatic weapons as well, since I've discovered enough crates of the stuff to take over both Shinjuku and Shibuya in almost a single day.\"</span> You answered, speaking instead of your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Ms. Smith almost seemed to be annoyed by the fact that you're basically subtly saying \"Whether you like it or not, you need me if you want to stop this attack\". After all, since both you and Adam now realize that Julie and her friends were going to attend Mon-Con, this ordeal became personal for both of you. <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Very well, keep me informed on the situation.\" </span>Ms. Smith replied, where she then left your father's workshop and out of your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after she left, Adam looked at you with a \"What the hell were you thinking?!\" face, as he then spoke to you and asked, <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Remind me why you antagonized her like that?\"</span> <span class=\"cpblue\">\"Because someone needed to remind her that this isn't a goddamn game when peoples' lives are dangling by a thread. Like it or not, she needs us if she wants to stop their terrorist attack on Mon-Con, Adam.\" </span>You answered, as you looked at your older brother with a \"This is serious\" look on your face.</span></div></div>",

Now then, for those who happen to be either confused or curious about these two subspecies, then allow me to elaborate on your situation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMALL ARACHNE<br>\r\nA subspecies smaller than the standard arachne, Small Arachne are easily distinguishable from the regular arachne due to their almost child-like appearance. Their legs are short, but in exchange for their small physique, they are capable of moving much faster than the average arachne, along with being good at jumping and full of energy. Instead of spinning webs like their larger brethren, Small Arachne scurry around on the ground in search of prey. Although they can produce thread, Small Arachne only use this reserve of webbing  to either stop or slow down their descent when falling from high places to prevent any injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLONG LEG ARACHNE<br>\r\nSometimes called \"Long Legs\", these large subspecies of arachne are recognized by having thinner and longer legs than the standard arachne, hence the name. Aside from having a mild-mannered personality, this arachne subspecies cannot produce thread, but they can move surprisingly quickly to secure their prey. A Long Leg Arachne's hunting instincts are so powerful that they will sometimes abandon the prey they have captured to pursue new prey. As they are especially uncompromising regarding the extermination of household pests, Long Leg Arachne are respectfully known among those troubled by such pests as \"sergeants\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now that you know more about these two arachne subspecies, which one will you choose? The Long Leg Arachne, or the Small Arachne?</span></div></div>",

You always hated bullies, especially ones that attacked girls. Even though you were goth, this was something that you couldn't let them get away with. You then charged the crowd and assumed a fighting stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, leave that girl alone!\" you yelled angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buzz off goth!

You delivered a brutal take-down of the adults, unaware of the girl staring at you in awe. By the time the brawl ended, you noticed some papers in the back of the first adult's pants. You took them out and gasped in shock when you saw your family as her host family before you grabbed the man by his collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are her documents.

She should've stayed with her monster family!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you brutally punched him repeatedly in the face until he slipped into unconsciousness. You then turned around and tried to help the girl up. You then saw that she had bright pink hair, four sea foam green eyes, and fair skin. She wasn't really developed since she looked like a small child, but you noticed that she was blushing heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" you asked. \"My name is Hiro Archer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only stared in awe before she responded. \"I need some help.

Thank you! Thank you! I couldn't defend myself against regular humans! It was so kind of you to intervene!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled awkwardly from her embrace, but you relented when you saw her adorable sea foam green eyes. It was that you noticed other features about her. She wore a red shirt on her human half while her spider-half matched her pink legs. She had clawed hands and forearms with red opera gloves which exposed her pink fingertips. Her pink hair was also relatively short, not even reaching her shoulders, but with a red barrette in the left side of her hair. Although, she had gotten a few cuts and bruises on parts of her body, but nothing that would warrant a hospital visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we should get you home.

While they knew about the existence of monsters, they hadn't ever seen a Small Arachne like Lorna before, if you remembered the guidebook you'd read for a class assignment correctly. Still, your graduation was only a few weeks away and you were looking forward to it. You both soon reached your ordinary 2-story home as you unlocked the mahogany brown door. While the interior was typical, Lorna seemed to be in awe when she first saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is such a cool home!\" Lorna said in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing special.

However, these aren't the Zombies from Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead, and here's why:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZOMBIE<br>\r\nKnown amongst the populace as living corpses or the living dead, Zombies are a non-human species that were formerly humans, brought back from the dead, becoming one of the walking dead due to the work of a special infectious disease. Although they can still move, they are still corpses, which means that any sustained injuries and wounds will not heal like a living body would. Aside from that, a Zombie's body will decay unless appropriate measures are taken to counteract this. Fortunately, with the recent establishment of preservation technology, they are able to live much like humans, courtesy of an antiseptic fluid that serves as a blood substitute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEARLY ZOMBIE<br>\r\nZombies created before the eventual establishment of preservation technology. To prevent any further decay, these types of Zombies spend most of their time in cold refrigerated rooms, and are only able to go outside during the freezing winter periods. However, because of their incomplete preservation, the brains of Early Zombies are....not entirely intact. In turn, this makes them very easygoing, coupled with the energy levels of a person who had just woken up.</span></div></div>",

Unlike the standard zombie, Jiang Shi are severely affected by the symptoms of a debilitating condition known as rigor mortis. In turn, this causes their joints, especially in their elbows and knees, to become particularly stiff. Due to this unfortunate side effect, Jiang Shi must practice Tai Chi every morning to stretch , allowing their limbs to bend and flex like normal human joints. However, their joints always stiffen to some degree while they sleep, forcing the Jiang Shi to hop around with their elbows and knees locked up in a straight position when they wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMUMMY<br>\r\nNamed after the preserved remains of Pharaohs from Ancient Egypt, Mummies are a zombie subspecies from dry desert areas such as Egypt or any other country with desert within a nation's borders. Miraculously, their arid environment keeps a Mummy from decaying like their undead relatives. And even without preservative technology, their bodies still remain intact. But as a side effect, their arid environment has also robbed a Mummy's skin of it's moisture, requiring them to take long baths to replenish their fluids. Alternatively, they supplement this by sucking the life force out of young men to preserve their beauty, but this functions only as a placebo. However, since many of these Mummies were ancient royalty or even nobility in life, expect them to come with.....difficult personalities.</span></div></div>",

In appearance, Ogres have brown skin, one or two horns protruding from their forehead, and have pointed ears.

Despite their sheer size, many Ogres are known to have laid-back and carefree personalities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGIGANTES<br>\r\nThe largest of their kind, Gigantes are a massive ogre subspecies, reaching heights greater than ten meters tall in height, showing how truly giant they are. Because of their massive size, a Gigantes can easily injure a group of humans with their massive bodies if they are not too careful. When they have nothing to do, Gigantes spend their time quietly holding still. As an unfortunate result, fashion is hardly a concern for a Gigantes, since there are practically no clothes large enough for these titanic beauties to wear, so they dress themselves in whatever rags they can use to preserve some sense of public order and decency.

However, you weren't exactly alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all began the other day when fate dealt you a rather strange hand. An Interspecies Exchange Officer named Ms. Smith came to your door with a rather beautiful monster girl. The monster girl's name was Keiko and she was an Oni, a subspecies of the Ogre race. She had red skin, long ebony hair that she kept in a ponytail, and amethyst eyes. She was somewhat well-endowed, not ridiculously, but still enough to turn some heads and about a head taller than you. She wore a tiger stripped shirt, blue jeans, and red sneakers.It goes without saying that when you first saw her, you couldn't even breathe. However, the rules of the Interspecies Exchange Bill were clear; there was no chance of sex before marriage without facing the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Smith gave you a pamphlet about the Oni race and left you to your own devices as Keiko's host family. Based on the pamphlet, Onis were very big eaters, but money wasn't a problem since the Interspecies Exchange Office footed the bill for all of your monster girl expenses. Also, you discovered that Onis particularly enjoyed meat, or more specifically...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Look at the steak!\" Keiko cried cheerfully as she practically dragged you to the meat section of the farmer's market. \"Porterhouse, sirloin, flank, it all looks good, Kai-kun!\" Keiko said hungrily as she eyed the different steaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

Anyway, for those who don't have a clue about these two breeds of monster girls, then allow me to elaborate:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDOPPELGANGER<br>\r\nAlso known as \"the shadow people\", Doppelgangers are a non-human species that can take on any appearance using their phantasmagoric hair. Basically, they are actually shapeshifters, and are unrelated to the paranormal phenomenon and harbingers of death known as doppelgangers. They do not wear clothes and instead spend most of their time naked, but as their appearance is not their true form, their nudity causes them no shame. Oddly enough, these mysterious creatures share much in common with the mythological \"Faceless God\", and little is known regarding their true nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDRAGONNEWT<br>\r\nAlso known as dragonmaids, Dragonnewts are a dragon-like non-human species. Like Lamias, they are similar to other reptile species. Dragonnewts boast about their lineage, being incredibly proud of their relation to dragons, the pinnacle of all living things. But in reality though, they are simply no more than winged lizards, since their wings are much too small for legitimate flight. According to their physiological anatomy, there is a backwards-facing scale located somewhere on their body, which happens to be their weakness. However, if one were to strike at that scale, it would cause the Dragonnewt to be paralyzed from the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They have deer-like horns on their heads and long tails, but unlike dragonnewts, they have no wings, making them appear to be lizardmen at first glance. They live much longer than humans, up to ten times a normal human lifespan. Like dragonewts, their backwards-facing scale is also their weakness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wyvern</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike dragonewts, their arms and wings are joined, meaning their wings are large enough to fly. They are very good fliers. They are much more wild than the rational dragonewt and ryu-jin and are extremely aggressive.

However, for those who are unaware of these two unique entities, then stay awhile and listen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDULLAHAN<br>\r\nBeing somewhat related to the mythical Headless Horseman from the tale of Ichabod Crane &amp; Sleepy Hollow, the Dullahan are an extremely rare non-human species with a separate head and body. However, unlike Zombies and their subspecies, Dullahans are not one of the undead, but rather a living creature. While the head and body are connected, the head actually controls the body. But when they are separated, a Dullahan's body acts independently, making them one of the more....mysterious non-human species. They call themselves gods of death and dress as such, but as this cannot be scientifically proven, the truth is simply unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDRYAD<br>\r\nKnown for their affinity toward nature, Dryads are a plantlike non-human species. Their qualities are similar to those of small to medium-sized trees or vines. Though they are easygoing and mild-mannered, Dryads tend to not associate themselves with other species (this is true of all plantlike species). However, exceptions are made for those who do not harm them or provide them with care, and they sometimes open their hearts toward helpful members of other species. The humanoid parts of a Dryad's body change according to the amount of nutrients and water they have absorbed. Regardless of their actual age, this makes it impossible to determine a Dryad's age by appearance alone. Additionally, plantlike species do not wear clothing.</span></div></div>",

However, if you intend on being a host family to one of these mythical equivalents to Poison Ivy, then allow me to hand you the information:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALRAUNE<br>\r\nLike the Dryads, Alraunes are a plantlike non-human species, but with flowerlike qualities. Like the other plantlike species, Alraunes are pretty timid. But as they use cross-pollination rather than self-pollination to procreate, Alraunes require other species to mate (primarily humans), and they are known to be very friendly toward other species. According to the scientific reports, the humanoid sections of an Alraune's body correspond to the flowers of plants, and they resemble beautiful women in order to attract pollination partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMANDRAGORA<br>\r\nAlso known as Mandrakes, Mandragoras are a plantlike non-human species with rootlike qualities. Even among the timid plantlike species, Mandragora are known for being exceptionally timid and cowardly, and they are not so much xenophobic as being extremely shy. Unlike the legends, the scream a Mandragora emits when removed from the earth isn't actually fatal. But since their scream is very loud, it does sometimes cause loss of consciousness for those standing in the vicinity.</span></div></div>",

They have dog ears, paw pads on their hands and feet, a functional medium-length canine tail, and short hair covering their bodies. The entire species jointly owns rich mineral deposits, where they are among the wealthiest of non-human species as a result of such riches. Like their four-legged counterparts, Kobolds are extremely friendly toward all species and use their aforementioned wealth to operate service facilities for other species in all parts of the world. Although all members of the Kobold species take daily walks in both the morning and evening, these so-called \"walks\" happen to be long-distance runs. After all, due to their athletic physique, it is not uncommon for a Kobold to cover over 50 kilometers (31.069 miles) in a single day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.

You then noticed that she moved both of her hands down her crotch and that her tail was standing straight up. You were confused, so you took out the Kobold manual that came with her. You flipped through the pages until you found the section that described her behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, uncomfortable lips, hands on crotch, tail straight up...oh.\" You said quietly. According to what you read, Sakura needed to pee. During slumber, Kobolds sleep the same as humans, but it takes them longer to wake up and they usually need to pee badly when that happens. They wake up and look for the nearest tree unless it it really bad and are very close to wetting themselves...which Sakura looked like right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura opened her brown eyes and whimpered nervously like an actual dog. Kobolds didn't usually have to pee this bad, but Sakura slept in and had neglected to take care of her need before she slept. \"Ah, gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee!\" Sakura yelled as she jammed both hands in her crotch and bounced around like a child. She seemed to be unaware of your presence, but she noticed you after a few moments and stared at you in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raiden-kun...why are you in my room?\" Sakura asked innocently, even though she was ready to burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, this is my room. You must have slept in here by accident.\" you responded, trying not to seem excited by having Sakura in your room. While she hardly wore anything during the day, she was dressed in a satin black bra and panties that left very little to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I was on my way to use a tree in the night, but I was so groggy that I collapsed in your room.\" Sakura said, only to return to her desperate state. \"Raiden-kun...I'm going to mark my territory soon. I can't make it outside. It's going to come out!\" Sakura squealed desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

There's no trees in the house.\" Sakura said through clenched teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Kobold bathrooms have trees in them?\" you asked in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura promptly nodded, although she was in a lot of pain. \"We each have our own tree back home. I've been using the garden to um...\"empty\" myself. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've never used a toilet?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a toilet? All I saw was a weird chair and a bathtub.\" Sakura said only to return to her desperate behavior. \"Would it be okay for me to mark your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'll sow you how to use a toilet. You'll feel better, really. I don't want to see you in pain.\" you said sincerely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stared at you for a few moments with a small blush on her face. She'd never needed help to relieve herself, but he was offering to because he couldn't bear to see her in pain? Sakura then nodded and they slowly made their way to the bathroom. Sakura winced; every step in this state was pure agony for her bladder. She thought it was a miracle that she hadn't let out a single drop of pee, but she was getting there. By the time they reached the bathroom, Sakura looked ready to burst, with tears and pee. However, she gave a very relieved smile when she heard what you had to say after you lifted up the toilet lid for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you need to do is sit, pull your panties down, and let the good times flow.\" you said, giving a basic understanding of the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?!\" Sakura asked excitedly, mostly because she was moments away from an accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'll just wait outside while you do your business.\" you said as you escorted her to the toilet and sat her down before departing and closing the door. You then heard a few panicked squeals, which was quickly followed by the sound of pee hhitting the water and a very relieved sigh,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Raiden-kun!\" Sakura said from behind the door. \"It sounds like rushing water!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'll do that when you've held it in for too long.\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited for Sakura to finish...</span></div></div>",

In case you need descriptions, let's see what exactly they are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lesser Devils</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith horns on their heads, bat wings on their backs, and tails with arrow-shaped points, this non-human species has a truly devilish appearance. Though they appear to be human children, they are actually fully grown, and their apparent age is not necessarily their actual age. They enjoy playing pranks, such as teasing and scaring others, and they can even use simple hypnotism techniques. However, their physical abilities are similar to those of children, making them weak to counterattacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Greater Devils</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are largely similar to lesser devils, except they have the bodies of humans in their late teens. They are not more mature lesser devils, but rather their own devil species. They enjoy dressing in human fashion and venturing into the city at night to play malicious pranks. However, because their actual age is greater than their apparent age, much like lesser devils, they are out of fashion trends popular among younger people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/2IF0VHV.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/2IF0VHV.png</a>) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now you know.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alright guys, this one is a bit of an odd twist on top of the anime choices I've focused on, so in this case, we have newer rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Following the Rules of the \"Interspecies Exchange Bill\" <br>\r\n   <br>\r\nA: Humans cannot harm any other species, that goes for the monsters as well, in this case of the story, accidental hits or something like in the anime is fine, but pure abuse is a HELL NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: A monster girl cannot be alone without their host family. meaning they cannot go out alone, but if its a quick errand, you can  leave her at your home for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Intercourse between human and another species is STRICTLY prohibited. However in my story, the only way around it, is if you are married to said monster girl. Now as for that, my rule is, you CANNOT start your story arc with a wife. try to build it up my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. If you do end up getting to the point of intercourse with your monster girl, you can attempt to make it realistic as you can. The best way I can actually explain this is ooooh, the \"Hentai\" game, Monster Girl Quest. check out the centaur girl in that one for an example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Do try your best to build up a relationship here. this isn't pure erotica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. I do not mind what names you go with, appearances, etc. However if you do end up using powers such as I do with my Chaos options, try to use them as a LAST Resort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. As of now, there will be NO power that makes someone fall in love with you, control them, or ANYTHING like that. The women have free will people<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. NO RAPE<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please make a decent sized entry here. no 3 or 4 line entries here. I like seeing effort to make a good stories like some people aside from me create.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. if you are going to end up basing your character on something from another anime, say DBZ, if you go Super Saiyan or something do have the power put a strain on the characters body, in other words, make it something he wouldn't use often if he didn't have something to protect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope you all enjoy my work in this one. and I hope you all can make stories as well. <br>\r\n</td>",
