The shop merchant was headed to his store when he noticed some black goo on the side of Goats Man bridge. People around these parts were always looking for weird shit to buy this stuff would clearly sell if he could only come up with a name for it...something like Demon Blood. There was a lot of it too it would sell easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou live at home in Denton with your parents and two brothers. You\u2019re Levi the oldest at twenty and 6\u20195 then there was August the middle child at 16  and 6\u20191 and Damien the youngest at 12 who was only 5\u20195. For the most part you all got along there of course was sibling rivalry but what family didn\u2019t?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you arrived at the general store there was a saloon next door but none of you ever went in (or so everyone is lead to believe). As you walk in right on the counter is a miniature display of these black cans with Demon\u2019s Blood written in red writing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mister Black, what is this stuff?\u201d Damien asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach down grab the fan from your youngest brother and examine it. If feels warm despite being a can which worries you. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing Dame\u201d you say dismissively. \u201cSomething to draw tourists or something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the shopkeeper butted in. \u201cActually fellas this is something I discovered by the goat bridge in town.\u201d He said persuasively \u201cYou might wanna check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the can some more and pondered. Everyone knew there was a lot of unexplained things surrounding that bridge. It ought to be cool if it really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine.\u201d You said in defeat. \u201cI will buy ONE can but if this is red play doh I am returning it for a full refund!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien started tugging at your shirt. \u201cBut Levi....\u201d he whined. \u201cI want my own can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah bro\u201d chimed in \u201cAugust. \u201cLet\u2019s all get a can in case the shits good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExasperated and sighing in disbelief you started at the can again. It looked so simple it had to be a prank...or is it?</span></div></div>",

We\u2019re buying one can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the can to the cashier forgetting why you come here in the first place and pay for it. The shopkeeper looks overjoyed. You aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re wasting your money or not but five bucks isn\u2019t a horrible price to pay for a souvenir. After leaving the store you three pile in the truck and head home. August tried to check it out while you drove and you snatched the can away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll decide what to do once we\u2019re home\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien pouts. \u201cAnd to think I saw it first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and ignore him you were almost home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home since no one could wait you started looking at the can directions. It read \u201copen at your own risk. Eat at a greater risk. Digestion is crucial to feel the effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your head. \u201cWhat in the hay is this shit? Eat it and what? You die? Become possessed? I dunno....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien jumped and took the can from you. \u201cI saw it first I wanna be a demon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe what you just heard. You snatched the can away. \u201cIf anything I\u2019ll try it first since I\u2019m oldest!\u201d</span></div></div>",

He has no interest which was odd but at the same time meant if anything happened he wouldn\u2019t go out of control or do anything stupid. Damien had offered some protesting but quickly piped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo remind me again why it makes the most sense that I try this out? Damien is the one that wants it so bad plus what ever happened to torturing the youngest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore him and proceed to open the can. You didn\u2019t even have to pour or anything the contents leaped out of their container. The three of you gathered around the table it jumped on to watching it move of its own accord. It was black and goey very slime like with a hint of red in it very veiny looking. It seemed to be studying you if that was even possible there were no eyes or ears but then it did something you didn\u2019t expect it leaped off the table and slid up Augusts\u2019 nostrils. (So much for having to force him to eat it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust hunched over in pain. He seemed to be groaning but then something changed in him: his eyes went all black and started laughing maniacally.</span></div></div>",

His pure black eyes looked ever glossy as he looked down at his brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you fools wish you had this power.\u201d He said egotistically. As August\u2019s head bumped the 10 foot ceiling his laughing deepened and pinned you under his massive growing boot. He wasn\u2019t intent on hurting you...yet he just wanted to keep you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at my big bro....always telling me what to do. Well, there won\u2019t  be much of that going on anymore...from now on this is MY world - and we go by my rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to have trouble breathing. Your brother\u2019s boot was really heavy and you could feel it getting heavier - preventing you from moving. \u201cAug - buddy *cough* maybe lighten up on the press *cough* pressure here?\u201d You managed to get out; but still he pressed harder on you as he got bigger. He had to sit down as he was too big for the room and even sitting was bumping his head on the ceiling. For now it seemed he had leveled his growth off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien for his part learned quickly from your torment or was just that evil. He ran up to August and hugged his arm. Confused, August grabbed Damien in one hand and brought him up to his face. \u201cWhat do you want runt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien was scared but still knew what he was doing. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d He said sheepishly. August studied Damien considering his request. Clearly Damien lover the new August. That could prove useful. For now August would see how this played out and placed Damien lovingly on his shoulder.</span></div></div>",
