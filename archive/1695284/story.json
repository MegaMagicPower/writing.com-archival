As you're walking down the road next to you,re house you begin to hear what seems to be screaming. Thinking it was just some kids playing you jusst keep walking howevere when you get about halfway down the road you see you,re neighbor jenna come running towards you. Normaly you would be happy to see her running towards you however this time something is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gets closer you can see what appears to be blood on her clothes. As she gets within shouting range of you hear her start yelling somthing. Run kris there comming. she screams. As she runs by she grabs you're hand and begins pulling you along behind her. What are you doing yoou yell? Just run she screams back as you try to figure out whats going on you hear a hissing behind you and look back. What you see behind you is somthing you never expected to see outside of you're nightmares. The creature is large at least 7 feet tall and matte black. It has a serpentine body and a long tail ending in a jagged barb at the end.It's head almost looks like some fucked up bannana with teeth. Looking back you see it extend a set of what appear to be inner jaws and begin to run after you and jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say you quickly stop resisting Jennas pull and quickly begin to run right alongside her. Looking back you can see it gaiining on you as you look frantically for a place to escape to you hear a loud squeal and see a pick up ram into the creature chasing you. You slide to a stop and try to catch you're breath as both you and jenna stare at the crushed remains of the you can think of no better word to describe it then bug. As you both stare at the crushed remains of the bug you can hardly believe what is happening forget the fact that killer aliens are attacking or the fact you had just been lucky enough to be saved from one by a crazy guys in a truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo what was hard for you to belive was the fact that where the bug had been squashed and had started bleeding it appeared that the blood had started to eat throught not just the cement under it but the metal of the truck to. Confused as to whats going on you turn to Jenna and try to ask what's going on i say try becuse as hard as you try you can only stare at her.  She see's you,re stare but seems no more capable of anwsering you're silent question then you are of asking it.</span></div></div>",

I ran a check of my gear as my comrades did like-wise. Shoulder-mounted plasma cannon and targeter? Check. I think that thing always takes the fun out of combat against a worthy adversairy, but still could come in handy for emergencies. Wrist blades, spear, and throwing stars? Check, check, and check. Net-gun and knives? Check. That was my weapons, now for my gear. Infa-red/X-ray helmet? Got it. Cloaking divice? Fully functional. Oh... Best not forget the emergency bomb. Ready to be primed. I looked up, the standard check had taken more time than I had thought, and the bay doors were already opening.

With shocking suddeness, the forest just gave way to a group of small but numerous structures immediately ahead. This must have been the city out-skirts. A row of simple white fences lined our side, though they weres so small and simple they would probably have served more as boundary markers betweeen the living spaces of the squabbling humans more than devices fro restricting movement. Beyond them, and in the distance we could make out the shapes of larger, more rectangular structures-'sky skappers', or something similiar- standing out against the night sky. As we passed over the fence and entered the city proper, it occurred to me that this place was too quiet and peaceful for a large, busy human settlement, even at this hour. Furthermore, I had studied human anatomy enough to know that they had terrible night-vision, and the city was devoid of artifiacial illumination for them to see by. And it was quiet. Too quiet... As I strode across the small, grass-covered open space beside one of the buildings, I heard a series of pained grunts issue from within. I stopped abruptly, and put my hand up beside my head, fingers spread in universal 'hold' gesture. I turned and climbed up beside a clear section of wall-a 'window'-and peered in. Inside was the house's main common, or living, room. It was plastered with exenomorph mucus, with a human corpse embedded in the wall, and a newly hatched Alien wriggling on the floor amidst several eggs and face-huggers. Several other bodies are also fixed to the walls, all with incubating exenomorphs within them, so I break the glass and climb through the window, ready to 'fix' those pesky little problems before they can start. I slide out my long, jagged wrist blades-a pair for each arm- and start to go to work, smashing eggs, detroying the incubating aliens, and butchering face-huggers. I keep alert though, and am not surprised as a furious hiss sounds from the other part of the room.       </span></div></div>",

I brace myself, allowing it to strike me full on and bounce off again, claws red with my blood. The wounds aren't <i>that</i> much more than inconviences though, and as it prepares to attack again, I step forward and stab it in the gut with my left-hand wrist blades. It shrieks and recoils, and I grunt in pain as acidic green blood splashes my unprotected hand. We both pull back and start to circle, waiting for a moment of weakness in our oppenent and preparing to attack again. It moves first, making as if to leap at me-and than spinning about, long stinger-tipped tail whipping for my face. I get my other blades up in time to block the attack- and the stinger comes right off, flying across the room to stick into a wall, where it hangs twitching. Again blood jets from the wound. My strurdy helmet prevents me from losing my face, but I'm blinded and stagger backwards. I feel four sets of claws drag long, shallow cuts across my chest, and can hear the thing's breathing right in front of me. Instictively, I lash out with the burned stumps of my left blades. I hear it shriek in pain, and press forward agian, not willing to relinquish my attack while I have an advantage. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both of my helmets vision pieces are burned close, and I blindly stab at where I hope it to be with both arms. It stumbles under the onslaught and falls, me on top of it, scrabbling viciously with its claws. I bellow a battle cry and tear it open from throat to abdomen with my reamaining blade, and feel its teeth bite into my shoulder with a death spasm.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It finally stops twitching, and I rip my ruined helmet off, taking a deep breath. I rip the straps holding my wrecked blades off before the acid can eat though to my skin, and roll away from the corpse. With another pained grunt, I prise the dead thing's jaws from my shoulder, and am finally able to stand. After examining my wounds, I decide them to be non-serious, and burn a ritual mark into the side of my head, before climbing out to rejoin the squad patiently waiting for my return outside. My blades and helmet are ruined, but I pull out my trusty spear and a trio of vicious shurikens, and lead us deeper into the city.              </span></div></div>",

Completely unditectable until and after it was too late. We are predators. Hunters from whom no game can escape, no game can hope to match. To kill? Yes.

At the edges of mind, I could sense something; a sub-conscious hissing and snarling, so faint that I could have very well have been imagining it. If I was, it was nonetheless still coming closer. I raised my hand and began the intricate signaling for close battle formation, when a war cry/bellow of pain sounded from behind and to the right. I spun about, cocking back the throwing arm of my shurikens, and surveyed the scene. A Hunter to the left and rear was locked in close combat with an exenomorph, too close for the safe intervention of another predator, while more advanced from the rear and Hunters leapt to engage. I cried out my own war-song, but hurled myself back as another Alien dropped from a rooftop and landed on the space I had recently left vacated. Disorientated by a fall without meeting a target, it couldn't twitch away in time as I stabbed it through it's long-crestedhead and into its body. It shrieked-that specific universall death-note that announces an abrupt parting with life-and fell away whilst I ripped my acid burnt spear free. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then the uncomparitively chaotic dance of mlee combat took over, with more of the vicious things droppping from every building and spring from every burrow in a sudden frenzy of hate-spawned activity. Stingers stabbed and claws slashed while we hacked and skewered with our weapons. Acid blood bit deep into our flesh and armour, plasma lit up the sky in that darkened night, every blue flash follwed by a miniature explosion of stinging green-tinged gore.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My spear was in two peices, one per hand, and all my shurikens now lay sheathed in a wounded drone staggering away into the dark. I felt a stinger deliver a painful blow to my side. I fed off the pain, gaining stregnth from the feral anger produced by it, and leapt at my attacker, stabbing repaetedly. Thrice, four times, five times, punctures opened in its hide and it hissed, and made a valiant but pathetic attampt to bit at me with its tongue, before flopping to the wet ground.               <br>\r\n.   </span></div></div>",

Something big was bulldozing through the forests towards us. <i>Take cover</i>. I signalled, jumping high up into a huge tree. More than a score of humanoid figures could be seen moving through the trees, a large, thickly armoured vehicle leading the columm. From our concealed positions, we watched them pass by us.

SOmehow, we had been spotted. I hadn't relaized the human had infra-red vision capabilities. '\"Engage!\" I roared into my helmet, leaping down from my perch. Both my shoulder mounted cannons opened fire, and several of the nearby humans exploded before I touched down. I punched left, caving in a pin-headed skull as my brethren began their attack around me. Plasma burst and shurikens flashed by, carving flesh and tearing through small bodies with enough force to easily send them flying off their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several poorly-aimed bullets grazed off of my armour, while the vehicle began to hurredly back up, running over one of the panicking soldiers as they stumbled past behind it. The long-barreled weapon that was it's dominant feature swiveled and fired, easily blasting apart a masive old tree and nearly killing one of my fellow hunters. I charged at it from behind, leaping atop is as more humans went down around me. Unable to see with their pathetically sad night-vision, many of them were reduced to blind firing in the confusion, more a danger to their allies than their enemies, while my Hunters roved among them, stabbing and cutting with thier weapons almost at lesiure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A human's upper torso was discernible in a depression in the surface of the machine, manning an attached weapon too big to be carried.

The gutted hulk of the vehicle lay still, and I surveyed the battle ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dead humans lay everywhere, and those not cooling fast enough were being rapidly fixed. A small but growing fire still burned where the machine had blasted a gaping hole in the foliage, and I knew that many more humans were likely on their way.<br>\r\n\"Well done.

Each of them cloaks him or herself in the cloaking field before making inhuman jumps up to some sturdy tree branches.  Thanks to our masks, we are able to see one another clearly even if those on the color spectrum cannot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep switching my mask between heat vision and electro-magnetic (EM) vision. The former paints my sight in a world of blue 'cold' vision. If any humans come into sight,  or anything that gives off heat, they will be as easy to spot as black on white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever thermal vision does not work on the hardmeats, the serpents, the Xenomorphs. No they are invisible in that spectrum as they do not give off body heat.  Though the fact that they have acid for blood (as acid is what creates electricity in batteries)  means they have a unique electromagnetic field around them.  This field can be detected with the EM vision. This allows the infesting serpents to be surrounded in white on a green background. The only downside is that it cannot be used to detect humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the major drawback from both sides: the plasma casters can only target creatures that appear in the current vision. <br>\r\nEx: if you're in thermal view you can auto target humans and animals. But not xenos. Vice versa applies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustling in the forest grows louder and we all flex our wrist blades in anticipation as it is a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*And should these predators be able to see in the color spectrum, nothing will be targeted. </span></div></div>",

Your fellow xenomorphs are usingn hit-and-run tactics, using their vastly superior mobility and toughness to their best advatges. They'll leap from windows and side-streets, clawing and snapping at any human they can reach, before fleeing again to take cover and and jump out again from a surprising angle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It isn't working very well.<br>\r\nIn the center of the open street the humans have the advantage of range, and gun down soldier after xenomorph soldier while they continue their relentless advance.

Unfortuneatly, they seam to have realized the advantage the xenos' posses in close combat, and keep their formation from bunching up too much.

Amputated human limbs - legs hanging intertwined on telephone wires and arms with crooked fingers as if beckoning all those still alive to join them - lay scattered, making it impossible to tell to whom they belonged.<br>\r\nPotholes were starting to form beneath the disemboweled organs of the xenomorph fallen, the molecular acid reacting with the tar and pavement to create trickles of smoke.<br>\r\nAnything in sight that had remained uncovered by bodies and bodyparts were beridden with bullet holes, claw-marks and blood sprays that looked as if a firetruck had tried to dowse a flame with red paint.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nThe preatorian-honour guard was now starting to issue orders(although in a far more primitive way than that of their human enemies), stating that it heard from the queen telepathically that a second marine squadron had broken through the eastern flank with 3 convoys of tanks and half-trucks. They were targeting the main nests there and all surviving warriors in this district were being called to the defend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to you and spoke, or rather grunted and sneered and threatened, that you should stay here with 2 warriors and guard this path from anyone trying to make a break for the queen herself. With that he and 50 drones and warriors swarmed away, scaling over walls and roofs, the familiar sound of their amassed footsteps (like nails on iron or billboards), withering away into the distance along with their roars and shrieks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the resulting silence, all that could be heard was the terrified and agonized screams of a lone surviving marine who was being pulled by one of your cohorts by the teeth, attempting to bring the hapless marine to back to a nearby unopened egg. Both his legs were torn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining member of your team came to you, grunted and whacked you with his tail to gather your attention.<br>\r\nBut you ignored him entirely, for you were caught in your own world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething you saw, puzzled you. Spears. Lots of them. As you surveyed the battle aftermath you noticed several marine corpses impaled by them. One marine was hanging against the nearby store wall with a spear pinning him through the head against the wall, like a paperman on a notice board, about 2 feet above the ground. Another 2 marines lay against a postbox, both impaled simultaneously by a single spear, like a gruesome kebab. The spears also extended to the xenomorph casualties. Several spears embedded into their backwards sloping shell-shaped heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had all been killed during this battle, whilst the xenomorphs and humans were too engaged with each other to notice an alternate enemy in their midst, picking them off one by one as they were occupied with killing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour animalistic intelligence didn't recodnise the spears as a weapon belonging to a particular enemy, but your great memory allowed you to connotate them with the threat of a Predator, for you had survived a confrontation with one before. It had cost you your tail and nearly your life, lucky the tail could be regrown as a gecko's could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tensed up and got ready jump or move for evasive action. You knew the fucker was out there. That death could befall you at any moment right now. You rotated your oblong head and tried to view as much of your surrounding area with your fishbowl vision at once. You sniffed the air and listened intently, your instincts going haywire as you tried desperately to sense an enemy you knew was out there, but remained invisible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then! A drop of human blood from telephone wires dropped onto what appeared to be thin air, stopped midair and flowed downward like a drop flowing down a car windshield. You didn't even hesitate. You jumped to the right, knocking your comrade away who up until now had remained oblivious to everything, still trying to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA split-second later a plasma-bolt sheared past the 2 of you, de-atomonising the very atmoshpere in the space where you stood only moments before, and continued to vaporize your 3rd mate whom was directly behind you and the marine he had dragged with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Predator seemingly materialized from where the plasma-bolt originated as the Plasma-shoulder-cannon had drained his suits power, and he uncloaked.  He bashed his chest and roared imperiously as he unslung his spear gun and took aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and you mate reacted instantly, both darting in opposite directions in order to outflank him. 3 Spears strafed you, missing you by millimeters, the 4th would have pierced your brain had you not jumped behind a car at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now your mate charged the predator from behind, drawing his fire. This was the signal for you to jump cover and you made a bee-line to the Predators turned back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sprinted to the Predator, you could see your comrade zig-zagging from side to side as he dodged the Predator's spears, closing in on him. You almost thought, as you had just covered half the distance, that you weren't needed and that your comrade would slay the predator before you got there, when -just as your mate jumped the last meter onto the predator's face - the predator's spear connected with his tail slicing it clean off and sending your mate body and all with its powerful thrust into the nearby wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had no choice but to continue charging, your agile, clawed feet carrying you faster that a cheetah.<br>\r\nSuffering the same misfortune as your mate, the predator had already turned around facing you, before you could close the last hurdle of the gap. You came to a standstill before him at point-blank range, snarling, knowing you demise was imminent as the front-node of his Shoulder-plasma-cannon glowed blue and trained directly at you; no time to even consider dodging.<br>\r\nIf you were human, now would have been an appropriate time to say: SHIT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Cannon short-circuited and failed to fire;  a stray spray of acidic blood from the earlier violent spear thrust on your mate as his tail had been amputated had found its way on the cannon, slowly corroding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe predator brought his spear gun still in his hands up, but with renewed vigour, you jumped him and bit the gun, breaking it in half.<br>\r\nNever a creature to take anything's shit, the predator calmly proceeded to grab you by the head and swirl with you in hand like a discus thrower, before releasing you and sending you head-first through  the front window-pane of a boutique and a great deal of mannequins. But the fall did little to harm you, your tough exoskeleton protecting you from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now proceeded to take an ugly looking device from his many asseccories and tools tied to his waist. It resembled a frisbee with razor fish-hook knives protruding from its edges.The infamous one-shot-kill Disc of the Predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew exactly what the thing was, even if in your primitive brain you couldn't begin to grasp how it worked. For it was with this thing that you has lost your tail with your last encounter with a predator. You started running through the store back into the street, knowing the Disc's ability to home in on its targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran, you heard the Disc's metallic whining to your left and ducked just in time to miss it cleaving you in half, but not before taking off 2 of the 4 cylindrical protrusions that was present on all Xenomorphs right of your back, sending streams of your yellow-green acid blood running down the rest of you. Luckily some acid was caught on the disc, destroying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in the open you and the Predator faced one another on opposite sides of the street, the gory remains of the previous battle making a literal red carpet beneath your feet, as you 2 stood a generic western final face-off.<br>\r\nThe Predator roared pumping out his chest and and holding back his arms as was familiar to them. You snarled and sneered showing your teeth, as well as your teeth within your teeth (the tongue-head-mouth-thing biting the air as it escaped you mouth threateningly).Both of you were royally pissed off. And then you both charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn contact he punched you so hard with an uppercut, that he literally sent you flying. But thinking quickly you recovered your balance mid-air and grasped a streetlight like a circus swingman. From up there you had a magnificent vantage point from which to jump him. Like a monkey cursing a lion you spat at him from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to jump, he shot a grapling-hook through your leg from the wristband on his left wrist and pulled you downward like a harpooner. Like a wrecking ball he smashed you into the pavement, breaking several toes, fingers, teeth.<br>\r\nThe fall was bad and left you dazed. The predator proceeded to pull you to him accros the cement like a fisherman would with his helpless catch on the beach; both his wristblades were out and gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to die such a demeaning death, you reacted by instinct. First you ran a little bit to the predator, throwing him off balance, then ran away from him pulling him off his feet. Not slowing down in order not to give the predator a chance to stand up and use his superior strength, you ran with him sliding behind you on his stomach, like a sled being pulled by you as the musher dogs, the harpoon still embedded in your leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chose a thick granite column at the nearby shopping mall entrance, running around it and heading straight back to the predator.<br>\r\nLike 2 cars coming on a collision-course, you pulled the predator to you as he slid helplessly after the grapling-hook wire which you towed around the column. Still face down, he could do little to stop you from jumping on his back and stabbing him in the neck with your serrated tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled in satisfaction and malevolence as you wormed your tail violently through his neck and into his brain, the Predator only able to groan as the life left him. You then followed him into unconsciousness as you collapsed from your wounds.</span></div></div>",

From your perch at the top of one mucus covered wall under 'construction', you ditect movement off to the left. One of your brothers limps into an alleyway, trailing acidic blood from several bullet wounds. There is the crackling of machine-gun fire, and he seems to virtually exploe into green gore. A group of marines break off from the battle and runs down the same alley-towards the nest-firing their weapons at another xenomorph who has attemped to run along the wall and gain a flanking advantage. Its corpse flops to the ground, and the formation of soldiers hardly slows. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You give another hiss at the death of a useful fighter, but than realize that you have taken up a vantage point right above the small side entrance the marines are aiming for; a perfect spot for for an ambush. Your next hiss is one of delight. Below, the door swings open, and light and lead pour in. One of the 'hoogans' yells \"Clear!\" And the squad steps inside. Bracing yourself, you leap from the ledge and land in their midst. Your deadly tail flashes left and right, stabbing repeatedly. One not knocked off his feet by your sudden arrival shoots several roouds into you- and your toung shoots into his brain and bites down. You twist and screech, snarl, claw, kick, and bite. One draws an enormeous knife and plunges in into your side. -And meets an agonizing end in a jet off acid blood. Completely taken by surprise, and over-matched in close-quarters- the marines don't stand a chance and are all dismembered.           <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
