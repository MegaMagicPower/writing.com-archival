The Dark Eldar revel in piracy, enslavement and torture, and are sadistic in the extreme.<br>\r\nThe Dark Eldar are unique amongst the races in the sense that they do not occupy many planets, but rather one dark city called Commorragh. They are mainly pirates, though are sometimes used as mercenaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNecrons:<br>\r\nThe Necrons are a group of metal warriors, created from the Necrontyr, an ancient and once powerful race which tried to find a way to lengthen their lives with to no avail. In their desperation, they looked into space and discovered ethereal beings feeding on the energies of whole stars. They named these beings \"the Star Gods,\" or C'tan. The C'tan offered the Necrontyr people immortality, but only at a terrible price.So their race was completely purged and transferred into their new metal bodies, stripped of thought and self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTau:<br>\r\nThe Tau are a young race of technologically-oriented beings, they seek to bring the peace through the galaxies with the help of their spiritual and political guide, the Ethereals.<br>\r\nUseless to say, even if they're seeking peace and collaboration with the others races of the universe they're ready to fight to defend their religion and their race if threatened, they make uses of advanced military technology to kill they're foes at long distances unleashing true storms of fire and bullets.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
