Such a shame - he had just been about to deal the final blow to Zeromus, which was a horribly difficult boss battle. He checked the back of the TV for any connection problems, and also checked the TV itself. Strange - it should have been on and functioning perfectly. Then the TV screen lit up and out came a bright light, which attached itself to Nick's wrist and formed into a watch-like device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick checked the device for an inbuilt user's manual, only taking a few seconds to learn how to navigate the device. Once he found one, he stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transform into fictional girls? That's crazy,\" he said, then he remembered a line from \"Sora no Otoshimono\": \"A theory of reality is unable to explain unrealistic events.\" \"This deserves a test,\" he decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all well and good, but what would he test it on? And meanwhile, his PS2 had quietly shut itself off, not saving the data...</span></div></div>",

Anyway, Nick had no idea how to go on a date, or really anything about romance. He didn't even know if he liked her back. The one time he tried to dig up feelings for her, he ended up getting extremely confused, yanking himself back to reality, watching Linkin Park OMVs on YouTube and crying about it, and finally falling asleep (still crying) despite it being six in the afternoon. His favorite one was this one: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtnGjBlwwxE\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtnGjBlww...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, Nick had tried to distance himself from Amelia, but she had found ways of getting his company. In any case, he felt bad about avoiding her for so long, but the prospect of going to her house made him feel excited and afraid all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he hit upon a different problem: his clothes. No one in his family had anything in Terra's size, and her regular duds looked like a cosplay outfit. Should he go out as he was, or figure out some way to go that would allow him to remain unseen?</span></div></div>",

So the question was, whether Terra had the \"Teleport\" or \"Vanish\" spells. The answer could easily be no, since Terra had to learn them both from magicite, but it was worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick tried to remember what the characters from Final Fantasy VI did to cast spells. Sadly, he arrived at the inescapable conclusion that there was nothing to remember. All they showed was the character's hands and mouth moving, and then the spell being cast. However, he did also imagine a random image of him doing what could be described as virtually the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" Nick muttered.

He didn't understand it himself. He just didn't want to see Amelia for some reason. Seeing her made his heart pound, and his face heat up like he was developing a fever. He didn't know why; he had gone to a hospital in his spare time to ask about \"personal-proximity-reactive colds\" and described his conditions, and the doctor had burst out laughing and told him \"good luck with her\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick decided it was a better idea not to think about knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFist to the door.

It took an effort of will for Nick to keep himself on the doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed an eternity and that Nick therefore had to remind himself was only a few seconds, Amelia opened the door, said \"We don't want any\", closed the door, and opened it again immediately with an incredulous expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recognized Terra, that much Nick could tell.

But anyway,\u201d she added, \u201cNick taught me how to tell when someone\u2019s cross-dressing, and you don\u2019t fit the bill. Sorry, but you\u2019re a girl through and through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI what?\u201d Nick asked, meaning that Amelia had said that he had a crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a real girl,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick realized too late just how close he had come to being found out. The more rational part of his brain pointed out that he wasn\u2019t trying to hide anything to begin with. \u201cAh, yeah, I knew that,\u201d Nick said, trying pathetically to patch up the conversation. \u201cSo, you\u2019re straight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStraight?\u201d Amelia said, confused. \u201cSo this is a confession!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPutting that aside,\u201d Nick said hastily, wondering why he was even doing this, \u201cAbout this \u2018Nick\u2019 person. You say he likes you, which means he\u2019s confessed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t confessed,\u201d Amelia admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s obvious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, do you like him back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia was silent for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no experience with romance.

Acting completely on his emotions, he embraced Amelia (against her will) and they both went toppling to the floor.

Their reactions to each other were so similar it was farcical!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what are you\u2026\u201d Amelia slapped Nick across the face.

Amelia had fainted, Nick had better carry her to her room or something. He picked her up, noting that she was lighter than expected, probably due to all the diet food she ate due to living in a Weight Watchers household, and carried her up the stairs to the second floor. He entered her room (at least he thought it was her room; he hadn't been here in a while after all), lay her down on the bed, and resolved to wait for her to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant that he had time to think and deal with his newly identified feelings. He loved Amelia; that much he knew for certain. All of his past irrational actions related to Amelia suddenly became clearer. He had distanced himself from her so as to avoid dealing with his own feelings, something he never thought he'd do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five minutes later, Amelia woke up. \"Uhhh... my head...\" she groaned, and Nick guiltily remembered that he'd accidentally bonked her head against the wall in the hallway. Then her eyes fell on Nick and widened. \"What are you doing in my room?!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting,\" Nick said. \"For you to wake up, anyway. I greeted you at the door, you fainted, and I carried you in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You greeted me at the door?\" Amelia asked, thinking back. \"Wait... that's what happened.

Then she blushed. \u201cOh, you heard about how I knew you loved me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Nick nodded. \u201cTruth be told, your circumstances for the Linkin Park video were exactly the same as mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia blinked. \u201cHuh? You mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded. \u201cYou knew I liked you, but when you tried to dig up feelings for me, you ended up avoiding it by watching a Linkin Park OMV and crying yourself to sleep early. Well, I made the same observation about you, but when I tried to dig up return feelings, I also ended up watching a Linkin Park OMV and crying myself to sleep early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia\u2019s expression turned surprised and kind of disgusted. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re crazy about each other,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia turned red, then redder, then still more red, then red some more.

Maybe for the same reason that Amelia had calmly accepted that he had turned into Terra. Not that he knew why she did that, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnalyzing his own mental state, Nick figured that he and Amelia had a subliminal understanding of each other.

Then he pressed the \"Scan\" button. Amelia's hand was lit up with a piercing light as her data was scanned, and then... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia cautiously removed her hand from the device, and Nick checked the database. \"Okay, you're in. I can do the rest myself.\" He targeted Amelia, selected Terra as the transformation, and\u2026 wait. \"Oh, Amelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Amelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you particularly fond of the clothes you\u2019re wearing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am, why?\u201d Amelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t take them off, they\u2019ll be lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Nick and Amelia realized the suggestiveness of Nick\u2019s words at the exact same time. They engaged in an unconscious competition over who could blush redder in the same span of time, and there was no clear winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm,\u201d Nick and Amelia said to each other at exactly the same time, and then followed up by saying \u201cyou first\u201d in similar unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nick said abruptly, after a few dozen seconds of silence. \u201cMe first. I didn\u2019t mean anything by that, I mean, I wasn\u2019t trying to get you out of your clothes. I mean, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to see you naked. It\u2019s just that I have no intention of, well, you see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot without my permission, right?\u201d Amelia suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. I wouldn\u2019t get you naked without your permission,\u201d Nick said, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust you,\u201d Amelia responded. \u201cIs it okay if I change into some of my older, worn-out clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia chose a too-small tank top and a pair of shredded jeans too small for her. Nick tried and failed not to think about her outfit and the way it covered just enough to tantalize the mind, but he managed to do his sworn duty regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick said, pressing the button. \u201cExecute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia immediately started gasping in pain. \u201cOh, I forgot to mention,\u201d Nick added, \u201cIt does hurt. Not much, but the pain\u2019s there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me sooner!\u201d Amelia gasped as her body stretched and shifted. Unlike with Nick, her body and clothes didn\u2019t change at the same time, but instead took their turns. Amelia\u2019s body was changing first, meaning that her already too-small clothes were nearing the breaking point as her body aged to twenty-one years of age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight gave Nick a boner, so he looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Amelia\u2019s own transformation stopped, and her shredded clothes reformed around her into Terra\u2019s red velvet halter top with matching shoulder-length gloves and a night-blue cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick said. \u201cNow you want it made permanent, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cNo way in fucking Hell am I going through that again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick silently fiddled with the watch, selecting the necessary options to make Amelia\u2019s Terra Transformation permanent. He pressed the Execute button, and\u2026 another screen appeared, asking if he wanted to synchronize ages. This apparently would adjust the physical age of Terra to match Amelia\u2019s age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick selected Yes, just as it occurred to him that it should really be Amelia\u2019s decision. \u201cOops,\u201d Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Amelia asked, then winced as she felt her body shrink back down to what Terra apparently looked like at sixteen. Contrary to experience, it didn\u2019t hurt this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI pressed the button to make Terra\u2019s age match yours, and it was your decision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad it didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Nick said. \u201cSo, what should we do now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She looked absolutely beautiful, but also casual and low-maintenance. She had applied light makeup, but truthfully, she didn\u2019t need it a bit. Terra\u2019s face was so beautiful that it would entrance a lesser man with casual eye contact. Like Nick, for instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s reaction was to stare.

This was no time to be spellbound. \u201cYeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you aren\u2019t that bad a driver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI what?\u201d Nick asked, stunned. \u201cI don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. Not yet, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Amelia\u2019s turn to stare. \u201cYou\u2026 you walked here? You didn\u2019t drive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do either one,\u201d Nick said honestly. \u201cI used the Teleport spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I also don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license,\u201d Amelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need one,\u201d Nick pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re Terra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia sighed. \u201cWill I have to Teleport both of us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThe upside is that you get to choose the places we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Amelia said, grinning. \u201cCome on over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick moved so that he and Amelia were standing face-to-face. He grabbed Amelia by the shoulder, sending an electric charge through both of them, and Amelia chanted the spell.</span></div></div>",

Naturally, you doubt that it would work but you decide to indulge your curiosity and give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you glance around your room you eventually notice that one of your sister's Sailor Moon DVDs is in your room shrugging your shoulders, you take out the DVD, place it in your PS2, and attach the cord from the watchlike device into the controller slot then hit the button on the watch...nothing happens then as you are about to unhook it <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a faint tingling thought your body and as you look down, you notice the device is glowing and hold your wrist up close realizing that something your fingers look more slender, delicate and perfectly manicured?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you're watching you hand change, numb with shock, you almost don't notice a faint tickling at the back of your neck. Gasping, you finally move your hand to reach for whatever is brushing your neck, and gasp with shock again when you feel silky hair. You pull it in front of your eyes; your still lengthing blonde hair  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the tingling has become an odd pulling. Muscles all over your body feel like they're contracting, some painfully so. Even the muscles of your face are not exempt. Panicking, you clumsily stumble out of your room and into the adjacent bathroom. As soon as you look in the mirror, you can see your face has already changed. Not just the underlying muscles have changed shaped, but the bone...higher cheekbones, a slimmer jawline. Even your lips look different. Your mouth had been open, agape, but then you close it. Full, kissable lips press together as bright blue eyes stare back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the most painful pulling sensation yet: in your groin. You can feel your manhood shrinking, painfully being pulled inside you. You can only guess what's going on inside your pants, since you don't have the courage to take them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try not to think about that you notice a strange pressure in your chest, as if something was bulging outward and realizes that Jeff only be breasts swell under your shirt, pushing it outward. It had been a rather tight T-shirt before, and now your new breasts  were stretching it to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling and painful pulling finally stopped and after getting over your shock, you look in the mirror again and see a real-life version of Usagi staring back at you then you realize you should be screaming about becoming a member of the opposite sex but all you can think of is how silly Usagi looks in boy's clothes.As if responding to your thoughts, your clothes suddenly come alive and change into...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naturally, disbelief that such a device could work still lingers. But seeing as how hours of work at your game has just gone to waste, and you're in no mood to start over again, you decide to indulge your curiosity and give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you glance over the shelf holding all your games and DVDs, you eventually come to the Disney DVDs you keep on hand whenever it's time to babysit your 6-year-old niece. \"Beauty and the Beast,\" you mutter. You pull the DVD out, the cover with Belle in that elegant golden dress practically jumping out at you. Not that you'd ever admit it, but you found Belle to be the hottest of the 'Disney Princesses'. The auburn hair, that gold dress sweeping along the dance floor...those were images burned into your occipital lobes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging your shoulders, you take out the DVD, place it in your PS2, and attach the cord from the watch into the controller slot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hitting the button on the watch...nothing happens. You sigh in annoyance. This cheap-looking toy was a dud after all....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you're dimly aware of a faint tingling in your toes, and the sensation is swiftly traveling up your body. As you look down, you notice the watch is glowing. Shocked, you hold your wrist up close, and realize that something is not quite right. Your fingers...they look longer, but somehow more slender and delicate. Almost like...a lady's hands?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze for a moment, and in that time, you observe more gradual changes. Your fingernails...they're growing out a little. But instead of becoming long and clawlike, they appear...perfectly manicured? As you're watching you hand change, numb with shock, you almost don't notice a faint tickling at the back of your neck. Gasping, you finally move your hand to reach for whatever is brushing your neck, and gasp with shock again when you feel silky hair. You pull it in front of your eyes; it's just long enough, and long locks of glistening, healthy-looking auburn hair are between your now delicate-looking digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the tingling has become an odd pulling. Muscles all over your body feel like they're contracting, some painfully so. Even the muscles of your face are not exempt. Panicking, you clumsily stumble out of your room and into the adjacent bathroom. As soon as you look in the mirror, you can see your face has already changed. Not just the underlying muscles have changed shaped, but the bone...higher cheekbones, a slimmer jawline. Even your lips look different. Your mouth had been open, agape, but then you close it. Full, kissable lips press together as mesmerizing hazel eyes stare back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the most painful pulling sensation yet: in your groin. You can feel your manhood shrinking, painfully being pulled inside you. You can only guess what's going on inside your pants, since you don't have the courage to take them off. Your scrotum is no doubt reforming into pussy lips, your testicles retreating deep inside and destined to become ovaries, your penis shrinking more and more until it becomes a clitoris....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you're too scared to take off your pants, you can still see other changes happening below the belt. Your jeans had been a tight feet, but now they looked and felt looser. Muscle tone was changing, extra fat tissue was being added. Now your pants felt too tight around the hips, and the pant legs looked and felt loose. Your shoes even felt a little big now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the coup de grace. A strange pressure in your chest, as if something was bulging outward. Once again, dumb shock keeps you rooted to the spot as what can only be breasts swell under your shirt, pushing it outward. It had been a rather tight T-shirt before, and now your new mammaries were stretching it to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling and painful pulling finally abated. After getting over your shock, you finally glanced in the mirror again. What could only be described as a real-life version of the Disney Princess stares back at you, full lips slightly parted, wispy lock of auburn hair dangling over a dazzlingly beautiful face, and a rack most women would kill for. But you're not exactly comfortable with it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at yourself again, you realize you should be screaming bloody murder about becoming a member of the opposite sex. But at the moment, for some reason, all you can think of is how silly Belle looks in a teenage boy's clothes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if responding to your thoughts, your clothes suddenly come alive. You notice the pants change first. A ripple effect travels down your pants, as if they were exploding outward, reforming into the skirt of a ball gown, going from blue denim to a golden, silky fabric. Underneath, you can feel your shoes change. Whatever you're wearing now..the sensation is alien, but it's obvious you've got heels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those heels were high enough to make you lose your balance. You tumble backward, falling flat on your ass and swearing in a most unladylike fashion. \"What the fuck, my voice...goddamn, it's high-pitched and pretty.... Damn, I really sound like Paige O'Hara!\" So distracted you were by your now mellifluous voice, that you failed to notice the other changes in your clothes. Your T-shirt had merged with that skirt, changing into a golden, off-the-shoulder top. Long, yellow gloves had also magically appeared on your arms, highlighting their dainty, ladylike look. A faint hint of your new cleavage could be seen, and right in front of it your three pearl woven into the dress's fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you lay there on the bathroom floor. You force yourself to steady your breathing, you at the moment, you're mesmerized by the sight of your rising and falling breasts. Each breath you take strains the fabric of your new ball gown, but amazingly, it doesn't feel too restrictive or tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the shock abates somewhat, and you brave trying to stand in those high heels. You wobble once or twice, fearing you would fall again, but soon enough you're standing before the mirror again. And now, a better-than-perfect image of what Belle and her trademark yellow dress would look like in real life is staring back at you. Your long, silky hair had even somehow been done of in a bun, but plenty was left to tumble over your shoulder. Little golden earrings had even appeared as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/download/152026230/Disney_Princess_Belle_2_by_BelleEtoile.jpg?token=2ded6eb80a061458c1ffe062040aa9fe9028af2e&amp;ts=1374525748\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.deviantart.com/download/15202...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...this is what it feels like to be a princess,\" you tell yourself, marveling at how alluring your voice sounds. You realize that being turned into a hot chick in a ball gown should have you screaming in rage, but...you're still curious. Wearing such an elaborate dress was a strange new sensation, and it didn't feel wrong or gay or anything at all. In fact, it felt rather nice. Rather...empowering. You take another deep breath, feeling your breasts press out against your bodice. \"And with the equipment to go along with the clothes,\" you add, a hint of mischievousness now in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and bend over a little, running your hands against the golden, ploofy skirt. One thing was for sure, this was getting in the way of...observing new equipment more than your pants were. You slowly realize this may be a chance most guys your age would kill for. Maybe that's why you weren't losing your head. Perhaps you should rip off this ball gown and see what being Belle in her birthday suit was like. But then again, you always loved the sight of Belle in this ball gown, and it did make you feel good and a bit powerful....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You place your gloved hands on your rosy cheeks, and slide them down your face, your neck, and finally...your new breasts. You give them a squeeze, and an onslaught of alien sensations assault your mind. Your breathing rate skyrockets, and you nearly topple over those heels again. \"Hot damn, if just SQUEEZING them through this dress does that....\" you mutter in Belle's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. As oddly satisfying as it is to wear Belle's ballroom dress, it was merely fancy giftwrapping from the true treasure underneath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not in the bathroom. Too little room. You timidly peer out the bathroom door, just to be sure the coast is clear. Once you're satisfied you're still alone, you take a step. Not only are you still unaccustomed to women's high heels, you almost trip over your dress! \"Whoa!\" you cry out, balancing yourself on the door handle just in time. After a moment, you right yourself. Standing bolt erect, you lift up your dress slightly so that the hem is a few inches off the ground. Then, with slow, measured steps, you walk back to your room, carefully balancing yourself on those four-inch heels. And the way you were walking...almost like the dignified walk of a princess! Instead of feeling ashamed, however, you giggle a little at the absurdity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swiftly lock the door behind you, then walk over to your bed. Abandoning grace, you flop down on it, your skirts fluttering down in a flurry of gold and white fabric. Laughing a little more, you get to work on loosening the bodice. Then it hits you: you have no idea whatsoever how to get such a fancy dress on of off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you deal with the easy stuff first. The gloves come off, and then your golden, high heel shoes. For the first time, you realize you're wearing hosiery underneath those skirts. \"Great, even more wrapping paper to tear through,\" you groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning your attention to Belle's dress, you eventually decide to slide it off you by pulling it down. <i>I hope I don't stretch this too much. I might...want to put it back on later,</i> you tell yourself, amazed that you would say that. Almost at once, Belle's full, round breasts pop out, unbound by any bra. Just the sensation of them bouncing nearly drove you wild, and it took all your willpower to keep sliding the dress off. Now, you were standing in nothing but silky white hose, panties, and a garter belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These, however, should be no problem,\" you say to yourself. The pantyhose were easily detached from the garter belt, and you slid them off after you sat back down on your bed. It felt...strangely arousing to do so. Your legs...no hair whatsoever, and they felt so smooth as you ran a hand over them. Even your feet looked perfect; you wiggled your little toes like Ariel did at first. You smile to yourself, but now for the coup de grace. Gently, ever so gently, you slide Belle's panties off. \"So much for getting into Belle's panties,\" you quip. Now there's nothing preventing you from seeing Belle's, or rather YOUR, womanhood. A small tuft of brown pubic hair, and a little slit that was already getting wet, begging to be touched....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lie in bed, you realize it's not just your breasts that are incredibly sensitive. Your entire skin...it was electrifying to the touch! Even the simple action of falling back on your sheets made you feel sexy and alive! \"Maybe that's why girls like to wear all that soft, silky stuff,\" you think aloud. Wearing Belle's ballroom grown had felt oddly empowering...what would contemporary female clothing feel like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was racing as you considered your possibilities. And this, in turn, made your breasts jiggle some more. You also felt your nipples becoming more erect. \"But alas, there's the task at hand,\" you tell yourself. Should you postpone delving into the riches that was Belle's hot bod, or go see if some of your sister's or mother's clothes fit and go out?</span></div></div>",

But as that old commercial went...why go to the next level, when you can go light-years beyond!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally unable to resist temptation any longer, you grab your slightly jiggling breasts, and at once you let out a moan. With your index fingers, you trace little circles around your aureoles. You peek at your breasts as you do so...your aureoles are the diameter of half-dollars, easily. As you massage them, your see that your nipples are getting even fatter, more erect. Hell, it feels like their liable to spew milk any second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pinch them, and you scream all over again! It was like you had two incredibly sensitive penises on your chest! \"Oh my God, I never had any clue how good girls have it!\" you moan as you massage and tweak your nipples. Wanting more, you massage your breasts with your whole hands again, all the while panting and moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're subconsciously aware of a peculiar wetness between your legs, and reflexively rub them together. You're so caught up in the sensations from kneading Belle's breasts, it takes a while to realize you're leaking crotch juice from her - YOUR - new womanhood. With one hand still fondling a breast, you timidly reach down and slip a finger between your pussy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you had experienced before was already ecstasy, but now you felt ready to implode from sheer pleasure. Taking a deep breath, you reach for Belle's vagina again, this time squeezing the clitoris in between two fingers. You let out your loudest, most high-pitched moan yet. The feeling...it was indescribable joy, indescribable pleasure. It made you feel...oh so close to fulfillment. A...womanly fulfillment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://xbooru.com//images/259/4570b440853e0b045b8ac78e69129c0f.jpeg?274864\" target=\"_blank\">http://xbooru.com//images/259/4570b44085...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to have more. With one hand, you switched from one breast to the other, fondling and caressing them, while you pumped your dainty little fingers in and out of your new vagina. Deeper and deeper your fingers thrust and you moaned on and on in ecstasy. This blissful feeling, it seemed to radiate outward, engulfing your new body! Belle's soft skin, her breasts, the tips of her fingers and toes...waves of pleasure shot out everywhere! And it kept going and going! Building and building, until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour back arches as you felt something squeeze and contract within your new plumbing. The muscles of your vaginal wall...they were closing on your fingers. A sudden, strange disappointment strikes you, wishing it were...something else those muscles were clamping. But that was soon forgotten as you climax, your womanly love juices erupting from your pussy. And it wasn't just once! You felt the need to finger yourself more, and the climaxing wouldn't stop! You orgasmed again and again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, utter exhaustion overtakes you, and you collapse on your bed, strangely fulfilled. You realize you're reveling in what women called their 'afterglow', such a tingly, warm feeling that makes you not want to get up. Just lie there and revel in the sexual bliss you just experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, a pity Disney movies never let you in on how good their princesses can REALLY feel,\" you mutter to yourself. After a while, you look up and notice the mess you made of one of your blankets. \"Heh, maybe I should've fooled around in the bathroom after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the one blanket, soaked in Belle's cum, and toss it aside. Still basking in the afterglow, you sit there on your bed, staring down at Belle's hot, nude body. \"The things I can do as a real-life Disney Princess...so many possibilities,\" you tell yourself. There was so much you could do. After all, if just masturbating rocked your world...freaky as the thought was, how good would <i>SEX </i>with a man feel? And there was still the option to go nab some clothes around the house and hit the town as a hot chick. And maybe, just maybe, you find out....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You place your gloved hands on your rosy cheeks, and slide them down your face, your neck, and finally...your new breasts. Not quite courageous enough to put the squeeze on them, your hands continue down toward your hips. Now that you think about it, your hips...they feel wider than before, serving to make balancing on those heels even more of a chore. Your pick up the skirt of your gown again; you grab quite a handful and pull up, and there's still more underneath that you can feel cascading all around your legs. All the while, the Belle in the mirror mimics your every move. It was like some magic mirror, but it wasn't the mirror that was magical. The magic had happened to YOU. In the span of a few minutes you've gone from an average teenage boy to an impossibly beautiful girl...with an elaborate ball gown to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConflicting feelings well up within you. Again, on one hand, you don't feel quite ready to strip out of that ball gown and see your new girly body in the buff. It was still a challenge to take this all in and not scream, faint, or both. Still, despite the changes in your body, you're still a horny teenage boy at heart. Belle's breasts - no, YOUR breasts - keep pressing up against the bodice each time you draw a breath, a constant reminder of your new feminine assets. And oh, how you longed to lift up those skirts and check between your legs, but your wobbliness due to those heels dissuades you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while fighting to maintain your balance and your composure, you just stare at the Belle in the mirror some more. That luscious brown hair, those kissable rosy lips, those perfectly-sculpted shoulders and neck that the off-the-shoulder gown laid bare for the world to see. Just about everything that made you drool over Belle as a kid. And now, through a twist of fate, you've BECOME this impossibly elegant Disney Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, at long last, you decide to take it slow and leave Belle's dress - YOUR dress - on. At least, until you learned more about this damn watch and what else it could do...like hopefully change you back. But as you look down again...although you're a little hesitant to see your new womanly form in all its glory, you're not quite so eager to change back just yet. This was a sweet chance to see how the 'other half' lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, figuring out how to walk in heels AND this elaborate gown was critical. Taking a deep breath (and once again feeling how your bodice barely contains your breasts) , you open the bathroom door, pull up your skirts, and bravely take your first step in high heels. You have to take it very slowly, but you manage to not topple over. Then you take another slow step, then another and another. Due to the necessity of raising your skirts, you can't use your arms for balance, making things more difficult. The slight jiggling of your breasts as you walk threatens to distract you as well, not to mention how your hips sway a little. But miraculously, you realize you're getting the hang of walking in women's shoes fairly quickly. You eventually step into a hall with no carpet, so your heels make rhythmic clacking noises as you pick up speed, and confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the sheer volume of your gown's skirts still proves problematic. As you pass a small stand in your living room, your raised skirts knock over a lamp. \"Oh shit!\" you cry out in Belle's voice, reaching down to grab the lamp before it can shatter. To your utter amazement, you don't fall over yourself. You look down, your high heels and shapely legs concealed by your gown again, but they're not wobbly at all. It was almost as if...Belle's natural grace somehow carried over to you, and a little practice brought it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bold and daring, much like Belle herself, you twirl around, your skirts becoming a spinning flurry of silky fabric. No loss of balance. You twirl again and again, moving out into the center of the room as you spin. The sheer eloquence of your movements, the way your hair and skirts flutter about as you spin...it all felt so invigorating. Is this why girls liked to dance? For a brief moment, you wish you had a dance partner to find out. It felt like a crime to conceal your beauty in this house, as if you had a responsibility to bring joy to everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you tire of spinning around, you walk into the kitchen, suddenly curious if food tastes different as a woman. Reaching into the fridge, you pull out a carton of orange juice and drink right from it. <i>Hmmm, no real difference,</i> you think to yourself, <i>but I guess it's improper for a lady to drink directly from the carton.</i> You giggle a little, some juice dribbling down your cheeks and neck as a result. Still smiling, you put the carton down and grab a paper towel to wipe the juice off. Looking down again, you're glad to see none of the juice got on your dress. \"Oh wow, ten minutes as a girl, and I'm already worried about ruining dresses!\" you laugh to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly hear a faint skittering over your girly laughter. Looking out the kitchen window, you see a squirrel scurrying over a low-hanging branch. \"I wonder, if I'm as graceful as Belle, as a Disney Princess...can I also....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to test your theory, you grab a jar of nuts and pour some into your hands. Then, ever so carefully, you open the window, hoping you don't startle the squirrel. Miraculously, it doesn't bolt. Then, just as gracefully, you hold up your hand, offering the nuts. The squirrels stares at you curiously for a moment, then throws caution to the wind and jumps onto your arms. Its claws don't poke through your gloves, and it starts munching on the nuts. The squirrel is so relaxed, it lets you pet it as it chows down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, just like a fairytale princess, I'm good with animals,\" you think aloud in wonder. Just how much like Belle had you become? Would you show more of Belle's traits as time went on? Part of you was still trying to make sense of these bizarre experiences and possibilities, and another part of you was feeling daring again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that feeling that you needed to spread joy, to share how good you felt as Belle, took hold again. As you watched the squirrel retreat out the window, the perfect solution suddenly hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia,\" you breathe out in Belle's singsong voice. Your kinda-sorta-girlfriend as Nick with deep emotional scars. Your not quite sure what this device and its power could do for her, though. Maybe being a fellow girl to talk to could help in ways you couldn't as Nick? Maybe she'd like to try being a Disney Princess herself, to get away from her troubles for a time and just feel good being alive?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you glance over the shelf holding all your games and DVDs, you eventually come to the Disney DVDs you keep on hand whenever it's time to babysit girls in your neighborhood. Sleeping Beauty,\" you mutter. A story about a picturesque princess who was impossible not to adore. If this device was supposed to turn into into ANY fictional girl...let's put it to a real test. Might as well use it to become what many would consider the pinnacle of femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't exactly feel fearful, still highly dubious that such a powerful tool could just fall in your lap. So you take out the DVD, place it in your PS2, and attach the cord from the watch into the controller slot. After hitting the button on the watch...nothing happens. You sigh in annoyance. This cheap-looking toy was a dud after all....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you're aware of a tingling in your toes, and the sensation is swiftly traveling up your body. As you look down, you notice the watch is glowing. Shocked, you hold your wrist up close, and realize something is not quite right. Your fingers...they look longer, but somehow more slender and delicate. Almost like...a lady's hands?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze for a moment, and in that time, you notice other changes. Your fingernails...they're growing out a little. But instead of becoming long and clawlike, they appear...perfectly manicured? As you're watching you hand change, numb with shock, you almost don't notice a faint tickling at the back of your neck. You finally move your hand to reach for whatever is brushing your neck, and gasp with shock when you feel silky hair. You pull it in front of your eyes; your hair's become so long, you wind up grabbing handfuls! Long, shimmering locks of golden hair tumble down, and you can feel how silky it is between your now delicate-looking digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had only been a curious tingling here and there...now you felt sharp tugging and tightening sensations all over your body. Muscles all over your body were contracting, as if imploding and losing mass. At the moment, the feeling was most painful in your face, as if all the muscle there were rearranging. The shock numbs you for a moment, but soon you're running across the room. You snatch up the Nintoaster you built yourself (yes, the NES used by the Angry Video Game Nerd) and look into the side. Not only do you sport long, golden-blonde hair that any woman would kill for, but your entire face was indeed changing. Higher cheekbones, more feminine lips and eyebrows...you eyes widen with shock as the irises go from a dull brown to a sparkling, sapphire blue! You stare at your reflection in the toaster, mouth now agape. Another shock...even your teeth now look perfect! Everything perfectly aligned, sparkling white...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so distracted by the changes in your face, you almost didn't notice that odd tugging and contracting was happening everywhere else. But as you feeling a lot of tugging below the belt, you can't ignore it any longer. Specifically, you feel an excruciating tugging from within in your manhood. \"Oh no, no no no no no,\" you mutter, terrified. Your now-delicate hand flies to your groin. You feel your package rapidly shrinking underneath your pants, until it's completely gone. Gulping, you know what you'd find instead if you looked, but you're too scared to look. No less unnerving are other tugging sensations in your lower body, especially in your legs. You know that you'd also see the shapely, perfect legs of a lady if you dropped your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were not only tugging sensations, but bloating sensations here and there. While your pant legs now feel a little loose, your pants suddenly feel tight around the hips. You instinctively know that extra fat tissue had just been added around your hips, and the bones of your pelvic girdle had shifted to accommodate. \"Wait a minute, if adipose tissue is magically appearing in certain places, then...oh no. OH NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you predicted, you feel something expand on your chest. Gulping, but this time working up the nerve to look, you pull at your shirt and look down. Sure enough, the coup de grace was coming: breasts were ballooning on your chest, and your nipples were even getting bigger, just like a girl's! If you weren't so scared and confused...you'd actually be a bit turned on by the site of such perfect breasts, even if they were attached to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new feminine assets stopped expanding, just when they were in the C-range. \"Good thing these Disney Princesses don't exactly have mammoth racks,\" you grumble. Shock overwhelms you all over again. For the first time, you notice how soft and melodious your voice now sounds. Even when venting your anger and anxiety, it did nothing to mask its new, hypnotic beauty. You let go of your T-shirt, and let out a girly gasp when it brushes against your nipples. It felt so itchy and uncomfortable, yet a little...enticing at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, can't get distracted. Got to figure out just how this damn watch works,\" you tell yourself, trying to ignore how mellifluous your voice has become. You look down, down past the mounds protruding from your T-shirt. The bottoms of your pant legs, they were wrinkled up, obscuring your shoes. You had lost a few inches in height, on top of everything else! You swiftly lift up one leg to investigate. You're surprised at how graceful this kicking motion is, but not quite as much as when your sneaker flies off your now-dainty foot. Even your FEET had shrunk! You collapse into the office chair you play games in and remove the sock. Once had once been a tight fit came off easily, revealing a dainty little foot. You wiggle the toes...they were yours, all right. Those bare feet on which Aurora hiked and pranced in the forest with impossible grace...they're now yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you sat there, nonplussed, forced to conclude that the watch had some functionality. Your body had changed not only into a girl's, but one of the most feminine and picturesque in the history of animation! Now the question was...what to do now! You glance down again at your poorly-fitting clothes. \"Well, if I can't reverse this effect anytime soon, I'd better find something else to wear,\" you admit to yourself. \"Hopefully, I can find some clothes of Serena's that can fit. Nothing too girly, that's for sure. At least this device isn't FULLY functional, considering I'm not in a ball gown...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For many long minutes, you simply sit there in your office chair, dully staring down at the new feminine body hidden beneath your old clothes. Your T-shirt is a bit baggy now, but your new C-cup breasts are still noticeable. And boy, do you FEEL them! Each breath you take causes your T-shirt's fabric to rub against your bare nipples. It's still rather uncomfortable. \"Now I know why girls wear bras,\" you mutter to yourself. On top of the sight and sensation of having breasts, your see several locks of golden hair tumble over your shoulders. Your T-shirt's dark fabric makes them stand out even more in your peripheral vision. Right now, you're just glad there are no mirrors around. Seeing those kissable lips and high cheekbones again could make you lose what's left of your sanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your wrist to examine that watch, cringing a little at the fluidity of the motion. At the dainty, delicate hand attached to your arm. You ignore all that as best you can as you try to figure out what button could undo all this. At the moment, it's impossible to dope out which one would throw everything in reverse. And frankly, you're too afraid to try. Messing with this more could put you in one of Aurora's fancy dresses, or even have you thinking like a teenage princess! Things were weird enough as is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe...maybe I need to go see Amelia and Serena. Serena's good with tech stuff like this, and, well, Amelia's one of the few people I'll let know about this crazy shit,</i> you think to yourself. But first, you'd have to find clothes to fit your new frame. Thankfully, no one was home, so you had free reign of her closet. You shudder a little. Your mother was definitely a girly girl and quite serious about fashion. Any hope of finding tomboyish clothes was next to nil....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you slowly stand up. You kick off your other sneaker, then head for the door. A few feet from it, you feel your pants slide down your legs. You gasp as you feel the rough fabric slide against fair, smooth skin. On top of that, your underwear fell off too, and you can feel a light breeze brush against your...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK!\" you scream indignantly as you pull you pants back up. You stomp across the hall towards your mother's bedroom, trying to ignore the odd sensations from your nipples and between your legs. It was getting harder and harder to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou storm into your mother's room and throw the closet doors open. As you expected, an array of dresses, ladies' business suits and (shudder) lacy lingerie awaits you. There are a few pairs of jeans...but they all have floral patterns shown into them. Roses, to be precise. \"Oh, how fitting,\" you mutter dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring your mother could be home any minute, you decide it's best to pick some clothes and bolt ASAP. You don't see any T-shirts for girls to go with those jeans, but there are some sports bras on the floor. Lovely. As for the dresses and suits...there's a simple white ensemble, a blazer with silvery buttons and a modest skirt. Looking down, you notice all of your mother's shoes. There one pair in particular...wedge sandals with four-inch cork heels and white straps. You could walk in those easily, you figure, and they'd go with the skirt suit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now time to decide. You didn't really want to wear anything overtly feminine. But a prime fox like yourself going around in a sports bra and jeans? You were going to draw attention no matter what, but the plainer you tried to dress, the odder you would look....</span></div></div>",

Then you reach for the white sports bra dangling over a small plastic dresser in the closet...and with both hands away from your pants, they fall down again. Once again, the sensation of denim sliding down your shapely, smooth legs was...electrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting exasperatedly, you kick your old jeans away in frustration, then bend over to put on the girls' pair. As you pull them up, it takes some effort to get them snugly over your hips. \"Damn, my ass is that big now?\" you mutter in disbelief as you try to slide the jeans over your now-wider hips. Doing so makes more breasts jiggle some more, and yes, your erect nipples brush against your T-shirt once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting down on your lip, you finally decide you've had enough. In one fell swoop, your T-shirt comes off, at last revealing Princess Aurora's full, perfect breasts to the world. As fate would have it, there was a full-length mirror in your mother's room, and the image that stared back at you looked something like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://suzuki7515.tumblr.com/image/57238693001\" target=\"_blank\">http://suzuki7515.tumblr.com/image/57238...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at your reflection for a moment, amazed at how luscious those titties look. But they were YOUR titties. Those bolt-erect nipples, made so by the constant rubbing against your T-shirt...you could still FEEL them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs heavenly as those globes of feminine flesh were, they had to be covered up. You reach down for the white sports bra again, gasping a little at how your bare breasts dangled. Wanting to waste no more time, you pull the sports bra over your head and do your best to settle your breasts in its confines. You're...astonished by how comfortable your breasts suddenly feel. They're suddenly no longer a burdensome bother and...feel quite nice to have, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left were shoes. Unable to find any running shoes, you settle for the four-inch wedge sandals with white ankle straps. You put them on without incident, and when you stand back up...it's not that hard to maintain your balance! \"I guess I have some of Aurora's grace,\" you say as you look down. You lift one leg: these pants legs perfectly fit your now-feminine contours, and intricate floral patterns run down its length. Quite girly, but somehow, not too much so. A...tolerable outfit to wear on your first foray in public as a girl. And a Disney Princess at that.</span></div></div>",

And judging by what you feel pressing down on your bare legs, you know there's a lot of frilly skirts underneath the main one. You watch in horror as the sleeves of your T-shirt travel down your arm, reforming into a far silkier, smoother fabric, stopping only when they reached your wrists. The watch that started it all was still visible, flashing a violent red, but you're too scared to touch it at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou receive another rude shock when the sneaker you kicked off before slowly levitates back to you. While in midair, it reforms into a smaller shoe: a pump with four-inch heels, right before sliding itself back on your foot. You're amazed by how easily you feel that little shoe slide on, as if such glamorous, girly things were meant for you. <i>Am I THAT demure and feminine now!?</i> you silently wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the neck of your T-shirt travels down, exposing your collarbones. your shoulders, and...(you shudder) a little bit of your cleavage. You face even feels a little tingly. <i>Oh crap, is even MAKEUP getting applied out of thin air!?</i> you wonder in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the only thing to appear on you from out of nowhere. You suddenly feel cold metal around the bottom of your neck, as well as a cold weight on top of your head. You couldn't see anything, but slowly, gingerly, you lift your hand, letting your delicate, ladylike fingers brush against the object, tracing it. A gold necklace band that felt like it was all one piece, perfectly fitting the contours around your neck. Your other hand reached up, and the now-fair skin of your finger was almost cut on your crown's tip. Your crown. The crown of the royal princess you had just become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now maybe I can go find a spinning wheel to prick it on, so someone can then rape me in my sleep,\" you mutter darkly. You shudder even more: even when speaking with a sarcastic bite, that came out quite invitingly. You take a deep breath, noticing your constrained these breasts feel when pressing against your new dress's bodice. \"And girls dream of wearing stuff like this? Everything feels so...weird.\" Taking another deep breath, you force yourself to look down at your new royal duds.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you glance downward, locks of your long, golden hair tumble over your shoulders, tickling your sensitive flesh. On top of that, seeing that tiny bit of cleavage this dress let one get a glimpse of...it was almost enough to make you freak. But the dress itself...it was indeed the simple, yet opulent, silky dress Aurora had in her movie, but the blue version. Somehow, seeing that you hadn't been dolled up in the pink one let you keep your sanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you sit in that chair for a good long while, just trying to steady your breathing. The sensation of those alien, squishy bags of flesh constantly getting pressed against that tight bodice with each breath...wasn't helping matters any. You raise your hands to your face again; soft, delicate digits, perfectly manicured. Slowly, gingerly, you touch your face with those ladylike hands, marveling at how smooth your cheeks feel, how high the cheekbones are. Your fingertips trace a path downward, down your neck, feeling that your Adam's apple is indeed no more. Your rake your fingers through your hair again, still unable to get over how long it is, how silky it all feels. But at last, you work up the courage to feel those new assets of yours through the dress. At once, you gasp again: a soft, girly gasp. Your breasts, they're so soft, squishy and sensitive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all that, you feel a bit calmer. Deciding that there was nothing to be gained by sitting in that chair any longer, you slowly rise. It wasn't until when you were nearly standing that you remembered those heels, but by some miracle, it's not too difficult to keep your balance. Whether it was some effect of the watch, or that heels just weren't as tough to walk in as some claimed, you're not sure. You're just glad you didn't fall on your face. Now THAT would be unladylike!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand at your full height, looking down at yourself. This dress...it all felt so silky smooth, so fine. Your hands cup your breasts again, and you repress a shudder of shock and slight pleasure. They travel down, past your waist, slowly going over your now-wide hips. Not brave enough to feel in between your legs just yet, you run your hands over your skirts, and you feel the petticoats underneath brush up against your smooth, shapely legs. IT was an oddly pleasant feeling. Wanting to see those legs for yourself, you take a deep breath and grab a handful of silky fabric. Pulling up your skirts, you thrust one leg out, amazed that you didn't wobble and fall after standing on one foot wearing a four-inch heel. Indeed, your leg was smooth, shapely, and looked every bit capable of allowing the graceful walk of a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another deep breath, you stand bolt erect and, still holding onto your skirts, you march forward. You still wobble a little, still not entirely comfortable walking in heels. Nevertheless, after a while, you do feel as though you're floating above the carpet almost effortlessly. \"OK, so I'm getting the hang of walking all regally and stuff,\" you think aloud. It still makes you shudder, how angelic your voice sounds, but for some reason, you feel like you're already getting used to it. To sounding like a woman. \"So...until I figure out how to switch back, what should I do with this body?\"</span></div></div>",

This time, even your angelic new voice can't mask the sarcastic bite. That makes you smirk a little as you walk on, one foot clad in a high heeled shoe in front of the other. You keep the front of your skirts slightly lifted; walking in heels is getting easier, but you're not about to risk breaking your neck. You almost wish you could see yourself walking. It's a good bet you really do look like a graceful princess walking about her domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the house was empty aside you yourself, so no one was around to see Princess Aurora emerge from your bedroom. Keeping your breathing steady, you march on to the bathroom, still taking it slow. It's not easy, adjusting to the feel of silky petticoats and a slight breeze brushing across your legs. Such alien sensations, yet not unpleasant. \"It actually feels...kinda nice,\" you admit to yourself. \"I guess I can...sort of understand why girls enjoy wearing dresses\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reach the bathroom. Reaching out with your delicate, ladylike hand, you open the door. Taking a breath so deep it makes your bodice hug your breasts more tightly than ever, you saunter inside, flip on the light, and turn to face the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just as you expected. Long, flowing golden hair, high cheekbones, plump kissable lips, flawless skin...you're every bit how Princess Aurora would look in real life! You finger your tiara and necklace again, marveling how cold they feel with your soft, delicate fingertips. It's nowhere near as odd, however, as watching this blonde bombshell in the mirror mimic your every move. Even the way your lips are slightly parted in surprise...that alone would make any guy's heart melt. Or give him a boner. Or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, you feel a strange tingling...down there, in your new ladyparts! As if the sight of your new body is turning you on. Despite yourself, you giggle a little, and the face in the mirror looks just like how Aurora would laugh to herself. Indeed, you've somehow become this perfect princess in every way! And somehow, with each passing minute, you're becoming more comfortable with it. Breasts and a vagina, a fancy dress, jewelry, high heels...now, it's all more interesting than appalling. For a few minutes, you pose for the mirror. Doing things like lifting your skirts with both hands and curtseying, looking over your shoulder with a flirtatious smile, spinning around and letting your skirts twirl, and simply striking provocative poses. You remember in Sleeping Beauty, how morose Aurora looked when she sat and saw herself in this blue dress in the mirror. How ironic that you, a guy, was having the opposite reaction from seeing that staring back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I...guess experiencing womanhood might not be so bad,\" you admit. The broad smile reflected in the mirror isn't an act; you're genuinely curious about seeing what else being a girl had to offer. How would it feel to hang around with guys like this, or...go further? How would being with girls be different? \"Of course, I'd have to find a change of clothes. It's not like Comic-Con's going on right now,\" you tell yourself in the mirror, giggling again. There had to be some girl clothes in the house that would fit Aurora - or rather, YOU - but you found yourself a tad reluctant to part with Aurora's dress just then. It still felt so...intriguing, having it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you look down at your wrist. The watch had been invisible, but as if responding to your mental commands, it suddenly appeared on your dainty wrist. \"Hmmmm, convenient,\" you mutter. \"I guess I could figure out how to reverse this, get to Amelia's house, turn it back on show her. Won't she flip!\" Your sisters won't be back anytime soon, and besides, you feel you can better trust Amelia with this secret than them. Plus, she'd probably be more open to your sudden curiosity about seeing how the other half lives. And so....</span></div></div>",

        "created":1286300460,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Based on Starfighter364\u2019s interactive of the same name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Nick. One day, you receive a watch-like device that allows you to obtain the data about fictional girls by scanning a screen or picture, or by plugging a special device that goes in it into a controller slot on a video game console. If you connect the device to the game, then you can enter the game in the body of that character. Eventually, you will gain the abilities to scan the data of female friends and to transform other humans, animals, and dolls/puppets (you won't be able to transform at the time, but you can control them with the device).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo gay/lesbian stuff or incest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep any names of characters the same throughout the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing off Nick or ending the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool has just ended for the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo turning Nick evil or changing his personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny character that in their series is called a god will be considered a powerful spirit instead in this story, even if the characters from their series won't call them as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watch will prevent Nick from getting a girl pregnant (or from getting pregnant himself) before he is old enough to support a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nick and someone else who is changed wants to stay that form, then a function will appear on the watch, which will alter reality so that everyone except the two of them believe that the person has always been that way (it can't happen for Nick). If this is done, the original form of the person is lost forever (unless it is a girl who has been scanned by the watch, then her form will be saved in it). Nick will still have control of them, but the watch can be used to transform others again. Nobody will find it odd that the person will be the same as the girl they became. Also, while doing so, Nick can alter the age of the fictional girl to match the age of the person being transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the watch has Nick (or anyone/anything else that he'd transform) take the form of a character who can transform between girl forms and boy forms will be in girl form the whole time, with no traces of the boy form. While Nick is one of them, he can't go into the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nick is holding onto someone who is transformed when they go into the series, then he'll go in as well, and be sucked into the body of the main character (or one of them if there are many) regardless of if they or male or female, unless the player is a character in the game, in which case, he'd become that character. If the character is female, then she will be stored on the watch. If not, Nick can transform into that character without the watch. Note: Nick can only become one male per continuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there is ever a debate on the gender of a character, then ask me, and I'll decide. Characters that are considered female:<br>\r\n-Teito Klein from 07 Ghost. He's small and cute, even though he is apparently old enough to be in an army, and his relationship with Mikage and that other guy borders on homo. So I'm making him a girl, just to avoid the identity crisis that 07 Ghost takes in stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the scanning feature, you can use edited versions of characters, including female versions of male characters. If you do this, you must give a link to a picture of that character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device is waterproof (along with being indestructible), and can't be taken off once put on. The device also stops him from being able to be possessed, hypnotized, or brainwashed in any way, not that he knows that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse proper grammar and spelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I find out that someone who adds has stolen someone else's chapter, and then posted it as their own, then I'll delete it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease put up links to pictures of the fictional girls during the option chapters they are mentioned in, or the chapter that Nick turns into them. Don't hesitate to use pictures of what someone as the girl is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere may be other things I'm forgetting, so everything else is fair game unless I remember anything else and add it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s personality: Quiet and observant. He doesn\u2019t like to make small talk. However, he is extremely perceptive, as well as being quick-thinking. He will often make observations that surprise people. He\u2019s also a very good liar \u2013 he doesn\u2019t keep a poker face, but instead alters his facial expression and body language to broadcast the emotion that he wants to portray. He enjoys video games in general and writing stories. He\u2019s also an anime fan. Incidentally, he knows a lot about psychology. (You can reference the manga Liar Game for ideas.)<br>\r\nNick\u2019s appearance: Dark hair, somewhat tall. He\u2019s not really what you would call an athlete, but he\u2019s surprisingly good at physical activities. His skin is pale in places and tanned in others, and he doesn\u2019t often show emotion on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReesa: Nick's little sister, age 13. She's obsessed with the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. Unlike other fanatics her age, she's pretty good at playing the game, and is an expert at constructing a good deck. (Nick's opinion is that if she would just focus on school instead of some card game, she could easily skip a grade or five.) She has long brown hair, and is rather tall for a thirteen-year-old kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia: If you\u2019re looking for three words to describe Amelia, then those words are \u201cSarcastic\u201d, \u201cCynical\u201d, and \u201cSpiteful\u201d. However, Amelia\u2019s prickly exterior hides an inner emotional turmoil, and she remains an enigma to everyone \u2013 except Nick, who guessed her emotional state after about an hour in her company. He confronted her with it at the end of the day in a private setting, and she collapsed crying into his arms. Since then, Amelia has had feelings for Nick, and Nick knows it, but he has left the situation alone because he has no experience with love affairs, and doesn\u2019t even know if he returns her feelings. She's sixteen years old. She has long, black hair and an unimpressive figure. She doesn't consciously watch her weight, but she is used to eating diet food. She enjoys RPG video games and watching anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena: Amelia's older sister, age 21 and with a great figure. More information will be added when someone adds it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you create a character, then you must give the details about them, such as their appearance and personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are 16 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfighter364's interactive can have a crossover with this one. Neither Nick nor Anthony can transform each other, or anyone that the other already has transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I will give 100 GP to anyone who makes a good chapter, aside from an option chapter, without breaking any of my rules. Furthermore, I will give an extra 500 GP to the first three people for their first good chapters, aside from Starfighter364. I can't afford to pay you right now, but I can and will keep track of how much I owe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, have fun!</td>",
