However, while carefully searching through the now derelict academic facility, she comes across numerous Feral Ghouls. Though, these Ghouls had a pinkish hue and were considered to be morbidly obese. Eventually, she comes across trays full of this pink paste. Though, little did she know, that tasting this paste administers an... Addictive and filling side effect. Will she realize her mistake before she becomes too fat and rotund to even waddle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 2: The Case of Vault 99<br>\r\nWhen The Sole Survivor had returned from being teleported to the Institute, she paid the Synth detective, Nick Valentine, a visit. But when she visited the Valentine Detective Agency in Diamond City, he and his assistant, Ellie Perkins, were currently reviewing a brand new case that they've recently acquired from a wealthy client in the Upper Stands. Apparently, said client wanted Nick to find the man's daughter, who ran off with some Vault Dweller from a previously unknown Vault: Vault 99. Of course, being the helpful person that she was, The Sole Survivor decided to help Nick Valentine with the case. However, little did they know, that this specific Vault had some... Eccentric tastes when it comes to their views on what a beautiful woman looks like. More specifically, the rotund and morbidly obese kind. What will happen when The Sole Survivor comes across this eccentric Vault full of fat and obese women?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, which story will you choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>War... War Never Changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn October 23rd, 2077... The world was consumed by atomic fire, unleashed from bombs harnessing the power of the atom. This...was The Great War. Although the American Dream has been long dead for over 200 years, human civilization continued to thrive in the Commonwealth, with places like Diamond City and Goodneighbor residing amongst the remains of what was once the city of Boston, Massachusetts. However, our story isn't about the convoluted history of the Commonwealth nor the numerous dangers throughout the land, such as Raiders, Gunners, Super Mutants, Feral Ghouls, and the various amounts of mutated wildlife. This is the story of The Sole Survivor from Vault 111.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name is Alicia Rose. To many, she is a Vault Dweller, truly a \"Woman Out of Time\". After all, she was literally a living relic from Pre-War times, all thanks to being frozen in suspended animation by cryogenic pods inside Vault 111, keeping her alive and preserved for over 2 centuries. However, unlike other conventional Vault Dwellers, Alicia had a more...voluptuous but healthily plump physique, complete with a pair of plush Double D-Cup breasts, a chubby but cushiony rear end, subtly plump thighs, a soft but discreet bump of a belly, and a healthy but slightly fuller face, along with long flowing reddish-brown hair that was braided into a short ponytail. Though, to the journalist from Diamond City, Piper, Alicia was more than just a Vault Dweller... She was a friend, and a lover. However, there was some...controversy, regarding Alicia's choice of faction to align herself with. Instead of aligning herself with The Minutemen, The Railroad, or even the so-called \"Boogeymen\" of the Commonwealth, The Institute. Instead, Alicia voluntarily aligned herself with the most recent faction to arrive in the Commonwealth: The Brotherhood of Steel. They arrived in force, with their soldiers clad in T-60 Power Armor, armed with Laser Rifles and Miniguns, carried into the Commonwealth by flying aircraft called \"Vertibirds\". But in the center of their loyal battle-hardened masses, was the Prydwen: A massive mobile headquarters for the Brotherhood of Steel, capable of flight over vast distances. It was both a technological and engineering marvel, nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she voluntarily joined the Brotherhood of Steel of her own volition, Alicia did not share the same racist views that most members of the Brotherhood had when it came to the folks of the Commonwealth, still seeing the humanity that resided in both the sentient Ghouls throughout the Commonwealth and the occasional Super Mutant like Strong, as well as certain Synths such as Nick Valentine and DiMa. And when Paladin Danse was accused by Elder Arthur Maxson of being a Synth, she refused to kill her fellow comrade, and convinced Elder Maxson to spare Danse, much to Maxson's hostility toward Synths, since he considered them abominations. However, since one of the Brotherhood of Steel's core tenets is the preservation of any discovered Pre-War technology, Scribe Haylen sent Alicia off to find Pre-War technology. More specifically, within the decrepit halls of the Suffolk County Charter School. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is her story...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--August 25th, 2288--<br>\r\n--8:45 AM--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the Southern Commonwealth, a Deathclaw was preoccupied with consuming the fresh remains of a Gunner's corpse, freshly killed by this specific Deathclaw. However, this moment of solace for the horned beast was brief, as it caught the scent of something approaching it. The Deathclaw roared at this intruder, brandishing it's claws, ready for a fight. Unfortunately for this monstrous creature, it was cut down by the maelstrom of 5mm bullets from a Minigun. This Minigun was held by none other than Alicia Rose, currently wearing the T-60 Paladin Power Armor given to her by the Brotherhood of Steel, which allowed her to wield the heavy automatic weapon with little difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she wasn't trekking through the Commonwealth Wasteland alone, as Piper followed closely behind her Power Armor-clad lover, armed with a nodded Laser Rifle given to her by Alicia as a Christmas present. \"Well, Blue. This is the 3rd Deathclaw we've seen in 4 hours.\" Piper chirped, remarking on how many Deathclaws they've encountered in the past 4 hours. Of course, as the Minigun's 6 barrels slowed down in rotation, Alicia quipped back towards Piper, speaking to her with a flirtatious tone and replied, \"Well, you know me, Piper: I'm not exactly the biggest fan of Deathclaws since Concord. Though, I can't say I blame you for saying that. Who knows? There might be more Deathclaws the further south we go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't remind me, hon!\" Piper answered, delivering a light jab at Alicia's Power Armor-clad side in an almost sarcastic manner, chuckling some in the process. From there, both Alicia and Piper continued walking down the crumbled asphalt that was once a road, where they continued their conversation, shifting onto a different topic, as Piper spoke first and said, \"...Still, I don't understand why you sided with the Brotherhood of Steel. I mean, they're willing to wage open war with the Institute, for Christ sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper... The Brotherhood of Steel aren't monsters. I mean, sure they're fanatically devoted to Elder Maxson's cause with wiping out Synths, it's just that they needed to realize that not everything involving the Synths is black and white as they thought, that not every Synth is out there to kill humanity. Trust me, it took a lot to convince Maxson that Nick Valentine wasn't going to kill him. But...the Brotherhood make some very valid points as well, Piper.\" Alicia answered, trying her best to explain to Piper why the Brotherhood of Steel weren't as evil as they claimed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what points are those, Honey?\" Piper asked, cocking an eyebrow at her beloved Alicia, thus prompting the plus-sized Vault Dweller to retort and explained, \"...Think about it, Piper: What would happen if, say, The Gunners get their hands on something like Liberty Prime? They would use his nuclear arsenal to control the Commonwealth through fear. The reason why the Brotherhood focuses on preserving lost technology is to make sure that tech doesn't fall into the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after careful thought, Piper somewhat reluctantly agreed with you on such a delicate matter, where she spoke toward Alicia and said, \"*sigh*...Well, I guess you made your point, Blue.\" However, just before she could speak anymore, both Piper and Alicia had finally arrived at their intended destination: The Suffolk County Charter School.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After trekking through the Southern Commonwealth for several hours, Alicia and Piper had finally arrived at their destination: The Suffolk County Charter School. Judging from the building's current physical state, they could easily tell that that the school hasn't been used for quite a long time, though Alicia can easily see it hasn't been occupied by anyone since the bombs fell in 2077. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just before they could approach the derelict academic center, Piper had noticed a sign positioned in front of the school, where she approached it to gain a closer look, easily noticing that there was some writing on the sign. \"Um, Piper? What are you doing?\" Alicia asked, wondering what exactly her lover was doing, where Piper responded back and replied, \"Take it easy, Blue. I'm just looking at this sign over here. I think there's something written on it.\" \"Oh? And what does it say then?\" Alicia asked, where she walked over toward Piper, who moved some dead shrubbery out of the way to get a clearer view of the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"Education is what survives when what has been learnt has been forgotten.\" Yep, that definitely sounds like something for a school.\" Piper said, reading aloud the withered words on the sign's bulletin board. Of course, Alicia retorted back and replied, \"Well, this WAS a school back before the Great War, Piper. After all, you're discussing this with an old fossil like me.\" \"*Giggle* Yeah, I guess you're right. But still, you look very attractive for an \"old fossil\", Blue.\" Piper answered, flirting with her Power Armor-clad lover, where the two women calmly approached the front entrance to the Suffolk County Charter School. But before they were going to casually enter the building, Alicia momentarily stopped her journalist comrade and said, \"Let's be careful once we get inside. I got a feeling that whoever was in there 200 years ago might still be there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, speaking from her personal experiences while traveling across the Commonwealth with Alicia, Piper knew very well to heed her lover's intuition, which meant that whoever was inside the school when the bombs fell might either be skeletons or transformed into Feral Ghouls from the radioactive fallout. In response, Piper gave Alicia a firm nod in agreement, where the duo then slowly opened the double doors, cautiously entering the abandoned Suffolk County Charter School, closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were fully inside the school, they could see the center of Pre-War academic learning in it's current but somewhat decayed state. Debris laid scattered across the lobby floor, and the large grand staircase had collapsed from 2 centuries of erosion and decay. Needless to say, the Suffolk County Charter School had seen better days. However, in an attempt to not announce their presence to any potential Feral Ghouls that might be inside the school, Piper spoke toward Alicia and whispered, \"So... Remind me why your Brotherhood of Steel buddies sent us here?\" \"...Well, Scribe Haylen wanted us to find a few Fusion Cores to use as a power source for some sort of energy shield to protect the Cambridge Police Station from any potential attacks, whether it's from Raiders to Institute Synths.\" Alicia explained, keeping her fingers on the Minigun's trigger should they run into any Feral Ghouls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, just as they thought that there were no threats inside the school, Piper heard the faint sounds of...gurgling, perhaps? Becoming curious, Piper slowly approached the source of the gurgling noise. However, when she reached the assumed source of the gurgling noises, Piper looked into a nearby classroom, where she came across a ghastly but strangely comical sight: A Feral Ghoul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow normally, she considered Feral Ghouls to be entirely ghastly, since these were once normal human beings. However, what made this specific Feral Ghoul comical to Piper were several factors. First, the Feral Ghoul's entire skin pigment was a bright pinkish hue. And second, this Feral Ghoul appeared to be morbidly obese, complete with a fat apron belly, chunky thighs, thick double chin, and fat-laden arms. And yet, despite it's bloated corpulent appearance, the Feral Ghoul didn't seem to be aware of Piper's presence for the time being, as it was currently preoccupied with feasting on the innards of a freshly killed Raider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to warn Alicia, Piper cautiously backed out of the classroom, where she then saw Alicia on the other side of the derelict school lobby. From there, Piper began to loudly whisper toward the Power Armor-clad Alicia and said, \"Psst! Hey, Blue. Blue!\" \"What is it, Piper?!\" Alicia loudly whispered, looking back at her beloved, as well as wondering why Piper was trying to get her attention, just as Piper spoke toward Alicia and loudly whispered, \"You really need to see this, Blue. Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* If this is another prank, Piper. I swear one of these days...\" Alicia muttered to herself, where she stood up from the locked door and slowly walked over to where Piper was standing. However, once Alicia followed Piper inside the classroom, the plump Vault Dweller got a good long look at the pink corpulent Feral Ghoul feasting on a dead Raider. \"Oh... That's why.\" Alicia said, realizing that this was what Piper was trying to show her. Unfortunately for the two women, the rotund Feral Ghoul became aware of them, as it then let out this guttural screech, warning it's fellow Ghouls that it found their new meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!!\" Alicia and Piper yelled in unison, as they quickly brought out their weapons and began to open fire on the oncoming Feral Ghouls, with each Ghoul they gunned down just as pink and rotund as the pink Feral Ghoul from earlier.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, after 3 and a half minutes of the sounds of gunfire and laser blasts echoing throughout the derelict school, Alicia and Piper had finally killed possibly all of the Feral Ghouls within the Suffolk County Charter School. \"*pant* *pant* Okay... Was it just me, Blue, or were those Ghouls harder to kill than we thought?\" Piper asked, a little out of breath from extensively dodging Feral Ghouls and their attacks. However, now that things were finally calm and the battle was over, both Alicia and Piper easily noticed something... Peculiarly odd, regarding the small horde of Feral Ghouls that attacked them: Like the first Feral Ghoul they've encountered inside the school, all of the Ghouls they have killed were just as pink and just as morbidly obese as their fellow Feral Ghoul back in the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, after seeing the deceased rotund bodies of the Feral Ghouls with her own eyes, Alicia couldn't help but agree with her journalistic lover and replied, \"...Yeah, you're not the only one, Hon. I mean, I shot a full drum magazine's worth of Minigun ammo at them! And yet, somehow they were able to negate some of the damage we did to them.\" \"But still... Why is their skin as pink as a Brahmin's backside, and how are they so... Well, fat?\" Piper asked, confused at the whole mass of obese Ghoul corpses before them. Then, while Alicia was reloading her Minigun with a fresh fully-loaded drum magazine, she continued speaking toward Piper and answered, \"I don't know, Piper... But I've got a bit of a bad feeling about this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Me too, Blue.\" Piper quipped, easily agreeing with her Power Armor-clad lover. And yet, Alicia couldn't help but become curious as to how these Feral Ghouls were so pink and so fat, while also wondering what was the exact cause of such a corpulent transformation in the first place. \"Come on, let's head to the Principal's Office. I've got a hunch that we might get some answers as to what's been going on here.\" Alicia said, who cautiously stepped over some of the corpulent Feral Ghoul corpses, calmly heading toward where the Principal's Office would be located. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Piper was taken aback slightly from such a decision on Alicia's part, where she quickly caught up with the Vault Dweller and asked, \"Wait a sec! Why would you want to find out more about this place? If you ask me, we should at least find what we're looking for and get the hell out.\" \"Aww come on, Piper! Aren't you at the least bit curious about what's going on here? Besides... It might be the next big article in Publick Occurrences.\" Alicia flirtatiously quipped, using her highly effective charismatic charm on Piper. Of course, even the persistent journalist of Diamond City was easily swayed by Alicia's honey-sweet words, as she couldn't help but become slightly curious at what exactly was going on here in the Suffolk County Charter School. So, in response, Piper shrugged her arms and answered, \"...Eh, why the hell not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's the Piper I know and love!\" Alicia replied, just as they went through the Reception Hall and opened the door to the Principal's Office. Upon setting their sights inside the office, Alicia and Piper could see that the office interior was in a mostly pristine condition, which included the skeleton of a woman behind the desk, slumped on the floor. Of course, Alicia somewhat recognized the skeleton, as she read the plaque on the desk, which said \"Principal Angela Hudson\" on it in bold letters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Alicia positioned herself in the center of the office, where she then slowly ejected herself out of her custom T-60 Power Armor, currently equipped in her plus-sized orange and gray Brotherhood of Steel jumpsuit uniform, which had the Brotherhood of Steel Sturdy Combat Armor covering up some to most of the jumpsuit. Though, judging from the look on her lover's face, Piper could see that Alicia has been here before. \"Hey! You alright there, Blue? You look like you've seen a ghost.\" Piper asked, catching the plump Vault Dweller's attention, where Alicia then answered, \"Oh, um... Sorry 'bout that, Hon. This place is a little...nostalgic, to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, anyway, let's see what we can find here.\" Piper remarked, as she then sat down in the Principal's chair and accessed the Principal's terminal on the desk. Meanwhile, Alicia carefully searched through the cabinets inside the office, where she stumbled across something rather...odd: An aluminum tray full of this meaty pink creamy paste. However, upon setting her eyes on the pink paste, Alicia's began to growl loudly, demanding to be fed. After all, Alicia was somewhat known to have a big appetite, which would explain her plush physique. In response to her stomach's hunger pangs, Alicia picked up the tray and thought to herself, \"Hmm... I just hope this stuff is edible...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Alicia was preoccupied on the tray full of pink paste, Piper coincidentally found a holotape next to the terminal. So, using the Pip-Boy she received from Alicia as a birthday gift, Piper took the holotape and inserted it into her Pip-Boy, which was labeled \"School Announcements, October 18th\" on it. From there, the holotape began to play the recording as it said, \"Good morning, teachers and students! It is another great week here at Suffolk County Charter School. I hope everyone is getting their costumes together for the annual Halloween festival. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that no outside food is to be brought on campus as of this week. This goes for faculty, as well as students. We have received generous donations for our implementation of the Nutrition Alternative Paste Program. We owe our benefactors strict adherence to the rules they have set forth. Thank you for your attention. This is Principal Hudson, signing off.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, while Piper was currently preoccupied with keenly listening to the holotape recording, Alicia dipped a single index finger into the voluminous pink paste, then pulled out her finger, which was now slathered in pink paste. \"*sigh*...Well, here goes nothing.\" Alicia thought to herself, being somewhat desperate to find food as soon as possible no thanks to her greedy gluttonous stomach. After all, despite her soft and plush physique, she was still as healthy as a normal woman during Pre-War times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Alicia slowly opened her mouth and allowed her pink paste-covered index finger to enter inside her gaping maw, as the slathered digit was firmly placed inside her famished mouth. From there, the plump Vault Dweller calmly closed her mouth around her inserted index finger, with her somewhat plump lips touching said digit, where she then began to pull her index finger out of her mouth with an audible *pop* in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she felt nothing from the pink paste inside her mouth. However, once the pink creamy substance first made physical contact with her tongue and taste buds, Alicia suddenly felt this tempting eruption of deliciousness within her mouth! Back before the bombs fell in 2077, Alicia fondly remembered to have an absurdly large sweet tooth, especially when it came to sweets like Fancy Lads Snack Cakes. And when she first tasted the pink paste, it felt like she was eating a radiation-free Fancy Lads Snack Cake, but with the delicious sweet taste cranked up to 11!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God! This stuff tastes like heaven!\" Alicia loudly thought to herself, becoming pleasantly surprised from such an edible revelation. In turn, Alicia then began to eagerly devour more and more of the pink paste from the tray, picking up chunks of pink paste with her bare hands and thrusting said chunks into her hungry eager maw. Though becoming lost in the blissful taste of the pink paste, Alicia was blissfully unaware of the edible paste's...\"addictive\" side effects. However, like any delicious meal, eventually it would be entirely devoured. And that's exactly what happened to Alicia, who had fully devoured the entire pink paste on the aluminum tray. And yet, she couldn't help but want more of the pink paste to consume, which prompted her to lick off the messy remains of the pink paste still clinging onto the aluminum tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it still wasn't enough to satiate her appetite. She needed more. She wanted more pink paste. But then, Alicia suddenly realized something: They were in a school, which meant it had a cafeteria, which meant it probably had more pink paste for her to consume! The eager anticipation alone was making her feel like a little girl in a candy store! However... There was still one minor problem: Her beloved Piper. Sure, Piper was mostly lenient towards Alicia's food binges. But if the Diamond City local saw her in such an addicted gluttonous state, then she won't be able to eat more of the pink paste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in an attempt to disguise her true gluttonous intentions, Alicia spoke toward Piper, disguising the tone of her voice and said, \"I'm going to head to the school cafeteria, see if there are any Fusion Cores there. Alright?\" \"...Alright. Just...be careful out there, sweetie. There might be a few of those \"Fatty Ghouls\" we've initially missed.\" Piper replied, completely unaware of her lover's gluttonous intentions. And yet, as Alicia walked out the door, Piper could've sworn that her lover's plump behind looked a little...fatter, only to shrug it off as her mind playing tricks, continuing her search through the Principal's terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alicia calmly walked toward the main entrance to the cafeteria. Although it was currently locked, the plump Vault Dweller was able to pick the lock open and unlock the doors with little to no effort. From there, she pushed both doors open, where she laid eyes upon the most mouth-watering sight today: Numerous cafeteria tables carrying trays full of pink paste, and it was all hers to devour! Rubbing her hands together with a greedy gluttonous look in her green eyes, Alicia rushed toward the nearest table and attacked a tray full of pink paste, digging her hands into the creamy food paste, grabbing handful after handful of pink paste and shoving them into her greedy maw. To Alicia, it felt like she had died and gone to Heaven! However, whilst blissfully binging on the trays of pink paste, Alicia had become blissfully unaware to what the food paste was actually doing to her, as her already plump body slowly but surely began to bloat up and fatten itself up with each morsel of the pink paste, causing her Brotherhood of Steel uniform to become a little tighter with each passing minute.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, back at the Principal's Office, Piper was still preoccupied with decoding the information residing within the Principal's terminal. And yet, despite her best efforts, she still felt like she was not getting any closer to discovering more juicy information regarding the Suffolk County Charter School. After all, it has been almost an entire hour since she started hacking into the Principal's terminal, and the journalist from Diamond City wasn't getting any further progress when it came to discovering new information. Although, it didn't help soothe her frustration as she kept hearing the repetitive clicking and clacking of the terminal keyboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" She exclaimed, pounding her left fist against the withered wooden desk once out of frustration. Moments later, she exhaled a deep sigh, rubbing her forehead some to stir up her creative thought process as she said, \"*sigh* ...Okay, Piper....think: There's gotta be some way to bypass some of this \"classified\" bullshit that principal put here.\" However, while she continued thinking about how to bypass into the more classified documents in the Principal's terminal, another thought had inadvertently crossed her mind: Alicia's current whereabouts and well-being. Now that she thought about it, she hasn't seen Alicia return to the Principal's Office for almost an hour, which slowly began to make Piper reasonably concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, out of a growing concern for her plump lover's well-being, Piper stood up from the Principal's chair, grabbed her custom Laser Rifle, and then cautiously walked out of the Principal's Office, where she began to call out to Alicia as she yelled, \"Hey, Blue? ....Alicia? Honey? Are you still out there?!\" No response, just silence. But still, as she slowly trekked down the hallway toward the School Cafeteria, Piper persistently called out to the plump Vault Dweller, hoping that Alicia would swiftly respond as she said, \"...Come on, Blue! This better not be one of your Pre-War pranks.\" Same as before: No response, only silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as she got closer to the School Cafeteria, Piper swore that she could hear these audible, wet slurping sounds coming from within the bowels of the Cafeteria. Thinking that it might be another one of those \"Fatty Ghouls\" from earlier, Piper raised her Laser Rifle, readying herself for another fight. From there, she took a deep breath, then exhaled, where she then quickly rushed into the Cafeteria, ready for a fight. However, instead of encountering another Fatty Ghoul, Piper encountered an all too familiar face: Alicia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately, Piper could see that something was clearly wrong with her beloved Alicia: She was much fatter than before! In appearance, Alicia appeared to have gained an extra 100 pounds in total, causing her Brotherhood of Steel jumpsuit to stretch to it's absolute limit, judging from a large tear on the jumpsuit's abdomen and two tears on the sides of Alicia's widened hips and thighs. However, Piper could easily see that Alicia's belly was now noticeably larger and fatter than before, as well as her D-Cup breasts going up a few sizes, becoming a hefty pair of F-Cup breasts. Along with a somewhat torn Brotherhood of Steel jumpsuit, some of the individual pieces of Alicia's Sturdy Combat Armor laid scattered across the dirty floor, as Piper noticed that the straps on the purged pieces of Combat Armor looked like they were snapped off from too much pressure. Overall, Alicia had somehow went from healthily plump to somewhat fat in the span of nearly an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Alicia!\" Piper exclaimed, rushing over toward her beloved Alicia, tending to any possible injuries she might've received. Fortunately, Alicia did not show any physical injuries. However, it was there that Piper took notice of something odd about Alicia: Her hands and mouth were messily covered with some sort of pink paste, which raised the journalist's suspicions, just as Alicia groaned some to her absurdly full but fattened stomach and said, \"*groan* ...Hey...H-Hey *Burp!* Piper. So, um... *Burp!* How goes your search?\" \"My search?! Blue, you had me so f*cking worried! I mean, you didn't return to check up on me for almost a goddamn hour!\" Piper yelled, feeling awfully tempted to simply slap Alicia right in the face out of great concern, only to swiftly wrap her arms around the somewhat fattened Vault Dweller in a loving embrace instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm just so glad you're alright, Blue.\" Piper answered, where she slowly assisted Alicia into a sitting position on the ground. From there, she brought up the topic of what exactly did the formerly plump Vault Dweller eat while she was preoccupied , where Piper spoke toward her and said, \"But seriously, Blue: What did you eat?\" \"Um...I don't know *Burp!* what you're talking about, sweetie.\" Alicia replied, failing miserably to persuade Piper of her gluttonous motivation, which prompted Piper to pull up Alicia's right hand, which was now slathered in the pink paste, making her point across and said, \" Alicia, this is serious! You look like you've gained a hundred pounds. I'm worried about you, Blue. So please, tell me.\" Although she was a mentally strong individual, Alicia couldn't resist Piper's concerns. So, in response to her journalist lover, Alicia...</span></div></div>",

War Never Changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn October 23rd, 2077, the world was consumed by searing atomic fire, wiping out anyone and anything who was unfortunate enough to get caught in a nuclear blast, either turning them into ash, or irradiating them into zombie-like Ghouls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when the fallout had settled, humanity eventually rebuilt society from the ashes, with places like Diamond City and Goodneighbor being major hotspots for commerce, trade, politics, etc. However, this isn't the story of a bunch of Raiders, or Super Mutants, or any of the dangers throughout the Commonwealth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the story of The Sole Survivor from Vault 111.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name is Kaylee Sanchez. To many, she was simply a Vault Dweller, truly a \"Woman Out of Time\", because she was literally from a time before the bombs fell. She was kept preserved in a cryogenic stasis pod for over two centuries. Suffice to say, she certainly had experienced a lot, and has lost some friends along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she wasn't exactly a petite woman either, complete with E-cup breasts, a fat jiggling behind and thunder thighs, along with a soft but somewhat subtle curve of a belly, and a plump round face, complete with luscious red hair put into a ponytail and a large pair of hair bangs that drooped over the left side of her face. Overall, she was certainly a looker with those pink eyes of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as many stories would go, there was always a side to join. And in Kaylee's situation, she joined the faction that seemed most familiar to her: The Brotherhood of Steel. Why? Her late husband was a member of the United States military before the bombs fell, while she pursued the career of becoming a lawyer. She worked her way up the ranks of the Brotherhood, eventually reaching the rank of Sentinel by the time the Brotherhood of Steel annihilated the Institute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she strongly believed that the Brotherhood of Steel were capable of great good, she did not share their extreme racist views of the other sentient beings in the Commonwealth, but she wouldn't hesitate to shoot them in self-defense. Sent by the Brotherhood to investigate recent sightings of Synths on the islands of Far Harbor, Kaylee would have no idea what life had in store for her, and especially her love life of all things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis...is her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Vim! Pop Factory, Far Harbor Islands --<br>\r\n--April 21st, 2290--<br>\r\n-- 9:44 am --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story begins with Alicia carefully treading through the wilderness of the Far Harbor Islands, currently wearing a full set of X-01 Power Armor, which was outfitted with Calibrated Shocks on both legs, a Recon Sensor mod installed in her helmet, along with a Bright lamplight for the helmet headlight, and a Jetpack fabricated onto the back of the Power Armor, all while the X-01 Power Armor was given a fresh coat of paint in the Brotherhood of Steel's colors of Iron Gray and Crimson Orange. And finally, she was armed with a heavily modified Laser Rifle called \"Righteous Authority\", a few Plasma Grenades, several Vertibird Signal Flares, and a Minigun painted with Brotherhood colors she aptly named \"Ad Victoriam\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kaylee was not traveling alone in the Far Harbor Islands. Accompanying her were Knight John Greystrom, who was outfitted in a set of standard Brotherhood-issued T-60 Power Armor, armed with a Laser Rifle, a few Fragmentation Grenades, and a Missile Launcher equipped with a guidance system. Aside from Knight Greystrom, there was also Senior Scribe Neriah, the head of the Biological Research department of the Brotherhood of Steel, responsible for dissecting the bodies of deceased enemies, with the purpose to analyze potential weaknesses or special traits within them that the Brotherhood could use to their advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow normally, Scribe Neriah would be on the Brotherhood of Steel's flagship and mobile headquarters, the Prydwen, investigating how Mole Rats have developed a natural resistance to radiation, as part of a project to develop a special chemical compound that could be used to protect the user against most of the more heavily concentrated pockets of radiation in the Commonwealth, such as the Glowing Sea, located southwest of Diamond City and what remained of Boston, Massachusetts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the reason why Neriah was traversing the Far Harbor Islands was under the request of Elder Arthur Maxson. Apparently, the Brotherhood had recently lost contact of a squad in Far Harbor. More specifically, approximately near the Vim! Pop Factory. But before they lost contact with the squad, their last message mentioned a massive 13 foot tall Gulper attacking the Super Mutants residing at the Vim! Pop Factory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being curious about this 13 foot Gulper, Scribe Neriah requested that she go with Kaylee Sanchez and Knight Greystrom, who were ordered by Maxson to investigate the fate of the missing squad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, of course, leads us to the group's current endeavor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What the hell happened here!?!\" Knight Greystrom exclaimed, aghast at the gruesome sight before him, his buxom commanding officer, and Scribe Neriah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore them, there were dozens of Super Mutant corpses scattered across the derelict parking lot of the Vim Pop Factory. Judging from the various stages of decomposition upon each of the deceased green-skinned humanoids, Kaylee could see that some of these Super Mutants have been killed recently, as Scribe Neriah cautiously examined one of the Super Mutant corpses, where Kaylee then asked, \"Scribe Neriah, got any idea who or...what, killed these Super Mutants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...To be honest, Sentinel Sanchez, this is quite the mystery. Here, take a look at this.\" Neriah retorted, where she then pointed out something rather...distinct, upon the examined corpse, which made this sickening squelching sound due to currently enduring rigor mortis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Blech!* Jesus Christ, Scribe! Did you have to show us that?!\" Knight Greystrom groaned, feeling as if he was about to puke inside his own T-60 helmet from merely getting a whiff of that decomposing corpse smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee on the other hand, approached the corpse that Neriah was examining, kneeling down on one knee to get a closer look at what the female Scribe was trying to show her. This came in the form of something rather... \"unusual\", even by Kaylee's standards of unusual. And this came in the form of a massive bite mark, taking a big chunk out of the left side of the Super Mutant, as it was clearly missing muscle mass and a few vital organs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay... Judging from what I'm seeing, Scribe Neriah, I'm guessing we're not dealing with Super Mutants resorting to cannibalism.\" Kaylee quipped, where Neriah swiftly pointed out the distinct details of such a massive bite mark as she explained, \"Exactly. And yet, these bite marks have the distinguish characteristics of homo sapien... only giant-sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what? Behemoths started turning on their smaller Super Mutant cousins?\" Greystrom sarcastically retorted, obviously not amused. But then, Kaylee then looked to her left and noticed the remains of a Super Mutant Behemoth, slouched over against the brick wall, where she then said, \"Scratch that theory, Greystrom. Look over there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, seeing the eaten remains of the Super Mutant Behemoth certainly surprised Greystrom, as he then responded, \"Okay, so... What the hell are we dealing with here, Ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...To be honest, Greystrom... I'm not exactly sure myself.\" Kaylee contemplated, slowly standing back upright in her X-01 Power Armor, where she soon reaffirmed the group's priorities as she said, \"...Anyway, we can worry about who or whatever killed these Super Mutants another time. Right now, we need to find out what happened to Theta Squad. Hopefully, if we're lucky, they might still be alive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Kaylee went through her Power Armor's heads-up display system, where she then noticed that her Pip-Boy was picking up a signal from a Brotherhood transponder, which made her grin some under her helmet as she chirped, \"And speaking of Theta, my Pip-Boy just picked up their transponder signal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! The sooner we find them, the better.\" Greystrom quipped, obviously not amused with standing out in the open in the midst of numerous decaying Super Mutant corpses. From there, Knight Greystrom and Scribe Neriah followed closely behind Kaylee Sanchez as they entered inside the Vim Pop Factory, which seemed to be where the source of the transponder signal is originating from.</span></div></div>",

Too bad those damned Super Mutants pillaged this place with Gore and dead bodies.\" Greystrom remarked, commenting on what Scribe Neriah had previously said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just before the two Brotherhood members could converse any further, Kaylee soon heard a set of voices on the other side of the interior, as she quickly hushed the Knight and Head Scribe as she whispered, \"Sshhh! You hear that? We're not alone here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super Mutants?\" Greystrom asked, brandishing his Laser Rifle, just as Kaylee then retorted, \"...I don't think so, Greystrom. One of them sounds like Paladin Gorski. Come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, despite the heft and audible clanking sounds of their Power Armor, Kaylee and Greystrom cautiously snuck their way towards the source of the two voices. But as they got closer, the two voices became much more clearer and easier to understand. \"...Please...You don't have to do this. Just let me and my squadmates go, and we won't bother you.\" One voice proclaimed, which Kaylee recognized as Paladin Ivan Gorski. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the next voice on the other hand, Kaylee didn't recognize, but she can clearly tell that it was undoubtedly female, as the second voice retorted, \"So you can tell your *growl* metal men where I am so they can kill me? I'm not going to kill you and your... \"squad\", but I can't risk letting you go so you can tell them where I am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, both Kaylee and Greystrom got close enough to the source of the two voices to gain a better view of the situation, as they both hid behind a large broken piece of a wall, large enough to hide two people in Power Armor behind. However, as she carefully leaned behind the wall to get a better look at the situation, Kaylee was in complete disbelief over what she was witnessing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she was aware that Paladin Gorski and Theta Squad were alright (albeit heavily restrained), but it was who, or rather, what that had restrained Theta Squad. What Kaylee was seeing appeared to be a massive Human-Gulper hybrid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/bigbig-on-da/art/Luna-Aces-OC-747255552\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/bigbig-on-da/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from it's appearance, the hybrid was undoubtedly female, complete with breasts each the size of a whole Mirelurk, and a big flabby belly large enough to contain a whole Deathclaw should it have swallowed it whole. It had A chubby human face adorned with freckles, a pair of grayish-blue eyes, and long damp wavy black hair that extended to just above her enormous buttocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, those are the only parts of it's body that one could consider human, the rest of the creature's body was without a doubt Gulper. It's lower legs and feet were large slimy grey Gulper feet, as parts of it's human-looking physique had blotches of grey slimy Gulper skin. Sure, it's fat-laden arms were distinctly human, but had Gulper characteristics, such as webbed membranes attached to each of it's plump digits, as well as gray slimy skin that had spread throughout most of it's arms. And to top it all off, the hybrid had a thick, fat, and somewhat long Gulper tail jutting out from just above the shelf of it's bulbous derriere. Overall, the hybrid stood at an intimidating 13 feet in height, towering over any human and most Super Mutants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The Institute?! You think my team and I are with the Institute?! Look, we're not with those bastards, my squad and I are with the Brotherhood of Steel!\" Gorski exclaimed, just as Kaylee then turned to look back at Greystrom as the Knight said, \"...Well, now I've seen way too many monster films on Holotape.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, shortly after taking another peek from behind the wall, Kaylee then noticed something... explicit, on the Human-Gulper hybrid's person: A large black tattoo branded upon the hybrid's fat right buttcheek, which was the logo of the Institute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the gears began to turn in Kaylee's head, as she realized that this Human-Gulper hybrid was most likely an escaped Institute experiment, and it wasn't even aware of the Institute's demise. Shortly after that, Kaylee then turned back toward Knight Greystrom, as he spoke toward her and whispered, \"So, how do you want to approach this, Ma'am?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylee thought through her choices on the situation at hand. Eventually, after much contemplation, Kaylee eventually decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaylee weighed her options carefully on the situation at hand. But eventually, after much contemplation, Kaylee eventually decided to talk with the female Human-Gulper hybrid. After all, this was all clearly a big misunderstanding. From there, Kaylee turned around to look back at Greystrom and whispered, \"...In all honesty, Knight Greystrom... I believe we should talk with this hybrid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What!?! Are you crazy!? She's a mutant-\" Greystrom unintentionally exclaimed, where he was soon silenced by his commanding officer, as Kaylee then explained, \"I get it, Greystrom: The Brotherhood doesn't tolerate mutants. But think about it; This hybrid is merely a victim of the Institute, and she probably isn't aware of their downfall from what I'm hearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm going out to talk with her. Just... don't do anything stupid, Greystrom.\" Kaylee retorted, as Knight Greystrom was left to ponder over his personal beliefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kaylee cautiously approached the massive hybrid, where she made her presence known as she cheerfully said, \"Must be some tasty food you're making.\" Of course, this easily caused the Human-Gulper hybrid to (despite her size and girth) swiftly turn around to face the Power Armor clad Kaylee Sanchez, now standing in a combative stance, readying for a possible fight with a new intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*snarl* *growl* Who are you!?!\" The hybrid snarled, bearing her fangs as a warning sign. In response, Kaylee calmly raised her hands slightly into the air, carefully tossing her Laser Rifle off to the side as she calmly retorted, \"Easy there, girl. Just starting up some friendly chit-chat, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wary of the newly arrived individual, the corpulent Human-Gulper hybrid was still in a defensive stance, her grayish-blue eyes still focused on Kaylee, as she then spoke up and queried, \"...Who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Sentinel Kaylee Sanchez. I am with the Brotherhood of Steel. My squad and I came here to Far Harbor to search for some of our people who went missing.\" Kaylee explained, still keeping her arms up to show that she wasn't a threat to the Human-Gulper hybrid, where she then looked at Paladin Gorski and the rest of Theta Squad as she continued, \"...And I see that they're still alive, thankfully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... with the metal men? The ones who work for the people in white?\" She asked quizzically, her guard lowered slightly, yet still cautious towards her new visitor. Of course, Kaylee figured out who the rotund hybrid was referring to, as the redhead then spoke up and replied, \"...Metal Men? Oh! You mean the Synths and the Institute? No, I'm not with them, and neither is Paladin Gorski and his squad. The Brotherhood of Steel is actually enemies with the Institute, as in we're not friends with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the hybrid preemptively cocked an eyebrow, quickly realizing that her captives were actually telling the truth regarding their allegiance, where she then looked back at the restrained Paladin Gorski and said, \"...So... You were not lying?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you we weren't with the Institute.\" Gorski retorted, just as Kaylee then spoke toward the hybrid and asked...</span></div></div>",
