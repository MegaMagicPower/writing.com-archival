            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The virus rocketed through the air, invisible to the naked eye as it fled its laboratory. Carried by the winds, it continued on for hours and hours until slowing down near a large and wide building that appeared to be quite crowded. The side of it read \"Mesa County High School\"... the virus couldn't understand how it knew that, but it just did. The hours of air travel had diluted its density by a large amount, with much fewer particles than when it left. It was now driven by its instinct to incubate inside a host to multiply. It eerily floated through some of the A/C on the west side of the school, and after a trip through there it saw a medium-sized room. There were human males and females together, with what appeared to be an older human in charge of teaching them. It took some time to examine the students, searching for a host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting near the middle of the class was Kelly Haute, a girl with long brown hair and a disinterested look on her cute little face as she watched the lecture with glazed eyes. Kelly was quite popular with boys and girls alike, possibly due to the fact that she had breasts almost the size of her head. Her huge rack and overall attractive physique meant that nearly everyone at the school knew about her. She was sitting there in a pink v-neck showing some cleavage and tight black leggings. The virus surmised that it would be able to spread quite easily with Kelly as its host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso in the classroom was Madison Grant, a nerdy girl with frizzled dirty blonde hair. She was definitely on the geeky side, wearing some awkward-looking glasses and a baggy hoodie and jeans. As the virus inspected the note-taking Madison, he noticed she had a thicker physique than Kelly, barely visible underneath her loose-fitting clothes. The virus surmised it would not have to maintain much of a social facade if its host wasn't very social to begin with. Plus, it could always spread to family instead of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the front of the class sat Ellie Slater, a cheerleader with dazzling blonde hair and a massive ass constrained by her galaxy-print leggings. She had a very toned, fit body that the virus saw as capable of restraining and overpowering additional hosts. That, in addition to the ease of being able to attract new hosts inside Ellie, gave the virus pause for thought before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last individual of note was a petite girl sat towards the back with dark blue dyed hair; Leah Hannigan. Her dark-colored outfit and black tights indicated she was part of the goth crowd. Some pins on her backpack indicated she was also a part of the theater community at this school. The virus noticed her lack of feminine assets compared to the other potential hosts here, but figured that Leah would be easy to be promiscuous in and help obtain new hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brief deliberation, a loud bell sounded. The teacher left the room, and many of the students began to pack up. The virus, faced with a sudden decision, decided on possessing...</span></div></div>",
