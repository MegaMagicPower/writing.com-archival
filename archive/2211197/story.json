            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After graduating college, an ordeal all its own, you were sitting in your bedroom one day, wondering what you ought to do with your life. You had graduated with high honors, majoring in English, but you had to admit that you got so caught up in academics, you never really stopped to think about what you\u2019d do with your degree afterwards. Two years had passed since then, and you spent most of your days at home, not yet having found the inspiration to set out on your own. (Your size also limited the number of things you could really do, but you\u2019d never admit that.) Today had been one such listless day so far, but as you sat lost in thought, the evening news suddenly caught your attention with a breaking story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...only one inch in height due to a rare congenital defect. He was reported missing one week ago by members of his family, who say they had already waited two weeks to file the report.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, could it be true? The doctors had told you only a handful of people around the world shared your condition, but you recognized the house in this news report as being only a few blocks away. To think you lived this close to another inch-tall man this whole time and had no idea! Though, from the sound of the report, you may not ever get a chance to meet him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s often away from the house for several weeks at a time due to his job as a private tutor. We thought he was off on one of his tutoring sessions, but he never came home\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter on-screen continued to interview the man\u2019s family about his disappearance, but you found yourself distracted by what had just been said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA private tutor, huh? I had never really considered it, but that could be a great way to use my degree! There are plenty of people looking to learn better English in this city. If that guy can do it, I\u2019m sure I can too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind made up, you decided to take the first steps toward becoming a tutor that very minute. You were never one to look before you leapt, and it seemed you\u2019d already forgotten what happened to the last inch-high guy to enter the field. Let's hope your recklessness doesn't lead you to a similar fate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter studying about being an independent tutor for a couple hours, you were convinced this was the opportunity you had been waiting for. Excitedly, you texted your dad to come up to your room, where the two of you chatted about the idea for a while. At first, he seemed a little hesitant about letting you leave the house for such extended periods, but after a long explanation, you eventually won his support. With him on your side, convincing your mother took little effort, and before you knew it, you were back at your laptop, ready to fire off a job posting indicating your availability. Just as you had finished it up and were hitting submit, you noticed a push notification out of the corner of your eye, indicating that Alyssa had logged on for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does your adventure take you from here?</span></div></div>",

You quickly bent over on your hands to scroll the mouse to her image, which proved to be a difficult task as always due to your short stature virtually using your whole body at some points. Before running over to jump on the click button twice. The loading symbol seemed to go on forever. You wish mom would get with the times and upgrade your internet speed. Finally, after a while, the chatbox to Alyssa presented as you watched the inbox flooded with messages.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"Hello, Nick! I got some news for you.\"</b> <i>1 hour ago</i><br>\r\n<b>\"Answer me, Damn it!\"</b> <i>30 mins ago</i><br>\r\n<b>\"Forget it!

Where the hell are you,\" Alyssa screamed. \"Why did I ever give Alyssa a key to my home!\" you pondered as her footsteps approached the room you were currently occupying. \"Ugh, There's never good Wi-fi here!\" Alyssa complains completely neglecting to see you on the couch. You got an extensive view of her giant ass as she was wearing a plaid skirt today. The panties she had on were skin tone to your exact degree as you ran for dear life, avoiding to be squished by her. \"Hey, watch where you're sitting! You almost smooshed me.\" I yelled up to her, jumping from danger for dear life, \"I know I'm small, but you can still see me even for a short...\" you stooped yourself from finishing the last delivery as the look in Alyssa's eyes turned to death stare knowing what you were about to reply. You quickly cleared your throat, \"So what's the news?\" you kindly smiled to change the room tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa smiled as she opened her laptop, presenting you with a homepage she designed for your new career path. \"Check it out!\" she announced, picking you by your shirt collar and placing you right between her massive cleavage. You blushed a little being between Alyssa's warm body. She usually very strict when it comes to you exploring her body on regular terms. You could feel a slight bit of yourself slipping deeper as you held on to stop from doing so. \"And so here's where I'll do a background check and set up availability for times your open.\" Alyssa carried on, speaking, as you pretended to hear the first half which you hadn't been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out too, you already have a few appointments,\" Alyssa said, opening the emails. \"The first girl kind of a pothead! Her names Zoey she's 21 and flunking math. The next girl is Cassandra also goes by Cassy! She's 19 and part of an all blonde frat house.\" Alyssa giggled, \"Probably all dumb! Since she was asking for you to tutor her and few dorm friends. Anyways next up is a mom asking for a tutor to teach her 16 yrold daughter Vivan to get better grades in history. If you want my opinion, the girl looks bratty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou viewed up at Alyssa, smiling for her high background checks, as she opened up the last two. \"Finally, I have a single woman, Dee 41, needing a study tutor for some college troubles. You wouldn't believe how well she looks for her age I speaking your mom's level of beauty. Last is an odd one I don't know if it's wise to take being honest. It seemed like a fake profile doing a bit of digging, but her names Jasmin didn't get an age needing help with English. But it'sup to you if you wanna take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe how many people were already interested in your busy in such a short time. It was still dangerous due to your size, but this is what you wanted. \"How about we set up an appointment with...</span></div></div>",

Hopping into a small electric car, a toy car if  you were generous but it let you travel on the hard wood quickly. You got to one of your tiny speakers and told Maya to come in. She didn't need more of an invitation and you soon heard the door opening, so you decided to get where you could talk to her. There was a string on the table for you to climb up and you did just that as Maya entered. She was always quiet but the women on your mom's side had killer bodies, even if they didn't realize it sometimes This was one such instance as you were standing on the table waving to her but as she walked in looking at the floor presumably to make sure she didn't step on you she bumped into the table knocking it just  enough to send you tumbling into one of the chairs. Not seeing you on the floor she decided to take a seat and wait for you to get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tumble hadn't been far but it did knock the wind out of you and startle you when the chair was pulled out, you rolled over only to see the giant jeans clad butt descending towards you and obliterating you without a second thought. You heard her muse to herself \"I'll just wait here for someone, I wouldn't want to impose.\" she shifted a little grinding you farther into the depressed cushion of the chair while she waited. You could feel her swap where her legs were a couple of times and adjust herself once more before she apparently got board and stood up leaving you smashed onto the chair. She turned around to push it in and start her search for you but miraculously she spotted your tiny form and you could swear she smirked a little before her face took on a shocked expression. \"Oh my goodness! Nick I'm so sorry. What a terrible way to start out our week together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou popped back into shape quick enough to ask her, \"What do you mean? Aren't you just visiting for the day?\" She shook her head and placed you down on the table before re-seating herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, your mom and dad already took off on a vacation. well work vacation in your mom's case, I'm watching you for the week if you don't get any clients.\" She smiled sweetly but oddly this is the first time that you've ever been alone with your aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... kay, did you want to do anything first?\" A smile graced her face for a moment and she folded her hands together under her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked little Nick because in celebration of our week together I want to-\"</span></div></div>",

She hadn't done anything like this since she accidentally mistook you for a string back in highschool. You knew your mom wasn't a fan of Thongs so all the pulling must be an attempt to get you even close to the size she wanted, she placed your stretched out from on her desk and began mashing you with her palm and pulling out until each side of your face with one of your eyes cartoonishly stretched out in the middle with the only sign of your hair in a little ring around the top somehow though she hadn't stretched your nose out leaving it direct center of your form, hopefully since she planned to have your face out that wouldn't be too much of a problem. You were so dizzy from the smashing you didn't even realize you were already trying to 'look on the bright side' once she was satisfied with how large she had gotten you she grabbed something from on her desk and started rubbing it in, whatever it was stung your eyes. She didn't get the lower half of your face which was still thin and hanging off the edge of your form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sorry if it stings a little honey, that's latex polisher that I usually use on my... well in either case it should keep you from shrinking on me for a few hours.\" She was right you realized, the parts she coated weren't retracting themselves at all, but before you could take stock of what that meant for you she was already pulling your 'jaw' out again. It was now that you realized that when she did that your mouth was open so the entirety of the second half was your tongue and lower jaw. She didn't need it as wide as the 'back' so after widening it out just a bit she forced the bottom most part to form a little extra on the sides just like your 'back' half. Your jaw felt like it was pried open and she started applying the polish to it, forcing you to taste the strange substance, it was like licking actual latex which was unpleasant but the sensation faded faster than you figured. You wanted to groan in pain but your face was now frozen and you felt like you had over stretched but couldn't pull back. You saw your mom look at the clock. \"shit that took longer than I thought, okay last part.\" she seemed rushed and pulled one of the back parts and dabbed a little of what looked like super glue on them. \"sorry I can't wait for a different binder to set\" she pinched you together into the panty shape... but she forgot to flip you over all your features were on the inside. \"finally, I can't stand going commando\" Shelly wiggled out of her pajama pants revealing that she truely hadn't been wearing panties and started stepping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you could have screamed as your face was rocketed towards the juicy curves but you got all the way to them before there were any problems pulling you up. Shelly grunted as she dug her thumbs under and into your eyes to wrap your face around her butt, letting go with a loud [i]*SNAP*[/i] as the impact sent her butt jiggling you heard her muttering as she collected her other cloths. \"A little tight but so comfortable\"  She said more but you didn't hear it because she bent over, subjecting you to blinding pain as you were both pulled out more and sunk a little into her plump rear, pulling you just slightly inward. If you could see yourself you were just pressing into the crack and cupping the cheeks perfectly. You sort of felt the world get darker when her loose jeans were put on and she started moving in earnest. The constant wobbling of her cheeks keeping you dizzy and the slightly pungent smell of her butt and taste of the salty sweat on her legs as she hustled around the house. Eventually she was sitting in her car which brought it's own series of sensations, the old leather seat  was cold and shocked you even as  Shelly wiggling on top of you as she started up the radio built a little heat. You wanted to shiver but then a different problem reared it's head, it had only been five minutes of driving but with the heat on and the seats being leather you had heated up drastically. When the first bead of sweat hit you and soaked into your skin you remembered that your mom had a thirty minute commute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The drive was hell, on top of the sweat mounting and dipping into you your body seemed to want to greedily drink the liquid. You could taste the salt and tell that your body was all that prevented the jeans from gaining an unseemly stain in the back but for some reason Shelly seemed perfectly comfortable. You were grateful for the blast of cold air that cooled you a little but again she bent over shattering your ability to pay attention to anything but her ass so you missed her next comment. \"oh, usually I need to wipe the seat down. Lucky day!\" she straitened back up and slapped her own butt causing you to wobble all over the place until her normal walking allowed you to take stalk of the situation again. You had moved another millimeter into the crack and with how much she sweat it was far more rank than it had been at home before she started her own personal sauna in the car. The cool air in the office made the hot skin and to you wafting air from her butt all the more prominent. You could hear her greeting co-workers and them greeting her in return until she stopped moving, you braced this time as she bent over to sit you were only unprepared for how uncomfortable the seat felt. Your mom probably wasn't going to acknowledge you until after work but this was unacceptable wasn't it! You couldn't move an inch though as her weight shifted back and forth on the uncomfortable chair, never crushing you exactly the same for more than five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a few hours into your 'assistant' job when suddenly Shelly shifted to stand up, you had been trying to concentrate on healing how painful it felt with a little success in that you no longer felt sore from the initial stretching. But now you had something else to pay attention to rather than a sweaty ass rolling over you what was going on...</span></div></div>",

To Shelly however this was just a normal part of the day she always dealt with, if she were to stay seated all day she'd be sore all the time so setting out her timer to swap between workouts she continued to lightly jog in place for the next few minutes. Of course she thought nothing of it as besides the slight issue this morning she was having an excellent day getting everything done, she hadn't even had to adjust her underwear at all. The timer beeped and she stopped jogging and flipped to her next exercise side lunges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jogging stopped and she was still for a moment before you felt her legs spread wide apart pulling you to one side and scrunching up the other, then back together and to the other side. You heard her count every time she did the second one, but a more pressing issue presented itself, this movement had pinched your nose and middle in her crack and every time she completed a 'rep' it got you a little farther in, surely she had noticed but she continued going. You had to get her attention so that she would pull you out before you were too deep. You tried making a vocalization but the only thing you felt was your tongue pressing up against the sparse hair above Shelly's pussy and realizing this you gagged and with all the time it took you were now half way to having your nose touch her back hole. Thankfully your fear that she would let you get dragged that far was unfounded as soon you felt her hand pinching either side of you through the pants and dragging you back into place over her cheeks. Unfortunately the front of you also got dragged and pressed a little tighter in front as your felt it take on the shape of her mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wordlessly moved on to her next exercise as your resolved to give her a talking to after this about respecting your boundaries, but as she set up you realized that this would be the worst one yet, she felt roughly in the sitting position but nothing was under you and your fear was confirmed as she dipped down even more you felt your body strain and stretch and finally the light sweat she had been working up hit your tongue with that first dip. Then once more and you mentally howled at her to stop, it was even worse than the initial smashing with her ass pulling you out even farther for a few seconds only to let you contract and do it again. She counted twenty agonizing reps before finally plopping back into her chair and scooting back up to the desk. You could tell she was doing some arm workouts or something but you were just glad for the mercy of merely being squished to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only pray that the day would go quickly...</span></div></div>",

At your size, you frequently got into accidents as larger folks trampled or sat on you, oblivious to your presence. Fortunately for you, this same condition also grants you near immortality. Whenever you\u2019re crushed, your body squishes like putty, and as long as you\u2019re left undisturbed for long enough, you can pop right back into shape shortly afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA semi-recent college graduate, you decide you\u2019re tired of sitting at home after being inspired to become a private tutor. What you don\u2019t know, however, is how dangerous this line of work will end up being for you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">CHARACTERS:</font></b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly Donahue - Your mother. She\u2019s in her early 40s, and clearly inherited a lot of her features from your grandmother\u2019s side of the family, originally from Korea. She\u2019s deeply dedicated to her job at an office downtown, and often comes home late, having put in a few hours too many. This is not to say, however, that she doesn't love you and care for you deeply, though sometimes getting her to pay attention to you can be quite a struggle. In terms of physique, she\u2019s a bit on the curvy side, though most people have no idea as she can always be found wearing baggy sweaters and roomy jeans. (Her office doesn\u2019t take dress code all that seriously.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan Donahue - Your father. He\u2019s just about the same age as your mom, though you can never seem to remember exactly how old either of them are. Where your mother takes after her Korean heritage, he\u2019s an Irishman through and through. He also doesn\u2019t seem to share her workaholism at all, and only contributes to the family income through what he manages to win off of sports betting. However, this leaves him effectively a stay-at-home dad, and as you\u2019ve grown up over the years, the two of you have spent more than enough time together. You genuinely feel like you could trust him with anything. He\u2019s a relatively thin man, but he exercises regularly, so most of the muscle he does have is pretty toned. You wish you could have inherited that from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa Blackwell - You and Alyssa have been best friends since high school, though you\u2019ve only met her in person a few times. Having originally met through an online game, you mostly communicate through instant messaging, though you later learned she only lives about an hour away. The two of you are very close, and talk to each other nearly every day. You\u2019ve definitely thought about asking her out once or twice, but she never seemed all that interested, so you\u2019ve never wanted to bring it up. You can remember from when you met her that she\u2019s relatively short for someone her age at 4\u201910 (147 cm), and she has curly black hair. Despite her height, she\u2019s got bigger curves than your mother, though you know she\u2019d kill you if she heard you using the word \u201cshortstack\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya Seong - Maya is your mother Shelly\u2019s younger sister, making her your aunt. She\u2019s 33 or 34, you think, and last you heard from her, she lives by herself on the outskirts of town. You know from overhearing conversations with your mom that she\u2019s a published author, but for some reason she always tries to change the subject whenever anyone asks her what books she\u2019s written. Every once in a while she\u2019ll come to visit, and when she does, she gets along with the family perfectly fine, though she mostly keeps to herself. You\u2019ve sometimes wondered what she\u2019s hiding under that quiet exterior\u2026 Physically she resembles your mother, though a bit taller and with a leaner frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">RULES:</font></b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose familiar with the original interactive will note that I\u2019m going to be less specific with what you can and cannot contribute. The chapters I plan on adding to the story will likely take a heavy focus on female characters, unaware interactions, and toilet-related content, and I\u2019d love to see that sort of thing from other contributors too, but you can write about whatever you want. Notably, male interaction is totally allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I will not allow choice chapters less than a paragraph long unless they really do seem necessary. If you want to bump this story in an attempt to get more people to add to it, I respectfully ask that you give us a little flavor to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, please do your best to respect the canon that comes before whatever you\u2019re writing. I realize not everyone has the time to read a billion chapters, so minor continuity slip-ups are fine, but try to remember generally how the characters act, and also please remember that Nick is squishy and cannot be easily killed (though if you eventually want to end the story by killing him, I\u2019ll allow it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy!</u></td>",
