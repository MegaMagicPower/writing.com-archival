The monster no harder or easier than any other they have faced before. As the battle rages on the monster shoots off a giant glob, knocking one of the girls to the ground and out of the fight. The remaining two, in a rage, kick it up a notch and manage to force the monster into a retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who got hit by the glob was...</span></div></div>",

He worked all night long until there were no other tests that could be run at the time. That morning he took Blossom aside to explain to her what the current situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blossom I'm sorry to have to say this but I can't find out just what kind of baby is inside you until it starts growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-y-you m-m-mean that ..\" Blossom stuttered with tears in her eyes ,so upset by the news that she had a hard time keeping her thoughts straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we'll just have to wait dear,\" The Professor stated regretfully as he consoled his now sobbing daughter. Taking note of just how upset by the news Blossom was he let her stay home from class that day. Making sure that Bubbles and Buttercup were headed off to school he got to work preparing his lab for the checkups Blossom would need starting in a few months.</span></div></div>",

Everyday she looked in the mirror and was relieved when she didn't see any growth and horrified when her imagination ran wild with how she would look when she was due. Her sisters were concerned for her as they knew that it could have happened to them. Occasionally they wished that they were going through the same thing Blossom was so she didn't feel as unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up on the examining table the Professor had set up Blossom hitched her dress up so that her the very slight curve of her belly was exposed.After four months the baby(ies) in Blossom's uterus was(were) large enough to be seen with the ultrasound the Professor had ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really cold ,\" Blossom said shivering from the feel of the gel the professor spread on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey, you just need to put up with it for a few minutes so the machine here can see whats inside your belly ,okay.\" Explained the nervous parent as he was unsure of what would show up on the screen and afraid of having to deliver any more bad news concerning this pregnancy.

The professor nodded, \"It appears so.\" The red-headed mother-to-be looked down at her swelling belly in wide wonder. She was amazed that not only would she soon be mothering one child, but three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBubbles and Buttercup hovered nearby, both exchanging eager glances. Bubbles squealed, \"Oooh! Three new babies for me to play with! I'm gonna be the best auntie ever!\" Giggled the blonde puff. Buttercup couldn't but but grin, \"This is so cool! Finally I can have someone to play ball and stuff with! Maybe they'll even want to learn boxing with me!\" She crossed her arms in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlossom glanced over at the professor and noticed that tears were silently cascading down his cheeks. The pink puff rubbed her well-rounded stomach gently, \"Professor? Are you...crying?\" The professor sniffled and looked at his daughter, wiping the rivulets of snot off of his nose. He wrapped his arms around Blossom, careful not to squish her belly, saying softly, \"I'm going to be a grandfather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlossom smiled. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
