            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The peaceful evening on the 7th floor of a luxury Miami condominium was suddenly shattered by the sounds of screams coming from one of the units.  A few concerned neighbors went to investigate but stopped when they realized where it was coming from.  Dominic Harrison and his fianc\u00e9, Rebecca Northam, had been fighting a lot lately.  This was just another in a long line of fights for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic was standing in the kitchen, trying to make some pasta, when Rebecca feverishly entered the room with a suitcase.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do this without asking me about it first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was leaving for a conference in New York; Dominic thought now would\u2019ve been a proper time to tell her that his parents were coming to dinner next week.  \u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal is, they\u2019re my parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning the suitcase against the wall, trying her best to remain calm, Rebecca turned to Dominic and said, \u201cYour parents hate me, Dom; every time they see me, they treat me like I\u2019m some spoiled rich girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca\u2019s family was one of the wealthier families in south Florida, due in large part to their company, Northam Technologies.  Rebecca and her sister Grace had been groomed from a young age for jobs in the company after college; Rebecca was in Public Relations, while Grace was in her sophomore year of college.  Dominic's parents knew of this, but felt that it was nothing short of nepotism; whereas Dominic had worked his way up from the bottom to become a senior analyst in the IT department.  \u201cInviting them to dinner is the best way to change their minds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease; they\u2019ll just find some other reason to hate me.\u201d Looking at the clock, Rebecca said, \u201cLook, I-I\u2019ve got to go; promise me you won\u2019t make any more unilateral decisions without talking to me first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise.\u201d Walking over to kiss her, Dominic said, \u201cHave fun at the conference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was driving down I-95 towards the airport when her phone started ringing.  A quick glance at the dash display showed Dad.  Groaning, she begrudgingly answered the call, \u201cHi Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi sweetie, just calling to check in before your flight.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cIs everything alright, you don\u2019t sound happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter losing their mother at an early age, Harold had made certain that he was always there for his daughters.  This, in time, led him to know exactly when something was bothering them.  \u201cI\u2019m fine, Dad; it\u2019s just...Dominic and I were arguing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca could hear her father\u2019s sigh over the phone; much like Dominic\u2019s parents didn\u2019t like her, Harold didn\u2019t care for Dominic.  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he do this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe invited his parents for dinner next week without asking me about it first.\u201d Sighing, Rebecca said, \u201cHe said it would help them to change their opinion about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold was fully aware of the Harrison\u2019s opinion of his daughter.  She expected him to agree with her, but instead he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but Dominic is right; a dinner might be just the thing to make them come around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny coming from you; you telling me to do the one thing you\u2019ve refused to do for two years.\u201d Pausing, Rebecca said, \u201cI\u2019ll take that under advisement if you\u2019re willing to do the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold realized he\u2019d just backed himself into a corner; what kind of parent would he be if he told his kids to do something he <br>\r\nwasn\u2019t willing to.  Looking at the window of his home office, he said, \u201cFine, why don\u2019t we make plans for the 3 of us to have dinner in a few weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat works with me; although I\u2019m sure Dominic will need some convincing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come around.  But, \u201cpausing, Harold said, \u201cAs for the other thing, if you want I can stop by tomorrow and have a talk with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate the offer, Dad; but I doubt anything you say will get through.\u201d Taking the ramp towards the airport, Rebecca said, \u201cI\u2019m almost to the airport, I should probably hang up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy the conference, sweetie; and don\u2019t worry about Dominic.\u201d Pausing, Harold said, \u201cI\u2019ll have a talk with him tomorrow.\u201d</span></div></div>",
