            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The peaceful evening on the 7th floor of a luxury Miami condominium was suddenly shattered by the sounds of screams coming from one of the units.  A few concerned neighbors went to investigate but stopped when they realized where it was coming from.  Dominic Harrison and his fianc\u00e9, Rebecca Northam, had been fighting a lot lately.  This was just another in a long line of fights for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic was standing in the kitchen, trying to make some pasta, when Rebecca feverishly entered the room with a suitcase.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do this without asking me about it first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was leaving for a conference in New York; Dominic thought now would\u2019ve been a proper time to tell her that his parents were coming to dinner next week.  \u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal is, they\u2019re my parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning the suitcase against the wall, trying her best to remain calm, Rebecca turned to Dominic and said, \u201cYour parents hate me, Dom; every time they see me, they treat me like I\u2019m some spoiled rich girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca\u2019s family was one of the wealthier families in south Florida, due in large part to their company, Northam Technologies.  Rebecca and her sister Grace had been groomed from a young age for jobs in the company after college; Rebecca was in Public Relations, while Grace was in her sophomore year of college.  Dominic's parents knew of this, but felt that it was nothing short of nepotism; whereas Dominic had worked his way up from the bottom to become a senior analyst in the IT department.  \u201cInviting them to dinner is the best way to change their minds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease; they\u2019ll just find some other reason to hate me.\u201d Looking at the clock, Rebecca said, \u201cLook, I-I\u2019ve got to go; promise me you won\u2019t make any more unilateral decisions without talking to me first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise.\u201d Walking over to kiss her, Dominic said, \u201cHave fun at the conference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was driving down I-95 towards the airport when her phone started ringing.  A quick glance at the dash display showed Dad.  Groaning, she begrudgingly answered the call, \u201cHi Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi sweetie, just calling to check in before your flight.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cIs everything alright, you don\u2019t sound happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter losing their mother at an early age, Harold had made certain that he was always there for his daughters.  This, in time, led him to know exactly when something was bothering them.  \u201cI\u2019m fine, Dad; it\u2019s just...Dominic and I were arguing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca could hear her father\u2019s sigh over the phone; much like Dominic\u2019s parents didn\u2019t like her, Harold didn\u2019t care for Dominic.  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he do this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe invited his parents for dinner next week without asking me about it first.\u201d Sighing, Rebecca said, \u201cHe said it would help them to change their opinion about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold was fully aware of the Harrison\u2019s opinion of his daughter.  She expected him to agree with her, but instead he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but Dominic is right; a dinner might be just the thing to make them come around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny coming from you; you telling me to do the one thing you\u2019ve refused to do for two years.\u201d Pausing, Rebecca said, \u201cI\u2019ll take that under advisement if you\u2019re willing to do the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold realized he\u2019d just backed himself into a corner; what kind of parent would tell his kids to do something, and then refuse to do it himself.  Looking at the window of his home office, he said, \u201cFine, why don\u2019t we make plans for the 3 of us to have dinner in a few weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat works with me; although I\u2019m sure Dominic will need some convincing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come around.  But, \u201cpausing, Harold said, \u201cAs for the other thing, if you want I can stop by tomorrow and have a talk with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate the offer, Dad; but I doubt anything you say will get through.\u201d Taking the ramp towards the airport, Rebecca said, \u201cI\u2019m almost to the airport, I should probably hang up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy the conference, sweetie; and don\u2019t worry about Dominic.\u201d Pausing, Harold said, \u201cI\u2019ll have a talk with him tomorrow.\u201d</span></div></div>",

While waiting for the water to boil so he could make some spaghetti, Dominic took the elevator down to the lobby to retrieve the mail.  He found himself thinking about his argument with Rebecca during the elevator ride down; wondering if perhaps she was right, and he should\u2019ve discussed dinner with his parents first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the elevator into the lobby, he walked towards the wall of mailboxes just as a trio of teenage girls walking down the stairs from the second floor.  They were wearing the clingy, form fitting clothes typical of today\u2019s teenage girls; they were all laughing at something on one girl\u2019s phone as they walked by.  That brought Dominic back to his high school days, wondering if they were laughing at him.  <i>Don't be silly, Dominic,</i> he told himself, <i>High School was a long time ago.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic went back upstairs to the apartment and, after checking to see if the water was boiling, he sat down to go through the mail.  He was putting Rebecca\u2019s aside so she could look at it when she got back; although the cover of one of her women\u2019s magazines caught his attention.  Looking closer, he saw it was a woman he remembered fantasizing about when he was in high school. <i>For someone whose pushing 40, she still looks great.\u201d</i> looking at the magazine some more, he thought, <i>I wonder what her secret is?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this rememcising about High School prompted Dominic to look back at his old yearbooks.  Unlike most of his classmates, his was almost completely devoid of signatures.  <i>Chalk it up to a youth spent alone.</i> Life hadn\u2019t changed much in the 8 years since High School; then, as now, he still wasn\u2019t one of the cool people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What I wouldn't give for the chance to turn my life around,</i> he thought. <i>Imagine Rebecca's reaction to coming home and finding me a changed person.</i></span></div></div>",

After putting his briefcase in his office, Harold made his way down to the labs on the 5th floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNortham Technologies had subsidiaries in almost every industry, so it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for Harold to find something to carry out his plan.  His plan was comparatively simple; Dominic was stubborn enough to where Harold knew he wouldn\u2019t listen to him, so Harold planned to forcibly change Dominic\u2019s attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into one of the labs, he was pleasantly surprised to see a lab technician sitting at a nearby desk at such an early hour.  Going up to him, Harold said, \u201cExcuse me, young man; can you tell me of any current projects involving behavior modification?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the technician, a young man perhaps a few years behind Dominic, had any concerns as to what was going on, he didn\u2019t voice them.  \u201cOf course, sir; we\u2019re not really working on anything like that at the moment.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cThe closest thing I can think is something we\u2019re calling XP-3; it\u2019s something we\u2019re working on to improve upon a person\u2019s less desirable personality traits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold was surprised; he had no idea something to that effect was possible outside of hypnosis.  \u201cHow does this XP-3 work, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the information on hand right now.\u201d Getting up, the technician said, \u201cIf you want, I can gather some information and deliver it to your office?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why don\u2019t you do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have the information on your desk in a few hours, sir; in the meantime, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to use the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\nHarold waited until after he heard the bathroom door close; once he was sure there was no one around, he walked over to a freezer and opened it.  It didn\u2019t take long for him to find a vial labeled XP-3.  With a grin on his face, he pocketed the file and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab technician returned a few minutes later to find that Harold had left; he was about to get back to work when another technician entered the room.  \u201cHey Tommy, the results from the latest XP-3 trials came back.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI think we\u2019ve narrowed down why of the mice experienced such drastic shifts in personality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab had run a test on XP-3 a few days earlier; during which time several of the test mice started acting counter to the way they normally would.  A normally docile and submissive male became aggressive and dominant; a female became sexually aggressive towards a younger male.  Looking at his associate, the lab tech said, \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe mice experiencing the personality shifts had, for some unknown reason, large amounts of caffeine in their systems.\u201d Walking past her coworker, the tech said, \u201cI guess for now, we make sure not to mix XP-3 with caffeine.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dominic arrived at work shortly before 7:30 that morning; walking into the elevator lobby as he left a voicemail for Rebecca asking her to give him a call.  He figured the chances of her calling back were slim, but he didn\u2019t see the harm in trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked through the doorway of the IT Department, he saw his coworker Marci Collins sitting at her desk.  Dominic\u2019s close relationship with Marci was a frequent cause of disagreement between him and Rebecca as she didn\u2019t like how close the two of them were.  Every time she brought that up, Dominic had to remind her that Marci was a lesbian and had a wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat at the desk across from hers, Dominic said, \u201cHey Marci, how was your weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know; pretty much the same as always.\u201d Placing a hand on her baby bump, Marci said, \u201cKelly and I are still trying to choose a name for our unborn son; but we can\u2019t seem to agree on anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tell you, I\u2019d gladly argue about something like that instead of what happened last night.\u201d Sighing, seeing the concerned look on Marci\u2019s face, Dominic said, \u201cI told Rebecca that my parents were taking us to dinner next week; and she didn\u2019t like that I agreed to it with consulting her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can see where she\u2019s coming from; if you guys are going to be married, you both have to stop making unilateral decisions without the other.  But,\u201d reaching for some paper on her desk, Marci said, \u201cThe marriage will be a lot smoother if your parents get along with your fianc\u00e9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Harold entered the room at that moment.  Walking towards them, he said, \u201cMs. Collins, can I have a moment alone with Dominic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Mr. Northam.\u201d Quickly glancing at her computer, Marci said, \u201cBut don\u2019t take too long; we just got a service request in a lab on the 6th floor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Marci was out of the room, Dominic turned to look at Harold and said, \u201cWhat can I do for you, Harold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease call me Mr. Northam; you\u2019re not married to my daughter yet, so you haven\u2019t earned that right.\u201d Sighing, Harold said, <br>\r\n\u201cRebecca called me last night; told me about your little fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat; let me guess, you\u2019re going to yell at me too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not exactly; as strange as it sounds, I actually found myself on your side.\u201d Pausing, Harold said, \u201cIf she\u2019s going to be a member of your family, Rebecca will need to get to know your parents better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, but she wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d Taking a breath, Dominic said, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re not here just to say that, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re correct, it\u2019s not.\u201d Sitting on Dominic\u2019s desk, Harold said, \u201cAs much as Rebecca needs to, you need to make some changes as well.  You need to take Rebecca\u2019s feelings into account before making decisions like agreeing to dinner with your folks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow exactly am I going to do that, sir?  I love Rebecca very much, but she can be pretty stubborn at times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI raised her and her sister by myself, I know how stubborn she can be.\u201d Sighing, Harold said, \u201cJust try to be more open to her feelings, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d  Getting up, Dominic said, \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I need to get my things and head to the 6th floor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold waited until Dominic and Marci were out of sight; reaching into his pocket, he pulled out the small vial that held the XP-3. <br>\r\nOpening the top, he poured the contents into Dominic\u2019s coffee mug. Once the vial was empty, he pocketed it once more and got up to leave as Dominic reentered the room pushing a cart in front of him.  After grabbing his laptop and coffee, Dominic left the room; unaware of what just happened.</span></div></div>",

The shower had already started, so Marci wasn\u2019t able to see him through the mist and steam.  With no other options, he hit the panic button.

The two were brought upstairs to a private room; Marci was about to follow when the doctor stopped her.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss; but you can\u2019t come in here right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way Marci was going to leave Dominic alone right now; she was about to say that when Dominic beat her to the punch.  \u201cPlease, doctor, I\u2019d feel a lot better if she were in here with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear the doctor didn\u2019t agree with it, but she realized she was outnumbered, \u201cFine, you can stay.\u201d Sighing as she stepped aside, the doctor said, \u201cJust stand in the corner and stay out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was very professional as she examined Dominic; she didn\u2019t let her utter disbelief of the situation take over.  She had Dominic explain everything that happened, with Marci filling it when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking some blood for testing, the doctor walked over to the counter and put on a new pair of gloves.  She then returned to the exam table where Dominic was lying in an inclined position.  \u201cLet me apologize in advance, Mr. Harrison, for what I\u2019m about to do.\u201d  Moving a stool to the foot of the bed, the doctor said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be a good doctor if I wasn\u2019t thorough, which, in this situation, means giving you a pelvic exam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for the doctor\u2019s words to hit home; but once they did, Dominic\u2019s eyes went wide.  \u201cHell no!\u201d Jumping to the floor, Dominic ran behind the exam table, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you put anything up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExasperated, the doctor turned to Marci and said, \u201cPerhaps you can talk some sense into him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarci silently nodded before making her way behind the table.  \u201cDom, listen to me; the doctor has to make sure that you\u2019re healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well she can do that without sticking her fingers in my vagina.\u201d Wincing, Dominic said, \u201cGod, I can\u2019t believe I just said <i>my</i> vagina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are limits to what I can learn with a physical examination, Mr. Harrison.\u201d Stepping forward, cautiously, the doctor said, <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the body of 15-year-old girl; I need to make sure that certain parts of your anatomy are healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming clear to Dominic that he wasn\u2019t getting out of this; and, in the back of his mind, he knew the doctor was right.  If, god forbid, he was stuck like this he\u2019d want to make sure he was healthy.  \u201cOkay fine.\u201d Relenting, Dominic climbed back on the exam table, \u201cJust make it quick, alright?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Once the doctor had finished the exam both her and Marci were politely, but firmly, asked to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting in the waiting room for a little while, Marci stood up and decided to check on Dominic.  Walking down the hall, she knocked on the door and waited for a response, which she got in the form of, \u201cGo away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore that, Marci opened the door a crack and poked her inside to find Dominic sitting on the bed in the fetal position.  <i>Poor guy,</i> she thought, <i>this must be incredibly awkward for him.</i>  Walking up to the bed, Marci said, \u201cHey Dom, how are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing just great, Marci.\u201d With an exasperated sigh, Dominic said, \u201cFirst I have a massive argument with my fianc\u00e9; then I, somehow, get turned into a 15-year-old girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here for you, okay?\u201d Taking a seat next to Dominic, Marci said, \u201cI\u2019ll try to help you get through this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry; but how exactly are you going to do that?\u201d looking at Marci, giving her one of those \u2018are you serious, right now\u2019 facial expressions, Dominic said, \u201cUnless I missed something over the last 3 years, when did your gender suddenly change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, he\u2019s got me there.</i> Placing a sympathetic arm on Dominic\u2019s shoulder, Marci said, \u201cI mean; I know what it\u2019s like to be a 15-year-old girl, so I can help you in that regard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess, with Rebecca not here, you\u2019re the best option I have.\u201d Resting his head on Marci\u2019s shoulder, Dominic said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the first thing on the list?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce the doctors say you can leave, I was thinking we\u2019d take you to the mall and buy some clothes.\u201d Gesturing to the nearby bag holding Dominic\u2019s clothes, she said, \u201cNo offense; but that\u2019s not an outfit for a 15-year-old girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get some new clothes; especially since I have no clue if this is permanent.\u201d Looking up at Marci, Dominic said, \u201cBesides; you can help me pick out clothes to draw attention from both guys <i>and</i> girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarci thought that was an uncharacteristic comment for Dominic to make; but before she could speak up about it, the door opened at Harold walked into the room.</span></div></div>",

The girl bared a passing resemblance to Dominic; she could\u2019ve passed for a younger sister.  Her brown hair was a few shades darker than Dominic\u2019s, while also going just passed her shoulders.  Harold also noticed she was far more developed then his daughters and their friends had been at that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he was responsible for Dominic\u2019s current situation.  After getting over his initial shock, he cautiously approached the bed and said, \u201cHow are you feeling, Dominic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m just peachy, boss.\u201d With an exasperated sigh, Dominic said, \u201cI just figured I\u2019d stop by the hospital for no reason at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile both Marci and Harold were taken aback by Dominic\u2019s response, Harold himself was particularly shocked.  It was true the two of them didn\u2019t have the best relationship, but Dominic never spoke to him that way before.  Harold couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he was acting like an insolent teenager.  He had experience in that regard; having raised two teenage girls as a single father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was steeped in silence as no one knew what to say next.  Thankfully the doctor chose that moment to walk in, breaking the tension in the room.  Spotting Harold as she closed the door, the doctor said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Harold Northam; as implausible it may sound, this young lady is my employee.\u201d Focusing on the doctor, Harold said, \u201cWhat exactly can you tell us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much, I\u2019m afraid; nothing like this has ever happened before.\u201d Looking at her clipboard, the doctor continued, \u201cFor all intents and purposes Mr. Harrison is now a normal, healthy, 15-year-old girl.  It honestly wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least if he started menstruating soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Harold and Marci were genuinely shocked by that statement, Dominic looked as though he could care less.  He just lay in bed, his head resting against the pillow, as he stared blankly at the wall in front of him.  \u201cExcuse me, Doctor; but how is that possible?\u201d with a gesture towards Dominic, Marci said, \u201cThis morning Dom was a grown man, now you\u2019re telling us he\u2019s possibly days away from having a period?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as confused as you are, Ms. Collins; like I said, nothing like this has happened before.\u201d Sighing, the doctor said, \u201cThere\u2019s no denying the fact that your friend is now biologically female in every way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Marci went to comfort an emotionless Dominic, Harold pulled the doctor aside and said, \u201cIs there anything you can tell us about what may have caused this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t know for certain, but the blood tests showed an unknown chemical in his bloodstream; that could be responsible for what we\u2019re seeing here.\u201d Turning back to Dominic, the doctor said,  \u201cMr. Harrison, did you eat or drink anything unusual this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really; unless you count a Dunkin Donuts coffee that had a weird taste to it.\u201d Looking up at the doctor, Dominic said, \u201cI highly doubt a $4 cup of coffee is responsible for making me female.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Harold turned pale, the doctor said, \u201cI\u2019m inclined to agree with you; but I can\u2019t rule anything out right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happens to me in the meantime?\u201d with a sigh, Dominic said, \u201cForgive me, but I\u2019m not a big fan of hospitals; so, if it\u2019s alright with you, I\u2019d like to go home now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no reason to keep you here, Mr. Harrison; whatever was responsible for this isn\u2019t contagious, otherwise we all probably would\u2019ve been affected by now.\u201d With a smile, the doctor said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep you informed of anything that I find.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic waited until the doctor left before jumping out of bed and retrieved his clothes; which were now at least 4 sizes too big.  As he turned to head off to the bathroom, Harold said, \u201cTry to keep a positive attitude about this, Dominic; for all you know, this could be temporary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I shared your optimism, Mr. Northam; but I\u2019m a 15 year old girl now.\u201d Reaching out to open the bathroom door, Dominic said, \u201cLast time I checked, the only cure for that was turning 16.\"</span></div></div>",

The two of them passed the time exchanging idle chit-chat, but nothing too serious.  Eventually the waiting proved too much for Harold, so he stood up and started towards the closed door.  \u201cI\u2019m going to check on Dominic; see what\u2019s taking him so long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Marci got between Harold and the door faster than he\u2019d ever seen a pregnant woman move.  \u201cNo sir, you\u2019re not going in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven considering the situation they found themselves in, Harold didn\u2019t like it when an employee spoke to him like that.  Taking a step back, he looked at Marci and said, \u201cAnd why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to give Dominic as much time as he needs; no one\u2019s ever experienced anything close to this before, so he\u2019s bound to be a little...curious.  Beside,\u201d her face turning serious, Marci continued, \u201cDo you really want to explain to hospital security, and possibly the police, why you were alone in a room with a naked 15 year old girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Harold\u2019s face turned to sheer dread as he realized what Marci was saying.  Harold had mistakenly walked in on Grace and Rebecca when they were growing up; as angry as they were, he couldn\u2019t imagine how angry Dominic would\u2019ve been.  \u201cY-You\u2019re right; I-I don\u2019t want that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t much longer before the sound of footsteps and a turning door handle drew their attention back towards the door.  They watched as an apprehensive-looking teenage girl stepped out into the hallway.  Both Marci and Harold had to stifle a chuckle at the sight before them, as Dominic\u2019s clothes were much too big for a teenage girl.  Scratching his scalp, Dominic looked at them and said, \u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold and Marci exchanged looks, neither of them knew how to respond.  After a moment, Harold finally said, \u201cYou look...nice, Dominic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them was sure how to respond; Harold finally said, \u201cYou look...nice, Dominic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know these clothes don\u2019t exactly fit me right now; but it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got a lot of options here.\u201d Focusing on them, with a wry smile, Dominic said, \u201cAll things considered, I think I make a good looking 15-year-old girl.  Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she and Harold silently nodded in agreement, Marci was growing concerned by Dominic\u2019s new nonchalant attitude.  She\u2019d be freaking out if this happened to her; but here he was, acting like it was nothing.  \u201cHey Dom, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re healthy and all that; but you\u2019re surprisingly calm about all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of them started walking towards the elevator, Dominic said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s only temporary; I\u2019ll probably start freaking out once the shock wears off.\u201d Looking at Marci as they walked, he said, \u201cNow, if I remember correctly, you mentioned something about shopping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all the excitement, Marci had completely forgotten that she\u2019d said that.  \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want to do, then I\u2019m more than willing to take you.\u201d As she pushed the elevator button, Marci continued, \u201cI just hope you know you\u2019re ready for this; shopping for girls is way different than shopping for boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the elevator ride down, Harold said, \"I have to return to the office, but I'll drop you two off at the mall on the way.\" looking at Marci, he said, \"I'll make sure to reimburse you for whatever you end up buying.\"</span></div></div>",

It was clear the subject was making Dominic uncomfortable, so Marci eventually said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Dom; I won\u2019t force you to wear anything you\u2019d be uncomfortable in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Without turning away from the window, Dominic said, \u201cI just want the boys to turn their heads, not try and force themselves on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took everything for Harold not to slam on the breaks in the middle of the highway as he spun around to look at Marci.  \u201cWhat did he just say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as shocked as Harold, Marci turned her attention to Dominic; placing a hand on his shoulder as she said, \u201cDom, sweetie, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from the window, Dominic was silent for a moment.  After an instant, he finally said, \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI asked if you were alright.\u201d Growing more concerned, Marci said, \u201cYou mentioned something about turning boy\u2019s heads at the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic looked at Marci dumbfounded, \u201cNo I didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes you did.\u201d With a nervous chuckle, Marci said, \u201cYou said you wanted to turn heads, not have them force themselves on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, does that sound like something I\u2019d say?\u201d looking nervous, Dominic said, \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I like boys...I mean girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold quickly swerved into the breakdown lane and, after turning the car off, he looked in the back seat.  \u201cSomething is clearly wrong with you, Dominic; perhaps we should take you back to the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they weren\u2019t concerned about Dominic\u2019s mental state, that all changed when he said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine!\u201d calming down ever so slightly, Dominic continued, \u201cNow let\u2019s just get me into some decent clothes before people start thinking I\u2019m weird or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold could\u2019ve easily driven back to the hospital and Dominic, being technically a minor at this point, wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop him.  Turning towards the front again, Harold looked out the windshield at he decided his next move.  After a moment of silence, he turned the car back on and drove back onto the highway.  The exit for the mall was coming up which; which, if he turned left instead of right, would also return them to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving off the highway, Harold slowed down ever so slightly as he decided his next move.

He\u2019d been unable to, for whatever reason, voice his concerns outside; but, like Marci, he too was concerned about his sudden personality change.  He always hated it when people, especially teenagers, used the word \u2018like\u2019 in sentences where it wasn\u2019t needed; yet he\u2019d used it several times in a brief period.  Maybe Marci\u2019s right: what if my appearance wasn\u2019t the only thing changed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic shook those thoughts from his head; focusing instead on the problem at hand.  Getting back to his feet, he stared at his reflection in the mirror: the long brown hair, the large breasts, the flat crotch.  \u201cGod,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m looking at totally different person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe that\u2019s because you are,</i> a voice in his seemed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head only served to get him a face full of hair.  <i>I\u2019ve really got do to something about this hair.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A new style might be nice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that voice again; it was familiar, but Dominic couldn\u2019t quite place it.  Then it hit him \u2013 it was the same voice that\u2019d been coming out of his mouth since he\u2019d changed.  Turning to look at the mirror, hoping there was no one nearby to hear him talking with himself, Dominic said, \u201cYou\u2019re not me, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I think you mean that you\u2019re not me; or did you really think this was your body?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic couldn\u2019t shake the idea that he was going insane; so, to rid his mind of these thoughts, he tried in vain to think of something else.  Unfortunately for him, seeing his now female body before him only served to make him think back to that pelvic exam.  The unnatural feeling of that device inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts were soon followed by a self-examination, and the alien feelings that it stirred up.  <i>Please, do you really think that counts as a self-examination?</i>This was then followed by his little self-examination, and the feelings it stirred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic had to tear himself away from the voice in his head; forcing himself back into the present, he stared at the bra in his hands.  He may not have been popular with the ladies, but he still knew more about taking bras off than he did about putting them on.  <i>Don\u2019t worry about a thing, Dom.</i> as Dominic\u2019s hands started moving on their own, the voice said, <i>I\u2019ve got this covered.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his hands moving beyond his control, Dominic thought it was as if they belonged to a different person.  {i{They do, Dom; this body\u2019s mine now.  Why don\u2019t you, like, take a vacay or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, stop!\u201d staring at his reflection in the mirror, Dominic continued, \u201cThis is my mind! This is my body!  This is my life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, I thought computer nerds were supposed to be smart.  Let\u2019s get one thing straight; you\u2019re, like, under new management.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic could feel himself fading, losing what little control he had left.  Going into panic mode, he yelled out, \u201cMarci!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice inside his head took full control at that point, pushing what was left of Dominic way to the back.  She was looking at her reflection, a smile on her face, when the curtain flung open to show Marci standing there with a worried look on her face.  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, I heard yelling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, nothing; just taking rightful control of my body.</i>  \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, I just needed your opinion.\u201d Placing her hands on her waist, she said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once she heard a customer had been injured in her store, Amber\u2019s boss called for security.  Marci knew it was only a precaution but wished that she had asked first.  Thankfully, Dominic was already fully dressed by the time they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they both gave a statement to security, Marci and Dominic went up to the register to pay for the half dozen bras that Amber had given them.  It was while they were standing there that Emma started feeling a little uncomfortable; there was an older man, perhaps a few years older than Harold, standing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma just knew that he was looking down her shirt \u2013 <i>God, I wanted a cute boy to notice me; not some pervy old guy.</i>  Marci turned towards Emma to ask her something, only to see the look on the man\u2019s face and where he was staring.  \u201cExcuse me!\u201d stepping around Emma to block his view, Marci said, \u201cI\u2019d really appreciate it if you stopped looking at my 15-year-old cousin like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, who looked to be in his mid-50s, was dumbstruck as he looked at Marci.  \u201cPardon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me; stop looking at my 15-year-old cousin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was understandably anxious; she\u2019d only been in control for 15 minutes and she was already the target of some pervert old enough to be her grandfather.  She was, however, grateful that Marci was defending her.  <i>All this time I thought she wouldn\u2019t say boo to a goose; guess she\u2019s got an edge after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Marci was still going off on the old man when a woman came running up from a nearby section with a girl not much older than Emma.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d looking Marci over, the woman said, \u201cWhy are you yelling at my husband?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour husband was looking down my cousin\u2019s shirt.\u201d Placing an arm around Emma, Marci said, \u201cShe\u2019s only 15 years old; she doesn\u2019t need some perverted guy ogling her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious this wasn\u2019t the first time the woman had heard that about her husband.  The young girl beside her was staring silently at Emma; the look on her face telling Emma that she may have experienced this as well.  In the meantime, the woman gestured at Emma and said, \u201cMaybe it has something to do with how she\u2019s dressed; that shirt clearly wasn\u2019t made for a young lady like her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was mortified at this point, on the verge of relinquishing control back to Dominic.  \u201cHow dare you!\u201d getting angrier than she\u2019d ever been, Marci said, \u201cShe just went through a growth spurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman clearly wasn\u2019t buying that explanation; her eyes focused on Marci\u2019s baby bump.  \u201cSeems fairly obvious where she gets her sense of \u2018fashion\u2019 from; if I had to guess, you were wearing something similar when you slept with your baby daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarci was seeing red at that point; inching closer to the woman as Amber scrambled out from behind the counter.  Before Marci could get close enough to do anything, Amber and another coworker had gotten between her and the woman.  \u201cOkay, let\u2019s all just stay calm; last thing we want is a premature birth on our hands.\u201d Turning her attention to the woman, Amber said, \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m afraid this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard complaints about your husband.  I suggest you leave before we call security.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked as though she was about to argue but realized that wouldn\u2019t be the smartest thing to do right now.  Grabbing the other girl by the arm, she turned to her husband and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go Richard; we can finish our shopping at Sears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma watched the other girl as she stood there for a moment, a look of dread on her face.  Emma quickly realized if Richard was looking at other girls, it wasn't a stretch to think he was doing the same to this girl.  It was at that moment she saw one of the security guards from earlier step out of the back with the manager.  Before she could fully comprehend what she was doing, Emma ran up over to the guard and pointed towards Richard, \"Excuse me sir, but I think that man is hurting that girl.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emma\u2019s actions caused a chain reaction as the guards approached the group as they were leaving the store.  She couldn\u2019t hear what was being said, but Emma figured it wasn\u2019t good based on the hand gestures from Richard and his wife.  Things escalated once Richard took a swing at one of the guards, which only served to get him on the floor with a taser in his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Richard\u2019s wife was trying in vein to calm things down, Emma watched as the girl beat a hasty retreat towards a bench <br>\r\nacross the way.  Before Marci could stop her, Emma ran out of the store after her.  As she cautiously approached the bench, Emma could see that the girl was crying.  \u201cA-Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl took one look at Emma before moving to embrace her.  What followed was a few moments where the girl did nothing but sob and hold Emma tightly.  Emma was starting to feel a little uncomfortable when the girl softly, and between tears, said, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sat down on the bench as the girl went ahead and let everything out; apparently Richard was the girl\u2019s grandfather, and he\u2019d been behaving inappropriately with her for years.  She begged her parents not to make her spend the last week of summer vacation with her grandparents, but they wouldn\u2019t listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them spoke on the bench, Emma noticed three girls watching them from the second level.  Looking at them, she recognized them as the same girls who Dominic had seen last night.  One of them, a brunette, gave Emma a smile and a nod before they all walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops soon arrived to take Richard into custody; while two officers led him and his wife away, a female officer approached the bench.  \u201cHi there, I\u2019m Officer Sullivan.\u201d Looking at the girl, she said, \u201cAre you Grace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe-Yes.\u201d Wiping some tears on her shirt sleeve, Grace said, \u201cWh-What\u2019s going to happen to my grandpa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma stood up to let Officer Sullivan and Grace have some privacy.  Seeing Marci standing inside the store with Amber, she walked over to join them.  Wrapping her arms around Emma, Marci said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Marci.\u201d Looking back at Grace, Emma said, \u201cI-I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she needed my help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding two large bags to Emma, Amber said, \u201cEverything\u2019s on the house, Emma; my boss said it\u2019s the least she could do after what you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking inside one of the bags; Emma saw an assortment of bras, panties, and several swimsuits.  Looking back at Amber, <br>\r\nEmma said, \u201cThanks, Amber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber stayed around for a few more minutes until she had to return to work; leaving Marci and Emma standing just outside the store.  Emma waved at Grace as she walked past with Officer Sullivan, which prompted Grace to come over and give her a hug.  <br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to thank you for everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me; I did what needed to be done.\u201d With a pause, Emma said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer Sullivan is going to contact my parents; they\u2019re going to come by the station.\u201d Smiling, Grace said, \u201cIf you give me your number, I\u2019ll text you afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma realized she was in a bind; the only phone number she had was Dom\u2019s.  Realizing that was her only choice, she relented and gave that to Grace.  \u201cIn all the excitement, I forgot to introduce myself; I\u2019m Emma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Emma.\u201d With a chuckle, Grace said, \u201cMaybe we can hang out sometime?  My folks and I live in West Palm Beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Harold entered the mall parking lot and drove up to the main entrance; while Dominic hurried out of the car, he turned to Marci.  \u201cKeep me appraised of any changes, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d Glancing at Dominic, pacing impatiently outside the car, Marci said, \u201cI\u2019m a little concerned how much he\u2019s already acting like a teenager.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo am I, which is why I want you to keep an eye on him.\u201d turning back to the steering wheel, Harold said, \u201cUnder no circumstances is he allowed to contact Rebecca; she\u2019s got enough on her plate right now without learning her fianc\u00e9 is suddenly a teenage girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould she even believe him if he did call, sir?\u201d getting out of the car, Marci leaned in through the driver\u2019s side window.  \u201cHonestly, if I hadn\u2019t seen it with my own eyes I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d believe this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold looked over at Dominic as he grew more impatient by the minute.  As if on cue, Dominic walked to the edge of the sidewalk and said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go already!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter silently waving goodbye to Harold, Marci walked over to join Dominic.  \u201cBefore we do anything, we need to come up with a cover story.\u201d Lowering her voice as a young couple walked past, Marci said, \u201cIf we tell people you used to be a grown man, they\u2019ll probably have us both committed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019d be bad; it\u2019s not like the state mental hospital is known for its cute guys.\u201d With a wink to Marci, Dominic said, \u201cSo what\u2019s our cover story going to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be my kid sister Emma; you\u2019re moving in with me after some issues at home.\u201d As she opened the door to the mall, Marci continued, \u201cYou recently experienced a major growth spurt which is why we\u2019re here; buying you new clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow; that was...pretty specific.\u201d Walking in after Marci, Dominic said, \u201cThere\u2019s only one problem with that; we look absolutely nothing alike.  It probably would\u2019ve been more believable if you said I was Harold\u2019s niece or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I suppose that would\u2019ve been easier. But,\u201d approaching a mall directory, Marci said, \u201cIt\u2019s too late to change it now.\u201d<br>\r\nWalking up behind Marci as she looked at the directory, Dominic countered, \u201cHow is it too late?  Literally no one knows who we are; we could say I\u2019m Harold\u2019s niece and no one would bat an eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we could do that; but we\u2019re not going to.\u201d Without looking away from the directory, Marci said, \u201cSorry <i>Emma</i>, but you\u2019re stuck being my kid sister for the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around the back of the directory, Dominic leaned against it and said, \u201cYou\u2019re having way too much fun with this; especially for someone who thinks I\u2019m being too calm.\u201d Marci suddenly let out a chuckle, causing Dominic to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll seriousness aside, seeing you behaving like a teenage girl is kind of adorable.\u201d Pulling Dominic around to her side, Marci said, \u201cNow come on, I figured out our plan of attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlan of attack?\u201d chuckling to himself, Dominic said, \u201cWhat, are we in the military now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust shut up and listen, okay?\u201d pointing towards the map, Marci said, \u201cFirst we need to get you measured for a bra; believe me, with a chest that big you\u2019ll want some support.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he\u2019d only had breasts for a few hours, Dominic had to agree with Marci that having a bra would make things much easier.  The whole ride over from the mall, his chest had been bouncing uncomfortably.  \u201cOkay, that makes sense.\u201d Leaning against the directory, Dominic said, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic\u2019s attention was quickly diverted by the sight of three teenage girls walking past on their way to the escalator.  It took a moment for him to realize they were the same girls he\u2019d seen at the condo the previous night.  As he watched them walk by, he found himself focusing on their outfits \u2013 skinny jeans and low-cut tops that showed off their mid-riff.  <i>Wonder how I\u2019d look wearing something like that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I think you\u2019d look great in something like that; the boy\u2019s will be all over you.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic looked around for a moment, thinking he\u2019d accidently said that out loud only to realize there was no one nearby save for Marci.  <i>Huh, I guess I\u2019m hearing things.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Think again, Dom.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around once again, Dominic confirmed that he was still alone.  <i>What the hell?  Am I losing my mind or something?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You know for a nerd, you\u2019re not that smart.  To make things simpler, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m your conscience.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic was sure he\u2019d heard that voice before but was having a hard time placing it.  Before he could think about it any further, Marci touched his shoulder and said, \u201cHey, Earth to Emma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back to reality, Dominic shook his head and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed pretty out of it just now, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic wanted to mention that he was hearing voices in his head but figured that would only cause more problems for him.  <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Sighing, he continued, \u201cIt just never occurred to me how different shopping is for girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, honey, you\u2019re going to have quite the learning experience.\u201d Placing an arm around Dominic\u2019s shoulder, Marci said, \u201cNow come on, let\u2019s go to Victoria\u2019s Secret to get you fitted for some bras.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The last time he\u2019d entered a Victoria\u2019s Secret was to help Rebecca pick out some sexy lingerie for their 2nd anniversary; now here he was 3 years later coming in to be measured for a bra.  There weren\u2019t many other customers in the store, save for a girl around Dominic\u2019s age shopping with an older couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic felt as though all eyes were on him as he went to catch up with Marci at the counter.  He got up there as she was talking with a girl behind the counter.  Dominic wasn\u2019t paying attention to what they were saying, instead he was focusing on an alarming realization \u2013 the girl in front of him wasn\u2019t doing anything for him.  <i>That\u2019s probably got more to do with the age difference than anything else.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*It\u2019s not the age difference, Dom; face it, you\u2019re not interested in girls anymore.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning so Marci couldn\u2019t hear him, Dominic said, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know who you are; but please shut up.\u201d  Continuing to speak in a hushed tone, Dominic said, \u201cI don\u2019t like boys, I like girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Oh please; all I have to do is mention someone like David Mazouz and you\u2019ll start feeling all warm and fuzzy.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice in his head was right; the mere mention of David Mazouz got Dominic\u2019s heart racing.  He started to panic as he felt a sudden tingling sensation in his chest.  \u201cStop it, alright!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Fine, I\u2019ll stop; but only after you admit you like boys now.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing behind a nearby display, Dominic said, \u201cOkay fine; maybe I do like boys now.  What\u2019s your point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Just that I know more about this body than you; I\u2019m starting to think I should be in control.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part disturbed Dominic to no end, but Marci approached him before he could go any further.  Pointing to the girl next to her, Marci said, \u201cEmma, this is Amber; she\u2019s going to measure you for some bras.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Shrugging, Dominic said, \u201cWhatever.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As she closed the door behind them, Amber said, \u201cSo Emma, is this your first time getting measured for a bra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t have much use for one until recently.\u201d With a chuckle, Dominic cupped his chest and said, \u201cThese things kind of appeared out of nowhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber chuckled at what she thought was Dominic\u2019s attempt at a joke, which caused Marci and him to smile.  If Amber knew the truth, Dominic figured she\u2019d probably start freaking out.  \u201cWell, let\u2019s see if I can\u2019t help you find what you need.\u201d Grabbing a measuring tape, Amber said, \u201cI have a little experience in the big boob department, so I can sympathize with how uncomfortable they can be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic was a little apprehensive as he took off his shirt; he\u2019d only been a girl for a couple hours and he was suddenly topless in front of a woman he barely knew.  Knowing what team Marci played for, he was also a little concerned about doing this in front of her.  He knew she\u2019d never do anything because of their sudden difference in age, but the idea was still on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile moving to place the shirt on a nearby chair, Dominic said, \u201cIt\u2019s not weird that I\u2019m wearing clothes that belong to an older guy, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you can wear whatever you want.\u201d With a smile, as she maneuvered closer to Dominic, Amber said, \u201cThere\u2019s no law that says a girl has to always dress sexy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d raising his arms, Dominic said, \u201cBesides, I\u2019m sure there are guys who like a girl with a masculine side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bra fitting only took about 15 minutes; Amber was very methodical as she took her measures.  Once she was finished, she jotted down some notes and said, \u201cWell Emma, I don\u2019t know what you were before; but your little growth spurt brought you up to a 36D.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Dominic and Marci were astonished by that; Marci because Dominic was bigger than her, and Dominic because he was bigger than Rebecca.  While he was trying to process that fact, the voice in his head was saying - *Having a fianc\u00e9 with bigger boobs than her is going to just kill Rebecca.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore the voice, Dominic stepped down from the stool he\u2019d been standing on.  \u201cSo what happens now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wait here with your sister; I\u2019ll go grab an assortment of bras for you to choose from.\u201d Heading towards the door, Amber said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Amber was gone, Marci turned her attention towards Dominic, \u201cYou seemed to handle that pretty well; honestly, a lot better than I thought you would after that pelvic exam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well my girls need support more than I need a woman\u2019s fingers in my privates.\u201d Shuddering, Dominic said, \u201cHonestly; I think the only reason that doctor gave me a pelvic exam was because I used to be a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing people outside the door, Marci put a finger to her lips, \u201cWould you keep it down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing his mistake, Dominic said, \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber walked in a few minutes later carrying about half a dozen styles to choose from.  As she lay them out on the counter, Amber said, \u201cHave a look, Emma; I got you everything from sports bras, to strapless bras and even a padded bra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic noticed an annoyed look on Marci\u2019s face at the mention of the padded bra.  As he looked over the choices, the voice in his head said *You should go with the padded bra; that\u2019ll definitely make the guys interested in you.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both Marci and Amber otherwise occupied, under his breath, Dominic said, \u201cShut up already; just because I <i>may</i> like boys now doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ready to attract them yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Oh please, I\u2019m inside your head; I can see you thinking about that cute boy you saw walking out of the bathroom.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic\u2019s thoughts suddenly turned to a boy he\u2019d seen a few minutes earlier; he was rugged and athletic, everything he hadn\u2019t been at that age.  \u201cI guess you\u2019re right, he was kind of...no! I\u2019m not doing this right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly appearing next to him, Amber said, \u201cEverything alright, Emma?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to decide.\u201d Glancing at Amber, Dominic said, \u201cI never really had to wear a bra before today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI totally understand, I was a late bloomer myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over for a moment, Dominic sighed and gave into the voice in his head.  Reaching for the padded bra, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll take this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent choice; it\u2019s quite popular with girls your age, especially for instances where you want to enhance your figure.\u201d Pointing towards another curtain, Amber said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, why don\u2019t you go try that on while I put the rest in a bag for you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Feeling stressed, Dominic ran both hands through his hair.  \u201cThis is a freaking nightmare; I have absolutely no idea how to be a teenage girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You\u2019re telling me; why do you think I\u2019ve been subconsciously taking control every now and then?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Dominic was concerned about there being cameras around, but quickly remembered he was in a changing area.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Didn\u2019t you think it was a little odd; all that uncharacteristic behavior in the car, or when you were first walking in?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Dominic had time to think about it, he realized the voice in his head was right.  \u201cSo wait, you\u2019re telling me that was you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yup, and it\u2019s left me with one inescapable conclusion; I need to take control before you ruin everything.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to freak out, Dominic tried to reach for the door handle but quickly discovered that he couldn\u2019t move.  Instead he was powerless as his body, no longer under his control, turned and walked towards the bra resting on the chair.  As his hands picked up the bra and started putting it on, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his hands effortlessly put the bra on, the voice in his head said *Like I just said, I\u2019m taking control; we can\u2019t exactly have a grown man in control of a teenage girl\u2019s body.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic tried to yell for help when the room suddenly started to spin; before he knew it, he was falling to the floor \u2013 missing the chair by barely an inch.  Once he regained consciousness he found himself lying on the floor of the changing room.  Getting to his feet, he was relieved to see a reflection of his old male self in the mirror.  \u201cOh, thank god that nightmare\u2019s over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d suddenly a voice behind him said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t celebrate just yet, Dom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around, Dominic found himself face to face with a very familiar girl \u2013 the same girl he\u2019d been seeing in the mirror for the last couple hours.  Only this time she was dressed in an outfit similar to what the girl\u2019s earlier had been wearing.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d looking the girl over, Dominic said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep things simple; you can call me Emma.\u201d With a derisive look on her face, Emma said, \u201cAs for what\u2019s going on; well, I\u2019m taking control of <i>my</i> body and there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Our situation is similar; we\u2019ll both end up dead if we try and share this body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic was becoming overwhelmed by everything he was hearing; and it didn\u2019t help matters much that he was starting to feel weak.

With everything that\u2019d happened today, Marci was in panic mode seeing her best friend on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting down to her knees, Marci started shaking him, \u201cEmma, honey, wake up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few moments where nothing happened, Marci was on the verge of tears when Dominic finally started to stir.

There was barely anytime for Emma to get dressed before she was approached by several security guards and an EMT.  After getting check over by the EMT, and giving a statement to the guards, Emma was left alone with Marci and Amber.  Looking at Emma, Marci said, \u201cIn all that excitement, I bet you never got a chance to try on that bra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not even close.\u201d Grabbing it from the chair, Emma said, \u201cCan you guys give me a few minutes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma had trouble focusing as she tried on the bra; now that she was no longer confined to Dominic\u2019s mind, she was experiencing the world around her for herself.  Every sight, smell, sound, touch was something she\u2019d never experienced before.  She finally managed to get the bra on and quickly realized that Amber had been correct \u2013 it supported her generous chest while accentuating her figure. <i>When the boys see me in this</i>, she thought, <i>I'm going to have to beat them off with a stick.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to keep the bra on, Emma carefully tore off the tag with the bar-code before putting her shirt back on.  Looking at herself in the mirror, she groaned and said, \u201cGod, I\u2019m defiantly going to need a new wardrobe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping outside, Emma went to join Marci up front as the latter paid for the purchases.  Everything was going fine until Emma felt the hair on the back of her neck raise \u2013 as she became overwhelmed by an uncomfortable feeling.  Looking after her shoulder, she noticed the older man from earlier standing right behind her; and his gaze was looking directly down her shirt at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma reached out to get Marci\u2019s attention, saying, \u201cSis, this creep\u2019s looking down my top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was surprised how quickly Marci spun around; facing the man with a look in her eyes that caught Emma off-guard.

Emma\u2019s mind was going a mile a minute; barely 15 minutes had gone by since she\u2019d taken control and she already found herself the target of a perverted old man.  On the plus side, she was grateful to have Marci defending her.  <i>Wow, to think I always thought she stayed away from conflict.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarci was still going off on the old man, jabbing her finger into his chest, when his wife came running over from a nearby section.  Emma could see the girl wasn\u2019t far behind; the look on her face suggesting that she wasn\u2019t surprised by this.  \u201cExcuse me.\u201d Looking Marci over, the woman said, \u201cWhy are you yelling at my husband?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI caught your husband looking down my sister\u2019s shirt.\u201d Seeing red, Marci said, \u201cShe\u2019s only 15 years old; the last thing she needs right now is some pervert ogling her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of surprise on the woman\u2019s face told Emma all she needed to know; this wasn\u2019t the first time her husband had been accused of this.  Looking once more at the young girl, Emma realized that she to must\u2019ve been a victim.  Meanwhile, the woman gestured towards Emma and said, \u201cPerhaps it has something to do with her outfit; that shirt is clearly too small for a girl like her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was on the verge of relinquishing control back to Dominic; while Marci got angrier than she\u2019d ever been before.  \u201cI\u2019ll have you know she just went through a growth spurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explanation didn\u2019t fly for the woman, as she focused on Marci\u2019s baby bump.  \u201cYou two must have awful parents; letting your sister dress like that while their other teenage daughter gets herself pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarci looked much younger than she really was; probably passing for 18 when she was really 25.  The woman\u2019s remarks did nothing to calm her down, if anything it made Marci even angrier.  \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business; but I\u2019m 25 years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and Emma could see where things were heading; it wasn\u2019t going to be long before Marci and the woman were at each other\u2019s throats.  With the help of another co-worker, Amber got herself between Marci and the other woman.  \u201cOkay, let\u2019s all just stay calm; last thing we want is a premature birth on our hands.\u201d Turning her attention to the woman, Amber said, \"Ma\u2019am, I\u2019m afraid this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard complaints about your husband.  I suggest you leave before we call security.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked as though she was about to argue; until the security guards stepped out of the back with the store manager.  Grabbing the other girl by the arm, she turned to her husband and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go Richard; we\u2019ll buy Grace some bras at Sears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl, Grace stood motionless for a moment as she gave Emma a look of pure dread.  After hearing Amber mention this wasn\u2019t the store\u2019s first problem with Richard, Emma quickly realized he was probably doing the same to Grace as well.  Before she could fully grasp what it was she was doing, Emma ran up to one of the guards.

Emma watched as she walked over and sat at a nearby bench.  Getting it in her head that she should check on the girl, Emma got up and quietly walked over to her.  As she got closer, Emma could tell that the girl was shaking and crying.  \u201cA-Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl took one look at Emma before getting to her feet and embracing her.  The girl did nothing but cry into Emma\u2019s shoulder for a solid five minutes.  Emma was starting to feel a little uncomfortable when the girl softly, and between tears, said, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently breaking the hug, Emma helped the girl sit down on the bench.  Finding a discarded tissue in Dominic\u2019s pants pocket, Emma handed it to the girl and said, \u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl introduced herself as Grace and said that Richard was her grandfather.  Apparently he\u2019d been behaving inappropriately towards her for years.  She\u2019d begged her parents not to make her spend the last week of summer vacation with her grandparents, but they wouldn\u2019t listen.  \u201cThis is probably going to sound awful.  But,\u201d looking at Emma, Grace said, \u201cI\u2019m glad my grandpa looked down your shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was about to disagree with that, until she watched as Richard was led past them in handcuffs.  If he hadn\u2019t looked down her shirt then none of this would be happening.  \u201cI could\u2019ve down without the creepy old guy look at my chest; but I\u2019m glad your nightmare is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace went back to crying for a few minutes as Emma realized that someone watching them from the second level of the mall.  Looking up, she realized it was the girls from earlier watching the drama unfold.  One of them, a brunette, gave Emma a smile and a nod before walking away with the others.  A few more minutes went by before a young female officer approached them.  \u201cI\u2019m Officer Sullivan; which one of you is Grace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all Emma's strength not to blurt out some witty response; instead she kept it in her head - <i>Uh, I don\u2019t know; maybe the one whose crying?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d Wiping tears from her eyes, Grace said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma decided to give them some privacy; walking away as Officer Sullivan sat down.  The last thing she heard was her telling Grace they were going to the station for her statement.  Looking around for a moment, Emma spotted Marci standing nearby with Amber.  As she walked over to join them, Marci hugged Emma and said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Marci.\u201d Glancing back at Grace, Emma said, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she needed my help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber stepped away briefly and returned with two large bags.  Handing them to Emma, she said, \u201c \u201cEverything\u2019s on the house, Emma; my boss said it\u2019s the least she could do after what you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking inside one of the bags; Emma saw an assortment of bras, panties, and several swimsuits.  Looking back at Amber, Emma said, \u201cThanks, Amber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber stayed around for a few more minutes until she had to return to work; leaving Marci and Emma standing just outside the store.  Emma waved at Grace as she walked past with Officer Sullivan, which prompted Grace to come over and give her a hug.  \u201cThanks again for everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me; I did what needed to be done.\u201d With a pause, Emma said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer Sullivan said they\u2019ll contact my parents once we get to the station.\u201d With a weak smile, Grace said, \u201cIf you give me your number, I\u2019ll text you afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma realized that she was in a bind; the only phone number she had was Dom\u2019s.  Realizing that was her only choice, she relented and gave that to Grace.  \u201cWith everything going on, I forgot to introduce myself.\u201d Extending her hand, Emma said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Emma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Emma.\u201d With a chuckle, Grace said, \u201cMaybe we can hang out sometime?  My folks and I live in West Palm Beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma didn\u2019t see a problem with that; Grace seemed like a nice girl and it certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt to have some friends. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</span></div></div>",

While she struggled to hold up a pair of boxers with one hand, and cover her ample chest with the other, the woman looked at Marci and said, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can tell me what\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just about to ask you the same thing.\u201d  Entering the shower, stepping over a puddle, Marci said, \u201cLet\u2019s with the basics; like who are you, and what have you done with Dominic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this is going to sound crazy; but I <i>am</i> Dominic, somehow I\u2019ve been turned into a woman.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Taking the elevator down to the IT Department, he found the door locked and the lights off.  A quick peak through the window showed there was no one inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that was a little strange, Harold crossed the hall to another office and spotted a middle-aged woman sitting behind a desk.  \u201cExcuse me,\u201d knocking on the door, he said, \u201cDo you know why there\u2019s no one in the IT office?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked up from her computer and, upon seeing the head of the company standing in front of her, she said, \u201cNo sir, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying another word, Harold returned to the elevator.  Suddenly concerned, he took the elevator down to the basement to the Security Department.
