You have known her since childhood and she is almost like a sister to you, sibling rivalry included. While the two of you often annoy each other to no end, you friendship has lasted into adulthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Kate</b> - The Motherly Waitress</u><br>\r\nMother of a pair of twins, Kate is the black haired waitress of Big Bites Diner. A familiar face to both you and Sarah. You\u2019ve know her since you were kids, and she is like a second mother to the two of you. Your parents knew they could always leave you at her house if they needed a babysitter, and you often found yourself talking to her about things you couldn\u2019t talk to anyone else about. She just had that gentle listening aura. By now she has to be in her mid-forties, though she still looks amazing, sometimes drawing eyes of younger men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I'll add more characters over time.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah is a childhood friend of yours. Your mother was best friends with her mother, which lead to you visiting each other regularly and being forced to spend a lot of time together. This somehow blossomed into a strong friendship that still stands today. By now you have grown into very different people. If you didn\u2019t have this history together, you probably wouldn\u2019t even consider talking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twenty year old dark brunette looks behind her, her blue eyes staring into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you coming?\u201d Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Sure...\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head out of memory lane, and catch up with Sarah, who is waiting at the park entrance. She had called you, asking to meet up. Seeing as the weather was good, you agreed to go for a walk. There is no doubt in your mind, as to why she wanted to see you. Sarah studies law at Hycenster University. Her final exam week has just ended, and you are sure that little bookworm is here to gloat about her success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both enter the park, walking on a sandy colored gravel road, which leads through the wide open grass with solitary trees spread about, a favorite spot for picnickers. Part of you regrets not bringing a basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed a bit lost in your head there.\u201d Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah sorry about that.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m just\u2026 wondering what you\u2019re thinking about, you know. Give me a little peek into that busy head of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing, was just thinking about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s pretty blue eyes widen and her face turns red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen.\u201d She says. \u201cI really like you as a friend, you\u2019re like a brother to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, your eyes widen and you can feel your face go red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, no, no, no! That\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d You stutter. \u201cI was thinking back on how we became friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s face cools off and she smiles. \u201cHow can I forget, you breaking all my dolls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back awkwardly. \u201cWell, we were playing Godzilla.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we\u2019d become friends if we met now?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, we\u2019re\u2026 two very different people. You\u2019re like a very regular girl, going to parties and dressing pretty basic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe interrupts. \u201cSorry, basic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re wearing blue jeans, a white shirt and a brown jacket and boots. That\u2019s a copy paste wardrobe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not gonna take style advice from someone like you.\u201d She says with a raised eyebrow and sarcastic voice. \u201cI agree we\u2019re very different. I grew up, and you\u2019re still that immature little kid. I\u2019m sure we wouldn\u2019t get along if we met now, \u2018cause you\u2019re a loser with shit social skills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the sarcastic tone you felt there was some honesty. Afraid you\u2019ve actually pissed her off you try and change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, well, let\u2019s stop talking about who\u2019s the loser, and start talking about who\u2019s the winner. How did your exam go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah knows exactly what you\u2019re trying to do, but fails to keep up the judgmental look. She smiles at your charmingly blunt switch from insulting her, to brownnosing. The girl folds her fingers into each other and stretches her arms over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of my class on every single test.\u201d She says, with a smug grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiar, there has someone who beat you in at least one test.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s face contorts in to what is pretty much a pout. \u201cWell there was one guy, who also got all answers correct on a test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk. \u201cMeaning at least one person is tied with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah groans. \u201cOn one test...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her, realizing this was pretty much how every conversation went between the two of you. Bickering like brother and sister. Sarah smiles back, before hearing a text notification. She reaches in to her purse (which is the same \u2018basic\u2019 brown as her jacket and boots) and pulls out her phone. While she checks her messages, you wait with her. Both of you standing still in the middle of the path. As you look around, you notice there really aren\u2019t many people out in the park today. A sudden chill runs down your spine and you turn to look at Sarah, whose eyes are still locked to her screen. You feel like something bad is about to happen, but you don\u2019t know what, until\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>...your vision turns black.</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, only a second later, lying on the uncomfortable ground. You look up at Sarah, who\u2019s standing over you, still looking at her phone. How did she not notice you fall down in front of her? Is she texting for an ambulance? Looking up at her, you feel weird, as if there is a lot of distance to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah?\u201d You mumble, but she doesn\u2019t respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and push yourself up off the rocks, which have the same sandy color as the gravel path. Getting up, you take a quick look to your left and right, seeing how far the path stretches. Your heart sinks and you look behind you. You can hardly believe it. Your childhood friend towers over you like a colossus, even the tip of her boot dwarfs you. You scream in terror at the sight of what is pretty much a normal young woman, falling onto your back in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mutter to yourself as the realization sets in. \u201cN-No way. I\u2026 I shrunk\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah doesn\u2019t seem to have noticed you\u2019re gone yet, still scrolling her thumb across her screen. She shifts one of her boots back, making terrifying crunching sounds against the gravel. You realize how dangerous your size is, and know you\u2019re going to need her help if you want to survive this. On the other hand, Sarah is also the biggest threat to your life.</span></div></div>",

She has always been, hotter, more successful and better than you in every other way, but this takes things to a whole other level. Your friend is a literal giant to you now. You can hardly fumble out a word to get her attention. Sarah sighs and lowers her eyes, while reaching into her purse to take out her phone again. You see the pair of big blue eyes align in your direction, and are filled with hope. While you are expecting immediate care and help, nothing happens. Your friend just stands there, frozen. Her lips slowly parting as her chin shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Are you...\u201d Sarah mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s me! Sarah, it\u2019s me!\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giant friend takes her hand out of her purse. She crouches in front of you, leaning forward to get a better look. Her big blue eyes observing you like the impossibility you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know, everything went black, and now this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mouth wide open, Sarah slowly reaches her hand down, her fingers stretching out towards you. Their enormous size makes you both fear them, and admire the detail you can see on both her soft skin and smooth fingernails. You take a few steps back, but it takes only a small movement for her to brush the tip of her middle finger against your body, almost knocking you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, he\u2019s real.\u201d Sarah mumbles under her breath. \u201cThis is insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know\u2026\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta admit though, this is kinda cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou being all little, it should be impossible. But isn\u2019t it awesome? There are so many things I could do with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to worry. \u201cSarah be serious about this, I\u2019m scared out of my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of the blue eyed brunette forms a familiar smile.</span></div></div>",

She brings her hand to her purse and drops you into it. You grunt, as you painfully crash onto her phone cover, before sliding down the back of it and getting your leg stuck between a make-up box and the edge of her wallet. Above, you can only see glimpses of your friend\u2019s shoulder and the side of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turns back to where she came from and walks home. Even though she has a hard time grasping what just happened, the young woman is sure this will be the most fun night she\u2019ll ever have with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she walks home, you are fending off all the stuff she keeps with her, finally getting your leg unstuck, when a giant package of ten paper tissues slides over you and buries you. Your face gets pinned against a cold bottle of women\u2019s deodorant, which makes it so you can only look in one direction, right at the packaging of what seems to be a female condom, your face quickly warms up after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Sarah opening the door to her house, slipping off her boots, and stomping up the stairs to her room. She sets her purse on the bed and opens it wide. Without much care she pulls you out by your leg and drops you down on the bedsheet. You are a bit bruised up, but alive. You look around, her room hadn\u2019t changed much since the last time you visited, except of course, bigger. It is a proper adult room with some signs of how it looked during her childhood. You snap out of your train of thought, when Sarah plops her gigantic butt down onto the bed, sending you up few inches, before you smack face first onto the bedsheet again. You accidentally smell how much of her scent she had sweat into the sheets. Pushing yourself up, you look over at your friend, seeing her slip off her socks and throw them next to the bed. He brings her feet up and places one of them on either side of you. The smell is awful, but you stay quiet. You don\u2019t want to hint at another thing she can tease you with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, now that we\u2019re home, it\u2019s time to have some fun.\u201d Sarah says, biting her lip.</span></div></div>",

There is no way you\u2019d ever want to cross that threshold at your size. You tell her to stop teasing you, but that just causes her mouth to open in an even wider smile. She moves her hand towards you, and before you can even react, she pins you between her fingers and stands up. The giantess brings you up to her face and holds you in front of the massive blue eyes. All you can do is panic and hold on to the thick layer of skin squeezing you. With an adorable smile, your friend continues to tease you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll make for a nice piece of candy to play with.\u201d She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to fight back, kicking and screaming as Sarah tilts her head back and opens her mouth. There is a sudden rush of shock, as you feel yourself falling, looking up at the fingers that let you go. Your wide view of the sky gets smaller, as the edges get blocked out by Sarah\u2019s lips and you see the back of her teeth. You realize you\u2019ve just passed into the mouth of a lifelong friend. Her lips are closing on the outside world, sealing you into a wet prison, which stinks of morning breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, this isn\u2019t funny let me out!\u201d You scream, your voice echoing slightly because of her mouth\u2019s acoustics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette starts to walk home, with a satisfied smile on her face. She can\u2019t believe she is really doing this to a close friend like you. But getting her hands on something as impossible as a tiny person, makes it far too exciting to not to try some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she is halfway home, your friend has already softly chewed you, and nearly drowned you in her saliva. Her favorite thing to do, is to use her tongue to pin you to the roof of her mouth, and gently suck on you like candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t know how much more of this you can take, being played around with so carelessly and in such a personal and bodily manner.

You knew that they were less then an inch tall in reality, but from your new point of view they had to be well over 100 feet tall. The rest of Sarah was so massive that to her you must be little more then a speck by her feet one she'd soon be leaving behind once she noticed that you seemly ditched her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to start moving, you didn't have time to think of the hows and whys of your situation.

Whatever she was looking at, you just hoped she kept looking at it, it was keeping her mostly still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed the gap soon standing at the base of the Ugg. You'd mostly lost sight of Sarah at this point, when looking up all you could really see was different shades of brown material making up the skyscraper sized boot you'd soon have to start climbing. You sighed, thinking about the color, she just had to pick brown, a color she'd have basically no change of seeing you on.

You glanced above it to the mile or so of blue denim making up just one of Sarah's jean covered legs. You swallow dryly looking back down to the top of her boot. \"One thing at a time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you wrapped your mind around the task in front of you Sarah had finally finished up with her phone dropping it back into her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"Sorry about that, just a few friends wanting to throw an end of the semester party...

However, as you look up you aren't able to see her, well at least not her face. Her chest utterly dominates your view above jutting out like a great mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly have to think about it as you cling to Sarah's clothing in the shadow of her tits, you weren't going to be able to climb up and over them. Your arms were just about shot and even if they weren't you'd have to free hang as you climb the bottoms of her boobs. You'd most likely just end up falling to your death, no you'd need to find another way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are close enough to push off from Sarah's shirt and land on the cool plastic surface of her table. The massive surface stretching  off into the distance in every direction. The only thing you could spot was a wall of white, which you knew was the skyscraper sized cup of coffee Sarah had been sipping at.

The titanic saucer filling your sky before crashing down leaving you in the shadow of the lip. She placed down some silverware to one side and a napkin on the other.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, you had a few choices though none of them were perfect. The silverware was large and would be hard to scale, but if you could she would be handling them the most. This would get you close to her, but would also mean getting close to her fingers and mouth. The napkin was far easier to climb, but she might not use it or you could end up crushed against her face as she cleans up. You could just try to run out onto the table, hope that you aren't to small to still go unnoticed, though she might think your a bug or a crumb.</span></div></div>",

You could only hear what was going on above until you finally cleared the edge of Sarah's plate. You were finally able to look up and see your god like friend lifting up a bit of egg larger then a house on the tip of her fork. The eggy mass vanishing between her lips, the small bite not even worth chewing for her as she simply swallowed. The small lump hardly visible as slip down her throat.

Just one more reminder about your state of being to add to the pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it too the top having to roll yourself over the edge and onto the surface of the napkin. \"No...more...climbing....\" Your arms were shot, you needed a break at least for a few hours before trying to climb anything at this point. If you planned work, you'd thankfully be done with climbing and finally get some help. You made your way across the white surface that spread out over a thousand feet across the massive square plateau. You were smaller then a fleck of pepper and could possibly end up crushed under a single grain of salt, but you hoped you stood out enough against the white world landscape for her to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of walking you figured you were close to the middle of Sarah's napkin and it was time to face her.

A finger swung around and came down making land fall close by, the towering digit seemly waiting for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Come on, climb on.\"</b></font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't question it, making your way over to her finger and climbing up the thick ridges of her finger print. You'd hardly made it off the ground before the finger was airborne. High winds wiped by you as Sarah picked you up, where she was taking you, you had no idea. Her massive body was moving around and being so close it was impossible to really tell what the heck was going on. When it finally settled down her finger lowered back down, this time on a strange white surface. It didn't take a genius to understand she wanted you to get off here and after climbing down you jumped off her finger. The digit rushing back off a moment after you'd made land fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out into the distant seeing the rest of the living room and Sarah's... legs? \"What, where am I?\" The ground under your feet started to quake softly as you heard Sarah start to giggle a bit. You stumbled falling onto your ass as the ground wobbled and shook slowly it returned to normal. That's when it hit you as you started to turn around to see Sarah face rising over you a bit as she looked down at the tiny speck she'd placed on her tit, the tiny thing just big enough to stand out against the white fabric of her tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Well, what do you think? No one else around, but you, no one looking at me, but you, no one I'd rather be with, but you.\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed, the sound of her heart starting to race started to reach your ears. Your own face had turned red as well as Sarah continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"I had kind of planned on bringing you back to my place from the start. Though you were suppose to be a little bit taller. We were suppose to walk through the park, get some lunch at Big Bites, go hang out by the lake when we were kids. Then I thought, I thought I'd invite you back here, for a little Netflix and chill.\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were caught off guard to say the least, you'd always assumed that Sarah saw you as a brother or at best just a friend. Here she was all the same confessing having feelings. \"But, what about all those times you said I was like a brother to you? What about all those times you joked about how strange it would be to date since we were so close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"I.. I didn't want to make things weird. I'd seen friends break up with boys some saying they were just going to stay friend after. I never saw it work out, not once. So when I started.. well seeing you as more then a best friend I thought I needed to squish it. I thought I was saving our friendship and well you never made a move other then when we joked about it. So I thought well I thought you probably weren't interested anyway. I was only going to bring it up now, to give it a shot because, I wasn't sure if we would see each other again. I mean with college over who knows what jobs we might get or where we might live. I thought what was the harm if it doesn't work? We were most likely going to end up moving to different states or something anyway.\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized in that moment, the problem, the two of you were the same. You both had been so worried about hurting the other and ruining your friendship that you didn't want to risk making it something more. You can't help, but laugh a bit, \"I'm such an idiot, I mean really we both are. I feel exactly the same way Sarah. I just thought, well, I just thought you weren't interested in me and I didn't want to try to make things weird by coming on to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Sarah tearing up a bit, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>You fucking jerk, I should just smush you for being so stupid. What guy can't figure out a girl likes him when she wants to hang out with him all the time, hangs on him at bars, and teases him all the time. And why am I so dumb not to see that how sweet you've been to me, how you always check on me and know how to cheer me up, how you are always the first person to know I'm having a bad day and bring me my favorite brooding ice cream. We are so dumb and now, when we finally just say something, you are so small I could lose you in the pocket of my shorts. I mean christ I have belly button lint that would be big as a house compared to you.</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up walking closer to Sarah moving up along the curve of her breast. \"Hey, we might be idiots, but at least we are together right? Our kind of dumb seems to work together rather well, so as long as we stick together I think we can work things out. It might not be ideal, but there is no other place I'd rather be right now... well I mean with you, being on your mini-mountain of a boob is just a bonus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see Sarah's eyes start to dry and a small smile cross her lips as she rolls her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"God, your such an idiot, but at your my idiot. I just wish I could hit you for that last little remark mister, though I think you'd just end up a mess across said boob if I did. So I'll just have to save that for when we get you back to full size.\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a deal, just try not to hit to hard when I do. I swear you can be crazy strong when you get angry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiles laughing lightly the two of you now closer then ever. It would seem you found yourself now the boyfriend? of your miles tall best friend? It certainly wouldn't of been what you expected out of your day when you got up this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Hey, you know, since we are taking things to the next level how about we turn tonight into our first little date?

You honestly liked the idea, it wasn't as if you guys were strangers after all and the idea of getting close to Sarah was more then a little appealing for you. You'd probably be coming down for it, if you weren't small enough to get stuck in her lip gloss. The two of you trying to have some kind of sex, what would that even look like? You trusted Sarah, but she wouldn't even feel you if you fell inside of her pussy, you'd probably end up drowning in waves of juices. You were standing some place on one of her massive tits now, each one weighing millions of tons. A bit of boob play would be like watching two fleshy mountains collapsing on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I think we should take it slow, it is our first real date after all.\" You say your voice a bit uneasy thinking about how even a bit of foreplay could be rather deadly.

You glance back to see her thighs softly rubbing together. You couldn't believe it, were, were you making her horny? You were given an answer as the ground under you started to move soon rising up knocking you off your feet. A large building sized tent of fabric shooting up in front of you several hundred feet tall. It didn't take you long to realize that the large tower that had just pushed up from the ground. Sarah's nipple towered over you pushing up through the thin fabric of her tank top with little effort. The massive tent pitched by her nipple over shadowed you as Sarah blushed, seemly rather embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Oopps! Sorry, are you ok? My nipple didn't hurt you did it?\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a very interesting situation when a girl was worried if her nipple had hurt you, but seeing how large it was, it easily could of, but you were fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, she just... surprised me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"I guess I got myself a bit excited thinking about you.

It was Sarah after all even being miles tall it was the same girl as always and while she could be a pain sometimes, she wouldn't purposely hurt you.

Now you just wanted to take a load off and let your brain turn into a nice soft pile of mush, at least for the next couple of months before you started really applying for jobs using your shiny new degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first stop was of course Big Bites Diner. You knew Kate would be waiting to see you and offer up some hot food and maybe a fresh bit of cake or pie she'd wiped up in the back herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate had worked at the Big Bites Diner since you and you childhood friend Sarah were kids and she'd always acted like a second mother too you and Sarah. Kate was in her mid forties now and looked great for her age having always kept on her feet as a single mother of twins. She always had a smile on her face which only grew wider when Sarah and yourself stopped by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be nice to see her since Sarah was still busy with her own exams, ever the overachiever she still had far more classes to finish up then you did.

At least until you heard Kate spot you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart!\" You looked over to see Kate making her way over to you. Kate was dressed in a simple black dress with slight low cut, the Diner's name printed on the right breast with her name right under it. Her long black hair pulled back into a pony tail. A large smile on her face as she grabbed you and hugged you tight. \"I guess you my big college grad now huh? I swear you and Sarah are finishing up school getting ready to move away and my own girls are just starting college next semester. I remember when all of you were so little, time just moves to fast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin, \"Yeah, time files by, just seems like yesterday you were sneaking me and Sarah an extra scoop of ice cream even though our parents said we had enough.\" The old memory was a happy one for yourself and Kate who couldn't help, but sigh, you could see her eyes a bit red as if ready to cry. \"But, enough about the past, I spent all morning on exams and I'm feeling a bit burnt out.\" You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate nodded, \"So your school day special then, no problem sweetie, you just go grab yourself a booth. I'll probably join you, I'd love to talk to you a bit before you head out. I mean it might be the last time I see you after all.\" You nod, you did feel a bit bad, Kate looked like she was losing a son and in a way she kinda was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat at an empty booth waving over to Kate to show her where you were. Then you felt a bit strange, maybe you'd sat down a bit to fast? You couldn't be sure, but the lights seemed to be getting dim....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolted up, had you passed out?
